In this article, we draw on experiences from local climate policy planning in Norway in order to discuss the ways in which climate change enters into a municipal policy setting. Based on the Norwegian case, supplemented with knowledge gained from an international literature review, we present a typology of six different categories of local climate policy. We highlight that local actors can both play the role as a structure for the implementation of national or international climate objectives, as well as that of being policy actors taking independent policy initiatives. We emphasize how the relationship between national and local authorities is a crucial factor if climate policy as a specific local responsibility should be further strengthened. © 2007 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"climate; environmental management; environmental policy; governance approach; local planning; policy implementation; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247530431

The lean premixed flames have lower temperature distributions and homogeneous fuel-air mixture which benefit of reducing thermal as well as prompt NO, and particulates formation. Unfortunately, lean flames suffer instability, high CO and CO2 emissions. The most stable premixed flames which have slightly rich equivalence ratio, leads to increase the tendency of flashback occurrence. The recirculation zone is responsible to a great extent of flame stability, therefore enhancing this zone will much affect flame behavior. The wake region in the recirculation zone contains a great percentage of oxygen, therefore applying a small portion of fuel inside this zone without disturbing its geometry will increase its heat release rate and temperature through the acceleration of the reaction rates. A circular cross section test burner was modified by the way to inject LPG through the conical flame stabilizer. The lower extinction limits were examined; while local temperature distribution, local emissions measurement, and stack emissions were measured. AU the measurements were carried out for both normal premixed flame and flame with auxiliary LPG injection. The flame stability was found to be increased and NO emissions were reduced by applying the auxiliary injected fuel.","Emissions; Flame stabilizers; Lean premixed flames; Temperature distribution; Wake region constituents","Heat radiation; Particulate emissions; Temperature distribution; Wakes; Flame stabilizers; Flashbacks; Lean premixed flames; Wake region constituents; Flame research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38549177592

The Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) v. 3060 model is a process-based model requiring detailed inputs. The soil conditioning index (SCI) is a simpler tool to predict relative change in soil organic carbon (SOC) using table values for three management components (i.e., organic matter, field operations, and erosion) within the framework of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation 2 model. Our objective was to determine whether SOC sequestration from no-tillage cropping systems in the southeastern USA could be simply predicted with SCI compared with detailed simulations using EPIC. Four management systems were evaluated: (1) cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) with conventional tillage, (2) cotton with no tillage, (3) corn (Zea mays L.)-cotton rotation with no tillage, and (4) bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L.)-corn-cotton rotation with no tillage. All no-tillage systems used wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as a cover crop. Simulated SOC sequestration with EPIC was 0.46 ± 0.06 Mg ha-1 yr-1 (410 ± 51 lb ac-1 yr-1) under the three no-tillage management systems and -0.03 Mg ha-1 yr-1 (-30 lb ac-1 yr-1) under conventional tillage. The SCI also predicted a strong difference in SOC between conventional and no tillage. Differences in SOC sequestration among crop rotations were not readily apparent with EPIC but were with SCI. Predictions of SOC sequestration with SCI were comparable to those with EPIC but not necessarily in a linear manner as previously suggested. The SCI appears to be a valuable method for making reasonable, cost-effective estimates of potential changes in SOC with adoption of conservation management in the southeastern USA, although validations under actual field conditions are still needed.","Conservation tillage; Cover cropping; Crop rotation; Modeling; Water-use efficiency","carbon sequestration; comparative study; conservation management; cotton; crop rotation; environmental policy; grass; maize; soil organic matter; tillage; water use efficiency; North America; United States; Cynodon (angiosperm); Cynodon dactylon; Gossypium hirsutum; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35948981736

Lake-level lowering of ∼50 m during the past 100 yr has led to deep incision by the Walker River into the former lake bed. This incision has exposed a sedimentary record of lake-level fluctuations spanning at least the past 4000 yr. Fourteen new radiocarbon dates on plant material collected from diverse sedimentary environments, including fluvial, deltaic, beach, and offshore settings, have led to the refinement of the late Holocene lake-level curve for this basin. This new curve documents at least four highstands that have occurred since ca. 3500 cal yr B.P. between elevations of 1245 and 1255 m. The lake has also experienced several lowstands during this same period. Comparison of this outcrop-based record to existing lake-level curves and to an oxygen isotope curve for the past 1200 yr reveals many similarities between the records, but also some differences. Therefore, research should be conducted to integrate outcrop studies, where absolute water depth and lake volume can be estimated, with isotopic or other types of proxies from cored sediments that may have higher temporal resolution. The extensive and nearly continuous outcrops along the lower Walker River also provide valuable information on the relationships between various sedimentary features and their formative water depths in clastic-dominated lacustrine systems.

However, a common European approach to achieving healthy indoor environments is desirable for several reasons including providing a broader recognition of the problem of unhealthy indoor air, setting a policy example for all 27 EU member states, and achieving greater public health equity across the different European nations. In this article we address the question ""Why is it so difficult in the EU to develop a coherent approach on indoor environment?"" We identify and describe four main barriers: a) the subsidiarity principle in EU policymaking introducing decentralization of decision making to the member states; b) fragmentation of the topic of the indoor environment; c) the differences in climate and governance among different member states that make a common policy difficult; and d) economic issues.

Bioenergy crops offset carbon dioxide emissions by converting atmospheric CO2 to organic C in crop biomass and soil, but they also emit nitrous oxide and vary in their effects on soil oxidation of methane. Growing the crops requires energy (e.g., to operate farm machinery, produce inputs such as fertilizer) and so does converting the harvested product to usable fuels (feedstock conversion efficiency). The objective of this study was to quantify all these factors to determine the net effect of several bioenergy cropping systems on greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. We used the DAYCENT biogeochemistry model to assess soil GHG fluxes and biomass yields for corn, soybean, alfalfa, hybrid poplar, reed canarygrass, and switchgrass as bioenergy crops in Pennsylvania, USA. DAYCENT results were combined with estimates of fossil fuels used to provide farm inputs and operate agricultural machinery and fossil-fuel offsets from biomass yields to calculate net GHG fluxes for each cropping system considered. Displaced fossil fuel was the largest GHG sink, followed by soil carbon sequestration. N2O emissions were the largest GHG source. All cropping systems considered provided net GHG sinks, even when soil C was assumed to reach a new steady state and C sequestration in soil was not counted.

Petroleum-based fuels are obtained from limited reserves. These finite reserves are highly concentrated in certain regions of the world. Therefore, those countries not having these resources are facing energy/foreign exchange crisis, mainly due to the import of crude petroleum. Hence, it is necessary to look for alternative fuels which can be produced from resources available locally within the country such as alcohol, biodiesel, vegetable oils etc. This paper reviews the production, characterization and current statuses of vegetable oil and biodiesel as well as the experimental research work carried out in various countries. This paper touches upon well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions, well-to-wheel efficiencies, fuel versatility, infrastructure, availability, economics, engine performance and emissions, effect on wear, lubricating oil etc. Ethanol is also an attractive alternative fuel because it is a renewable bio-based resource and it is oxygenated, thereby providing the potential to reduce particulate emissions in compression-ignition engines. In this review, the properties and specifications of ethanol blended with diesel and gasoline fuel are also discussed. Special emphasis is placed on the factors critical to the potential commercial use of these blends. The effect of the fuel on engine performance and emissions (SI as well as compression ignition (CI) engines), and material compatibility is also considered. Biodiesel is methyl or ethyl ester of fatty acid made from virgin or used vegetable oils (both edible and non-edible) and animal fat. The main resources for biodiesel production can be non-edible oils obtained from plant species such as Jatropha curcas (Ratanjyot), Pongamia pinnata (Karanj), Calophyllum inophyllum (Nagchampa), Hevca brasiliensis (Rubber) etc. Biodiesel can be blended in any proportion with mineral diesel to create a biodiesel blend or can be used in its pure form. Just like petroleum diesel, biodiesel operates in compression ignition (diesel) engine, and essentially require very little or no engine modifications because biodiesel has properties similar to mineral diesel. It can be stored just like mineral diesel and hence does not require separate infrastructure. The use of biodiesel in conventional diesel engines result in substantial reduction in emission of unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulate. This review focuses on performance and emission of biodiesel in CI engines, combustion analysis, wear performance on long-term engine usage, and economic feasibility. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The challenging emission reduction commitments taken up by Italy through the Kyoto Protocol had to be pursued vis-à-vis a number of challenging issues including: rapidly rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions trend, contrasting energy policy objectives of supply diversification and smooth market liberalisation, challenging time-frames, lack of data and a climate of political uncertainty over the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol itself. Furthermore, at both the EU and national level lack of clarity existed over the role of the EU ETS as a ‘policy setting’ rather than a ‘policy compliance’ tool. All of these issues have significantly influenced the NAP development process and their understanding is critical for drawing conclusions over lessons to be learnt. Italy's reduction target and abatement potential Italy's GHG emissions reduction target under the Burden Sharing Agreement (BSA) appears relatively modest when compared in absolute terms to targets of other Member States. However, it becomes quite challenging when considering the country's rising emission levels and high abatement costs. Under the BSA Italy has committed to a 6.5% reduction of its 1990 GHG emissions. A commitment requiring in absolute terms a reduction from the 508 Mt CO2e per year emitted in 1990 to an average 476 Mt CO2e per year during the period 2008–2012. However, a number of factors make such an apparently limited reduction extremely challenging. © Cambridge University Press 2007 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911033359

Such alterations may predispose to central sleep apnea at high altitude by promoting changes in brain PCO2 and thus breathing stability. We measured middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCAv; transcranial Doppler ultrasound) and arterial blood pressure during wakefulness in conditions of eucapnia (room air), hypocapnia (voluntary hyperventilation), and hypercapnia (isooxic rebeathing), and also during nonrapid eye movement (stage 2) sleep at low altitude (1,400 m) and at high altitude (3,840 m) in five individuals. At each altitude, sleep was studied using full polysomnography, and resting arterial blood gases were obtained. During wakefulness and polysomnographic-monitored sleep, dynamic cerebral autoregulation and steady-state changes in MCAv in relation to changes in blood pressure were evaluated using transfer function analysis. High altitude was associated with an increase in central sleep apnea index (0.2 ± 0.4 to 20.7 ± 23.2 per hour) and an increase in mean blood pressure and cerebrovascular resistance during wakefulness and sleep. MCAv was unchanged during wakefulness, whereas there was a greater decrease during sleep at high altitude compared with low altitude (-9.1 ± 1.7 vs. -4.8 ± 0.7 cm/s; P &lt; 0.05). At high altitude, compared with low altitude, the cerebrovascular reactivity to CO 2 in the hypercapnic range was unchanged (5.5 ± 0.7 vs. 5.3 ± 0.7%/mmHg; P = 0.06), while it was lowered in the hypocapnic range (3.1 ± 0.7 vs. 1.9 ± 0.6%/mmHg; P &lt; 0.05). Dynamic cerebral autoregulation was further reduced during sleep (P &lt; 0.05 vs. low altitude). Lowered cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2 and reduction in both dynamic cerebral autoregulation and MCAv during sleep at high altitude may be factors in the pathogenesis of breathing instability.

An integrated conceptual design approach that takes into account both the technical and institutional design of the system has been adopted and has resulted in a feasible and robust system design. The technical part of the integrated conceptual design consisted in the estimation of the heat demands, the design of the heat upgrading system, equipment sizing, the network morphology and/or spatial connectivity and the exergy losses in the needed infrastructure as well as the economic viability of the system.

This discussion may be helpful for comparative studies, touching as it does on other ethnopharmacological issues: a) which cultural and ecological factors affect the selection of medicinal plants; b) substitutions of medicinal plants in popular medicine; c) the relation between local nomenclature and uses. To analyze these questions, this paper presents an example of a species used for digestive disorders (tea and camomile: Jasonia glutinosa, J. tuberosa, Sideritis hyssopifolia, Bidens aurea, Chamaemelum nobile, Santolina chamaecyparissus...), high blood pressure (Rhamnus alaternus, Olea europaea...) or skin diseases (Hylotelephium maximum, H. telephium, Anagallis arvensis, A. foemina). Methods: Fieldwork began on January 2004 and continued until December 2006. During that time we interviewed 505 informants in 218 locations in Navarra. Information was collected using semi-structured ethnobotanical interviews, and we subsequently made maps using Arc-View 8.0 program to determine the area of use of each taxon. Each map was then compared with the bioclimatic and linguistic map of Navarra, using the soil and ethnographic data for the region, and with other ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological studies carried out in Europe. Results: The results clearly show that ecological and cultural factors influence the selection of medicinal plants in this region. Climate and substrate are the most important ecological factors that influence the distribution and abundance of plants, which are the biological factors that affect medicinal plant selection. Conclusion: The study of edaphological and climatological factors, on the one hand, and culture, on the other, can help us to understand why a plant is replaced by another one for the same purposes, either in the same or in a different area. In many cases, the cultural factor means that the use of a species is more widespread than its ecological distribution. This may also explain the presence of synonyms and polysemies which are useful for discussing ethnopharmacological data. © 2007 Akerreta et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Anagallis; Anagallis arvensis; Bidens; Bidens aurea; Chamaemelum; Chamaemelum nobile; Hylotelephium maximum; Jasonia glutinosa; Olea europaea; Rhamnus; Rhamnus alaternus; Santolina chamaecyparissus; Sideritis; Sideritis hyssopifolia; chamomile; plant medicinal product; adult; aged; article; cardiovascular disease; climate; clinical trial; ecosystem; ethnobotany; female; gastrointestinal disease; human; male; medicinal plant; middle aged; multicenter study; phytotherapy; skin disease; Spain; Tanacetum parthenium; tea; traditional medicine; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cardiovascular Diseases; Chamomile; Climate; Ecosystem; Ethnobotany; Female; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Humans; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Middle Aged; Phytotherapy; Plant Preparations; Plants, Medicinal; Skin Diseases; Spain; Tanacetum parthenium; Tea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34347205278

A reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) of about 28% was achieved for this system compared to an equivalent conventional system.

The budgets are strongly influenced by atmospheric deposition as well as forestry. This study demonstrates how budget calculations for nitrogen (N), carbon (C) and base cations (BC) can be used as a basis for policy decisions on a regional level in Sweden. The study was based on existing nutrient and C budget calculations on a regional scale in Sweden. The nutrient budgets have been calculated for each square in a national 5 km × 5 km net by means of mass balances including deposition, harvest losses, leaching, weathering (BC) and fixation (N). Scenarios with different deposition and forestry intensity have been run and illustrated on maps. A simplified C budget has been estimated by multiplying the N accumulation with the C/N ratio in the organic layer, based on the assumption that the C/N ratio in the accumulating organic matter is equal to the ratio in the soil organic matter pool. The budget approaches differ from earlier budget studies since they involve regional high resolution data, combine deposition and forestry scenarios and integrate different environmental aspects. The results indicate that whole-tree harvesting will cause net losses of N and base cations in large parts of Sweden, which means that forestry will not be sustainable unless nutrients are added through compensatory fertilization. To prevent net losses following whole-tree harvesting, compensatory fertilization of base cations would be required in almost the whole country, whereas N fertilization would be needed mainly in the northern half of Sweden. The results further suggest that today's recommendations for N fertilization should be revised in southern Sweden by applying the southwest-northeast gradient of the N budget calculations. The C and N accumulation calculations show that C sequestration in Swedish forest soils is not an effective or sustainable way to decrease the net carbon dioxide emissions. A better way is to apply whole-tree harvesting and use the branches, tops and needles as biofuel replacing fossil fuels. This could reduce the present carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels substantially. The study shows that high resolution budget calculations that illuminate different aspects of sustainability in forest ecosystems are important tools for identifying problem areas, investigating different alternatives through scenario analyses and developing new policies. Cooperation with stakeholders increases the probability that the research will be useful. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Such emissions occur in every part of the world – a coal-fired power plant in the United States, a diesel bus in Europe, a rice paddy in Asia, and the burning of tropical forest in South America. Today's emissions will affect the global climate beyond our lifetimes – most greenhouse gases reside in the atmosphere for decades to centuries. The impacts of global climate change pose serious, long-term risks. Global climate change is the ultimate global-commons problem, with the relevant greenhouse gases mixing uniformly in the upper atmosphere, so that damages are independent of the location of emissions. Because of this, a multinational response is required. To combat the risks posed by climate change, efforts that draw in most if not all countries over the long term will need to be undertaken. The challenge lies in designing an international policy architecture that can guide such efforts.This focus on climate policy architecture reflects the need to establish a foundation of policy principles and institutional infrastructure to inform and frame multilateral and national actions. Richard Schmalensee highlighted the need for a long-term policy architecture in his 1998 review of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's assessment of policy instruments. © Cambridge University Press 2007.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924206479

The costs of abating greenhouse gas emissions occur locally and in the present, but the benefits accrue globally and over multiple generations.The most important greenhouse gas that policy can affect, carbon dioxide, is a byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuels that serve as the primary source of energy for industrialized, emerging, and developing economies around the world. Relatively wealthy, developed countries are responsible for a majority of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases that have already accumulated in the atmosphere, but poor, developing countries will emit more greenhouse gases over this century than those currently industrialized nations if no efforts are taken to change their course of development. The problem of climate change with its global, long-term environmental, economic, energy, and development consequences necessitates the design of a sound international climate change policy architecture.The Kyoto Protocol frequently has been described as a “first step” to address this awesome long-term, global problem. It is the first agreement to have imposed binding legal commitments on greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to representing the first step to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, the Protocol represents the first step in the ultimate design of an effective, long-term international climate change policy architecture. © Cambridge University Press 2007.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57749177224

Highly soluble potassium carbonate (K2 CO3, potash) is formed together with difficulty soluble calcium carbonate (CaCO3, calcite), and, as a rule, the content of the latter in the ash is higher than the content of potash. It is important that calcium carbonate can be preserved in the buried state for a long time. The pyrogenic formation of carbonates is a phenomenon that is not taken into account by researchers studying natural and anthropogenic soils. It is particularly important for buried soils and habitation deposits, as it leads to their alkalization and to the accumulation of secondary carbonates in the layers affected by pyrogenesis. The role of this process in natural systems is discussed, and the stability of pyrogenic carbonates in soils of different geographic zones is analyzed. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2007.",,"Alkalinity; Carbonates; Coal ash; Incineration; Soils; accumulation; ash; carbonate; formation mechanism; incineration; organic matter; paleosol; pedogenesis; potash",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249856928

Field and herbarium surveys were thus used to determine if two pathogens (a smut and a rust) and a pre-dispersal seed predator were less common at the western range limit of the forest sedge Carex blanda in Kansas, USA. Host plant size, reproduction and density did not decline at the western border of the range. In fact, plants at two western sites had unusually large size and seed production. Host populations at the edge of the range were more likely to be disease-free or lack the pre-dispersal seed predator. Where the smut, seed predator and rust were found, the proportion of infected or infested plants was not related to longitude, latitude or percentage forest cover. More of the peripheral populations lacked the smut than the rust, as expected given the more localized nature of smut spore dispersal and the limited period when smut infection can occur. In the adjacent, more highly forested state of Missouri, there were no geographical patterns in the incidence of the smut or seed predator in herbarium data. The smut and rust increased in frequency over the 129-year span of herbarium collections. Although field and herbarium distributional data were not identical (for example, smut infection was found much farther west in the field than in the herbarium data), the qualitative agreement between the two data sets suggests herbarium data can be used more broadly for studies of natural enemy distributions. Limited dispersal by pathogens and seed predators is probably the reason why small, isolated western populations were less likely to have natural enemies. Peripheral host populations may thus have different ecological and evolutionary trajectories compared with more central populations. This conclusion, as well as the considerable variation among peripheral populations, is relevant to geographical studies of co-evolution and to research on climatic effects on plants inhabiting ecotonal regions. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 British Ecological Society.","Anthracoidea blanda; Biogeography; Central-marginal model; Ecotone; Host-pathogen interactions; Peripheral populations; Pre-dispersal seed predator; Puccinia; Rust; Smut","biogeography; ecotone; forest cover; fungal disease; herbarium; host plant; host-pathogen interaction; natural enemy; sedge; seed dispersal; seed predation; seed production; Kansas; Missouri; North America; United States; Anthracoidea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Carex blanda; Puccinia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247211773

N2O and CH4 fluxes from sediment were measured adjacent to the river (""fringe"") and in the mangrove forest (""forest"") at 3-h intervals throughout the day during autumn, winter and summer. N2O fluxes from sediment ranged from an average of -4 μg to 65 μg N2O m-2 h-1 representing N2O sink and emission. CH4 emissions varied by several orders of magnitude from 3 μg to 17.4 mg CH4 m-2 h-1. Fluxes of N2O and CH4 differed significantly between sampling seasons, as well as between fringe and forest positions. In addition, N2O flux differed significantly between time of day of sampling. Higher bulk density and total carbon content in sediment were significant contributors towards decreasing N2O emission; rates of N2O emission increased with less negative sediment redox potential (Eh). Porewater profiles of nitrate plus nitrite (NOx-) suggest that denitrification was the major process of nitrogen transformation in the sediment and possible contributor to N2O production. A significant decrease in CH4 emission was observed with increasing Eh, but higher sediment temperature was the most significant variable contributing to CH4 emission. From April 2004 to July 2005, sediment levels of dissolved ammonium, nitrate, and total carbon content declined, most likely from decreased input of diffuse nutrient and carbon sources upstream from the study site; concomitantly average CH4 emissions decreased significantly. On the basis of their global warming potentials, N2O and CH4 fluxes, expressed as CO2-equivalent (CO2-e) emissions, showed that CH4 emissions dominated in summer and autumn seasons (82-98% CO2-e emissions), whereas N2O emissions dominated in winter (67-95% of CO2-e emissions) when overall CO2-e emissions were low. Our study highlights the importance of seasonal N2O contributions, particularly when conditions driving CH4 emissions may be less favourable. For the accurate upscaling of N2O and CH4 flux to annual rates, we need to assess relative contributions of individual trace gases to net CO2-e emissions, and the influence of elevated nutrient inputs and mitigation options across a number of mangrove sites or across regional scales. This requires a careful sampling design at site-level that captures the potentially considerable temporal and spatial variation of N2O and CH4 emissions. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Much work has been done to assess the impacts of these pollutants on trees, but little is known about how the diverse understory flora has fared. Understory vegetation has declined in diversity in response to elevated N in the eastern U.S. and Europe. Six sites along an ozone and N deposition gradient that had been part of a long-term study on response of plants to air pollution beginning in 1973 were resampled in 2003. Historic ozone data and leaf injury scores confirmed the gradient. Present-day ozone levels were almost half of these, and recent atmospheric N pollution concentrations confirmed the continued air pollution gradient. Both total and extractable soil N were higher in sites on the western end of the gradient closer to the urban source of pollution, pH was lower, and soil carbon (C) and litter were higher. The gradient also had decreasing precipitation and increasing elevation from west to east. However, the dominant tree species were the same across the gradient. Tree basal area increased during the 30-year interval in five of the sites. The two westernmost sites had 30-45% cover divided equally between native and exotic understory herbaceous species, while the other sites had only 3-13% cover dominated by native species. The high production is likely related to higher precipitation at the western sites as well as elevated N. The species richness was in the range of 24 to 30 in four of the sites, but one site of intermediate N deposition had 42 species, while the easternmost, least polluted site had 57 species. These were primarily native species, as no site had more than one to three exotic species. In three of six sites, 20-40% of species were lost between 1973 and 2003, including the two westernmost sites. Two sites with intermediate pollution had little change in total species number over 30 years, and the easternmost site had more species in 2003. The easternmost site is also the driest and has the most sunlight filtering to the forest floor, possibly accounting for the higher species richness. The confounding effects of the precipitation gradient and possibly local disturbances do not show a simple correlation of air pollution with patterns of native and invasive species cover and richness. Nevertheless, the decline of native species and dominance by exotic species in the two westernmost polluted sites is cause for concern that air pollution is affecting the understory vegetation adversely. ©2007 with author.

For sediments contaminated with light non-aqueousphase liquids, anomalous high conductivity values have been observed. Vertical changes in the geoelectrical properties of the sediments were concomitant with significant changes in the microbial community structures as determined by the construction and evaluation of 16S rRNA gene libraries. DNA sequencing of clones from four 16S rRNA gene libraries from different depths of a contaminated field site and two libraries from an uncontaminated background site revealed spatial heterogeneity in the microbial community structures. Correspondence analysis showed that the presence of distinct microbial populations, including the various hydrocarbon-degrading, syntrophic, sulfate-reducing, and dissimilatory-iron-reducing populations, was a contributing factor to the elevated geoelectrical measurements. Thus, through their growth and metabolic activities, microbial populations that have adapted to the use of petroleum as a carbon source can strongly influence their geophysical surroundings. Since changes in the geophysical properties of contaminated sediments parallel changes in the microbial community compositions, it is suggested that geoelectrical measurements can be a cost-efficient tool to guide microbiological sampling for microbial ecology studies during the monitoring of natural or engineered bioremediation processes.

Standard ""detection and attribution"" analyses, such as those cited by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), are generally sufficient to establish the strength of human influence on large-scale, long-termaverage climate, but fall short of quantifying the role of greenhouse gas emissions in almost any conceivable case of actual harm, since nobody is directly exposed to a change in global average temperature alone. The authors argue that it should be possible to agree on a relatively objective approach to quantifying the role of human influence on climate in cases of actual harm. There are, however, a number of questions to be resolved, including: can we apply the concept of Fraction Attributable Risk, developed for population studies in epidemiology, to the analysis of an unprecedented change in a single system such as the world's climate? Can we rely on computer simulation to address counter-factual questions such as ""what would the climate have been like in the absence of twentieth century greenhouse gas emissions, "" given that we are working with imperfect simulation models? Due to multiple anthropogenic and natural contributions to changing weather risks, it will always be necessary to apply some kind of principle of ceteris paribus to quantify the role of any particular causal agent, such as greenhouse gas emissions. How is this principle to be applied? These questions are not, in themselves, scientific issues, although how they are to be resolved will have a direct bearing on how and whether climate science can inform specific causal attribution claims. In summary, we need the legal community to ask the scientific community the right questions.

One is an oxidation in N 2O performed in a quartz tube using quartz sample holders and the other is a dry oxidation performed in an alumina tube using alumina sample holders. In n-type metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) capacitors the interface state density near the SiC conduction band edge is estimated using capacitance-voltage (C-V) and thermal dielectric relaxation current (TDRC) measurements. N-channel metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) are characterized by current-voltage (I-V) techniques and the inversion channel mobility is extracted. It is shown that the high inversion channel mobility (154 cm2 V-1 s-1) seen in samples oxidized using alumina correlates with a low interface trap density (3.6 × 1011 cm-2). In the case of N2O oxidation the mobility is lower (24 cm2 V-1 s -1) and the interface trap density is higher (1.6 × 10 12 cm-2). Room temperature C-V measurements are of limited use when studying traps near the conduction band edge in MOS structures while the TDRC measurement technique gives a better estimate of their density. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Conduction bands; Dielectric relaxation; MOS capacitors; Oxidation; Quartz; Silicon carbide; Capacitance-voltage (C-V); Channel mobility; Interface state density; Thermal dielectric relaxation current (TDRC) measurements; MOSFET devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047206863

The spontaneous emission lifetime of the 5D4 → 7p4 transition of Tb 3+ ions at 542 nm embedded in the SiO2 inverse opal structure was determined. In contrast to an average lifetime of 2.8 ms in photonic crystals when the photoluminescence of the Tb3+ envelop was located outside the photonic stop band, a lifetime of 4.0 ms was observed when the Tb3+ photoluminescence fully overlaps with the photonic stop band in the inverse opal. The obtained results demonstrate that the photonic structure affects the spontaneous emission significantly, resulting in a 40% increase of the luminescence lifetime of Tb3+ ions. In other words, the density of optical states is reduced at the emission frequency of Tb 3+ (i.e., 542 nm) which reduces the radiative rate constant. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Nanoparticles; Photoluminescence; Rate constants; Silica; Spontaneous emission; Emission frequency; Photonic stop band; Radiative rate constant; Photonic crystals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047253614

To meet these demands, this research project aimed at optimising anaerobic digestion of maize and dairy cattle manures. Methane production was measured for 60 days in 1 l eudiometer batch digesters at 38 °C. Manure received from dairy cows with medium milk yield that were fed a well balanced diet produced the highest specific methane yield of 166.3 Nl CH4 kg VS-1. Thirteen early to late ripening maize varieties were grown on several locations in Austria. Late ripening varieties produced more biomass than medium or early ripening varieties. On fertile locations in Austria more than 30 Mg VS ha-1 can be produced. The methane yield declined as the crop approaches full ripeness. With late ripening maize varieties, yields ranged between 312 and 365 Nl CH4 kg VS-1 (milk ripeness) and 268-286 Nl CH4 kg VS-1 (full ripeness). Silaging increased the methane yield by about 25% compared to green, non-conserved maize. Maize (Zea mays L.) is optimally harvested, when the product from specific methane yield and VS yield per hectare reaches a maximum. With early to medium ripening varieties (FAO 240-390), the optimum harvesting time is at the ""end of wax ripeness"". Late ripening varieties (FAO ca. 600) may be harvested later, towards ""full ripeness"". Maximum methane yield per hectare from late ripening maize varieties ranged between 7100 and 9000 Nm3 CH4 ha-1. Early and medium ripening varieties yielded 5300-8500 Nm3 CH4 ha-1 when grown in favourable regions. The highest methane yield per hectare was achieved from digestion of whole maize crops. Digestion of corns only or of corn cob mix resulted in a reduction in methane yield per hectare of 70 and 43%, respectively. From the digestion experiments a multiple linear regression equation, the Methane Energy Value Model, was derived that estimates methane production from the composition of maize. It is a helpful tool to optimise biogas production from energy crops. The Methane Energy Value Model requires further validation and refinement. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In the context of a simple model, we use broadband spectral energy distributions and submillimeter visibilities to derive constraints on some basic parameters that describe the structure of these disks. For the typical disk in the sample we infer a radial surface density distribution ∑r ∝ r-p with a median p ≈ 0.5, although consideration of the systematic effects of some of our assumptions suggest that steeper distributions with p ≈ 1 are more reasonable. The distribution of the outer radii of these disks shows a distinct peak at R d ≈ 200 AU, with only a few cases where the disk emission is completely unresolved. Based on these disk structure measurements, the mass accretion rates, and the typical spectral and spatial distributions of submillimeter emission, we show that the observations are in good agreement with similarity solutions for steady accretion disks that have a viscosity parameter α ≈ 0.01. We provide new estimates of the spectral dependence of the disk opacity κv ∝ vβ with a mean β ≈ 1.0, corrected for optically thick emission. This typical value of β is consistent with model predictions for the collisional growth of solids to millimeter-size scales in the outer disk. Although direct constraints on planet formation in these disks are not currently available, the extrapolated density distributions inferred here are substantially shallower than those calculated based on the solar system or extrasolar planets and typically used in planet formation models. It is possible that we are substantially underestimating disk densities due to an incomplete submillimeter opacity prescription. © 2007. The American Astronomical Society.

This method uses secondary economic data and conventional econometric production models, combined with estimates of soil carbon stocks derived from biophysical simulation models such as Century, to construct economic simulation models that estimate economic potential for carbon sequestration. Using this method, simulations for the central United States show that reduction in fallow and conservation tillage adoption in the wheat-pasture system could generate up to about 1.7 million MgC/yr, whereas increased adoption of conservation tillage in the corn-soy-feed system could generate up to about 6.2 million MgC/yr at a price of $200/MgC. About half of this potential could be achieved at relatively low carbon prices (in the range of $50 per ton). The model used in this analysis produced estimates of economic potential for soil carbon sequestration potential similar to results produced by much more data-intensive, field-scale models, suggesting that this simpler, aggregate modeling approach can produce credible estimates of soil carbon sequestration potential. Carbon rates were found to vary substantially over the region. Using average carbon rates for the region, the model produced carbon sequestration estimates within about 10% of those based on county-specific carbon rates, suggesting that effects of spatial heterogeneity in carbon rates may average out over a large region such as the central United States. However, the average carbon rates produced large prediction errors for individual counties, showing that estimates of carbon rates do need to be matched to the spatial scale of analysis. Transaction costs were found to have a potentially important impact on soil carbon supply at low carbon prices, particularly when carbon rates are low, but this effect diminishes as carbon prices increase. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",,"Carbon; Computer simulation; Greenhouse effect; Mathematical models; Soils; Agricultural soil; Carbon sequestration; Econometric production models; Agriculture; agricultural modeling; agricultural soil; assessment method; carbon sequestration; conservation tillage; cost-benefit analysis; econometrics; fallow; greenhouse gas; numerical model; soil carbon; Agriculture; Carbon; Greenhouse Effect; Mathematical Models; Soil; North America; United States; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751209826

Use of a hyperbaric chamber complicates anesthetic delivery, ventilation, and electrophysiological recording. We constructed a hyperbaric acrylic-aluminum chamber allowing recording of single unit activity in spinal cord of rats anesthetized only with N2O. Large aluminum plates secured to each other by rods that span the length of the chamber close each end of the chamber. The 122 cm long, 33 cm wide chamber housed ventilator, intravenous infusion pumps, recording headstage, including hydraulic microdrive and stepper motors (controlled by external computers). Electrical pass-throughs in the plates permitted electrical current or signals to enter or leave the chamber. In rats anesthetized only with N2O we recorded extracellular action potentials with a high signal-to-noise ratio. We also recorded electroencephalographic activity. This technique is well-suited to study actions of weak anesthetics such as N2O and Xe at working pressures of 4-5 atm or greater.

The goal of the treatment process was to enable the textile industry to reuse the wastewater in textile washing through simple, efficient, and cost-effective methodologies. Actual textile wastewater samples from local textile factories were used and were found to be highly polluted. The study focused on three main processes; sedimentation, coagulation, and adsorption. While sedimentation was found to reduce the total suspended solids (TSS) of the wastewater, coagulation had the additional advantages of lowering the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and achieving higher filtration rates. Four coagulants were tested, ferric chloride, ferrous sulfate plus lime, aluminum sulfate, and aluminum sulfate plus lime. While ferric chloride failed to perform effectively as a coagulant, the other three coagulants were fairly effective. Finally, to further lower the COD of post-coagulation treated water, adsorption using activated carbon was studied. It was found that carbon was effective in reducing the COD of the wastewater using reasonable quantities, where up to 98% COD reduction was achieved using 6 g carbon/L. © 2007 NRC Canada.","Adsorption; Coagulation; Sedimentation; Textile; Treatment; Wastewater","Activated carbon; Adsorption; Coagulation; Sedimentation; Textile industry; Washing; Wastewater reclamation; Chemical oxygen demand (COD); Textile wastewater; Wastewater treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38349124798

Design: An ecological time-series study. Total daily records of asthma hospital admissions (ICD 10th J15) were obtained from one of the main hospitals in Araraquara, São Paulo State, Brazil, from 23 March 2003 to 27 July 2004. The daily concentration of TSP (μg/m3) was obtained using Handi-vol equipment (Energética, Brazil) placed in downtown Araraquara. The local airport provided the daily mean figures of temperature and humidity. The daily number of asthma hospital admissions was considered as the dependent variable in Poisson's regression models and the daily concentration of TSP was considered the independent variable. The generalised linear model with natural cubic spline was adopted to control for long-time trend. Linear terms were used for weather variables. Results: TSP had an acute effect on asthma admissions, starting 1 day after TSP concentrations increased and remaining almost unchanged for the next four days. A 10 μg/m3 increase in the 5-day moving average (lag1-5) of TSP concentrations was associated with an increase of 11.6% (95% CI 5.4 to 17.7) in asthma hospital admissions. Conclusion: Increases in TSP concentrations were definitely associated with asthma hospital admissions in Araraquara and, despite using sugar cane alcohol to reduce air pollution from automotive sources in large Brazilian urban centres, the cities where sugar cane is harvested pay a high toll in terms of public health.",,"asthma; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; health risk; hospital sector; public health; toxicity; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; article; asthma; biomass; Brazil; controlled study; hospital admission; human; major clinical study; pathogenesis; plantation; statistical model; sugarcane; suspended particulate matter; time series analysis; Agriculture; Air Pollution; Asthma; Biomass; Brazil; Environmental Monitoring; Evidence-Based Medicine; Hospitalization; Humans; Incineration; Linear Models; Occupational Diseases; Saccharum; Vehicle Emissions; Araraquara; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; South America; Saccharum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247546545

We here describe the amounts and seasonality of soil VOC exchange during a year in a natural Mediterranean holm oak forest growing in Southern Catalonia. We investigated changes in soil VOC dynamics in drought conditions by decreasing the soil moisture to 30% of ambient conditions by artificially excluding rainfall and water runoff, and predicted the response of VOC exchange to the drought forecasted in the Mediterranean region for the next decades by GCM and ecophysiological models. The annual average of the total (detected) soil VOC and total monoterpene exchange rates were 3.2±3.2 and -0.4±0.3 μg m-2 h-1, respectively, in control plots. These values represent 0.003% of the total C emitted by soil at the study site as CO2 whereas the annual mean of soil monoterpene exchange represents 0.0004% of total C. Total soil VOC exchange rates in control plots showed seasonal variations following changes in soil moisture and phenology. Maximum values were found in spring (17±8 μg m-2 h-1). Although there was no significant global effect of drought treatment on the total soil VOC exchange rates, annual average of total VOC exchange rates in drought plots resulted in an uptake rate (-0.5±1.8 μg m-2 h-1) instead of positive net emission rates. Larger soil VOC and monoterpene exchanges were measured in drought plots than in control plots in summer, which might be mostly attributable to autotrophic (roots) metabolism. The results show that the diversity and magnitude of monoterpene and VOC soil emissions are low compared with plant emissions, that they are driven by soil moisture, that they represent a very small part of the soil-released carbon and that they may be strongly reduced or even reversed into net uptakes by the predicted decreases of soil water availability in the next decades. In all cases, it seems that VOC fluxes in soil might have greater impact on soil ecology than on atmospheric chemistry. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we aimed to quantify 1,3-D diffusion and emission from laboratory soil columns maintained under realistic conditions and thereby assess the efficacy of soil irrigation as a technique for reducing emissions. In two soils (one relatively high, and one relatively low, in organic matter), irrigation led to a limiting of upward diffusion of the fumigant and to the maintenance of higher soil gas concentrations. Therefore, rather than being emitted from the column, the 1,3-D was maintained in the soil where it was ultimately degraded. As a consequence, emission of 1,3-D from the irrigated columns was around half of that from the nonirrigated columns. It is concluded that surface irrigation represents an effective, low-cost, and readily practicable approach to lessening the environmental impact of 1,3-D fumigant use. In addition, the higher organic matter soil exhibited emissions of around one-fifth of the lower organic matter soil in both irrigated and nonirrigated treatments, due to markedly enhanced degradation of the fumigant. Organic matter amendment of soils may, therefore, also represent an extremely effective, relatively low-cost approach to reducing 1,3-D emissions. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Enhanced degradation; Soil columns; Soil gas concentrations; Emission control; Soil surveys; Volatile organic compounds; Irrigation; 1,3 dichloropropene; propylene; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; Emission control; Irrigation; Soil surveys; Volatile organic compounds; agricultural soil; assessment method; cost-benefit analysis; diffusion; emission control; fumigant; irrigation; organic matter; soil amendment; soil emission; volatile organic compound; article; diffusion; irrigation (agriculture); organic matter production; soil amendment; soil degradation; soil pollution; surface irrigation; United States; Agriculture; Allyl Compounds; California; Chromatography, Gas; Environmental Pollution; Fresh Water; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Temperature; Volatilization; Irrigation; Pollution Control; Surveying; Voc",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247173107

Little is known, however, about the effects of these gases on understory plant taxa. At the Aspen free-air CO2 and O3 enrichment (Aspen FACE) site we assessed colonization and establishment of two common forest understory species, red (Trifolium pratense) and white (Trifolium repens) clover. To better understand these natural patterns in red clover, the more responsive of the two clover species, we also assessed intraspecific variation in growth performance to altered atmospheric conditions. Natural red clover populations were larger in enriched CO2 atmospheres, whereas white clover populations showed no response to CO2. Neither species showed beneficial or detrimental responses to enriched O3 atmospheres. Nine red clover genotypes exhibited similar, but counterintuitive, decreases in shoot and root biomass, and increases in foliar nitrogen concentrations and root nodule numbers, under elevated CO2. We suggest that in enriched CO2 habitats, increased shading from rapidly growing trees offsets the positive benefits of CO2 for understory plant performance. Enriched CO2 and O3 atmospheres may have large direct and indirect effects on colonization, establishment, and performance of common understory plants.

Both foliar and root herbivory can alter the exudation of carbon from plant roots, which in turn can affect nitrogen availability in the soil. However, few studies have investigated the effects of herbivory on N fluxes from roots, which can directly increase N availability in the soil and uptake by neighbouring plants. Moreover, the combined effects of foliar and root herbivory on N fluxes remains unexplored. 2. We subjected the legume white clover (Trifolium repens L.) to defoliation (through clipping) and root herbivory (by an obligate root-feeding nematode, Heterodera trifolii Goggart) to examine how these stresses individually, and simultaneously, affected the transfer of T. repens-derived N to neighbouring perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) plants using 15N stable-isotope techniques. We also examined the effects of defoliation and root herbivory on the size of the soil microbial community and the growth response of L. perenne. 3. Neither defoliation nor root herbivory negatively affected T. repens biomass. On the contrary, defoliation increased root biomass (34%) and total shoot production by T. repens (100%). Furthermore, defoliation resulted in a fivefold increase in T. repens-derived 15N recovered in L. perenne roots, and increased the size of the soil microbial biomass (77%). In contrast, root herbivory by H. trifolii slightly reduced 15N transfer from T. repens to L. perenne when T. repens root 15N concentration was included as a covariate, and root herbivory did not affect microbial biomass. Growth of L. perenne was not affected by any of the treatments. 4. Our findings demonstrate that defoliation of a common grassland legume can substantially increase the transfer of its N to neighbouring plants by directly affecting below-ground N fluxes. These finding require further examination under field conditions but, given the prevalence of N-limitation of plant productivity in terrestrial ecosystems, increased transfer of N from legumes to non-N-fixing species could alter competitive interactions, with implications for plant community structure. © 2007 The Authors.","Legume; Nitrogen dynamics; Nitrogen limitation; Plant-parasitic nematodes; Rhizodeposition","belowground biomass; defoliation; growth response; herbivory; host-parasite interaction; legume; nematode; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen isotope; nutrient availability; nutrient uptake; soil microorganism; stable isotope; Heterodera trifolii; Lolium perenne; Nematoda; Trifolium repens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947216129

The first thesis is that, while reduced GHG emissions are essential for long-term global sustainability, the usual policy recommendation of increasing energy costs by introducing a carbon tax may be relatively ineffective under current market structures and have an unnecessarily adverse impact on economic growth. Our second thesis is that there exists a practical near-term strategy for reducing GHG emissions while simultaneously encouraging continued technology-driven economic growth. Moreover, this strategy does not require radical new technologies, but rather improved regulation or-more precisely-better deregulation of the electric power sector. In respect to the first of our two theses, this paper addresses a deficiency in neoclassical economic growth theory, in which growth is assumed to be automatic, inevitable and cost-free. We challenge both the assumption that growth will continue in the future at essentially the same rate (""the trend"") as it has in the past, and the corollary that our children's children will inevitably be richer and better able to afford the cost of repairing the environmental damages caused by current generations [[1]Simon et al., The state of humanity.

Air quality management in the united States has depended largely on establishing effects-based National Ambient Air Quality Standards, since 1970, that inspire state and local programs to attain and maintain acceptable air quality. An effective air quality management depends on the nature and scale of the air pollution problem, and the understanding, interdisciplinary skills, and commitment of the managers. The CAA has included a number of programs including uniform national emissions standards for mobile and new stationary sources and market-based cap-and-trade programs.

The current CAA system is a hybrid of several distinct air pollution control philosophies, including the recursive or circular system driven by ambient standards. Although this evolving system has resulted in tremendous improvements in air quality, it has been far from perfect in terms of timeliness and effectiveness. The paper looks at several periods in the history of the U.S. program, including: (1) 1900-1970, spanning the early smoke abatement and smog control programs, the first federal involvement, and the development of a hybrid AQM approach in the 1970 CAA; (2) 1971-1976, when the first National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) were set and implemented; (3) 1977-1993, a period of the first revisions to the standards, new CAA Amendments, delays in implementation and decision-making, and key science/policy/legislative developments that would alter both the focus and scale of air pollution programs and how they are implemented; and (4) 1993-2006, the second and third wave of NAAQS revisions and their implementation in the context of the 1990 CAA. This discussion examines where NAAQS have helped drive implementation programs and how improvements in both effects and air quality/control sciences influenced policy and legislation to enhance the effectiveness of the system over time. The review concludes with a look toward the future of AQM, emphasizing challenges and ways to meet them. The most significant of these is the need to make more efficient progress toward air quality goals, while adjusting the system to address the growing intersections between air quality management and climate change.

Since independence in the 1960s, grazing lands have been opened to all without specific guidance, and the vulnerability of the pastures to degradation has increased. Rotational grazing is postulated as a possible solution to provide higher pasture productivity, higher animal loads per unit land, and perhaps improved soil carbon storage. The objective of this study was to conduct a simulation-based assessment of the impact of rotational grazing management on pasture biomass production, grazing efficiency, animal grazing requirement satisfaction, and soil carbon storage in the Madiama Commune, Mali. The results showed that grazing intensity is the primary factor influencing the productivity of annual pastures and their capacity to provide for animal grazing requirements. Rotating the animals in paddocks is a positive practice for pasture protection that showed advantage as the grazing pressure increased. Increasing the size of the reserve biomass not available for grazing, which triggers the decision of taking the animals off the field, provided better pasture protection but reduced animal grazing requirements satisfaction. In terms of soil carbon storage, all management scenarios led to reduction of soil carbon at the end of the 50-year simulation periods, ranging between 4% and 5% of the initial storage. The differences in reduction as a function of grazing intensity were of no practical significance in these soils with very low organic matter content, mostly resistant to decomposition. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study we investigate the impact of freeway and arterial-road air pollution on vulnerable populations - for example, the poor, minorities, children, and the elderly - whose housing options are limited. Because many mobile-source emissions decay rapidly with distance, approaching background concentrations at 330 ft from the freeway, populations living near limited access roads are most at risk from exposure. Furthermore, microscale air monitoring systems are rarely in place at these locations in the United States. In this research we will define freeway air-pollution sheds with the aid of a geographic information system analysis and determine populations that may be at risk from exposure to mobile-source pollutants in two West Coast metropolitan areas (Seattle and Portland). We then use cluster analysis to identify key neighborhoods at risk in Seattle. Subsequently, we apply a hedonic pricing model to understand the extent to which house price values in Seattle are related to freeway proximity.

Two-hourly interval time-resolved measurements of organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were performed at the Gosan site, Korea during Atmospheric Brown Clouds-East Asian Regional Experiment 2005 (ABC-EAREX2005) campaign. They were operated by the same semi-continuous field carbon instruments of Sunset Laboratory (thermal optical transmittance) in PM2.5 particulate. However, their thermal protocols (four and two steps for OC and five and two steps for EC) were different. The co-located 1 min black carbon (BC) concentrations were compared by an Aethalometer for an intercomparison study. As a result, the poor R2 of OC between two different temperature protocols suggested that OC can be significantly more biased by the slight differences of maximum temperature (870 and 840 °C) and a number of temperature steps (four steps and two steps) with their hold times. However, EC that is a smaller fraction of total carbon (TC) shows the good agreement between two different protocols, which are under a mixture of 2% O2 and 98% He in six temperature steps and two temperature steps as max as 900 and 880 °C with the slope of 1.05±0.15 (R2 of 0.98).

Cold-acclimated fish were acutely moved to 23 °C and sampled after 1, 6, 12, 24, 48 or 120 h of warm temperature exposure. Lipid peroxide levels increased quickly during the first few hours at 23 °C, but thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances changed little. Protein carbonyl content was reduced by 20-40% in the liver over the entire experimental course, but increased transiently in the kidney. The content of high-molecular mass thiols decreased by two-thirds in the brain and was affected slightly in other organs. By contrast, total low-molecular mass thiols (e.g. glutathione and others) increased transiently. Activities of the primary antioxidant enzymes-superoxide dismutase and catalase-were generally unaffected in goldfish organs, whereas glutathione-dependent enzymes were elevated in the brain and kidney after 24-48 h at 23 °C. Glutathione peroxidase increased by 1.5-2.3-fold and glutathione-S-transferase by 1.7-fold. Hence, a short-term exposure to warm temperature disturbed several oxidative stress markers, but only slightly affected the activities of antioxidant enzymes. However, comparison of the current data for cold-acclimated winter fish with the same parameters in summer fish suggests that longer exposure to high ambient temperature requires the enhancement of activities of glutathione-dependent enzymes for maintaining the steady-state levels lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in goldfish tissues. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Such turbines may soon become a commercial reality in the UK as a result of both advancements in technology and new financial incentives provided by the government. In addition, microgeneration technologies, especially those with appreciable resource, have the potential to reduce built environment related CO2 emissions coupled with reductions in consumers' electricity costs. In many cases payback on capital investment is within the lifetime of the device. Micro-wind turbines installed in certain areas in the UK will fit within such criteria. The work presented here addresses modelling of such installations around the UK and presents a methodology to assess the suitability and the economic viability of micro-wind turbines for domestic dwellings. A modelling tool ""μ-Wind"" has been developed specifically for studying both energy yields and the payback periods for micro-wind turbines. μ-Wind predicts wind turbine performance prior to installation according to specific power curves either defined by turbine manufacturers or the user. Numerical consideration of wind speed data at specific UK sites was used to estimate energy yields and the results are projected to real electricity demand data from monitored dwellings in the UK. The results show that it is possible to predict with a good degree of accuracy the expected financial payback period for a typical domestic dwelling. Furthermore, the paper postulates that micro-wind technology could have the potential to make a significant impact upon domestic electricity generation when located at the windiest sites in the UK. The likelihood of a proliferation of these turbines in the urban or suburban environment is low but at coastal or inland high elevation sites the technology appears to have a promising future. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

As this state is similar to that of general anxiety rather than panic, we further validated this by examining the effects of anxiolytic medication. Two separate studies in healthy volunteers are described; study one is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a single dose of 2mg lorazepam and study two describes the effects of 21 days of treatment with paroxetine. Gas challenges were air and 7.5% CO2 inhaled for 20 minutes, delivered on day 0 (before treatment) and day 21 (after treatment) in the paroxetine study. Subjective effects were measured using visual analogue scales and questionnaires. When compared with placebo, lorazepam 2mg significantly reduced peak CO2-induced subjective fear, feelings of wanting to leave, tension and worry. In the paroxetine study, when compared with day 0, day 21 showed a significantly attenuated peak CO2-induced nervousness and a trend for reduced ratings of anxiety, fear, feel like leaving, tense and worried. In these studies we have shown that this CO 2 model of anxiety is sensitive to lorazepam and to a lesser extent paroxetine.

Box 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","We combine surface and cave climate monitoring with multiple stalagmite parameters to help understand and calibrate the climate records contained within stalagmites from a region with strong rainfall seasonality. Two actively growing stalagmites from Ethiopia were analysed in order to investigate the climate signal contained within δ18O and growth rate parameters. The δ18O and growth rate of the two stalagmites give different responses to surface climate due to variations in the climate signal transfer. Both stalagmites (Merc-1 and Asfa-3) have a climate response that is seasonal; however this signal is subsequently smoothed by the mixing of event and storage water within the aquifer. Merc-1 responds more to high frequency ('event') climate, due to a greater ratio of event to storage water in this sample, whereas Asfa-3 responds more to low frequency ('storage') climate. In addition, different parameters respond to different seasons. For example, stalagmite Asfa-3, from greater depth from the surface and with a slow drip rate, has a growth rate that responds to the amount of summer rain. In contrast, Merc-1, closer to the surface and with a faster drip rate, exhibits no clear response to surface climate, probably due to a more complex climate signal transfer. δ18O response varies with stalagmite due to the interplay between rainfall forcing factors (amount, seasonality) and disequilibrium kinetics, with opposing correlations between seasonal rainfall and δ18O between the samples. Our results demonstrate that analysis of seasonal climate forcing, and transfer functions reflecting the mixing of event and storage water, may be the most appropriate approach to develop of transfer functions appropriate for high-resolution, stalagmite climate reconstruction. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Results show that mean annual temperature in the last two decades of the 20th century has been increasing locally at a rate of 0.06°C yr -1 (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the annual trend is a result of both summer- and wintertime warming (0.037°C yr-1, p &lt; 0.001; and 0.036°C yr-1, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Additionally, a local drying trend (-3.80 mm yr-1; p &lt; 0.001) was observed during the period 1955-1995. Repeat photos and supplemental measurements show that this warming is causing the retreat of glaciers and contributing to the elevational advance of alpine treeline. Fire, a traditional management tool used to halt the advance of woody species, has been suppressed since 1988. One consequence of these interactions is the encroachment of woody vegetation into alpine meadows, which will have negative impacts on plant species diversity and Tibetan livelihood. Two spatially and temporally distant anthropogenic actions, a rapidly warming climate and local land use policy, appear to be threatening both biodiversity and Tibetan livelihoods. Land managers need to recognize that global warming is occurring and adapt their conservation practices and policies to anticipate and be resilient to threats at all critical scales. © 2007 Regents of the University of Colorado.",,"biodiversity; climate change; conservation planning; glacier retreat; historical record; species diversity; treeline; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Xizang; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249936688

Deforestation releases CO 2 to the atmosphere, which exerts a warming influence on Earth's climate. However, biophysical effects of deforestation, which include changes in land surface albedo, evapotranspiration, and cloud cover also affect climate. Here we present results from several large-scale deforestation experiments performed with a three-dimensional coupled global carbon-cycle and climate model. These simulations were performed by using a fully three-dimensional model representing physical and biogeochemical interactions among land, atmosphere, and ocean. We find that global-scale deforestation has a net cooling influence on Earth's climate, because the warming carbon-cycle effects of deforestation are overwhelmed by the net cooling associated with changes in albedo and evapotranspiration. Latitude-specific deforestation experiments indicate that afforestation projects in the tropics would be clearly beneficial in mitigating global-scale warming, but would be counterproductive if implemented at high latitudes and would offer only marginal benefits in temperate regions. Although these results question the efficacy of mid- and high-latitude afforestation projects for climate mitigation, forests remain environmentally valuable resources for many reasons unrelated to climate. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Afforestation; Albedo change; Climate change; Climate policy; Global warming","carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon; article; atmosphere; biogeochemical cycling; carbon cycle; climate change; cloud; deforestation; environmental impact; evapotranspiration; greenhouse effect; physical phenomena; priority journal; simulation; chemistry; climate; environmental protection; metabolism; Atmosphere; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249855831

Consequently, an increase of building energy performance can constitute an important instrument in the efforts to alleviate the EU energy import dependency (currently at about 48%) and comply with the Kyoto Protocol to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. This is also in accordance to the European Directive (EPBD 2002/91/EC) on the energy performance of buildings, which is currently under consideration in all EU member states. This paper presents an overview of the EU residential building stock and focuses on the Hellenic buildings. It elaborates the methodology used to determine the priorities for energy conservation measures (ECMs) in Hellenic residential buildings to reduce the environmental impact from CO2 emissions, through the implementation of a realistic and effective national action plan. A major obstacle that had to overcome was the need to make suitable assumptions for missing detailed primary data. Accordingly, a qualitative and quantitative assessment of scattered national data resulted to a realistic assessment of the existing residential building stock and energy consumption. This is the first time that this kind of aggregate data is presented on a national level. Different energy conservation scenarios and their impact on the reduction of CO2 emissions were evaluated. Accordingly, the most effective ECMs are the insulation of external walls (33-60% energy savings), weather proofing of openings (16-21%), the installation of double-glazed windows (14-20%), the regular maintenance of central heating boilers (10-12%), and the installation of solar collectors for sanitary hot water production (50-80%). © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, variations in carbon (13C/12C) and oxygen (18O/16O) isotope ratios obtained during whole-shell and sequential-rib analyses of the modern land snail, Cerion, reveal a record of diet and local environment on San Salvador, Bahamas. The mean δ13C value of adult Cerion shells collected from C4 vegetation is higher by 1.0‰ relative to snails collected from C3 plants, suggesting that carbon isotopes in shell carbonate reflect the dominant plant type in the diet, though the broad range of shell carbonate δ 13C confirms a varied diet for this genus. The mean δ18O values of adult Cerion shells collected from the west coast of San Salvador are 0.8‰ higher than those collected from the east coast of the island. This difference may reflect the incorporation of water vapor derived from 18O-rich hypersaline lakes located in the island's western interior. Sequential-rib analysis of one adult Cerion shell reveals variations in δ13C and δ18O values through ontogeny that may reflect changes in food source and rainfall seasonality, respectively.

The primary types of geologic reservoirs for storing CO2 underground are depleted oil and gas reservoirs, unmineable coal seams and deep saline formations. There are various reservoir types. Depleted oil and gas reservoirs in the US are estimated to contain 90 gigatons of storage capacity. Currently, CO2 is injected in depleted oil fields to enhance oil recovery. Another option is unmineable coalbeds, which can be used for enhanced coalbed methane production. Another option is deep saline reservoirs. In terms of projects, a deep saline reservoir is under way at Sliepner field in North Sea and at the In Salah project in Algeria. Another large-scale project under planning is the FutureGen project, which will ensure coal gasification to produce power and hydrogen in a near-zero emission plant with CO2 sequestration.

This paper proposes simple mitigation and recovery procedures to substantially reduce atmospheric methane emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs. We aim at transforming existing methane stocks of tropical reservoirs into a clean, renewable energy source. The recovered gas methane may be pumped to large consuming centers, stocked locally and burned in gas turbines to generate electricity during high demand periods, or even purified for transport applications. Our simulations show that the use of biogenic methane may increase considerably the energy supply in countries like Brazil. As a result, it would be possible to reduce the need of additional hydroelectric dams, protecting important pristine biomes, and avoiding the resettlement of villages and indigenous reserves. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Background: Increased coronary sinus (CS) pressure can reduce myocardial ischemia by redistribution of blood from nonischemic to ischemic territories. The Coronary Sinus Reducer is a percutaneous implantable device designed to establish CS narrowing and to elevate CS pressure. In preclinical experiments, implantation of the Reducer was safe and was associated with improved ischemic parameters. In the present study, the safety and feasibility of the Coronary Sinus Reducer was evaluated in patients with refractory angina who were not candidates for revascularization. Methods: Fifteen coronary artery disease patients with severe angina and reversible ischemia were electively treated with the Reducer. Clinical evaluation, dobutamine echocardiography, thallium single-photon emission computed tomography, and administration of an angina questionnaire were performed before and 6 months after implantation. Cardiac computed tomography was performed 2 days and 6 months after implantation. Results: All procedures were completed successfully. No procedure-related adverse events occurred during the periprocedural and the follow-up periods. Angina score improved in 12 of 14 patients. Average Canadian Cardiovascular Society score was 3.07 at baseline and 1.64 at follow-up (n = 14, p < 0.0001). Stress-induced ST-segment depression was reduced in 6 of 9 patients and was eliminated in 2 of these 6 (p = 0.047).

With the Kyoto Protocol having entered into force in February 2005, there will be renewed international pressure on the United States for action. Concurrently, the US economy, growing modestly, is characterized by large current account and budget deficits. This situation calls for garnering additional revenue through repealing of the recent tax cuts. An option available is to impose a modest carbon tax. The rationale of such a tax is that it would address the twin objectives of additional revenue and reduction of emissions. In this paper, the impact of a hypothetical carbon tax imposed in a revenue-neutral context on 2001 household incomes is analyzed primarily to ascertain its progressivity. Progressivity of any tax is strongly associated with its political acceptability. The incidence of the hypothetical carbon tax is computed across the income quintiles. It is observed that only the households in the highest income quintile and the lowest income quintile are impacted by the tax. It is found that this tax is weakly regressive in the US context. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The terminal CoIIIN3O3 centres exhibit a uniform facial arrangement of both N3 and O3 donor sets and the CoII centre is coordinated to six oxygen atoms. Variable temperature magnetic susceptibility measurement reveals that the intermediate Co(II) paramagnetic centre undergoes a very weak spin exchange (θ = -6.39 K, antiferromagnetic) interaction with the two terminal Co(III) diamagnetic centres over the range 300-2 K. A three line EPR spectra at 4 K was characterized with highly anisotropic g tensors and the one line broad spectra at 300 K indicates the strong influence of temperature on the metal spin states, consistent with a high spin Co(II) complex. Two anodic responses appeared at +0.85 (Co2+ → Co3+, reversible) and +1.7 V (Co3+ → Co4+, irreversible) corresponding to one and two electron transfer oxidation respectively. Another reversible signal attributed to Co3+ → Co2+ reduction occurred at -0.5 V, associated with a two electron stoichiometry.

This paper considers whether the international ""pull"" and the domestic ""push"" will be strong enough to accomplish this. First, we discuss whether changes in the architecture of the current climate regime might induce the United States to re-engage at the international level. We argue that the United States is unlikely to rejoin any global climate regime that is based on the Kyoto architecture, even if Kyoto were to be ""reformed"". Second, we discuss whether domestic political developments might eventually cause the United States to re-engage. We conclude that US re-engagement is likely to require the emergence of a new climate regime that basically extends US regulation to other countries. However, the forging of a unified US climate policy is still in the making. Furthermore, a new regime can gain widespread participation only if the Kyoto countries accept the idea of replacing Kyoto with some alternative architecture, which seems unlikely in the near future. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It is divided into four phases: G1, S, G2, and M. Passage through the cell cycle is strictly regulated by a molecular interaction network, which involves the periodic synthesis and destruction of cyclins that bind and activate cyclin-dependent kinases that are present in nonlimiting amounts. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors contribute to cell cycle control. Budding yeast is an established model organism for cell cycle studies, and several mathematical models have been proposed for its cell cycle. An area of major relevance in cell cycle control is the G1 to S transition. In any given growth condition, it is characterized by the requirement of a specific, critical cell size, PS, to enter S phase. The molecular basis of this control is still under discussion. The authors report a mathematical model of the G1 to S network that newly takes into account nucleo/cytoplasmic localization, the role of the cyclin-dependent kinase Sic1 in facilitating nuclear import of its cognate Cdk1-Clb5, Whi5 control, and carbon source regulation of Sic1 and Sic1-containing complexes. The model was implemented by a set of ordinary differential equations that describe the temporal change of the concentration of the involved proteins and protein complexes. The model was tested by simulation in several genetic and nutritional setups and was found to be neatly consistent with experimental data. To estimate PS, the authors developed a hybrid model including a probabilistic component for firing of DNA replication origins. Sensitivity analysis of PS provides a novel relevant conclusion: PS is an emergent property of the G 1 to S network that strongly depends on growth rate. © 2007 Barberis et al.",,"cyclin dependent kinase; cyclin dependent kinase 1; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor; cycline; protein Clb5; sic1 enzyme; unclassified drug; cell cycle protein; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; article; carbon source; cell cycle G1 phase; cell cycle S phase; cell division; cell growth; cell population; cell size; complex formation; DNA replication; gene dosage; mathematical model; biological model; cell cycle; computer simulation; cytology; metabolism; physiology; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; signal transduction; Eukaryota; Saccharomycetales; Cell Cycle; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Size; Computer Simulation; Models, Biological; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247627985

An important constraint of using n-alkanes to estimate diet composition with currently employed mathematical procedures is that the number of markers must be equal or larger than the number of diet components. This is a considerable limitation when dealing with free-ranging herbivores feeding on complex plant communities. We present a novel approach for the estimation of diet composition using n-alkanes which applies equally to cases where the number of markers is lower, equal or greater than the number of plant species in the diet. The model uses linear programming to estimate the minimum and maximum proportions of each plant in the diet, and avoids the need for grouping species in order to reduce the number of estimated dietary components. We illustrate the model with two data sets of n-alkane content of plants and faeces obtained from a sheep grazing experiment conducted in Australia and a red deer study in Portugal. Our results are consistent with previous studies on those data sets and provide additional information on the proportions of individual species in the diet. Results show that sheep included in the diet high proportions of white clover (from 0.25 to 0.37), and relatively high proportions of grasses (e.g. brome from 0.14 to 0.26) but tended to avoid Lotus spp. (always less than 0.04 of the diet). For red deer we found high proportions of legumes (e.g. Trifolium angustifolium and Vicia sativa reaching maximum proportions of 0.42 and 0.30 of the diet, respectively) with grasses being less important and Cistus ladanifer, a browse, also having relevance (from 0.21 to 0.42 of the diet). © 2007 The Animal Consortium.","Grazing; Linear models; Linear programming; Markers; Ungulates","alkane; Cistus; conference paper; deer; food composition; grass; grazing; herbivore; legume; linear system; Lotus; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; plant; priority journal; sheep; Bromus; Cervus elaphus; Cistus ladanifer; Ovis aries; Poaceae; Trifolium angustifolium; Trifolium repens; Ungulata; Vicia sativa",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947412740

In this study, the perceptions of the impacts of invasive exotic plant species are examined and compared to perceptions of other environmental issues on the islands of Mallorca, Sardinia and Crete. A survey of key stakeholders was undertaken on the Mediterranean islands with the use of questionnaires and in-depth interviews. While there is a widespread tolerance of environmental change associated with the establishment of invasive species on the islands, local stakeholders raise concerns about specific impacts and the policies in place to respond to future risk.

To this aim, the objective of this work is to size the cogenerative production plant combined to the district heating system. This work proposes the use of a simulation model, developed by the authors, to optimize the thermal power demand of a complex user during the heating season. On the basis of such model, the study was focused on the analysis of the obtained global thermal load and the possible solutions proposed for the thermal plant sizing. The better plant configuration was established and, consequently, the polluting quantity emitted and the fuel consumption relative to an entire heating season were esteemed with satisfactory precision.

Nowadays the worldwide hydrogen production is based mainly on natural gas reforming, but the attention of the scientific community is focused also on other gas mixtures with significant methane content. In particular mixtures constituted mainly by methane and carbon dioxide are extensively used in energy conversion applications, as they include land-fill gas, digester gas and natural gas. The present paper addresses the development of an innovative system for hydrogen production and CO2 capture starting from these mixtures. The plant is based on steam methane reforming, coupled with the carbonation and calcination reactions for CO2 absorption and desorption, respectively. A thermodynamic approach is proposed to investigate the plant performance in relation to the CH4 content in the feeding gas. The results suggest that, in order to optimize the hydrogen purity and the efficiency, two different methodologies can be adopted involving both the system layout and operating parameters.

Cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts have been used extensively in industrial process control to detect deviations in production parameters from pre-determined values. This study investigates the use of the CUSUM procedure to identify change in ambient air pollution levels following the introduction of a traffic management scheme at a specific location in Central London. The CUSUM methods of Lucas first compute the standardised deviations of time series observations from the desired process mean. These are accumulated over time to compute the CUSUM at each time point. Data for the analysis were taken from a kerbside monitoring site on Marylebone Road, a six lane trunk route in Central London. In August 2001 the lane adjacent to the monitoring site was designated as a permanent bus lane. The CUSUM analysis clearly identifies a sustained decrease in carbon monoxide concentrations beginning in 2002. However, seasonality and other factors precluded precise characterisation of the timing of the change. When the analysis was repeated using a reference mean that extrapolated the pre-intervention trend in carbon monoxide concentrations, the CUSUM chart no longer identified a sustained decrease. CUSUM appears to offer a simple and rapid method for identifying sustained changes in pollution levels, but the range of confounding influences on carbon monoxide concentrations, most notably underlying trends, seasonality and independent interventions, complicate its interpretation. Its application in assessing the presence or timing of a stepped change in pollution or similar environmental time series data is recommended in its basic form only where the predicted change is large by comparison with other independent influences. The authors believe that further development of the technique beyond this initial study is worthwhile in order to improve the technique's sensitivity. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We recalculate sea surface temperature estimates derived from foraminifera and compare these with estimates derived from alkenones and magnesium/ calcium ratios in foraminiferal carbonate and with accompanying sedimentological and pollen records on a common absolute timescale. Using a stack of the highest-resolution records, we find that first-order climate change occurs in concert with changes in insolation in the Northern Hemisphere. Glacier extent and inferred vegetation changes in Australia and New Zealand vary in tandem with sea surface temperatures, signifying close links between oceanic and terrestrial temperature. In the Southern Ocean, rapid temperature change of the order of 6°C occurs within a few centuries and appears to have played an important role in midlatitude climate change. Sea surface temperature changes over longer periods closely match proxy temperature records from Antarctic ice cores.

Hungary's trading sector CO2 emissions are relatively small compared to its size. The total quantity of allowances issued is about half of the trading sector emissions of Belgium, a country with an almost equal number of inhabitants. Though only half as populous as Hungary, Slovakia's trading sector emissions are almost equal to Hungary's. These relatively small emissions are attributable to the relatively small heavy industry, and an exceptionally high (40%) share of gas in the country's total primary energy supply. Significantly, unlike in most new Member States, electricity generation and distribution has been almost fully privatised, and is now owned mostly by the multinationals E.ON, RWE and EDF. The state still owns and operates the national electricity grid and the Paks nuclear power station. Hungary, like all new Member States, has seen a steep decline in its plan-based carbon-intensive economies during the 1990s, and despite the subsequent rebound of economic activity, emissions are still well below their levels in the 1980s. © Cambridge University Press 2007 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924744276

This strategy can be even more environmentally friendly if a suitable treatment process of the resulting sewage is performed in order to control nutrients emission. However, still nowadays, part of the scientific and technical community considers the application of this technology a possible source of problems. In this study, the FWDs were applied, with a market penetration factor of 67%, in a mountain village of 250 inhabitants. Further, the existing wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was upgraded by applying an automatically controlled alternate cycles process for the management of nutrients removal. With specific reference to the observed results, the impact of the ground food waste on the sewerage system did not show particular solids sedimentation or significant hydraulic overflows. Further, the WWTP was able to face the overloads of 11, 55 and 2 g per capita per day of TSS, COD and TN, respectively. Then, the increase of the readily biodegradable COD (rbCOD/COD from 0.20 to 0.25) and the favourable COD/TN ratio (from 9.9 to 12) led to a specific denitrification rate of some 0.06 kg NO3-N/(kg MLVSS day). Therefore, not only COD removal, but also the total nitrogen removal increased: the denitrification efficiency reached 85%. That led to a better exploitation of the nitrogen-bound oxygen and a consequent reduction of energy requirements of 39%. The final economic evaluation showed the benefits of the application of this technology with a pay back time of 4-5 years. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

HOMO and LUMO values of the dyad were aquired by cyclic voltammetry. Photophysical properties were studied by steady-state UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. After selective excitation of the TPD moiety, a quenching of donor fluorescence and the appearance of acceptor fluorescence was observed. This proves nonradiative energy transfer from the donor to the acceptor group. The energy transfer was 4 times more efficient in DBA than in a mixture of D and A. The energy transfer efficiency in the dyad is also independent of the concentration, indicating intramolecular transfer mechanism. However, the direct excitation of the acceptor in the dyad exhibited reduced fluorescence emission of the acceptor, indicating electron transfer between the moieties. Thus, this DBA is an excellent model system for the study of energy- and electron-transfer processes in organic semiconductors. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Aromatic hydrocarbons; Cyclic voltammetry; Energy transfer; Molecular dynamics; Semiconducting organic compounds; Intramolecular transfer; Nonradiative energy transfer; Tetraphenylbenzidine (TPD); Molecular structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846511164

For Italy, the commitment is the reduction of the greenhouse emissions by 6.5% below 1990 levels over the commitment period 2008-2012. It requires the introduction of suitable political strategies and programmes aimed to establish a sustainable energy system together with the application of a set of actions either at national scale, either at regional one. This study presents the results of a survey in the context of the Regione Sicilia about the potential saving of primary energy and the reduction of greenhouse emissions, which should be allowed by local energy planning in the energy uses. An assessment of the specific costs per unit of saved energy and of avoided CO2eq emissions is presented for each of the actions of the Sicily Regional Energy Master Plan (REMP).

Emission spectra were obtained on both, solid state and aqueous solutions for europium and terbium complexes. The complexes exhibit good emission, even in aqueous solution, enhancing their potential for biological applications. The reduction of emission intensity, from solid state to aqueous solution, is lower for europium complexes, in comparison to terbium complexes. The [Eu(12-crown-4)(terpy)(H 2O)]∈•∈3Cl complex exhibits an emission lifetime of 0.64∈ms while [Eu(15-crown-5)(terpy)]∈•∈3Cl exhibits a value of 0.38∈ms. Furthermore, the 15-crown-5 complex emission intensity is about 3.8 times larger than the emission intensity of the 12-crown-4 complex. This ratio (3.8) is the same as observed for the ARAD and A NRAD for the aqueous solutions: 1225.5/339.5∈=∈3.6.

The program promotes the production and use of bioethanol with tax-related incentives regarding gasoline (exemption from the VAT, tax on gross revenue, and surcharge), and an effective reduction of CO2.emissions. Five distilleries were established in the Cauca River valley between October 2005 and March 2006. Jointly, these plants produce 1,050,000 liters per day. Vinasse resulting from distillation is concentrated to a dry matter content of 32%-55%.

FCC gasoline is recognized as the principal contributor of sulfur to the gasoline pool and has become the focus for meeting the new specifications. The difficulty in removing sterically hindered sulfur species in the fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) cycle oil drives up the hydrogen and investment costs for treating the distillates. Although installation of pre- and post-treatment facilities is planned by many refiners, other non-capital approaches such as undercutting are being evaluated to meet interim and future sulfur levels. Even when expensive treatment facilities are installed, operating costs can be lowered and the flexibility of the facility increased with improvements in the ability to remove sulfur in the FCCU. In this article, we detail Petro-Canada's experience in integrating Albemarle's RESOLVE sulfur reduction technology with a combination of innovative process ideas. These concepts include heavy naphtha recycle, coprocessing of hydrogen donor feeds, and recycle of light cycle oil (LCO) to a specially designed stripper reactor. Special attention is paid to the interaction of deep FCC feed hydrodesulfurization with the FCC performance. The results demonstrate that very low FCC gasoline sulfur levels can be achieved without significant capital investment through novel approaches to recycle, creative integration of cat feed hydrotreating unit (CFHTU)-FCCU designs and operations, and application of state-of-the-art sulfur reduction additive technology. An added benefit of the RESOLVE 950 sulfur reduction technology is the substantial elimination of sulfur oxides in the FCC flue gas. This has been observed in Petro-Canada operations and numerous other RESOLVE 950 applications around the world.","Additive; Fluid catalytic cracking; Fluid catalytic cracking unit; Gasoline; RESOLVE, Sulphur","Additives; Desulfurization; Distillation; Flue gases; Fluid catalytic cracking; Cat feed hydrotreating unit (CFHTU); Light cycle oil (LCO); Stripper reactor; Gasoline refining; Additives; Desulfurization; Distillation; Flue gases; Fluid catalytic cracking; Gasoline refining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847726538

In this study, we compare the water balance requirements of nondiapausing and diapausing adult females of C. pipiens. Although their percentage water content is lower, diapausing females contain both higher initial and dry masses than nondiapausing individuals. Both nondiapausing and diapausing females tolerate a loss of up to 40% of their water mass before dying, but diapausing female C. pipiens reach this point after a longer period due to their lower rate of water loss. Males, which do not overwinter in diapause, showed no differences in their water balance characteristics when reared under diapausing or nondiapausing conditions. Likewise, no changes were noted in the water balance of pupae, indicating that diapause-related changes do not occur prior to adult eclosion. This mosquito does not replenish internal water stores by generating metabolic water or by absorbing vapor from the atmosphere, but instead relies on drinking liquid water (or blood feeding in the case of nondiapausing females). The critical transition temperature, a point where water loss increases rapidly with temperature, was the highest for females, then males, then pupae, but was not influenced by the diapause program. Females in diapause did not utilize common polyols (glycerol, trehalose and sorbitol) to retain water, but instead the presence of twice the amount of cuticular hydrocarbons in diapausing compared with nondiapausing females suggests that the deposition of hydrocarbons contribute to the reduced rates of water loss. The laboratory results were also verified in field-collected specimens: mosquitoes in the late fall and winter had a lower percentage water content and water loss rate, higher initial mass, dry mass and more cuticular hydrocarbons than individuals collected during the summer. Thus, the major features of diapause that contribute to the suppression of water loss are the large size of diapausing females (reduction of surface area to volume ratio lowers cuticular water loss), their low metabolic rate and the deposition of extra cuticular hydrocarbons.","Culex pipiens; Diapause; Mosquito; Water balance; Water loss rates","carbohydrate; hydrocarbon; adaptation; animal; article; body water; chemistry; comparative study; Culex; energy metabolism; female; male; physiology; season; sex difference; temperature; thermoregulation; United States; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Body Water; Carbohydrates; Culex; Energy Metabolism; Female; Hydrocarbons; Male; Ohio; Seasons; Sex Factors; Temperature; Water Loss, Insensible; Culex pipiens; Culex pipiens pipiens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847072292

The U.S. has large coal resources, the cheapest fuel in most areas. Coal fired power plants are likely to continue to provide much of U.S. electricity. However, the type of power plant that should be built is unclear. Technology can reduce pollutant discharges and capture and sequester the CO2 from coal-fired generation. The U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides incentives for large scale commercial deployment of Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) systems (e.g., loan guarantees and project tax credits). This analysis examines whether a new coal plant should be Pulverized Coal (PC) or IGCC. Do stricter emissions standards (PM, SO2, NOx, Hg) justify the higher costs of IGCC over PC? How does potential future carbon legislation affect the decision to add carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology? Finally, can the impact of uncertain carbon legislation be minimized? We find that SO 2, NOx, PM, and Hg emission standards would have to be far more stringent than twice current standards to justify the increased costs of the IGCC system. A CO2 tax less than $29/ton would lead companies to continuing to choose PC, paying the tax for emitted CO2. The earlier a decision-maker believes the carbon tax will be imposed and the higher the tax, the more likely companies will choose IGCC w/CCS. Having government announce the date and level of a carbon tax would promote more sensible decisions, but government would have to use a tax or subsidy to induce companies to choose the technology that is best for society. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal gasification; Electric power generation; Investments; Carbon legislation; Carbon tax; Decision theory; carbon; coal; carbon; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal gasification; Decision theory; Electric power generation; Investments; carbon; coal production; decision making; electricity generation; energy policy; legislation; natural resource; tax incentive; air pollution; article; cost utility analysis; decision making; electric power plant; electricity; environmental factor; investment; pollution control; power supply; technology; economics; electric power plant; law; legal aspect; pollution; North America; United States; Carbon; Coal; Electricity; Environmental Pollution; Legislation; Power Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250027641

The widespread implementation of such technologies will require a sustainable supply of biomass from forestry and agriculture. Forests are a major source of feedstocks for biofuels production in Canada. Woody biomass includes residues from logging and forest thinning, and from wood processing and pulp production. More recently, damaged wood caused by beetle infestations has become available on a large scale in Western Canada. This study evaluates beetle-killed British Columbian hybrid spruce (HS) (Picea glauca × P. engelmannii) as a feedstock for the production of bioethanol. In the past 30 yr, attack by the beetle Dendroctonus rufipennis and associated fungi has resulted in estimated losses of more than three billion board feet in British Columbia alone. Here we describe the chemical and some physical characteristics of both healthy (HHS) and beetle-killed (BKHS) British Columbian HS and evaluate the technical feasibility of using these feedstocks as a source of biomass for bioethanol production. Untreated HHS and BKHS did not differ significantly in chemical composition except for the moisture content, which was significantly lower in BKHS (approx 10%) compared with HHS (approx 18%). However, the yields of carbohydrates in hydrolyzable and fermentable forms were higher at mild pretreatment conditions (H-Factor <1000) for BKHS compared with HHS. At medium (H-Factor 1000-2000) and severe (H-Factor >2000) pretreatment conditions HHS and BKHS behaved similarly. Organosolv pretreated HHS and BKHS demonstrated good ethanol theoretical yields, approx 70 and 80%, respectively. © 2007 Humana Press Inc.","Cellulase; Enzyme; Ethanol; Fermentation; Hydrolysis; Lignocellulose","Agriculture; Air pollution; Biological materials; Biomass; Carbohydrates; Ethanol; Feedstocks; Forestry; Gas emissions; Gas fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydraulic structures; Leakage (fluid); Organic compounds; Raw materials; Renewable energy resources; Technology; Wood; Bio ethanols; Bioethanol production; Biofuels production; British Columbia; Cellulase; Chemical compositions; Chemical-; Dendroctonus; Energy security; Enzyme; European Union; Fermentation; Forest thinning; Green house gas emissions; H factors; Hydrolysis; Lignocellulose; Moisture content; Organosolv; Physical characteristics; Pre-treatment conditions; Pulp production; Renewable resources; Technical feasibility; United States; Wood processing; Woody biomass; Living systems studies; alcohol; carbohydrate; hydrolase; agriculture; alcohol production; beetle; biofuel production; biomass; biotransformation; Canada; chemical composition; conference paper; enzyme activity; European Union; evaluation; fermentation; forestry; fungus; greenhouse gas; hybrid; hydrolysis; infestation; logging; moisture; renewable energy; spruce; United States; wood; Animals; Beetles; British Columbia; Ethanol; Picea; Wood; Agriculture; Air Pollution; Biomass; Carbohydrates; Cellulase; Enzymes; Ethanol; Fermentation; Forestry; Greenhouse Gases; Hydrolysis; Leakage; Lignocellulose; Organic Compounds; Raw Materials; Wood; Coleoptera; Dendroctonus rufipennis; Fungi; Picea; Picea glauca",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44449097080

All define carbon limits over only a very short time-frame compared with either the timescales characteristic of climate processes or the time horizon over which investments in mitigation measures must be evaluated. The Kyoto Protocol set national greenhouse gas emission targets only through 2012, and did not allow negotiations on targets for the Second Commitment period from 2013 to 2017 to begin until the protocol enters into force. In the European Union, a pilot emission trading system has been set up for the years 2005–2007, but targets and allocations for the First Commitment period limits were not specified. In the United States, proposed legislation to limit US greenhouse gas emissions has been specific about limits to 2020 but purposely ambiguous about limits further in the future. The short time horizons arise at least in part from the fundamental impossibility of binding future governments (through legislation or treaty) to policies that must be implemented and enforced over the indefinite future. Short policy horizons pose very difficult problems for assessing costs because silence on long-term limits leaves considerable ambiguity over long-term expectations about policies not yet enacted. © Cambridge University Press 2007, Cambridge University Press, 2010.",,"Carbon; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial relations; International cooperation; International law; Laws and legislation; Climate change policies; Climate process; Emission trading systems; European union; International negotiation; KYOTO protocol; Mitigation measures; Short time frames; Climate change",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927054884

Until recently, Canadian policy seemed to be driven in large part by a desire to join in multilateral efforts to address climate change. By contrast, current policy is seeking a ""made in Canada"" approach to the issue. Recent government-sponsored analytic efforts as well as the government's own stated policies have been focused almost entirely on domestic regulation and incentives, domestic opportunities for technological responses, domestic costs, domestic carbon markets, and the setting of a domestic carbon ""price"" at a level that sends the appropriate marketplace signal to produce needed reductions. A Globally Integrated Climate Policy for Canada builds on the premise that Canada is in need of an approach that effectively integrates domestic priorities and global policy imperatives. Leading Canadian and international experts explore policy ideas and options from a range of disciplinary perspectives, including science, law, political science, economics, and sociology. Chapters explore the costs, opportunities, or imperatives to participate in international diplomatic initiatives and regimes, the opportunities and impacts of regional or global carbon markets, the proper mix of domestic policy tools, the parameters of Canadian energy policy, and the dynamics that propel or hinder the Canadian policy process. © University of Toronto Press Incorporated 2008.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966989674

At the time there was a lot of theoretical analysis and discussions on this policy instrument and in particular on its effectiveness and cost efficiency. Before the debate was over, a number of important voluntary agreements to improve energy efficiency or reduce CO2 emissions were implemented in Europe both at national and European levels. These voluntary agreements cover end-use equipment and appliances (e.g. cars, electric motors, residential appliances, etc.), industrial processes, and industrial energy management policies and practices. The paper classifies and analyses the different types of voluntary agreements aiming at improving energy efficiency in Europe, and reviews voluntary agreements and other initiatives of similar nature (voluntary programmes, unilateral commitments, self-regulation) in industrial sectors in a number of Member States of the European Union. The paper also examines some successful European initiatives of voluntary nature, including unilateral agreements for improved energy efficiency of end-use equipment, such as the European agreement on energy consumption of washing machines, and the European agreement on power consumptign in standby mode of televisions and video cassette recorders (VCRs). The paper concludes that if set up under the right institutional framework (as presented and discussed in the paper), voluntary agreements can deliver energy savings in a flexible and cost effective manner and could represent an important instrument for improving energy efficiency and climate change mitigation, in addition and co-ordination with other important policy instruments.",,"Energy conservation; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Unilateral agreements; Voluntary agreements; Energy efficiency; carbon emission; economic instrument; energy efficiency; energy policy; energy use; European Union; institutional framework; OECD; sustainable development; voluntary approach; Eurasia; Europe",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249658918

K1A 0C6, Canada","We explore the impact of agriculture, forest and cloud feedback on the surface energy budget using data obtained using a research aircraft, mesonet towers and model data. The forest has an order of magnitude larger roughness length, a lower albedo, a much smaller seasonal cycle in surface Bowen ratio (BR) and a weak mid-summer maximum of CO2 uptake compared to agricultural areas, which have much smaller BR and much higher mid-summer CO2 uptake, but a net CO2 release and much reduced evaporation in spring and fall. Higher surface temperatures and the higher albedo over agricultural land reduce Rnet near local noon in the warm season by about 50 W m-2 in comparison with the adjacent boreal forest. The annual averaged Rnet, derived from 2 years of tower data, is 14 W m-2 less over grass sites than over forest sites. A reanalysis time-series for the BOREAS southern study area shows the coupling on daily timescales between the surface energy partition, the mean boundary layer depth, the cloud field and the long-wave and short-wave radiation fields. The albedo of the cloud field, the cloud short-wave forcing at the surface, varies over the range 0.1-0.8 with decreasing surface BR, and plays a major role in the surface energy budget. We estimate that this cloud feedback may increase albedo by 0.13 and reduce Rnet by 25 W m-2 in summer over agricultural land. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Here we assess the importance of these biogeophysical effects for present-day climate, and quantify the radiative forcing of historical climate change by land use change for comparison with radiative forcings due to anthropogenic changes in greenhouse gases and aerosols. We also discuss the implications of biogeophysical effects for the use of forestry as a tool for mitigating climate change through carbon sequestration. Our model results suggest that since most historical deforestation has taken place in temperate regions where the main climatic effect is an increase in surface albedo, the dominant biogeophysical effect of past land cover change has been a cooling. The northern mid-latitude agricultural regions are simulated to be approximately 1-2 K cooler in winter and spring in comparison with their previously forested state. This conflicts with the suggestion that land use change is responsible for the warming observed over the 20th century. The increase in albedo by 1750 is simulated to exert a negative radiative forcing of approximately -2 W m-2 locally over Europe, China and India, suggesting a potential anthropogenic influence on climate before fossil fuel burning began. The present-day global mean radiative forcing by anthropogenic surface albedo change relative to the natural state is simulated to be -0.2 W m-2, which is comparable with the estimated forcings relative to pre-industrial times by stratospheric and tropospheric ozone, N2O, the halocarbons, and the direct effect of anthropogenic aerosols. In cold regions, afforestation or reforestation would decrease the surface albedo and induce a positive radiative forcing (warming) which could partly or completely offset the negative forcing (cooling) due to carbon sequestration. This suggests that carbon sink plantations could be less effective than expected at reducing warming, and could even cause further warming. However, we note that reforestation (or avoided deforestation) in tropical regions could exert a double cooling effect through carbon sequestration and increased evaporation and cloud cover. © 2006.","Biogeophysical effects; Climate change; Land use; Radiative forcing; Surface albedo","albedo; anthropogenic effect; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; climate change; climate modeling; greenhouse gas; land cover; land use change; radiative forcing; surface energy; twentieth century; Asia; China; Eurasia; Europe; Far East; India; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846454364

Although crop productivity is sustained mainly through the application of organic manure in the Indian Himalayas, little information is available on C sequestration, C content in different aggregate size fractions and soil water transmission properties (infiltration and saturated hydraulic conductivity) as affected by long-term manure addition. We analyzed results of an 8-year experiment, initiated in 1995-1996 on a silty clay loam soil, to determine the influence of fertilizer and fertilizer + farmyard manure (FYM) application on those important soil properties. The overall increase in soil organic C (SOC) content in the 0-45 cm soil depth in NPK + FYM treatment as compared to NPK and control treatments was 11.0 and 13.9 Mg C ha-1 at the end of 8 years, respectively. Application of FYM significantly reduced soil bulk density and increased mean weight diameter (MWD) and SOC contents in different aggregate size fractions. Soil organic C content in macroaggregates was greater than in microaggregates. The response of SOC content to FYM application was dependent upon inorganic fertilization and more upon balanced application of NPK than N only. Steady state infiltration rate under NPK + FYM (1.98 cm h-1) was higher than under unfertilized (0.72 cm h-1) and NPK (1.2 cm h-1). Soil water sorptivity (calculated from Philip's equation) under NPK + FYM (1.06 cm min-0.5) was higher than under NPK (0.61 cm min-0.5).

Situated just south of this restraining bend, the city is within the Western Transverse Ranges which are undergoing transpressional uplift along active thrust faults. The city has experienced and mitigated the effects of earthquakes on the San Andreas and local faults, floods, fires, droughts, landslides and debris flows. The natural resources of Los Angeles include vast oil and gas deposits and the La Brea Tar Pits, an important Pleistocene fossil locality. Urbanization over and tunneling through both abandoned and active oil and gas fields have encountered hazardous conditions. Seepage of hazardous gasses has caused explosions within the city and as a result Los Angeles established methane mitigation requirements for construction in methane hazard zones. Los Angeles has been aggressive in addressing issues of air, soil and water pollution control. A master plan for solid waste management has been implemented, regulating the siting and operation of landfills. Local sources of drinking water are inadequate to support the population. Importation of drinking water via three aqueducts has fueled the city's growth and agricultural prosperity. The practice of engineering and environmental geology has been greatly influenced by laws, practices and policies that were started in or influenced by the City of Los Angeles.

The recovery is slowest in a Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) climate, fastest in a modern climate, and intermediate between the two in a greenhouse warming (4XCO2) climate. Previously proposed mechanisms to explain thermohaline circulation stability involving altered horizontal freshwater transport in the North Atlantic are consistent with relative recovery rates in the modern and 4XCO2 climates, but fail to explain the slow LGM recovery. Instead, sea ice expansion inhibits deep-water formation after freshening in the LGM climate by reducing heat loss to the atmosphere and providing additional surface freshwater. In addition, anomalous vertical freshwater transport across ∼1 km depth after freshening is most effective at weakening the stratification in the modern case but is negligible in the LGM case.

Advanced control algorithms can supply solutions to modern exploitations. The new developments usually require accurate models (probably multivariable and non-linear ones) and control methodologies capable of using these models. As an additional requirement it is important for the final application to be easy to use, so advanced control will not mean an increase in complexity of the manipulation of the installation. This article shows an alternative to classical climate control. It is based on two fundamental elements: an accurate non-linear model and a model-based predictive control (MBPC) that incorporate energy and water consumption. Genetic algorithms (GAs) play a key role in these two elements because functions to solve are non-convex and with local minima. First of all GAs supply a way to adjust the non-linear model parameters obtained from first principles, and finally GAs open the possibility of using non-linear model in the MBPC and of establishing a flexible cost index to minimize energy and water consumption. The results on a plastic greenhouse with arch-shaped roofs and for Mediterranean area are presented, important reduction in energy and water used in the cooling system (nebulization) is obtained. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

These are given below for each of the themes discussed above. Change and methods of change analysis: • What do various earth-sciences consider change? • How do they deal with it? • What are the results of agents of change on hydrological response, and time scales of change? • What are suitable methods of change analysis/detection? • When does the delta change approach (or incremental change approach) fail? Transitional climate regimes: • How can one best use climate model results in view of the scale gap? • How does uncertainty propagate from climate to hydrological models? • How can analyses by the analogue method be combined with results from climate models? • If circulation patterns change, does this decrease/increase floods? • How can one relate changes in the mean atmospheric characteristics to changes of the extremes? Catchment processes and flow paths: • How do land use change and climate variability modify flow pathways and storage? • What are the changes in soil structure due to vegetation changes (e.g. break-down of fabric, mineralogy)? • What are the changes in the time scales, e.g. over • what time scales does soil structure change occur in response to land cover change? • What is the resilience of soil hydraulic characteristics to change? • What is the recharge for different settings and how does it change with climate/land use changes? Feedbacks: • How do floods and low flows change with time and what are the feedback mechanisms controlling them? • What feedbacks of land cover/climate impacts on water resources exist? • What are the positive and negative feedback loops? • How does the water balance affect runoff components (interactions between long and short time scales)? • What are the changes in the coupling between groundwater and surface water linked with land cover change? Heterogeneity and scaling: • What percentage of catchment area can be changed to another land cover type before a significant change in the flood regime occurs? • How do changes in the soil's hydraulic characteristics due to vegetation changes transfer to larger scales? • How can one upscale local information on soils, vegetation, groundwater and groundwater-surface water interactions to the scale of HELP basins (10 000 km2)? • What are integrative concepts of upscaling/downscaling in the context of impact analyses? • What is the relative role of climatic variability and land cover change on floods and low flows as a function of scale in different environments? Generalization and potential of typologies: • How can climate/rainfall, catchments, aquifers, soils and vegetation be classified (with a view on floods and low flows)? • What processes switch between regimes (in time, spatially)? • How to best overcome data scarcity to assess the impacts on water resources due to land cover change, and what are the low-cost options for measuring hydrological response at various scales? • What is the necessary network density required to address a management problem such as the ecological consequences in a stream after catchment area development? • What variables should be strategically collected that would more directly address impact on hydrological response?

NO2 tropospheric column retrievals of SCIAMACHY and its predecessor Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment are characterized by errors of the order of 40%. We present here a new SCIAMACHY tropospheric retrieval data set for the year 2003. The cloud free satellite observations are compared to surface measurements and simulations over western Europe performed with the regional air-quality model CHIMERE. The model has a resolution of 50 km similar to the satellite observations. For these comparisons, averaging kernels are applied to the collocated model profiles to remove the dependency of the comparison on a priori NO2 profile information used in the retrieval. The consistency of both SCIAMACHY and CHIMERE outputs over sites where surface measurements are available allows us to be confident in evaluation of the model over large areas not covered by surface observations. CHIMERE underestimates surface NO2 concentrations for urban and suburban stations which we mainly attribute to the low representativeness of point observations. No such bias is found for rural locations. The yearly average SCIAMACHY and CHIMERE spatial NO2 distributions show a high degree of quantitative agreement over rural and urban sites: a bias of 5% (relative to the retrievals) and a correlation coefficient of 0.87 (n = 2003). On a seasonal basis, biases are smaller than 20% and correlation coefficients are larger than 0.75. Spatial correlations between both the model and satellite columns and the European Monitoring and Evaluation Program (EMEP) emission inventory are high in summer (r = 0.74, n = 1779) and low in winter (r = 0.48, n = 1078), related to seasonal changes in lifetime and transport. On the other hand, CHIMERE and SCIAMACHY columns are mutually consistent in summer (r = 0.82) and in winter (r = 0.79). This shows that CHIMERE simulates the transport and chemical processes with a reasonable accuracy. The NO2 columns show a high daily variability. The daily NO2 pollution plumes observed by SCIAMACHY are often well described by CHIMERE both in extent and in location. This result demonstrates the capabilities of a satellite instrument such as SCIAMACHY to monitor the NO2 concentrations over large areas on a daily basis. It provides evidence that present and future satellite missions, in combination with CTM and surface data, will contribute to improve quantitative air quality analyses at a continental scale.

The global community has accepted its responsibility for global warming and the immediate need to reduce the anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to prevent further global warming. As a means to reduce their greenhouse footprints, many national and state governments have pinned their hopes on GHG emissions trading regimes. Such regimes, however, seek to reduce GHG emissions through differing liability rules and mechanisms. This Article analyzes these rules and mechanisms in the context of regulating the global public good of climate stability. It concludes that the network of partially overlapping GHG emissions trading regimes, often with differing rules, forms a global warming regime complex and gives rise to interregime competition and forum shopping. While beneficial to some trading entities, ultimately, these outcomes may undermine the Kyoto Protocol and climate protection. Recognizing the inherent difficulty in preventing a proliferation of competitive regimes, this Article calls for the creation of a clean development fund as a means to maximize compliance despite strategic behavior facilitated by the regime complex.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548132428

For this it needs considerable research work and good coordinated research projects between the state, industry, research laboratories and universities.","Aerospace propulsion system; Energy; Fuel cell; Hybrid system; Turbine","Combustion; Cooling; Electricity; Fuel cells; Natural resources; Propulsion; Turbines; Aerospace propulsion system; Energy; Hybrid system; Kyoto protocol; Quantum leap; Combined cycle power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249328122

The recent glacier coverage was delineated in a semi-automated way using a TM4/TM5 ratio image of a Landsat ETM Scene from the year 1999 and a merged ASTER/SRTM3-DEM. The extent of these glaciers is compared to that of the glaciers in the Soviet Glacier Inventory [UdSSR, Academica Nauk (1966 to 1983). Katalog Lednikov SSSR (in Russian), Gidrometeoizdat. Leningrad], which represents the situation in study area in approx. 1955. Regionalization of temperature and precipitation as well as solar radiation calculation was conducted in order to determine the climate situation at the glaciers. Trend and correlation analysis for the period from 1879 to 2000 at 16 climate stations showed a temperature increase, which have become pronounced since the 1950s. Another strong increase occurred at the beginning of the 1970s and since around 1980, the temperatures have generally stayed at this high level. The trend coefficient was about 0.8 K/100a for the period 1900 to 2000 and about 2.0 K/100a on average for the second half of the last century. The increase was about two times higher than the global average in northern Tien Shan from 1950 until 2000, where the increase was mainly due to temperature rise in autumn and winter. The increase is less pronounced in the mountainous areas, but still obvious. However, the higher temperature increase at the lower stations, located for the most part in cities or larger settlements, may be due in part to increased urbanization. For precipitation, there was a small increase on average, but no clear trend. On the average, the decrease in glacier extent was more than 32% between 1955 and 1999 in the investigated valleys of Zailiyskiy and Kungey Alatau. The glacier retreat was not homogeneous, but depended strongly on the size, location and climate regime at the glaciers. The area loss of the continental-type glaciers with very predominant summer accumulation, as for those situated in the deeply incised Chon-Kemin valley between Zailiyskiy and Kungey Alatau, was conspicuously less, in parts, than the loss at the more maritime glaciers on the northern slope of Zailiyskiy Alatau. This is consistent with the small increase in summer temperatures. However, under dryer conditions with high solar radiation input, such as with glaciers in the Chon-Aksu valley in Kungey Alatau, the area retreat of the continental-type glaciers can be even more pronounced than that of the more maritime glaciers. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

But is the reduction in height growth in aging trees a function of age or of size? We grafted shoot tips across different ages and sizes of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) trees to determine whether the decline in height growth is mediated by tree size or by the age of the apical meristem. We also evaluated whether reduced carbon assimilation plays an important role in height growth decline. In one experiment we cut shoot tips from old-growth, young-mature and seedling trees and grafted them onto 2-year-old graft-compatible rootstock in a seed orchard in Lebanon, Oregon. In another experiment we performed reciprocal grafts between lateral branches of old-growth trees accessible from the canopy crane at Wind River, Washington and young-mature trees in a nearby plantation. We measured growth (diameter and elongation of the dominant new stem) and mortality annually for three years in the Seed Orchard experiment and for two years in the Reciprocal Graft experiment. In the Seed Orchard experiment we also measured photosynthetic capacity (determined from the response of net carbon assimilation to the intercellular CO2 concentration of the leaf, or A/Ci curves), leaf mass per area (LMA) and carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of cellulose in 1 -year-old foliage. Grafting caused changes in both growth and physiology of the grafted stems. Within two years after grafting, growth and physiology of all combinations of scions and rootstock exhibited characteristics of the rootstock, In some cases, the change in growth was dramatic-cuttings from old-growth trees showed a 10-fold increase in stem elongation rate within 2 years of grafting onto seedling rootstock. Similarly, carbon isotope discrimination of new foliage on shoots from old-growth trees increased by nearly 3‰ and 2‰ after grafting onto young-mature and seedling rootstock, respectively, whereas discrimination decreased by a similar magnitude in scions from young-mature trees after grafting on old-growth trees. Furthermore, differences in carbon assimilation estimated from carbon isotope discrimination and A/Ci relationships were small relative to growth differences. Our results confirm that size, not age, drives developmental changes in height growth in Douglas-fir. Reduced carbon assimilation oes not play an important role in height growth decline. © 2007 Heron Publishing.","Age-related growth decline; Grafting; Hydraulic limitation; Photosynthesis; Pseudotsuga menziesii","age-related difference; aging; carbon fixation; coniferous tree; experimental study; growth modeling; height; leaf area; orchard; rootstock; seedling; Lebanon [Oregon]; North America; Oregon; United States; Wind River; Wyoming; Pseudotsuga; Pseudotsuga menziesii",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047172990

Environmental evidence from a nearby river valley (8.15 m of sediment ranging in age from about 12 000 cal. BP to the present) records local and regional environmental change. Twenty-four radiocarbon dates based on plant macrofossils provide a strong chronological framework. Calcareous microfossil assemblages (foraminifera, ostracods) have been recovered from the fine-grained sediments, recording a change from marine through to brackish and eventually freshwater conditions between about 8200 and 6500 cal. BP. A preliminary pollen study of the core has permitted a reconstruction of the regional vegetation as it responded to climatic amelioration and human influence upon the landscape. Radiocarbon dating and sedimentological evidence indicates a major hiatus between approximately 11 000 and 8000 years BP (including the period of Mesolithic occupation), represented by a 30 cm layer of coarse sands and sandstone pebbles, probably the result of a significant high-energy event dated to about 8300 cal. BP. Although not a typical tsunami deposit, the age and context suggests that this may be associated with the Storegga Slide event, already well-documented along the eastern coast of Scotland. The sedimentary and biological remains at Howick record environmental change over much of the Holocene and are compared with other environmental change records from the region to provide an environmental framework for the archaeology of this coastline. © 2007 SAGE Publications.","Coastal change; Foraminifera; Geoarchaeology; Holocene; Mesolithic; Northumberland coast; Ostracods; Pollen; Radiocarbon; Tsunami","archaeological evidence; environmental change; foraminifera; Holocene; human activity; landslide; Mesolithic; palynology; radiocarbon dating; sedimentology; tsunami; vegetation; England; Eurasia; Europe; Northumberland; Scotland; United Kingdom; Western Europe; Foraminifera; Ostracoda",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548095659

The photoelectron spectrum of SF6 - is dominated by a long progression in the S-F stretching mode, with an envelope consistent with theoretical predictions that the anion preserves the Oh symmetry of the neutral, but has a longer S-F bond length. This main progression occurs with an unexpectedly strong contribution from a second mode, however, whose characteristic energy does not correspond to any of the neutral SF6 fundamental vibrations in its ground electronic state. The resulting doublet pattern is evident when the bare ion is prepared with -low internal energy content (i.e., using N2 carrier gas in a free jet or liquid nitrogen-cooling in a flowing afterglow) but is much better resolved in the spectrum of the SF6-·Ar complex. The infrared predissociation spectrum of SF6-·Ar consists of a strong band at 683(5) cm-1, which we assign to the v3 (t1u) fundamental, the same mode that yields the strong 948 cm-1 infrared transition in neutral SF6. One qualitatively interesting aspect of the SF6- behavior is the simple structure of its photoelectron spectrum, which displays uncluttered, harmonic bands in an energy region where the neutral molecule contains about 2 eV of vibrational excitation. We explore this effect further in the c-C 4F8- anion, which also presents a system that is calculated to undergo large, symmetrical distortion upon electron attachment to the neutral. The photoelectron spectrum of this species is dominated by a long, single vibrational progression, this time involving the-symmetric ring-breathing mode. Like the SF6- case, the c-C 4F8- spectrum is remarkably isolated and harmonic in spite of the significant internal excitation of a relatively complex molecular framework. Both these perfluorinated anions thus share the property that the symmetrical deformation of the structural backbone upon photodetachment launches very harmonic motion in photoelectron bands that occur far above their respective adiabatic electron affinities. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Complex molecular framework; Photoelectron bands; Symmetrical deformation; Vibrational progression; Binding energy; Crystal symmetry; Deformation; Electron energy levels; Harmonic analysis; Spectroscopic analysis; Negative ions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847725504

The objective of this paper is to investigate whether the glass curtain walls are appropriate for the Tunisian local climate and context and if it is so, to give recommendations concerning the kind of glass to be used. A TRNSYS [Klein SA. TRNSYS a transient system simulation Program V5 14.2. Solar Energy Laboratory, University of Wisconsin Madison, July 1996] simulation was conducted on a typical administrative building. The investigation concerns only the building heating and cooling load. The building was split in five thermal zones; for each thermal zone, all the windows have the same orientation. The single zone model TYPE19 of TRNSYS [Klein, 1996] was used to model each thermal zone. An additional convection heat transfer between the different thermal zones of the building was modelled according to the Brown and Solvason law [Brown WG, Solvason KR. Natural convection through rectangular openings in partitions, Part 1: vertical partitions. Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer 1962; 5: 859-68]. This particular law was used because it has been validated in the Tunisian context by Bouden [Bouden C. Analyse du suivi thermique d'un pavillon solaire expérimental en région Tunisoise, Thèse de doctorat, Université de Paris 7, 1989]. We assume that the glass curtain wall will be implemented only on the main building facade; this is why it was simulated with different glazing sizes and glass types. The other facades remain unchanged. The results of this simulation have shown that, in relation to space heating, the glass curtain wall can be very interesting in the Tunisian context if the orientation as well as the kind of glazing are carefully selected. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

While such a spectrum is inconsistent with steep-spectrum synchrotron (α ∼ -0.7) and flat-spectrum free-free (α ∼ -0.1) emission, it is consistent with various models of electric dipole emission from thermally excited spinning dust grains, as well as models of magnetic dipole emission from ferromagnetic dust grains. Several regions in the plane, e.g., near the Cygnus arm, have spectra with even larger α. While the low signal-to-noise ratio of the 19 GHz data precludes a detailed map of the spectral index, especially off the Galactic plane, it appears that the bulk of the emission in the plane is correlated with the morphology of dust.

The present paper thus discusses a new methodology based on neural network to mix ensemble of climate model simulations. Our analysis consists of one simulation of seven Atmosphere-Ocean Global Climate Models, which participated in the IPCC Project and provided at least one simulation for the twentieth century (20c3m) and one simulation for each of three SRES scenarios: A2, A1B and B1. Our statistical method based on neural networks and Bayesian statistics computes a transfer function between models and observations. Such a transfer function was then used to project future conditions and to derive what we would call the optimal ensemble combination for twenty-first century climate change projections. Our approach is therefore based on one statement and one hypothesis. The statement is that an optimal ensemble projection should be built by giving larger weights to models, which have more skill in representing present climate conditions. The hypothesis is that our method based on neural network is actually weighting the models that way. While the statement is actually an open question, which answer may vary according to the region or climate signal under study, our results demonstrate that the neural network approach indeed allows to weighting models according to their skills. As such, our method is an improvement of existing Bayesian methods developed to mix ensembles of simulations. However, the general low skill of climate models in simulating precipitation mean climatology implies that the final projection maps (whatever the method used to compute them) may significantly change in the future as models improve. Therefore, the projection results for late twenty-first century conditions are presented as possible projections based on the ""state-of-the-art"" of present climate modeling. First, various criteria were computed making it possible to evaluate the models: skills in simulating late twentieth century precipitation over continental areas as well as their divergence in projecting climate change conditions. Despite the relatively poor skill of most of the climate models in simulating present-day large scale precipitation patterns, we identified two types of models: the climate models with moderate-to-normal (i.e., close to observations) precipitation amplitudes over the Amazonian basin; and the climate models with a low precipitation in that region and too high a precipitation on the equatorial Pacific coast. Under SRES A2 greenhouse gas forcing, the neural network simulates an increase in precipitation over the La Plata basin coherent with the mean model ensemble projection. Over the Amazonian basin, a decrease in precipitation is projected. However, the models strongly diverge, and the neural network was found to give more weight to models, which better simulate present-day climate conditions. In the southern tip of the continent, the models poorly simulate present-day climate. However, they display a fairly good convergence when simulating climate change response with a weak increase south of 45°S and a decrease in Chile between 30 and 45°S. Other scenarios (A1B and B1) strongly resemble the SRES A2 trends but with weaker amplitudes. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",,"Bayesian analysis; climate change; climate conditions; climate forcing; climate modeling; greenhouse gas; precipitation (climatology); simulation; transfer function; twenty first century",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845452718

Costs and spatial constraints of onboard SPECT might be minimized if SPECT could be accomplished using the same flat‐panel detectors (FPDs) employed for onboard transmission imaging. This may require some re‐engineering of FPDs, and it is therefore important to understand the emission imaging performance of present‐day FPDs. Here we evaluate the electronic and offset‐and‐gain (OG) noise of current FPDs relative to the quantum noise characteristic of SPECT imaging. Method and Materials: A standard SPECT collimator was placed over a FPD. A flat circular radiotracer phantom was constructed with an outer region of 18 μCi/ml and a smaller inner region of 53 μCi/ml. (Typical human dose is 1 μCi/ml.) The phantom was placed on the collimator/FPD. Large low‐frequency variations in FPD response were removed by fitting each region (no activity, low activity, high activity) of the emission image with low‐order polynomials. Noise (standard deviation) was computed within each region as a function of number of acquisition frames, enabling separate estimates of electronic, OG, and quantum noise. Results: Electronic and quantum noise were comparable at 12 times the radiotracer doses typical of human SPECT imaging. For the particular OG correction considered, OG noise exceeded quantum noise after about 8 seconds (4 frames) of acquisition. Conclusion: For the FPD considered, electronic noise is about an order of magnitude above the quantum noise that would arise from radiotracer concentrations typical of human imaging. OG noise is also significant. These conclusions should be considered in the context of other aspects of FPD design. For example, thicker scintillators could boost emission‐imaging signal, thereby alleviating requirements on noise reduction. © 2007, American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Prototaxites specimens from five localities differ from contemporaneous vascular plants by exhibiting a carbon isotopic range, within and between localities, of as much as 13‰ δ 13C. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry highlights compositional differences between Prototaxites and co-occurring plant fossils and supports interpretation of isotopic distinctions as biological rather than diagenetic in origin. Such a large isotopic range is difficult to reconcile with an autotrophic metabolism, suggesting instead that, consistent with anatomy-based interpretation as a fungus, Prototaxites was a heterotroph that lived on isotopically heterogeneous substrates. Light isotopic values of Prototaxites approximate those of vascular plants from the same localities; in contrast, heavy extremes seen in the Lower Devonian appear to reflect consumption of primary producers with carbon-concentrating mechanisms, such as cryptobiotic soil crusts, or possibly bryophytes.

The exploitation of a wide range of larval host plants should increase an herbivorous insect species' ability to track climate by increasing habitat availability. Therefore we investigated whether the performance of a species on different host plants changed towards its range boundary, and under warmer temperatures. We studied the polyphagous butterfly Polygonia c-album, which is currently expanding its range in Britain and apparently has altered its host plant preference from Humulus lupulus to include other hosts (particularly Ulmus glabra and Urtica dioica). We investigated insect performance (development time, larval growth rate, adult size, survival) and adult flight morphology on these host plants under four rearing temperatures (18-28.5 °C) in populations from core and range margin sites. In general, differences between core and margin populations were small compared with effects of rearing temperature and host plant. In terms of insect performance, host plants were generally ranked U. glabra ≥ U. dioica > H. lupulus at all temperatures. Adult P. c-album can either enter diapause or develop directly and higher temperatures resulted in more directly developing adults, but lower survival rates (particularly on the original host H. lupulus) and smaller adult size. Adult flight morphology of wild-caught individuals from range margin populations appeared to be related to increased dispersal potential relative to core populations. However, there was no difference in laboratory reared individuals, and conflicting results were obtained for different measures of flight morphology in relation to larval host plant and temperature effects, making conclusions about dispersal potential difficult. Current range expansion of P. c-album is associated with the exploitation of more widespread host plants on which performance is improved. This study demonstrates how polyphagy may enhance the ability of species to track climate change. Our findings suggest that observed differences in climate-driven range shifts of generalist vs. specialist species may increase in the future and are likely to lead to greatly altered community composition. © 2007 The Authors.

We present a spectral variability analysis of the X-ray emission of the Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxy Ark 564 using the data from a ̃100 ks XMM-Newton observation. Aims. Taking advantage of the high sensitivity of this long observation and the simple spectral shape of Ark 564, we determine accurately the spectral variability patterns in the source. Methods. We use standard cross-correlation methods to investigate the correlations between the soft and hard energy band light curves. We also generated 200 energy spectra from data stretches of 500 s duration each and fitted each one of them with a power law plus a bremsstrahlung component (for the soft excess) and we investigated the correlations between the various best fit model parameter values. Results. The ""power law plus bremsstrahlung"" model describes the spectrum well at all times. The iron line and the absorption features, which are found in the time-averaged spectrum of the source are too weak to effect the results of the time resolved spectral fits. We find that the power law and the soft excess flux are variable, on all measured time scales. The power law slope is also variable, and leads the flux variations of both the power law and the bremsstrahlung components. Conclusions. Our results can be explained in the framework of time-dependent Comptonization models. They are consistent with a picture where instabilities propagate through an extended X-ray source, affecting first the soft and then the hard photons producing regions. The soft excess could correspond to ionized disc reflection emission, in which case it responds fast to the primary continuum variations. The time scales are such that light travel times might additionally influence the observed variability structure. © ESO 2007.","Galaxies: active; Galaxies: individual: Ark 564; Galaxies: seyfert; X-rays: galaxies","Band structure; Correlation methods; Energy absorption; Parameter estimation; Spectrum analysis; X ray scattering; Galaxies: active; Galaxies: individual: Ark 564; Galaxies: seyfert; X-rays: galaxies; Galaxies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947618907

The National Report on the State of Environment in Ukraine 1999 (Ukraine Ministry of Environmental Protection [MEP], 2000) shows significant air pollution. There are numerous emissions that have been associated with developmental effects, chronic long-term health effects, and cancer. Ukraine also has been identified as a major source of transboundary air pollution for the eastern Mediterranean region. Ukraine's Environment Ministry is not currently able to strategically target high-priority emissions and lacks the resources to address all these problems. For these reasons, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency set up a partnership with Ukraine's Ministry of Environmental Protection to strengthen its capacity to set environmental priorities through the use of comparative environmental risk assessment and economic analysis - the Capacity Building Project. The project is also addressing improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of the use of its National Environmental Protection Fund. The project consists of a series of workshops with Ukrainian MEP officials in comparative risk assessment of air pollutant emissions in several heavily industrialized oblasts; cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis; and environmental finance. Pilot risk assessment analyses have been completed. At the end of the Capacity Building Project it is expected that the use of the National Environmental Protection fund and the regional level oblast environmental protection funds will begin to target and identify the highest health and environmental risk emissions.

This has led to the need for information on the main sources responsible for PM2.5. In urban locations being impacted by regional-scale transport, source-receptor relationships for PM2.5 are complex and require the application of multiple receptor-based analysis methods to gain a better understanding. This approach is being followed to study the sources of PM2.5 impacting southern Ontario, Canada, and its major city of Toronto. Existing monitoring data in the region around Toronto and within Toronto itself are utilized to estimate that 30-45% of the PM2.5 is from local sources, which implies that 55-70% is transported into the area. In addition, there are locations in the city that can be shown to experience a greater impact from local sources such as motor vehicle traffic. Detailed PM2.5 chemical characterization data were collected in Toronto in order to apply two different multivariate receptor models to determine the main sources of the PM2.5. Both approaches produced similar results, indicating that motor-vehicle-related emissions, most likely of local origin, are directly responsible for about 20% of the PM2.5. Gasoline engine vehicles were found to be a greater overall contributor (13%) compared to diesel vehicles (8%). Secondary PM2.5 from coal-fired power plants continues to be a significant contributor (20-25%) and also played a role in enhancing production of secondary organic carbon mass (15%) on fine particles. Secondary fine particle nitrate was the single most important source (35%), with a large fraction of this likely related to motor vehicle emissions. Independent use of different receptor models helps provide more confidence in the source apportionment, as does comparison of results among complementary receptor-based data analysis approaches.

Based upon the steadily growing amount of literature in this field we develop and test our own analytical model. In a large-scale household survey carried out in southeast Bangladesh, we ask almost 700 floodplain residents living without any flood protection along the River Meghna about their flood risk exposure, flood problems, flood damage, and coping mechanisms. Novel in our study is the explicit testing of the effectiveness of adaptive coping strategies to reduce flood damage costs. We show that, households with lower income and less access to productive natural assets face higher exposure to risk of flooding. Disparity in income and asset distribution at community level furthermore tends to be higher at higher risk exposure levels, implying that individually vulnerable households are also collectively more vulnerable. Regarding the identification of coping mechanisms to deal with flood events, we look at both the ex ante household level preparedness for flood events and the ex post availability of community-level support and disaster relief. We find somewhat paradoxically that the people that face the highest risk of flooding are the least well prepared, both in terms of household-level ex ante preparedness and community-level ex post flood relief. © 2007 Society for Risk Analysis.","Bangladesh; Climate change; Flood risks; Social vulnerability","Climate change; Economic and social effects; Floods; Mathematical models; Risk assessment; Environmental risk]; Flood risks; Risk exposure; Social vulnerability; Environmental engineering; coping strategy; disaster relief; environmental risk; flood; poverty; risk assessment; socioeconomic conditions; vulnerability; adaptation; adult; article; Bangladesh; climate change; controlled study; coping behavior; disaster; female; flooding; household; human; literature; lowest income group; male; normal human; poverty; risk assessment; socioeconomics; vulnerable population; Acclimatization; Adult; Bangladesh; Disaster Planning; Environment; Female; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Implosive Therapy; Male; Middle Aged; Relief Work; Risk; Risk Assessment; Social Class; Asia; Bangladesh; Eurasia; Meghna River; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248637616

Modeling tools were used to analyze and visualize the fate of nitrogen from three anthropogenic sources: septic tanks, atmospheric deposition, and fertilizer. Our results suggest that septic tanks may be a less significant contributor to surface water nitrogen pollution in the short-term whereas fertilizer used at the home scale is a more significant source than previously thought. Participation in the study was solicited from community stakeholders who were instrumental in understanding how models could be applied to local decision making, in making appropriate model assumptions, and in developing politically feasible scenarios. Stakeholders used the model results to develop recommendations for the Calvert County Board of Commissioners. Recommendations include mandating nitrogen removal septic tanks for some homes, intensive citizen education about fertilizer usage, local regulation of fertilizer sales, reduction in automobile traffic, and cooperation with regional regulatory agencies working to reduce regional NOx emissions. We explore how the participatory process can be used to influence decision-making, management policies, and citizen education in Calvert County, MD, to reduce all anthropogenic sources of nitrogen to local waters. © 2006.","Decentralized wastewater; Landscape; Nitrogen; Onsite sewage disposal systems; Residential fertilizer use; Septic systems; Spatial modeling; Stakeholders; Water Quality","Computer simulation; Regulatory compliance; Septic tanks; Waste management; Water quality; Watersheds; Decentralized wastewater; Onsite sewage disposal systems; Residential fertilizer use; Septic systems; Spatial modeling; Stakeholders; Nitrogen fertilizers; anthropogenic source; atmospheric deposition; decision making; fertilizer; local participation; modeling; nitrogen; nonpoint source pollution; pollution control; water management; water pollution; watershed; Fertilizers; Simulation; Waste Management; Calvert County; Maryland; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845809535

There is potentially great value in understanding the role of climatic uncertainty on this relationship because of the dependence of agriculture on irrigation and the scale of water consumption for irrigation. Probability distributions of crop-water production functions (CWPF-PDs) are demonstrated as being useful encapsulations of the climate-yield-irrigation relationship for decisions at various levels of time and space. Combined with reliable climate teleconnections or climate forecasts, CWPF-PDs can be a central decision support tool for questions of risk and reliability. For long planning horizons, potential climate change predicted by multiple general circulation models (GCMs) can be assessed in the context of agricultural water resources. By analysis of changes in the CWPF-PDs, conclusions regarding the efficacy and sustainability of water resources and agricultural policies can be made. A semihypothetical case study for the Lake Victoria Basin in East Africa is used to illustrate these methodologies, and potential future climate impacts as predicted by the CGCM1, ECHAM3, and HadCM2 GCMs are discussed. © 2007 ASCE.","Africa; Agriculture; Climatic changes; Crops; Irrigation; Regional planning; Water resources","Climate change; Crops; Decision support systems; Irrigation; Probability distributions; Weather forecasting; Crop-water production functions; General circulation models; Water consumption; Water resources; Climate change; Crops; Decision support systems; Irrigation; Probability distributions; Water resources; Weather forecasting; climate change; climate variation; crop yield; decision support system; irrigation; probability; regional planning; sustainability; water planning; water resource; water supply; Africa; East Africa; East African Lakes; Lake Victoria; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247213933

High turbine inlet temperatures and ineffective cooling at the trailing edge of a first-stage stator vane lead to corrosion, oxidation, and thermal fatigue. Observations of this region in engines frequently reveal burn marks, cracks, and buckling. Fundamental studies of the importance of trailing edge heat transfer to the design of an optimal cooling scheme are scarce. An experimental study of an actively cooled trailing edge configuration, in which coolant is injected through a slot, is performed. Trailing edge heat transfer and aerodynamic measurements are reported. An optimum balance between maximizing blade row aerodynamic efficiency and improving thermal protection at the trailing edge is estimated to be achieved when blowing ratios are in the range between 2.1% and 2.8%. The thermal phenomena at the trailing edge are dominated by injection slot heat transfer and flow physics.

Invasive hybrid cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora × Spartina foliosa) is an ecosystem engineer in salt marshes in San Francisco Bay, California, U.S.A. that raises intertidal elevations and may be either increasing C4 plant carbon input into food webs or tying up carbon in a form that is not usable by consumers. A manipulative experiment compared abundance, growth, and stable isotope (δ13C and δ15N) composition of the clam Macoma petalum (=M. balthica) among native marsh, hybrid Spartina, and mudflats in central San Francisco Bay. We found higher densities (individuals m-2) of M. petalum on mudflats compared to either native or hybrid Spartina (p &lt; 0.001). Macoma petalum shell growth was significantly greater in mudflats than in either vegetation type in 2002 (p = 0.005) but not 2003. Differences in shell growth between native and hybrid Spartina were not significant. Stable isotope results showed differences between habitats in δ13C but not δ15N. Carbon signatures of M. petalum placed in Spartina were much more depleted than the isotopic signature of Spartina. Neither native nor hybrid Spartina appears to be a significant carbon source for M. petalum in San Francisco Bay, and we found no evidence that hybrid Spartina contributes carbon to M. petalum beyond what is provided by S. foliosa, despite the hybrid's much greater biomass. Our results show that loss of mudflat habitat, rather than increased input of C4 carbon, is the greatest effect of the invasion of hybrid Spartina on M. petalum. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presented the impact of small ruminants on the quality of air and water in and around small ruminant houses. In total, 27 small ruminant houses from the three agro-ecological zones, lowlands, middle zone and uplands, in the Province of Yogyakarta, Indonesia, were monitored to investigate gas emissions and water pollution. Air samples were taken by using a gas catching tool filled with absorbents for gases. The gases mainly consisted of ammonia, nitrogen oxides, dihydrogen sulphide, sulphur dioxide and hydrocarbons. Groundwater samples were collected from the farmers' wells, adjacent to the small ruminants houses. The main water chemical parameters analysed were pH, turbidity, iron, fluoride, calcium carbonate, chloride, manganese, nitrate, nitrite, dihydrogen sulphide, and organic matter, while the bacterial indicators were faecal coliform and total coliform. Gas concentrations in the air were highest inside the houses, while around the houses their concentrations decreased rapidly on both the tailwind and headwind side. The concentrations of the gases were below the admissible levels assessed by the local government, except hydrocarbons in the middle zone, which was probably related to the storage of the manure inside the houses. The impact of small ruminants on water pollution was much greater than on air pollution. Some of the physico-chemical parameters showed high concentrations and nearly reached the admissible limit. The water sources had very high levels of faecal coliform bacteria and total coliform bacteria, two groups of bacteria used as indicators for water contamination caused by manure. It can be concluded that, in Central Java, management and housing of small ruminants close to the family quarters causes little environmental problems; however, attention should be paid to water quality. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Because of its location relative to the large-scale atmospheric circulation, the MLO receives mainly Eurasian air masses in the northern hemisphere (NH) winter but relatively more North American air masses in NH summer. Consistent with this seasonal footprint, our findings indicate that the MLO amplitude registers North American net carbon uptake during the warm season and Eurasian net carbon release as well as anomalies in atmospheric circulation during the cold season. From the early 1970s to the early 1990s, our analysis was consistent with that of Keeling et al. [Keeling CD, Chin JFS, Whorf TP (1996) Nature 382:146-149], suggesting that the increase in the MLO CO2 amplitude is dominated by enhanced photosynthetic drawdown in North America and enhanced respiration in Eurasia. In contrast, the recent decline in the CO2 amplitude is attributed to reductions in carbon sequestration over North America associated with severe droughts from 1998 to 2003 and changes in atmospheric circulation leading to decreased influence of Eurasian air masses. With the return of rains to the U.S. in 2004, both the normalized difference vegetation index and the MLO amplitude sharply increased, suggesting a return of the North American carbon sink to more normal levels. These findings indicate that atmospheric CO 2 measurements at remote sites can continue to play an important role in documenting changes in land carbon flux, including those related to widespread drought, which may continue to worsen as a result of global warming. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Atmospheric circulation; Atmospheric CO2 seasonal cycle; Continental droughts; Terrestrial carbon sinks","carbon dioxide; carbon; carbon dioxide; air monitoring; article; Asia; breathing; carbon cycle; drought; Europe; greenhouse effect; North America; photosynthate; priority journal; seasonal variation; source sink relationship; United States; vegetation; winter; atmosphere; climate; cold; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; heat; metabolism; photosynthesis; season; temperature; time; weather; Atmosphere; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Cold; Ecosystem; Greenhouse Effect; Hawaii; Heat; Photosynthesis; Seasons; Temperature; Time Factors; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248371274

It was found that nitrite, nitrate, and acetate surface complexes occurred under reaction conditions. Considerable amounts of hydrogen were formed in the interaction of NO + C3H8 + O2 or C3H8 + O2 reaction mixtures with the catalyst surface. The rates of conversion of the surface complexes detected under reaction conditions were measured. The resulting values were compared to the rate of the process. It was found that, at temperatures lower than 200°C, nitrate complexes reacted with the hydrocarbon to form acetate complexes; in this case, the formation of reaction products was not observed. In the temperature region above 250°C, two reaction paths took place. One of them consisted in the interaction of acetate and nitrate complexes with the formation of reaction products. The decomposition of NO on the reduced surface occurred in the second reaction path.

Threatening processes were categorised and their contributions to past, present and future declines were assessed. The information was cross-referenced against State agency information and field knowledge. Land clearance for agriculture (grazing and cropping) and urbanization have been the primary causes of range contractions and habitat loss in the past, responsible for the current status of the majority of threatened Australian plants. In the future, land clearance will remain important but new issues are emerging. Many species are now at risk from demographic and environmental uncertainty alone. Threats growing in importance include disease, salinity, invasive species and changed disturbance regimes. Many species are subject to common, landscape-level threats. A key issue to emerge from our analysis is that most species are threatened by a number of interacting factors - threat syndromes. Several future risks may be mitigated effectively by simple, low-cost changes in policy, such as more stringent controls on land clearance, strategic fire management, and firmer control on the importation of plant species. Other factors will require greater effort and new strategies to mitigate, including social and legal initiatives in urban landscapes and broad strategies for pathogens, climate change and other landscape-level processes.

The Grosmont Formation carbonates have been subject to various stages of diagenesis, including dolomitization and karstification with a profound effect on the distribution of porosity and permeability, which resulted in highly heterogeneous reservoirs. In addition, low effective permeabilities because of high bitumen saturation, the high viscosity of the heavily biodegraded bitumen, and the continuity and integrity of shales capping bitumen-bearing reservoir facies are further factors that must be considered in applying future in-situ recovery schemes to the Grosmont carbonate bitumen deposit. © 2007 International Association for Mathematical Geology.","Bitumen; Grosmont carbonate; Regional diagenetic; Stratigraphic model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548209638

The primary NAAQS are health-based standards; therefore, an exceedance implies that it is likely that there will be adverse health effects for the public. Prior to and since the inclusion of PM 10 and PM 2.5 into the EPA's regulation guidelines, numerous journal articles and technical references have been written to discuss the epidemiological effects, trends, regulations, methods of determining PM 10 and PM 2.5, etc. A common trend among many of these publications is the use of samplers to collect information on PM 10 and PM 2.5. Often, the sampler data are assumed to be an accurate measure of PM 10 and PM 2.5. The fact is that issues such as sampler uncertainties, environmental conditions, and characteristics of the material that the sampler is measuring must be incorporated for accurate sampler measurements. The purpose of this article is to provide the background and theory associated with particle size distribution (PSD) characteristics of the material in the air that is being sampled, sampler performance characteristics, the interaction between these two characteristics, and the effect of this interaction on the regulatory process. The results show that if the mass median diameter (MMD) of the PM to which the sampler is exposed is smaller than the cutpoint of the sampler, then under-sampling occurs. If the MMD of the PM is greater than the cutpoint of the sampler, then over-sampling occurs. The information presented in this article will be utilized in a series of articles dealing with the errors associated with particulate matter measurements.","Air; Air pollution; Environmental impact; Legislation; Mathematical models; Particle size distribution; PM; PM 10; Pollution; Sampler performance; Samplers; Sampling","Concentration limits; Mass median diameter (MMD); Sampler performance; Samplers; Environmental impact; Health care; Laws and legislation; Mathematical models; Particle size analysis; Particulate emissions; Air quality; air quality; air sampling; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; numerical model; particle size; particulate matter; performance assessment; pollution monitoring; sampler; size distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947723005

Diagnostic analyses indicate that altered momentum fluxes from midlatitude eddy activity caused by changes in orbital forcing (in the Holocene) and topographic forcing (at the LGM) regulate the strength of climatological easterlies and therefore affect both the tropical mean state and the characteristics of interannual variability.

If true, terrestrial plants could rival wetlands as being the largest global source of methane forcing us to rethink the methane budget. While further measurements are needed to confirm the methane release rates from this source and their dependencies, in this work we use the preliminary measurements to assess the potential impact of the methane release from this source globally. Using novel techniques we extrapolate the initially reported chamber measurements to the global scale and calculate the global methane emissions from the terrestrial plant community to be in the range 20 to 69 Tg CH4 y-1. The spread in emissions is largely due to the sensitivity of the global flux to the prescribed temperature dependence of the plant emission rate, which is largely unknown. The spread of calculated emissions is in good agreement with the upper limit imposed on the source during the late pre-industrial period, which we estimate to range from 25 to 54 Tg CH4 y-1 during the years 0 to 1700 A.D. using the published atmospheric δ13CH4 record. In addition, if we assume that plant emissions have been constant at the mean value of 45 Tg CH4 y-1, we find that the methane release from wildfires and biomass burning during the pre-industrial span 0-1000 A.D. must be near 12 Tg CH4 y-1, which would be in better agreement with previous estimates of the pyrogenic source during this time than a methane budget missing the plant source. We conclude that methane release from the terrestrial plant community as presently understood does not require major innovations to the global methane budget. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Air pollution; Extrapolation; Methane; Plants (botany); Methane budget; Plant emission rate; Particulate emissions; methane; pyrogen; Air pollution; Extrapolation; Methane; Particulate emissions; Plants (botany); carbon budget; carbon emission; methane; plant community; source-sink dynamics; air pollution control; article; soil pollution; temperature dependence; Air Pollutants; Biomass; Methane; Models, Biological; Plant Leaves; Plants; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250160901

Federal farm policies may enhance or limit the usefulness of this climate information. A representative peanut-cotton-corn non-irrigated North Florida farm was used to estimate the value of the ENSO-based climate information and examine impacts of farm programs under uncertain conditions of climate, prices, and risk aversion levels. Yields from crop model simulations and historical series of prices were used to generate stochastic distributions that were fed into a whole farm model, first, to optimize crop selection and planting dates, and then, to simulate uncertain outcomes under risk aversion, with and without the use of climate information, and with and without the inclusion of farm programs. Results suggest that seasonal climate forecasts have higher value for more risk averse farmers when La Niña or El Niño ENSO phases are forecast. Highly risk averse farmers could benefit from the forecast by taking advantage of potential favorable conditions (offensive responses). The inclusion of Commodity Loan Programs (CLP) and Crop Insurance Programs (CIP) decreased the overall value of the forecast information even to negative levels. However, more risk averse farmers could still benefit moderately from El Niño and marginally from La Niña forecasts when they participate in CLP and CIP. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In spite of striking improvements in internal combustion engine technology, air pollution in most urban areas is still measured at levels determined to be harmful to human health. Throughout the 1990s and beyond, California and France both chose to improve air quality by means of technological innovation, adopting legislation that promoted clean vehicles, prominently among them, electric vehicles (EVs). In California, policymakers chose a technology-forcing approach, setting ambitious goals (e.g., zero emission vehicles), establishing strict deadlines and issuing penalties for non-compliance. The policy process in California called for substantial participation from the public, the media, the academic community and the interest groups affected by the regulation. The automobile and oil industries bitterly contested the regulation, in public and in the courts. In contrast, in France the policy process was non-adversarial, with minimal public participation and negligible debate in academic circles. We argue that California's stringent regulation spurred the development of innovative hybrid and fuel cell vehicles more effectively than the French approach. However, in spite of the differences, both California and France have been unable to put a substantial number of EVs on the road. Our comparison offers some broad lessons about how policy developments within a culture influence both the development of technology and the impact of humans on the environment. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLP 2007.","Air pollution; Electric and hybrid vehicles; Environmental policy; Policy styles; Sustainable transport; Technology policy","atmospheric pollution; environmental policy; innovation; sustainability; technology policy; transport vehicle; urban pollution; California; Eurasia; Europe; France; North America; United States; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247193102

Optimum sized plants can be built when biomass resources are sufficient to meet feedstock demand; examples include wood and forest harvest residues from extensive forests, and grain straw and corn stover from large agricultural regions. The impact of feedstock cost on technology selection is evaluated by comparing the cost of power from the gasification and direct combustion of boreal forest wood chips. Optimum size is a function of plant cost and the distance variable cost (DVC, $ dry tonne-1 km-1) of the biomass fuel; distance fixed costs (DFC, $ dry tonne-1) such as acquisition, harvesting, loading and unloading do not impact optimum size. At low values of DVC and DFC, as occur with wood chips sourced from the boreal forest, direct combustion has a lower power cost than gasification. At higher values of DVC and DFC, gasification has a lower power cost than direct combustion. This crossover in most economic technology will always arise when a more efficient technology with a higher capital cost per unit of output is compared to a less efficient technology with a lower capital cost per unit of output. In such cases technology selection cannot be separated from an analysis of feedstock cost. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It is also highly inequitable, as the greatest risks are to the poorest populations, who have contributed least to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The rapid economic development and the concurrent urbanization of poorer countries mean that developing-country cities will be both vulnerable to health hazards from climate change and, simultaneously, an increasing contributor to the problem. We review the specific health vulnerabilities of urban populations in developing countries and highlight the range of large direct health effects of energy policies that are concentrated in urban areas. Common vulnerability factors include coastal location, exposure to the urban heat-island effect, high levels of outdoor and indoor air pollution, high population density, and poor sanitation. There are clear opportunities for simultaneously improving health and cutting GHG emissions most obviously through policies related to transport systems, urban planning, building regulations and household energy supply. These influence some of the largest current global health burdens, including approximately 800,000 annual deaths from ambient urban air pollution, 1.2 million from road-traffic accidents, 1.9 million from physical inactivity, and 1.5 million per year from indoor air pollution. GHG emissions and health protection in developing-country cities are likely to become increasingly prominent in policy development. There is a need for a more active input from the health sector to ensure that development and health policies contribute to a preventive approach to local and global environmental sustainability, urban population health, and health equity. © 2007 The New York Academy of Medicine.","Cities; Climate change; Energy; Equity; Health; Transport","air pollution; ambient air; building; city planning; climate change; developing country; economic development; energy resource; environmental health; environmental temperature; global climate; government; greenhouse gas; health care organization; health care policy; health hazard; household; human; immobilization; indoor air pollution; policy; population density; poverty; priority journal; review; sanitation; seashore; traffic accident; urban population; urbanization; Developing Countries; Environmental Health; Greenhouse Effect; Hazardous Substances; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Urban Population",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249053877

Our results indicate that consideration of climate change produces second-order modifications to ocean chemistry predictions made with constant climate; these modifications occur primarily as a result of changes in sea surface temperature, and climate-induced changes in dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations. Under a CO2 emission scenario derived from the WRE1000 CO2 stabilization concentration pathway and a constant climate, we predict a 0.47 unit reduction in surface ocean pH relative to a pre-industrial value of 8.17, and a reduction in the degree of saturation with respect to aragonite from a pre-industrial value of 3.34 to 1.39 by year 2500. With the same CO2 emissions but the consideration of climate change under a climate sensitivity of 2.5°C the reduction in projected global mean surface pH is about 0.48 and the saturation state of aragonite decreases to 1.50. With a climate sensitivity of 4.5°C, these values are 0.51 and 1.62, respectively. Our study therefore suggests that future changes in ocean acidification caused by emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere are largely independent of the amounts of climate change.

Air quality is a field of major concern in large cities. This problem has led administrations to introduce plans and regulations to reduce pollutant emissions. The analysis of variations in the concentration of pollutants is useful when evaluating the effectiveness of these plans. However, such an analysis cannot be undertaken using standard statistical techniques, due to the fact that concentrations of atmospheric pollutants often exhibit a lack of normality and are autocorrelated. On the other hand, if long-term trends of any pollutant's emissions are to be detected, meteorological effects must be removed from the time series analysed, due to their strong masking effects. Materials and Methods. The application of statistical methods to analyse temporal variations is illustrated using monthly carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations observed at an urban site. The sampling site is located at a street intersection in central Valencia (Spain) with a high traffic density. Valencia is the third largest city in Spain. It is a typical Mediterranean city in terms of its urban structure and climatology. The sampling site started operation in January 1994 and monitored CO ground level concentrations until February 2002. Its geographic coordinates are W0°22'52'' N39°28'05'' and its altitude is 11 m. Two nonparametric trend tests are applied. One of these is robust against serial correlation with regards to the false rejection rate, when observations have a strong persistence or when the sample size per month is small. A nonparametric analysis of the homogeneity of trends between seasons is also discussed. A multiple linear regression model is used with the transformed data, including the effect of meteorological variables. The method of generalized least squares is applied to estimate the model parameters to take into account the serial dependence of the residuals of this model. This study also assesses temporal changes using the Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (KZ) filter. The KZ filter has been shown to be an effective way to remove the influence of meteorological conditions on O3 and PM to examine underlying trends. Results. The nonparametric tests indicate a decreasing, significant trend in the sampled site. The application of the linear model yields a significant decrease every twelve months of 15.8% for the average monthly CO concentration. The 95% confidence interval for the trend ranges from 13.9% to 17.7%. The seasonal cycle also provides significant results. There are no differences in trends throughout the months. The percentage of CO variance explained by the linear model is 90.3%. The KZ filter separates out long, short-term and seasonal variations in the CO series. The estimated, significant, long-term trend every year results in 10.3% with this method. The 95% confidence interval ranges from 8.8% to 11.9%. This approach explains 89.9% of the CO temporal variations. Discussion. The differences between the linear model and KZ filter trend estimations are due to the fact that the KZ filter performs the analysis on the smoothed data rather than the original data. In the KZ filter trend estimation, the effect of meteorological conditions has been removed. The CO short-term component is attributable to weather and short-term fluctuations in emissions. There is a significant seasonal cycle. This component is a result of changes in the traffic, the yearly meteorological cycle and the interactions between these two factors. There are peaks during the autumn and winter months, which have more traffic density in the sampled site. There is a minimum during the month of August, reflecting the very low level of vehicle emissions which is a direct consequence of the holiday period. Conclusions. The significant, decreasing trend implies to a certain extent that the urban environment in the area is improving. This trend results from changes in overall emissions, pollutant transport, climate, policy and economics. It is also due to the effect of introducing reformulated gasoline. The additives enable vehicles to burn fuel with a higher air/fuel ratio, thereby lowering the emission of CO. The KZ filter has been the most effective method to separate the CO series components and to obtain an estimate of the long-term trend due to changes in emissions, removing the effect of meteorological conditions. Recommendations and Perspectives. Air quality managers and policy-makers must understand the link between climate and pollutants to select optimal pollutant reduction strategies and avoid exceeding emission directives. This paper analyses eight years of ambient CO data at a site with a high traffic density, and provides results that are useful for decision-making. The assessment of long-term changes in air pollutants to evaluate reduction strategies has to be done while taking into account meteorological variability. © 2007 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).","Atmospheric pollution; Carbon monoxide (CO), seasonal cycle; KZ filter; Linear model; Nonparametric trend test; Urban air quality","air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; concentration (composition); decision making; emission; estimation method; filter; meteorology; numerical model; seasonal variation; temporal variation; traffic emission; urban area; Comunidad Valencia; Eurasia; Europe; Southern Europe; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248327538

Efforts to reduce emissions of GHGs, such as carbon dioxide, in a decentralized way or even in a few countries (such as the United States or under the Kyoto Protocol) without equivalent actions by all the other countries of the world, particularly the most rapidly growing ones, cannot realistically achieve the temperature change limits most emission control advocates believe are necessary to avoid dangerous climatic changes, and would be unlikely to do so even with the cooperation of these other countries. This Article concludes that the most effective and efficient solution would be to use a concept long proven by nature to reduce the radiation reaching the earth by adding particles optimized for this purpose to the stratosphere to scatter a small portion of the incoming sunlight back into space, as well as to undertake a new effort to better understand and reduce ocean acidification. Current temperature change goals could be quickly achieved by stratospheric scattering at a very modest cost without the need for costly adaptation, human lifestyle changes, or the general public's active cooperation, all required by rigorous emission controls. Although stratospheric scattering would not reduce ocean acidification, for which several remedies are explored in this Article, it appears to be the most effective and efficient first step toward global climate change control. Stratospheric scattering is not currently being pursued or even developed, however; such development is particularly needed to verify the lack of significant adverse environmental effects of this remedy. Reducing GHG emissions to the extent proposed by advocates, even if achievable, would cost many trillions of dollars, and is best viewed as a last resort rather than the preferred strategy.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548106210

Many field studies have found that elevated CO2 leads to higher carbon assimilation by plants, and others suggest that this can lead to higher carbon storage in soils, the largest and most stable terrestrial carbon pool. Here we show that 6 years of experimental CO2 doubling reduced soil carbon in a scrub-oak ecosystem despite higher plant growth, offsetting ≈52% of the additional carbon that had accumulated at elevated CO2 in aboveground and coarse root biomass. The decline in soil carbon was driven by changes in soil microbial composition and activity. Soils exposed to elevated CO2 had higher relative abundances of fungi and higher activities of a soil carbon-degrading enzyme, which led to more rapid rates of soil organic matter degradation than soils exposed to ambient CO2. The isotopic composition of microbial fatty acids confirmed that elevated CO2 increased microbial utilization of soil organic matter. These results show how elevated CO2, by altering soil microbial communities, can cause a potential carbon sink to become a carbon source. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Carbon cycling; Global change; Microbes; Priming effect","carbon dioxide; fatty acid; soil organic matter; carbon; article; biomass; carbon source; carbon storage; ecosystem; enzyme activity; greenhouse effect; lipid composition; oak; plant growth; plant root; priority journal; scrub; soil microflora; source sink relationship; bacterial phenomena and functions; fungus; metabolism; microbiology; physiology; soil; time; Embryophyta; Fungi; Bacterial Physiology; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Fungi; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247595902

A polarizable continuum model is used to represent acetonitrile solvent for the reaction. Starting from a photochemically generated radical ion pair state, the mechanism of reduction is deduced to be one in which the CO2 - begins to use one of its oxygens to abstract a hydrogen from an α carbon of the amine radical cation. During this event, and before the transition state for H transfer is reached, the system encounters a surface crossing, which provides pathways for unproductive back electron transfer and for productive reduction, with the latter involving attachment of the hydrogen to the carbon of CO2. The result of the reduction is a closed-shell iminium formate ion pair, which completes the reaction by proton transfer between the ions, to give an eneamine and formic acid. On the basis of the calculations, approaches for improving the efficiency of the reduction and increasing the wavelength of the light used to drive the reaction are discussed. One of these modifications involves the use of a bicyclic amine as reductant. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Amine radical cation; Ion pair state; Polarizable continuum models; Acetonitrile; Amines; Computational methods; Continuum mechanics; Organic solvents; Proton transfer; Reduction; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249812104

Four (3rd order?) Lower and Middle Oxfordian cycles were identified (S1, S2, S3, and S4) in the Eastern Paris Basin. These four cycles can be organised into two lower frequency cycles (So I and So II) which comprise the S1, S2 and the S3, S4 cycles respectively. During the time intervals of the S1, S2, and S3 cycles, sedimentation occurred along a southward dipping carbonate-siliciclastic ramp, prograding from the northern Ardennes area. The S4 cycle shows the development of a reefal distally steepened ramp which subsequently evolved into a flat-topped platform as a result of the compensation infill of the available accommodation space by the carbonate production during a climatic warming, in this case reef growth. Isopach and facies maps suggest synsedimentary activities of hercynian faults coevals with the floodings of the So I and So II cycles. One of these events generated a diachronism of the maximum flooding (Plicatilis Zone) during the So II cycle between the northwestern and southeastern parts of the studied area. The depositional patterns found in the Eastern Paris Basin and the Swiss Jura show great similarities for the Early-Middle Oxfordian. Both regions were probably connected and recorded the same tectonosedimentary evolution.

Metalworking activities have been present in the area since ancient times and several mining centres have been active in the region since the Etruscan period. Two of the more notable mining locations are the island of Elba and the towns of Populonia and Massa Marittima. In order to reconstruct the development of metallurgical techniques in the past, a multi-disciplinary approach is required, involving both archaeological study and archaeometric analysis of the sites of interest. One of the most complex problems is establishing the chronological history of metallurgical exploitation in ancient sites: archaeological remains are sometimes incomplete and the stratigraphy of archaeological horizons might have been deeply altered. Thus, direct dating of metallurgical slags and other remains of mining and metalworking activities using radiocarbon measurements is particularly useful for developing site chronologies. Charcoal samples from a recent excavation in Populonia were dated by AMS radiocarbon in order to reconstruct the chronological evolution of ancient metallurgical production; results reported here are consistent with archaeological observations. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to delaying securing the epidural catheter, it may loosen the adhesive catheter dressing. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether skin infiltration with epinephrine-containing rather than plain lidocaine reduces superficial bleeding after catheter placement. Secondary objectives were to determine whether adding epinephrine and/or sodium bicarbonate affected infiltration pain. Methods: After institutional review board approval and informed consent, 80 healthy women receiving epidural analgesia during labor were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to four local anesthetic mixtures (n = 20 in each group): group L: lidocaine 1.5%, group LB: lidocaine 1.5% with 8.4% sodium bicarbonate, group LE: lidocaine 1.5% with epinephrine 1:200 000, and group LEB: lidocaine 1.5% with epinephrine 1:200 000 and 8.4% sodium bicarbonate. Clinical endpoints included the amount of superficial bleeding at the catheter site, pain during local anesthetic infiltration and epidural catheter movement during labor. Results: Demographic data were similar among the groups. The addition of epinephrine to lidocaine significantly reduced superficial bleeding. Solutions containing epinephrine were well tolerated and caused no cardiovascular disturbances. The addition of epinephrine did not increase pain, while bicarbonate reduced it [verbal score (scale 0-10) 3.6 ± 2.2 vs. 2.6 ± 1.8; P = 0.04]. There were no differences in epidural catheter movement among the groups; no catheters became displaced during labor. Conclusion: Local infiltration of epinephrine-containing lidocaine before epidural catheter insertion reduces superficial bleeding and the addition of bicarbonate decreases pain during skin infiltration. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Also studied was the effect on the anoxic maximum specific growth rate. Two pure bacteria cultures were used, Paracoccus pantotrophus, denitrifying bacteria containing a periplasmic nitrate reductase (Nap), and Pseudomonas denitrificans, denitrifying bacteria lacking the periplasmic nitrate reductase. The anoxic maximum specific growth rate of both cultures following a period of aerobic growth with identical dilution up to steady-state was indeed affected by the oxidation state of the carbon, with the most oxidized substrate yielding the highest anoxic maximum specific growth rate. The diauxic lags for Paracoccus pantotrophus were considerably shorter than those for Pseudomonas denitrificans, something expected due to the presence of Nap, an enzyme not affected by aerobiosis. Since the activity of Nap in Paracoccus pantotrophus under aerobic conditions has been shown to increase with the extent of reduction of the carbon substrate, it was also expected that the diauxic lag length for these bacteria would decrease as the reduction state of the carbon substrate increased. This could not be demonstrated, as no significant lags were observed for this species. Pseudomonas denitrificans exhibited a shorter diauxic lag with the more oxidized carbon source.

An important factor regarding forests and carbon is simply maintaining the amount of land that is retained in forest cover. Since 1973, Oregon's statewide land-use planning program has sought to maintain forest and agricultural lands in the face of increasing development by maintaining forest and agricultural zones and to limit growth to within urban growth boundaries. We combine projections of forest and agricultural land development with estimates of average carbon stocks for different land uses to examine what effect land-use planning has had in maintaining forest carbon in western Oregon. In addition to other benefits arising from the conservation of forestland, results indicate that Oregon's land-use planning system in western Oregon yields significant gains in carbon storage equivalent to a reduction of 1.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per year.

Concentrations of PAHs, PCBs, DDT, and seven trace metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, Zn) were correlated strongly with urbanization, with the strongest relations to percentage commercial, industrial, and transportation (CIT) land use. Average PAH and metal concentrations in the most urbanized watersheds were approximately 30 and 6 times the reference concentrations, respectively, in remote, undeveloped watersheds. One-quarter to one-half of sampling sites had concentrations of PAHs, Cu, Pb, or Zn above the probable effects concentration, a set of sediment quality guidelines for adverse effects to aquatic biota, and sediments were predicted to be toxic, on average, when CIT land use exceeded about 10%. Trends in metals in cores from urban watersheds were dominantly downward, whereas trends in PAHs in a suburban watershed were upward. A regional atmospheric-fallout gradient was indicated by as much as order-of-magnitude-greater concentrations and accumulation rates of contaminants in cores from an undeveloped reference lake in Boston compared to those from remote reference watersheds. Contaminant accumulation rates in the lakes with urbanization in their watersheds, however, were 1-3 orders of magnitude greater than those of reference lakes, which indicate the dominance of local sources and fluvial transport of contaminants to urban lakes. These analyses demonstrate the magnitude of urban contamination of aquatic systems and air sheds, and suggest that, despite reductions in contaminant emissions in urban settings, streams and lakes will decline in quality as urbanization of their watersheds takes place. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

K7L 3N6, Canada","To date, the ethanol production industry in Canada is comprised mainly of small-scale plants producing ethanol primarily from agricultural crops as feedstocks. Research interests in the area of bio-ethanol production from organic waste materials emerged in the late 1980s. Significant advances in lignocellulosic material extraction and enzymatic hydrolysis have been reported in the last decade, however, continued research efforts are critical for the development of technically feasible and economically viable large-scale enzyme-based biomass-to-ethanol conversion processes which employ organic waste materials as alternative sources of feedstocks. The source of the lignocellulosic material, waste management practices and delignification procedures have a significant impact on the quantity and quality of delignified materials derived from these lignocellulosic feedstocks. The success of cellulose-to-ethanol conversion from lignocellulosic material feedstocks is generally a function of fibre pre-treatment, enzyme selection and operating conditions. These will differ depending on the source of the biomass feedstock. This paper illustrates the potential that Canada has to utilize its residual or waste biomass resources to provide a renewable and sustainable supply of bio-ethanol to help meet Canada's future energy needs. Canada could produce 5336 million L of bio-ethanol annually based on the recoverable fraction of crop residues generated in 2001. Based on bio-ethanol feasibility studies conducted on livestock manures and municipal biosolids and sludges, an estimated 6.22 Mt/year of sugar could be produced from this waste biomass for subsequent fermentation to bio-ethanol. The long-term benefits of using waste residues as lignocellulosic feedstocks will be to introduce a sustainable solid waste management strategy for a number of lignocellulosic waste materials; contribute to the mitigation in greenhouse gases through sustained carbon and nutrient recycling; reduce the potential for water, air, and soil contamination associated with the land application of organic waste materials; and to broaden the feedstock source of raw materials for the bio-ethanol production industry. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

(2) A sharp rise of temperature resulted in the increase of evaporation and the decrease of discharge, which has a greater effect than on ice-snow melting. (3) Frozen ground tends to be degraded markedly. There is a significant positive correlation between the permafrost thickness and the discharge. (4) Evaporation rates are significantly increasing, leading to the decrease of discharge. 70% of the discharge reduction resulted from climate change, and the remaining 30% may have been caused by human activities. © Science in China Press 2007.","Climate change; Frozen ground; Surface water resources; The source region of the Yellow River",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247595021

The approach adopts the Eulerian large eddy simulation of turbulent flow and the Lagrangian particle trajectory tracking to solve the continuous airflow phase and the discrete particle phase, respectively. Model verification, including sensitivity tests of grid resolution and particle numbers, is conducted by comparison with the full-size experiments conducted previously. Good agreement with the measured mass concentrations is found. Numerical scenario simulations of the effect of ventilation patterns on PM removal are performed by using three common ventilation patterns (piston displacement, mixing, and cross-flow displacement ventilation) with a measured indoor PM10 profile in the Taipei metropolis as the initial condition. The temporal variations of suspended PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 mass concentrations and particle removal mechanisms are discussed. The simulated results show that for all the of the three ventilation patterns, PM2.5 and PM1 are much more difficult to remove than PM10. From the purpose of health protection for indoor occupants, it is not enough to only use the PM10 level as the indoor PM index. Indoor PM2.5 and PM1 levels should be also considered. Cross-flow displacement ventilation is more effective to remove all PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 than the other ventilation patterns. Displacement ventilation would result in more escaped particles and less deposited particles than mixing ventilation. © 2007 Air &amp; Waste Management Association.",,"air conditioning; air pollutant; algorithm; article; indoor air pollution; particle size; statistical model; air analysis; air conditioning; airflow; ambient air; mathematical analysis; particulate matter; priority journal; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Air Pollution, Indoor; Algorithms; Models, Statistical; Particle Size; Ventilation; Flow patterns; Large eddy simulation; Particle size; Transport properties; Turbulent flow; Ventilation; Airflow phases; Flow displacement ventilation; Ventilation patterns; Particles (particulate matter)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947725847

To investigate the potential public health and economic impact of ambient air pollution under various low-carbon energy scenarios in Shanghai, we estimated the exposure level of Shanghai residents to air pollution under various planned scenarios, and assessed the public health impact using concentration-response functions derived from available epidemiologic studies. We then estimated the corresponding economic values of the health effects based on unit values for each health outcome. Our results show that ambient air pollution in relation to low-carbon energy scenarios could have a significant impact on the future health status of Shanghai residents, both in physical and monetary terms. Compared with the base case scenario, implementation of various low-carbon energy scenarios could prevent 2804-8249 and 9870-23,100 PM10-related avoidable deaths (mid-value) in 2010 and 2020, respectively. It could also decrease incidence of several relevant diseases.

These findings illustrate that a low-carbon energy policy will not only decrease the emission of greenhouse gases, but also play an active role in the reduction of air pollutant emissions, improvement of air quality, and promotion of public health.

In order to develop effective strategies for vehicle emission controls, it is necessary to develop a microscopic simulation platform for estimating vehicle emissions that can capture the vehicles' instantaneous modal activities. This article is intended to develop an integrated microscopic traffic-emission simulation platform by using the microscopic traffic simulation model VISSIM and the modal emission model CMEM. A sub-network selected from the Haidian district of Beijing is used to build a traffic simulation network, whose traffic and emission conditions are subsequently evaluated. This article first analyzes the relationship between the instantaneous emission/fuel consumption rate and the instantaneous speed/acceleration. Then, it analyzes and calculates the emissions for a variety of vehicle types in the network. Finally, it evaluates the impact of two alternative traffic control and management strategies using the developed platform. © 2007 China Association for Science and Technology.","CMEM (Comprehensive Modal Emission Model); emission estimation; microscopic traffic simulation; traffic control; VISSIM","Computer simulation; Emission control; Fuel consumption; Mathematical models; Strategic planning; Comprehensive Modal Emission Model; Emission estimation; Microscopic traffic simulation; Street traffic control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250750711

The global climate change issue is becoming more and more important and hence to be the fourth challenge for China's future energy development, following energy supply shortages, energy security, and local environmental protection. This paper used three MARKAL (MARKet ALlocation) family models, that is, MARKAL, MARKAL-ED (MARKAL with elastic demand), and MARKAL-MACRO, to study China energy system's carbon mitigation strategies and corresponding impacts on the economy. The models' structures and the economic feedback formulations used in MARKAL-MACRO and MARKAL-ED are briefly described. The endogenous demands in MARKAL-MACRO and MARKAL-ED enable them to partly satisfy carbon abatement constraints via energy service demand reductions, and the reduction levels for the 30 demand sectors from these two kinds of models for given carbon emission constraints are presented and compared. The impact of carbon mitigation on social welfare from MARKAL and MARKAL-ED, and on GDP, investment and consumption from MARKAL-MACRO are evaluated. The changes in both final and primary energy mix, changes in technology development, as well as marginal abatement costs for given carbon constraints from the three models, are analyzed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The PL intensities of the Sb-treated samples were improved by around two times and the line width of the emission spectrum was reduced from 263.6 to 67 meV as well, while maintaining the peak at 1265 nm. The surfactant effects of Sb were verified by photoluminescence, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) and high-resolution X-ray diffraction. The SPM measurement indicated that the surface condition was improved by Sb surfactant, and the surface roughness was reduced from 0.495 to 0.397 nm. In addition, the commonly observed localized effects of the InGaAsN QWs were also suppressed by Sb surfactant. Therefore, applying TMSb before the growth of InGaAsN could recover the degraded optical properties caused by nitrogen incorporation, and shows the potential to grow high-quality InGaAsN by MOVPE. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A statistical downscaling method was used to downscale five general circulation model (GCM) scenarios to selected weather stations. Downscaled GCM scenarios were used to compare respective characteristics of the weather groups developed in Part I; discriminant function analysis was used to allocate future days from two windows of time (2040-2059 and 2070-2089) into one of four weather groups. In Part I, the four weather groups were characterised as hot, cold, air pollution-related, and other (defined as relatively good air quality and comfortable weather conditions). In estimating future daily air pollution concentrations, three future pollutant emission scenarios were considered: Scenario I - emissions decreasing 20% by 2050, Scenario II - future emissions remaining at the same level as at the end of the twentieth century, and Scenario III - emissions increasing 20% by 2050. The results showed that, due to increased temperatures, the average annual number of days with high O3 levels in the four selected cities could increase by more than 40-100% by the 2050s and 70-200% by the 2080s (from the current areal average of 8 days) under the three pollutant emission scenarios. The corresponding number of low O3 days could decrease by 4-10% and 5-15% (from the current areal average of 312 days). For the rest of the pollutants, future air pollution levels will depend on future pollutant emission levels. Under emission Scenarios II and III, the average annual number of high pollution days could increase 20-40% and 80-180%, respectively, by the middle and late part of this century. In contrast, under Scenario I, the average annual number of high pollution days could decrease by 10-65%. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Climate change scenarios; Downscaling; Future air pollution; South-central Canada; Synoptic weather typing","Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Climatology; Concentration (process); Thermal effects; Climate change scenarios; Future air pollution; Synoptic weather typing; Atmospheric chemistry; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Climatology; Concentration (process); Thermal effects; air quality; atmospheric general circulation model; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; climate change; climate effect; climatology; discriminant analysis; downscaling; forecasting method; future prospect; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; pollution monitoring; sulfur dioxide; suspended particulate matter; synoptic meteorology; urban pollution; air pollution; air quality; article; Canada; climate; discriminant analysis; pollutant; temperature; weather; Canada; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248325596

Hong Kong is now considered no as the production hub that it has been for long, but a sourcing hub and service economy and with it, a high level of pollution. However, any direct relationship between the quality of water in Hong Kong and the relocation of factories to the mainland remains undetermined. But one thing is for sure, the textile industry there is known to consume a lot of water in its manufacturing process, particularly for dyeing, printing and finishing. Accordingly, it discharges a large quantity of waste water into the streams and the harbor. Although industrial activity in Hong Kong has reduced significantly since factories began migrating to Shenzhen and Zhuhai, Hong Kong's environmental condition has continued, ironically to worsen. This situation is due to the territory's geographical location. Hong Kong is directly affected by the level of pollution in southern China.

The AAC was defined as the maximum allowable pollutant emission that can be discharged to the atmosphere without violating the desired air quality objective in the planning region. The coupled modeling system was firstly evaluated through comparing the simulation results of PM 10 concentration with the corresponding observations during four representative months in 2002, which showed an acceptable modeling performance. By using a trial-and-error approach, the validated modeling system was run through gradually reducing the emission strength within the modeling domain from a GIS-based pollutant emission database until a desired air quality objective was achieved. The air quality objective was characterized by the air quality guideline-satisfaction ratio (AQGSR) which was defined as the ratio of days when the daily PM10 concentrations are below the air quality standard during a certain time period. The PM10 emission within the modeling domain after such trial-and-error reduction under the condition of satisfying a certain AQGSR was considered its corresponding assimilative capacity. Accordingly, the atmospheric assimilative capacities of PM10 in the study region were identified corresponding to the AQGSR of 60, 65, 70, 75 and 80%, respectively. The relation between such capacity and guideline-satisfaction ratio was then established through regression analysis. The results could provide sound basis for decision makers in terms of effective air quality management by understanding the allowable pollutant discharge under different desired air quality objectives. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Air quality; ARPS; Atmospheric assimilative capacity; Beijing; CMAQ; Modeling; PM10","Computer simulation; Concentration (process); Error correction; Mathematical models; Particles (particulate matter); Regression analysis; Air quality guideline-satisfaction ratio (AQGSR); Atmospheric assimilative capacity; Trial-and-error reduction; Air quality; Air quality; Computer simulation; Concentration (process); Error correction; Mathematical models; Particles (particulate matter); Regression analysis; air quality; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; congestion; emission control; metropolitan area; modeling; particulate matter; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; air quality standard; article; atmosphere; atmospheric dispersion; China; pollutant; regression analysis; Asia; Beijing [China]; China; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247385520

The relation between the total allowable emission and wind speed as well as the relation between the total allowable emission and air-quality-guideline satisfaction were quantified based on the simulation results of the Gaussian-box modeling system. The area-source emission reduction objective in each functional zone of the study city during the heating and non-heating seasons was calculated based on such relations. A linear programming model was then developed to optimize the emission abatement which was subject to a number of dust and SO2 control measures. The economic objective of the air quality management strategy was to minimize the total emission control system cost while the environmental objective can still be satisfied. The environmental objective was reflected by the emission reduction objective of TSP, PM10 and SO2 corresponding to an air-quality-guideline satisfaction percentage of 80%. Consequently, the modeling system comprehensively took into account the information of emission reduction objectives, emission abatement alternatives, emission reduction cost, and related resources constraints. An optimal emission abatement strategy and the related cost were obtained for various pollution control measures.

In particular, the authors seek to identify decadal changes in the STCs in the model and to compare them with observations in order to understand the consequences of such changes for the equatorial ocean heat and mass budgets. The simulation shows a trend toward increasing pycnocline volume transport at 9°N and 9°S across the basin from 1992 to 2003. This increase [4.9 ± 1.0 Sv (Sv ≡ 106 m3 s-1)] is in qualitative agreement with observations and is attributed primarily to changes in the interior ocean transport, which are partially compensated by opposing western boundary transports. The subtropical meridional volume transport convergence anomalies in the model pycnocline are found to be consistent with anomalous volume transports in both the observed and modeled Equatorial Undercurrent, as well as with the magnitude of simulated anomalous upwelling transport at the base of the mixed layer in the eastern Pacific. As a result of the increased circulation intensity, heat transport divergence through the lateral boundaries of the tropical control volume (defined as the region between 9°N and 9°S, and from the surface to σθ = 25.3 isopycnal) increases, leading to a cooling of the tropical upper ocean despite the fact that net surface heat flux into the control volume has increased in the same time. As such, these results suggest that wind-driven changes in ocean transports associated with the subtropical cells play a central role in regulating tropical Pacific climate variability on decadal time scales. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Cooling; Heat flux; Mathematical models; Ocean currents; Wind; Equatorial undercurrent; Ocean general circulation model; Pycnocline; Subtropical cells; Oceanography; atmospheric forcing; circulation modeling; eddy; equatorial dynamics; meridional circulation; oceanic circulation; oceanic general circulation model; pycnocline; undercurrent; upwelling; volume transport; wind-driven circulation; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Subtropical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249909921

Development Alternatives (DA) recently distributed 980 improved chimney cookstoves (Sukhad stoves) in the Bundelkhand region of India. In a subset of these households (n = 60), DA undertook a comprehensive assessment of the impact of the improved Sukhad stove on indoor air quality. Measurements of carbon monoxide (CO) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were conducted for a 48-hour period in 60 rural kitchens in Bundelkhand before and after installation of the Sukhad stove. One year after the installation of the of the Sukhad, 48-hour average CO concentrations were reduced, on average, by 70% (p &lt; 0.001) in the homes of regular users of the improved stove. Similarly, 48-hr average PM2.5 concentrations were reduced, on average, by 44% (p &lt; 0.01). Given these reductions, continued promotion of the Sukhad stove would be warranted, while simultaneously improving stove design. Similar to other Household Energy and Health (HEH) projects, there were many homes that transitioned to use of the improved stove, while maintaining a traditional stove in the home, which highlights the need for follow-up in stove training after installation of the improved stove. Although challenging, the monitoring and evaluation provided important information about actual use of the stove in communities, and was important in understanding the adoption process for these rural families. © 2007 International Energy Initiative, Inc.",,"Air quality; Carbon; Carbon monoxide; Indoor air pollution; Particles (particulate matter); Comprehensive assessment; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Indoor air quality; Measurements of carbon monoxide; Monitoring and evaluations; Nongovernmental organizations; PM2.5 concentration; Quantitative monitoring; Stoves; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; cooking appliance; household energy; indoor air; installation; nongovernmental organization; particulate matter; rural energy; Asia; Bundelkhand; Eurasia; India; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45249121625

However, combustion processes produce emissions, which must be below the Best Practical Means (BPM) specified legislative limits. Several wastes, such as tires and meat meal, have been successfully combusted in cement kilns, up to 20% w/w, while retaining emission standards well below legislative limits. In the case of municipal solid waste (MSW) the introduction of large amounts of MSW into cement kilns is not practical because the additional kiln volume required is too great, the large amounts of ash generated will affect the cement clinker quality, and it would be difficult to sustain the required very high clinkering temperature of 1500 °C with large quantities of low calorific value MSW. A completely novel process, termed the CoCo process, has been developed, integrating MSW combustion in a synergistic fashion with the cement production. This process is based on combining the cement ""front-end"" calcination reaction and incorporating it with a high temperature, at 1200 °C, combustion process, providing a giant acid gas scrubber. A pilot plant was designed, constructed, and operated to demonstrate the benefits of the Co-Co process. The pilot plant achieved emissions minimization: dioxins were typically 0.5-1% of the European BPM limits, HCI, SOx, NOx, and particulates were 15, 10, 20, and 25% of BPM limits, respectively.

Climatic data were obtained from a nearby meteorological station and summarised in 24 variables. Phosphorus addition significantly affected vegetation cover of both vascular and cryptogamic vegetation but did not influence species richness. The effects on species composition were clear but not marked, and consisted in promoting the abundance of some species already present in the community but not leading to the colonisation of other species. Interannual climate differences affected vegetation cover in the fertilised plots but not in the control ones, while climate affected the species richness values of different/various life-forms in both groups of plots, with more evident effects in the fertilised one.

However, their short shelf-life has limited the market increase of this product. Quality changes (firmness, colour, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), sensory quality and microbial safety) of fresh-cut mangoes, pineapples, melons and mixes of these fruits were evaluated. Chemical treatments to reduce browning, firmness loss and decay of fresh-cut tropical fruits were investigated. The most effective agents for fresh-cut mangoes, pineapples and melons were 0.1 M ascorbic acid, 0.2 M ascorbic acid and 0.2 M ascorbic acid + 0.2 M calcium chloride, respectively. Fresh-cut tropical fruits were packaged in various rigid containers (PET, OPS and OPLA). Gas composition in the package headspace and time to reach steady-state condition varied among fresh-cut packaging systems and affected their quality and shelf-life. The effects of package permeability of O2 and CO2 on quality and shelf-life of the fresh-cut products are discussed. Extended shelf-life was observed in fresh-cut mangoes, pineapples and mixes packaged in PET due to reduced O2 and elevated CO2 atmosphere. A modified atmosphere of 6% O2 and 14% CO2 achieved in PET extended the shelf-life of fresh-cut pineapples from 6 to 13 days. Accumulation of CO2 may impart an off-odour of fresh-cut fruits. The results suggested that the shelf-life of fresh-cut fruits could be extended by using proper rigid containers. Suitable mixes to create optimal equilibrium modified atmosphere had a potential to extend shelf-life of short shelf-life fresh-cut tropical fruits.

Most commonly reported endoscopic neck surgery studies in literature have been on thyroid and parathyroid glands. The approaches are divided into two types i.e., the total endoscopic approach using CO2 insufflation and the video-assisted approach without CO2 insufflation. The latter approach has been reported more often. The surgical access (port placements) may vary-the common sites are the neck, anterior chest wall, axilla, and periareolar region. The limiting factors are the size of the gland and malignancy. Few reports are available on endoscopic resection for early thyroid malignancy and cervical lymph node dissection. Endoscopic neck surgery has primarily evolved due to its cosmetic benefits and it has proved to be safe and feasible in suitable patients with thyroid and parathyroid pathologies.

The blast furnace operation of charging the burdens with high reducibility has been numerically evaluated using a multi-fluid blast furnace model. The effects of reaction rate constants and diffusion coefficients were investigated separately or simultaneously for clarifying the variations of furnace state. According to the model simulation results, in the upper zone, the indirect reduction of the burdens proceeds at a faster rate and the shaft efficiency is enhanced with the improvement under the conditions of interface reaction and intra-particle diffusion. In the lower zone, direct reduction in molten slag is restrained. As a consequence, CO utilization of top gas is enhanced and the ratio of direct reduction is decreased. It is possible to achieve higher energy efficiency of the blast furnace, and this is represented by the improvement in productivity and the decrease in consumption of reducing agent. The use of high-reducibility burdens contributes to a better performance of blast furnace.

Because elevated CO2 and N deposition increased plant productivity to a greater extent in more diverse plant assemblages, it is plausible that heterotrophic microbial communities would experience greater substrate availability, potentially increasing microbial activity, and accelerating soil carbon (C) and N cycling. We, therefore, hypothesized that the response of microbial communities to elevated CO2 and N deposition is contingent on the species richness of plant communities. Microbial community composition was determined by phospholipid fatty acid analysis, and function was measured using the activity of key extracellular enzymes involved in litter decomposition. Higher plant species richness, as a main effect, fostered greater microbial biomass, cellulolytic and chitinolytic capacity, as well as the abundance of saprophytic and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Moreover, the effect of plant species richness on microbial communities was significantly modified by elevated CO2 and N deposition. For instance, microbial biomass and fungal abundance increased with greater species richness, but only under combinations of elevated CO2 and ambient N, or ambient CO2 and N deposition. Cellobiohydrolase activity increased with higher plant species richness, and this trend was amplified by elevated CO2. In most cases, the effect of plant species richness remained significant even after accounting for the influence of plant biomass. Taken together, our results demonstrate that plant species richness can directly regulate microbial activity and community composition, and that plant species richness is a significant determinant of microbial response to elevated CO2 and N deposition. The strong positive effect of plant species richness on cellulolytic capacity and microbial biomass indicate that the rates of soil C cycling may decline with decreasing plant species richness. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Complementary resource use; Extra cellular enzymes; FACE (free-air carbon dioxide enrichment); Global change; Grassland ecosystem; Microbial biomass; Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA); Plant diversity; Soil C cycling; Soil fungi","biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide enrichment; community composition; global change; grassland; microbial activity; microbial community; microbial ecology; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; plant community; soil microorganism; species richness; Arbuscular; Embryophyta; Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247560175

The authors applied the model of acidification of groundwater in catchments (MAGIC) to 410 acid-sensitive lakes located in a 3000 km east-west gradient in eastern Canada. The goal was to estimate the water chemistry from pre-acidification times, under worst case conditions (mid 1970s) and what it should be in the year 2030 after proposed acid emission reduction levels agreed-to or planned by Canada and the United States are in place. In eastern Canada, large decreases in pH and ANC are shown between pre-acidification and 1975, the year of greatest historical deposition. Current-day conditions are much improved from 1975. Under the most likely future acid deposition reduction scenarios, an improvement of pH and ANC is shown in all the regions from current-day levels, but not to pre-acidification levels. Dissolved Ca levels were considerably higher at the height of acidification than under pristine conditions, but will return to pre-acidification levels at most of the sites by the year 2030. The results also show that under proposed control programs, a large number of sites in eastern Canada will not return to ANC values &gt;40 μeq L-1, thought to be suitable for healthy aquatic communities.

Southwestern and eastern parts of Nova Scotia combine poor buffering, high organic acidity, and higher acid deposition, to produce extremely low surface water pH and acid neutralization capacity (ANC) values. Although sulfate deposition is decreasing, concurrent reductions in dissolved base cations, as well as the acid-base characteristics of natural organic acids, are not allowing the recovery of ANC or surface water pH. Spring-time acid pulses occur in Atlantic Canada, though these have been reduced in severity with decreases in winter acid deposition, while autumnal low pH pulses caused by organic acids are a regular occurence in Nova Scotia and must be separated from mineral acidity pulses. Geochemical modeling using both critical load and dynamic approaches, nevertheless predict improvements in the water chemistry of Nova Scotia lakes within the next 20 years. However, re-establishment of pre-acidification water chemistry in most of its lakes will require greater reductions in S emissions than are currently planned in Canada and the United States. © 2007 NRC Canada.","Acidification; Atlantic Canada; Freshwater; Organic acidity; Total organic carbon","Acidification; Acidity; Air pollution; Deposition; Hydrochemistry; Lakes; Organic acids; pH; Sulfur compounds; Water; Acidity; Deposition; Organic acids; Organic carbon; pH effects; Acid-base characteristics; Acid-neutralization capacity; Atlantic Canada; Concurrent reduction; Eastern north america; Freshwater; Freshwater acidifications; Total Organic Carbon; Organic carbon; Surface waters; Acidification; Atlantic Canada; Canada; Organic acidity; United States; Water chemistry",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38049115876

The involvement of white matter in schizophrenia is becoming increasingly apparent with reports of structural, morphological and genetic alterations occurring in the disease. The 2-DE was employed to reveal significantly altered proteins within the ACC white matter proteome in a schizophrenia cohort (n=10) relative to controls (n=10). From the 423 matched spots between the two groups, the levels of 32 protein spots were altered in the schizophrenia ACC white matter. of these, 30 spots were identified using MS. The majority of the altered proteins in schizophrenia function in metabolism, the cytoskeleton, and the synapse.

Biomass burning and pollution plumes identified from trace gas measurements were evaluated for their aerosol physiochemical and optical signatures. Measurements of soluble ionic mass and refractory black carbon (BC) mass, inferred from light absorption, were combined with volatility to identify organic carbon at 400°C (VolatileOC) and the residual or refractory organic carbon, RefractoryOC. This approach characterized distinct constituent mass fractions present in biomass burning and pollution plumes every 5-10 min. Biomass burning, pollution and dust aerosol could be stratified by their combined spectral scattering and absorption properties. The ""nonplume"" regional aerosol exhibited properties dominated by pollution characteristics near the surface and biomass burning aloft. VolatileOC included most water-soluble organic carbon. RefractoryOC dominated enhanced shortwave absorption in plumes from Alaskan and Canadian forest fires. The mass absorption efficiency of this RefractoryOC was about 0.63 m2 g-1 at 470 nm and 0.09 m2 g-1 at 530 nm. Concurrent measurements of the humidity dependence of scattering, γ, revealed the OC component to be only weakly hygroscopic resulting in a general decrease in γ with increasing OC mass fractions. Under ambient humidity conditions, the systematic relations between physiochemical properties and γ lead to a well-constrained dependency on the absorption per unit dry mass for these plume types that may be used to challenge remotely sensed and modeled optical properties.

The fragmentation of Gondwana and the development of wide-scale glaciation have resulted in major episodes of extinction and vicariance, as well as driving adaptation to an extreme environment. On shorter time-scales, glacial cycles have resulted in shifts in distribution, range fragmentation and allopatric speciation, and the Antarctic Peninsula is currently experiencing among the most rapid climatic warming on the planet. The recent revolution in molecular techniques has provided a suite of innovative and powerful tools to explore the consequences of these changes, and these are now providing novel insights into evolutionary and ecological processes in Antarctica.

Distinctive features of the orange zone include: (1) high abundances of kaolinite, (2) a strongly leached character with a bright orange iron-enriched horizon, (3) poor organic carbon preservation, and (4) ferric pans/pisoliths at its basal contact, equivalent to modern lateritic materials. Though conclusive evidence, such as a distinctive Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum flora and/or definitive carbon isotope excursion, is lacking, the stratigraphic succession of palynofloral datums preserved within the upper part of the Bear Den orange zone is similar to that associated with the later stages of other terrestrial Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum records from the U.S. Western Interior. Bulk δ13Corg ratios decrease through the orange zone as well, but the magnitude of this isotopic decrease is less than that of the carbon isotope excursion. Thus, the collective evidence indicates that the early initial stages of the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum are either preserved within the barren, condensed interval of the lower orange zone or are missing altogether from the Williston Basin stratigraphy, and that the orange zone likely developed during the later recovery stages of the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum. The Williston Basin records generally agree with the tenet that continental weathering intensified during the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum. Moreover, these records indicate that the paleohydrology of the basin varied markedly and that sequestration of terrestrial organic carbon was greatly reduced as this transient global warming event unfolded. © 2006 Geological Society of America.","Golden Valley Formation; Kaolinite; Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum; Williston Basin","Carbon isotope excursion; Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum; Williston Basin; Global warming; Hydrogeology; Kaolinite; Organic carbon; Stratigraphy; Weathering; Hypsithermal; kaolinite; Paleocene-Eocene boundary; pedogenesis; stratigraphy; weathering; North America; Williston Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947401061

However the additional vehicle material and development cost is significant, particularly in cost sensitive markets such as India. Belt Starter-Generator (BSG) technology can provide a cost-effective route to achieve some of the benefits hybridisation brings, such as a stop-start feature when vehicles are stationary.

In the reduction stage, the structural oxygen contained in the lattice of a reducible inorganic oxide, is used for combustion of the carbonaceous material. In the regeneration stage the oxygen carrier, found in a reduced state after the reduction stage, is regenerated with pure air to recover the physical and chemical properties of the carrier, ready to reinitiate a new cycle reduction-regeneration. In a typical multicycle reactor test, the carriers are subjected to accumulative chemical and thermal stresses and the performance will, probably, decay progressively with the number of cycles. The occurrence of some side reactions may limit the efficiency of the overall process in CO2 capture. In this paper, titania-supported iron oxides with different iron loadings have been tested in multicycle tests in a fixed-bed reactor at 900 °C and atmospheric pressure, as oxygen carriers for the chemical-looping combustion of methane. The study shows that the available oxygen for methane combustion in the reduction stage is lower than expected since the active phase interacts with the support forming FeTiO3 ilmenite. The reactivity of these iron based carriers in the reduction stage is independent on the iron oxide content but lower than that exhibited by other tested carriers, such as CuO or NiO. However, iron carriers are cheaper no showing any tendency to carbon deposition. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Adapted experimental and numerical modelling techniques have been used to describe each of the main phenomena in play. Edge electron density and temperature are measured with Langmuir probes. The C II, C III and H α emission is measured with optical fibres and cameras. The background plasma flow is calculated consistently with the observed recycling pattern by the neutral transport code EDCOLL for the two magnetic connection schemes of interest (short or long connection lengths). 3D Monte-Carlo modelling of carbon near the neutralizer plate (BBQ code) shows that the transport of carbon ions is governed by the friction force in addition to the electric field. Finally, a simplified 3D test particle model is used to estimate the core penetration fraction of carbon. A high value is found for the carbon screening efficiency (fraction of particles that does not penetrate in the plasma core), in the range 95-97% depending on the edge plasma conditions. This value, combined with the calculated carbon influxes, yields the first quantitative estimate of the carbon core contamination during ED operation. The paper shows that the screening of carbon and core contamination are mainly dependent on the carbon source (partially controlled with the ED) and the plasma flow distribution in the laminar region (magnetic topology and particle drifts). © 2007 IAEA, Vienna.",,"Carbon; Carrier concentration; Electric field effects; Langmuir probes; Mathematical models; Numerical methods; Ergodic divertors (ED); Neutral transport code; Plasma flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247244158

The addition of crude oil to estuarine water resulted in an immediate change in bacterial community structure, increased abundance of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms and a rapid rate of oil degradation, suggesting the presence of a pre-adapted oil-degrading microbial community and sufficient supply of nutrients. Relatively rapid degradation was found at 4°C, the lowest temperature tested; and it was temperature rather than nutrient addition that most influenced the community structure. A detailed phylogenetic analysis of oil-degrading microcosms showed that known hydrocarbonoclastic organisms like Thalassolituus and Cycloclasticus, as well as proposed oil degraders like Roseobacter, were present at both 4°C and 20°C, demonstrating the thermo-versatility of such organisms. Clones related to Oleispira antarctica (98% 16S rRNA similarity), a psychrophilic alkane degrader, were dominant in the 4°C oil-degrading community, whereas other clones constituting a different clade and showing 94% similarity 16S rRNA with O. antarctica were found in situ.

Vehicle emissions and other anthropogenic related activities are a frequent source of CO2 to the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Micrometeorological techniques used for observations in Northern Hemisphere cities have found that urban CO2 fluxes are consistently a source. This study investigates CO2 fluxes in an Australian city, adding to the global database of CO2 fluxes in a bid to aid in future development of planning policies concerning reductions in CO2 emissions. Using the eddy covariance approach, fluxes of CO2 were measured at a suburban site (Preston) in Melbourne, Australia from February 2004 to June 2005 to investigate temporal variability. A second site (Surrey Hills) with differing surface characteristics (in particular, greater vegetation cover) was also established in Melbourne and ran simultaneously for 6 months (February 2004-July 2004). Results showed that both sites were a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Diurnal patterns of fluxes were largely influenced by traffic volumes, with two distinct peaks occurring at the morning and evening traffic peak hours, with the winter morning peak averaging 10.9 μmol m-2 s-1 at Preston. Summer time fluxes were lower than during winter due to greater vegetative influence and reduced natural gas combustion. Vegetation limited the source of CO2 in the afternoon, yet was not enough to combat the strong local anthropogenic emissions. Surrey Hills showed higher fluxes of CO2 despite greater vegetation cover because of higher local traffic volumes. Annual emissions from Preston were estimated at 84.9 t CO2 ha-1 yr-1.

Roost trees were larger in diameter than 95% of non-roost trees and on average 2.5 times larger within burned areas of similar severity. Roost trees were within patches less dense than 95% of measured patches across study sites, which were on average 1.5 times as dense. Two-thirds of roost trees were created by fire and were smaller than those created by other means. Six birds each used one roost and three males each used two roosts. Two-thirds of the roosts were outside or on the edge of estimated home ranges. Maximum straight-line distances traveled, from roost to farthest point of home range, were > 1 km for 8 of 9 birds. Woodpeckers have a significant role in providing cavities for secondary cavity nesters. Thus, understanding habitat requirements for winter roosts could provide managers with essential tools to maintain or enhance populations of this species.",,"bird; climate conditions; coniferous forest; energy budget; home range; patch dynamics; population dynamics; predator; roost site; roosting; wildfire; Arizona; North America; United States; Aves; Picidae; Picoides villosus; Pinus ponderosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947494205

However, while there can be complementarities between the three environmental goals, there are often tradeoffs. Thus, the challenge lies in developing land use policies that promote optimal environmental outcomes, and in implementing these locally to promote sustainable development. The paper considers synergies and tradeoffs in implementing land use measures to address the objectives of the three global environmental conventions, both from an environmental and economic perspective.

They include a complex structure, onerous monitoring and reporting requirements, and potential for omission of some important fluxes. One solution that may overcome some of these problems is to include all lands and associated processes within a country's jurisdiction, rather than restrict accounting to specific nominated land categories or activities. Ideally, the accounting approach should cover all significant biospheric sources and sinks, avoid biased or unbalanced accounting, avoid leakage and require no arbitrary adjustments to remedy unintended consequences. Furthermore, accounting should focus on the direct human-induced component of biospheric emissions/removals so that debits/credits can be allocated equitably and provide appropriate incentives to adopt land-use management options with beneficial outcomes for the atmosphere. This paper focuses on biospheric emissions and removals resulting from carbon stock changes. It considers four alternative accounting options that include all land areas: Gross-Net Accounting, Net-Net Accounting, Net Accounting with Negotiated Baselines and the Average Carbon Stocks approach. Each option is described, and assessed with respect to defined criteria for effectiveness. Gross-Net Accounting and Net-Net Accounting do not adequately distinguish the anthropogenic component of carbon-stock changes from indirect and natural effects, so large undeserved credits or debits could be created. Under Net Accounting with Negotiated Baselines, countries' projected emissions and removals during the commitment period would be taken into account in the negotiation of emissions targets. In the commitment period, countries would then gain credits/debits for biospheric removals/emissions. Difficulties with this approach would lie in reaching agreed baselines for emissions and removals for individual countries, and, if desired, in factoring out residual effects of natural variability on emissions/removals. Under the Average Carbon Stocks approach, debits/credits for changes in land use or management practices would be based on the changes in long-term average carbon stocks associated with changes in specific land use and management regimes. This approach thereby directly identifies the anthropogenic component, and assigns debits and credits accordingly. It may prove problematic, however, for countries to accept long-term averages rather than observable realised carbon-stock changes as the basis for accounting. Thus, none of the options is without its drawbacks, but Net Accounting with Negotiated Baselines and the Average Carbon Stocks approach could potentially be used as the basis of developing a future 'all lands' accounting framework. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Our simulations indicate that the presence or absence of C4 plants is important for understanding regional climate, specifically with respect to seasonal climate patterns. When C4 plants are absent from simulated tropical ecosystems, the percentage of bare soil increases regionally, Amazonia becomes warmer during the dry season, South Africa becomes drier during the dry season, the African Sahara-Sahel boundary becomes hotter during the dry season, and yet temperatures cool in central Australia during the Austral winter.

Multiple issues, stakeholders and scales of system behaviour must be considered, as well as the key disciplines within and between the human and natural sciences. Modelling is a critical tool in integrated assessment. It enables effects of policy interventions, climate forcing and demographics to be predicted (although with some uncertainty), and provides a means of expanding understanding of river basin behaviour. It also acts as a vehicle for social learning among various interest groups. This paper discusses the various frameworks and methods being used for integrated modelling, and their suitability and unfulfilled potential for these purposes. The frameworks include coupled component models, systems dynamics models, metamodels, risk-assessment approaches, Bayesian decision networks, agent-based methods, expert systems and other heuristic knowledge-based techniques. Specific software platforms are not considered but the lessons from software development and implementation are clearly spelt out. The paper presents three Australian case studies in integrated assessment. They vary in their range of catchment/watershed sizes, hydroclimatology, issues of concern and stakeholders engaged. Two of them utilise a coupled component modelling framework and the third a Bayesian decision network approach.

In particular it proposes some ways to address the challenges of assessing options to obtain more sustainable basin-wide outcomes. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.","Agent-based; Bay esian decision networks; Expert systems; Integrated modelling; Integration frameworks; Knowledge-based; Meta models; Risk assessment; River basin management; Stakeholders; System dynamics","Environmental impact; Expert systems; Heuristic methods; Management; Risk assessment; Statistical methods; Bayesian decision networks; Integrated modelling; Integration frameworks; Meta models; River basin management; Stakeholders; System dynamics; Water resources; Environmental impact; Expert systems; Heuristic methods; Management; Risk assessment; Statistical methods; Water resources; basin management; climate forcing; decision making; environmental policy; expert system; risk assessment; stakeholder; water planning; water resource; Australasia; Australia; Triticum aestivum subsp. spelta",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845943439

We examined the ecological consequences of losing shallow-rooted forbs, a group of species we predict to be adversely affected by climate change based on their response to experimental warming. After three years of experimental species removal, tap-rooted forbs and grasses were able to fully compensate for the loss of shallow-rooted forbs with increased biomass production. Moreover, the remaining plant community yielded a larger biomass response to nitrogen addition when shallow-rooted forbs were removed, possibly because removal led to increased soil moisture. We conclude that, although shallow-rooted forbs share a common response to warming, their loss did not affect community-level biomass. However, the loss of shallow-rooted forbs could result in increased sensitivity to perturbations, such as changing nutrient availability. Our results demonstrate that realistic, nonrandom scenarios of species loss do not necessarily follow the general pattern of decreased productivity and dampened response to nitrogen addition with species loss that is predicted by theory and many experimental results. Further examinations of nonrandom species loss in other ecosystems are needed to further improve our understanding of the consequences of human-driven species loss. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","Climate change; Compensation; Functional effect group; Functional response group; Nitrogen addition; Nonrandom species loss; Species-removal experiment; Subalpine meadow","nitrogen; angiosperm; biomass; climate change; compensation; functional change; functional response; grass; nitrogen; nutrient availability; plant community; subalpine environment; analysis of variance; article; biomass; comparative study; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; metabolism; plant; population dynamics; species difference; United States; Analysis of Variance; Biomass; Colorado; Ecosystem; Greenhouse Effect; Nitrogen; Plants; Population Dynamics; Species Specificity; Mimosa; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247120721

After elimination of the effects of side reactions, the reforming reaction was controlled by kinetics. The activation energies of the reforming reaction and the reaction orders of CH4, CO2, H2, and CO showed that the reforming reaction could be divided into three regions: 550-575 °C, 575-650 °C, and 650-750 °C. The reaction rate was constant in the low and high temperature ranges but was varied with temperature in the middle range. The CH4 dissociation reached equilibrium with Ni-H species above 650 °C. The surface oxygen species originating from CO2 became removable and reacted with CHx species above 575 °C. The reaction of CHx with CO2 was slower than that of CH4 dissociation above 650 °C, leading to the durative carbon deposition on the catalyst. CO competed with CH4 on the Ni active sites below 650 °C but was desorbed rapidly above 650 °C. The formation of hydrogen is a rapid or equilibrium step in the reforming reaction. The CH4 dissociation is the RDS and CO desorption also restrained the dry reforming in 550-575 °C. The reaction between CHx and CO2 became the RDS in 650-750 °C. And the restraining steps were switched from the former two steps to the latter step in 575-650 °C.

In 20 healthy male individuals with no sleep-related disorders, continuous recordings of blood velocity in the middle cerebral artery, arterial blood pressure, V̇E, end-tidal gases, and frontal cortical oxygenation using near infrared spectroscopy were monitored during hypercapnia (inspired CO 2, 5%), hypoxia [arterial O2 saturation (SaO2) ∼84%], and during a 20-s breath hold to investigate the related responses to hypercapnia, hypoxia, and apnea, respectively. Measurements were conducted in the evening (6-8 PM) and in the early morning (6-8 AM). From evening to morning, the cerebrovascular reactivity to hypercapnia was reduced (5.3 ± 0.6 vs. 4.6 ± 1.1%/Torr; P &lt; 0.05) and was associated with a reduced increase in cerebral oxygenation (r = 0.39; P &lt; 0.05) and an elevated morning hypercapnic V̇E response (r = 0.54; P &lt; 0.05). While there were no overnight changes in cerebrovascular reactivity or V̇E response to hypoxia, there was greater cerebral desaturation for a given SaO2 in the morning (AM, -0.45 ± 0.14 vs. PM, -0.35 ± 0.14%/SaO2; P &lt; 0.05). Following the 20-s breath hold, in the morning, there was a smaller surge middle cerebral artery velocity and cerebral oxygenation (P &lt; 0.05 vs. PM). These data indicate that normal diurnal changes in the cerebrovascular response to CO2 influence the hypercapnic ventilatory response as well as the level of cerebral oxygenation during changes in arterial PCO 2; this may be a contributing factor for diurnal changes in breathing stability and the high incidence of stroke in the morning.

In the context of the Clean Air For Europe programme of the European Commission, the CityDelta project was designed to evaluate the impact of emission-reduction strategies on air quality at the European continental scale and in European cities. Ozone and particulate matter (PM) are the main components that have been studied. To achieve this goal, a model intercomparison study was organized with the participation of more than 20 modelling groups with a large number of modelling configurations. Two following main topics can be identified in the project. First, in order to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, the participating models were evaluated against observations in a control year (1999). An accompanying paper will discuss in detail this evaluation aspect for four European cities. The second topic is the actual evaluation of the impact of emission reductions on levels of ozone and PM, with particular attention to the differences between large-scale and fine-scale models. An accompanying paper will discuss this point in detail. In this overview paper the main input to the intercomparison is described as well as the use of the ensemble approach. Finally, attention is given to the policy relevant issue on how to implement the urban air quality signal into large-scale air quality models through the use of functional relationships. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Their chemical and physical characteristics have been previously determined, and earlier in vitro short-term studies have shown them to cause dose-dependent and time-dependent oxidative damage, gene expression and protein secretion of inflammatory mediators, and apoptotic events in human lung epithelial cells (L132) in culture. Hence, this work studied the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)/inhibitory kappa B (IκB) by Dunkerque city PM2.5 in these target cells, by determination of phosphorylated p65 and phosphorylated IκBα protein levels in cytoplasmic extracts, and p65 and p50 DNA binding in nuclear extracts. In PM-exposed L132 cells, there were concentration- and/or time-dependent increases in nuclear p65 and cytoplasmic IkB-α phosphorylation, and nuclear p65 and p50 DNA binding. Taken together, these results showed that Dunkerque city PM2.5 were involved in the activation of the NF-κB/IκB complex, notably through the occurrence of oxidative stress conditions, and, therefore, in the gene expression and protein secretion of inflammatory mediators in target L132 cells. Hence, these findings suggested that the activation of the NF-κB/ IκB complex preceded cytotoxicity in Dunkerque city PM-exposed L132 cells.

The plant has produced treated wood products continuously since 1904. The principle chemicals used to treat the wood, which is primarily used for railroad ties (oblong objects laid perpendicular to the rails to act as a base for the tracks), are creosote and pentachlorophenol. For a number of years, the plant burned treated waste wood products containing creosote and pentachlorophenol. First the plant pressure impregnates the wood with creosote and pentachlorophenol, and then the wood is stacked on open ground to allow it to air dry. Chemicals from recently treated wood ties are allowed to evaporate into the air or drip onto the ground surrounding the stacked wood. Small drainage ditches carry the liquid wastes into larger water channels where eventually the waste streams are discharged into a river adjacent to the plant. The river serves as a source of drinking water for the nearby community. Prevailing wind patterns favor a drift of air emissions from the plant's boiler stack over the nearby community and its residents. Over the past few years, the town's residents have become increasingly concerned about their health status and have voiced concerns regarding multiple health problems (including cancer), possibly associated with plant discharges. The intention of this study is to examine a representative sample of the potentially affected residents and to evaluate their residential environment for the presence of dioxin and/or its congeners. Data obtained from EPA's Toxic Release Information (TRI) database revealed the plant routinely discharged creosote, pentachlorophenol, dioxin and dioxin-like compounds into the ambient air via fugitive air emissions and surface waste waters. Sampling of household dust and water sediment within and outside of residences within a 2-mile radius of the plant revealed the presence of significantly elevated levels of dioxins, principally octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD) and 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-hepta-CDD. Biomonitoring of 29 subjects identified the presence of significantly elevated chlorinated dioxins and furan levels (OCDD = 1049 ppt for exposed and 374 ppt for controls and 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-hepta CDD = 132 ppt for exposed and 45.1 ppt for controls). These levels are consistent with exposures to pentachlorophenol in this group of subjects. And they confirm the presence of unsafe levels of chlorinated dioxins in these persons. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The photochemical simulations were conducted during two distinct periods: in summer (from 24 to 26 January 2003) and in winter (from 10 to 12 August, 2004). With the RAMS atmospheric model (Regional Atmospheric Modelling System) we obtained meteorological fields to initialize the CIT photochemical model. The emission data were based on the AP-42 and only compounds emitted during coal burning were considered. The simulated results revealed high ozone levels in warmer periods, being related to high temperatures and water vapor concentrations. The simulated concentrations are located far from the emitting source, favoring reaction and mixing time between precursors to form ozone. Simulated winds of small intensity favored ozone transport, mixing and accumulation in areas far from the emitting source. © 2006 Springer Science + Business Media B.V.","Nitrogen oxides; Photochemical model; Power plant emissions; RAMS model; Tropospheric ozone","Computer simulation; Concentration (process); Mathematical models; Nitrogen oxides; Numerical analysis; Ozone; Photochemical reactions; Troposphere; Photochemical model; Power plant emissions; Industrial emissions; coal; nitric oxide; ozone; Computer simulation; Concentration (process); Industrial emissions; Mathematical models; Nitrogen oxides; Numerical analysis; Ozone; Photochemical reactions; Troposphere; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; coal-fired power plant; concentration (composition); nitrogen oxides; numerical model; ozone; photolysis; pollutant source; article; Brazil; chemical model; meteorology; summer; temperature; water vapor; winter; Brazil; Candiota; Rio Grande do Sul; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846151007

The mechanical and (in the case of carbon nanotubes filled composites) electrical properties of these composites were investigated. Dynamic mechanical analysis highlighted the influence of entanglements between fibers and of fiber/fiber contact properties on the composite mechanical reinforcement in the rubbery state. In the case of cellulose filled nanocomposites a large mechanical reinforcement effect was observed. This effect was explained by the formation of a rigid nanofibril network linked by strong hydrogen bonds. The formation of this network was assumed to be governed by a percolation mechanism. Conversely, when such bonds between cellulose fibrils were prevented by the process, a lower mechanical reinforcement is observed and can be modeled by a classical mean field approach. On the other hand, both types of composites filled with carbon nanotubes (where no strong interactions are possible) highlighted the fact that entanglements are responsible for a strong increase in thermo-mechanical stability but do not influence the mechanical reinforcement. However, carbon nanotubes are good conductive objects and for such nanocomposites, electrical percolation properties were found. The influence of the process on these electrical properties was highlighted and discussed in term of modification of tube-tube contact electrical properties. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A technique used for reducing the brittleness (increasing the fracture toughness) of these materials is rubber toughening. While there is significant qualitative understanding of the mechanical behavior of rubber-toughened polymers, quantitative modeling tools for the large-strain deformation of rubber-toughened glassy polymers are largely lacking. In this paper, we develop a suite of numerical tools to investigate the mechanical behavior of rubber-toughened glassy polymers, with emphasis on rubber-toughened polycarbonate. The rubber particles are modeled as voids in view of their deformation-induced cavitation early during deformation. A three-dimensional micromechanical model of the heterogeneous microstructure is developed to study the effects of initial rubber particle (void) volume fraction on the underlying elasto-viscoplastic deformation mechanisms in the material, and how these mechanisms influence the macroscopic response of the material. A continuum-level constitutive model is developed for the large-strain elasto-viscoplastic deformation of porous glassy polymers, and it is calibrated against micromechanical modeling results for porous polycarbonate. The constitutive model can be used to study various boundary value problems involving rubber-toughened (porous) glassy polymers. As an example, the case of an axisymmetric notched bar is simulated for the case of polycarbonate with varying levels of initial porosity. The quality of the constitutive model calibration is assessed using a multi-scale modeling approach. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Little is known about how these two commonly co-occurring gases will affect reproductive fitness of important forest tree species. Here, we report on the long-term effects of CO2 and O 3 for paper birch seedlings exposed for nearly their entire life history at the Aspen FACE (Free Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment) site in Rhinelander, WI. Elevated CO2 increased both male and female flower production, while elevated O3 increased female flower production compared to trees in control rings. Interestingly, very little flowering has yet occurred in combined treatment. Elevated CO2 had significant positive effect on birch catkin size, weight, and germination success rate (elevated CO2 increased germination rate of birch by 110% compared to ambient CO2 concentrations, decreased seedling mortality by 73%, increased seed weight by 17%, increased root length by 59%, and root-to-shoot ratio was significantly decreased, all at 3 weeks after germination), while the opposite was true of elevated O3 (elevated O3 decreased the germination rate of birch by 62%, decreased seed weight by 25%, and increased root length by 15%). Under elevated CO2, plant dry mass increased by 9 and 78% at the end of 3 and 14 weeks, respectively. Also, the root and shoot lengths, as well as the biomass of the seedlings, were increased for seeds produced under elevated CO2, while the reverse was true for seedlings from seeds produced under the elevated O3. Similar trends in treatment differences were observed in seed characteristics, germination, and seedling development for seeds collected in both 2004 and 2005. Our results suggest that elevated CO2 and O3 can dramatically affect flowering, seed production, and seed quality of paper birch, affecting reproductive fitness of this species. ©2007 with author.

The electric-vector position angle (EVPA) of the pseudocore rotated by about 80° in four VLBA observations over a period of 9 days, matching the trend of the optical EVPA. In addition, the 43 GHz EVPAs agree well with the optical values when we correct the former for Faraday rotation. Fluctuations in the polarization at both wave bands are consistent with the variable emission arising from a standing conical shock wave that compresses magnetically turbulent plasma in the ambient jet. The volume of the variable component is the same at both wave bands, although only ∼20% of the total 43 GHz emission arises from this site. The remainder of the 43 GHz flux density must originate in a separate region with very low polarization. If 0420-014 is a typical case, the nonthermal optical emission from blazars originates primarily in and near the pseudocore rather than closer to the central engine where the flow collimates and accelerates. © 2007.

For this analysis we consider a representative dust episode which occurred on April 2001 in the Aral Sea region. The meteorological fields were simulated using the PSU/NCAR MM5 modeling system considering two different boundary layer parameterizations. In each case, emitted dust fluxes were computed off-line by incorporating MM5 meteorological fields into the dust module DuMo. Several dust emission schemes with a prescribed erodible fraction and fixed threshold wind speed were the subject of our analysis. Implications to assessment of the anthropogenic fraction of dust emitted in the Aral region were investigated by conducting the full, half, and no lake modeling experiments. Our results show that the discrepancies in dust fluxes between the two different PBLs are much higher compared to the discrepancy associated with the use of considered dust production schemes. Furthermore, the choice of the PBL affects the timing and duration of a modeled dust event. We demonstrate that different combinations of the PBL parameterization and wind- or friction velocity-driven dust emission schemes can result in up to about a 50% difference in predicted dust mass caused by the Aral Sea desiccation. We found that the drying-up of the Aral cannot only affect the dust emission by expanding the source area, but also by affecting atmospheric characteristics, especially winds. These competitive factors add further complexity to quantification of the anthropogenic dust fraction in the region. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The ACROPOLIS initiative, supported by the European Commission and the International Energy Agency, used up to 15 energy models to simulate and evaluate selected policy measures and instruments and then compare their impacts on energy systems essentially in terms of costs of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reduction and energy technology choice. Four case studies are formulated considering policies and measures on renewable portfolio schemes and internationally tradable green certificates, emissions trading and global GHG abatement target, energy efficiency standards and internalisation of external costs. The main focus of the project is on the electricity sector. From a large set of quantified results, ACROPOLIS provides an international scientific consensus, on some key issues, which could be useful in assessing and designing energy and environment policies at the world, European and national/regional levels. It concludes that the Kyoto targets (and their continuation beyond 2010 in specific scenarios) could be achieved at a cost around 1% of GDP through global emissions trading, indicating also that this flexibility mechanism is a more cost-effective instrument for GHG mitigation than meeting the goal domestically without trade. It demonstrates that internalising external costs through a price increase reduces local pollutants (SOx, NOx, and others) and it produces other benefits such as triggering the penetration of clean technologies in addition to the curbing of CO2 emissions. © 2006.","Energy models; GHG mitigation; Renewable portfolio","Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; International cooperation; Mathematical models; Energy modelling; Green certificates; Greenhouse gas emissions; Renewable portfolio; Energy policy; emission control; energy efficiency; energy policy; greenhouse gas; mitigation; renewable resource",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845466392

We show that the zero current in the I-V curves (measure of Coulomb blockade (CB) of the nanoparticles) depends on the properties of the spacer molecule. In both the cases the gap voltage and the tunneling current at which the images are obtained are quite different which is further confirmed from the fitting performed based on the orthodox theory. The values for the capacitance and charging energy obtained from the fitting for ODT capped particles are comparable to the values obtained using spherical capacitor model. In contrast, values of these parameters were found to differ for LAM capped nanoparticles. While imaging, ODT capped nanoparticles were observed to drag along the scan direction leading to ordering of particles. Images of LAM capped gold nanoparticles show local ordering in self-assembly of particles although no evidence of large scale ordering in spatial Fourier transform was seen. These observations suggest that nanoparticles with larger CB would be imaged nonevasively in contrast to small CB systems for which tip induced effects will be dominant. In both the systems the current was found to rise faster than theoretical curves based on the orthodox theory suggesting that mechanism of charge transfer in this case may involve field emission rather than tunneling through a rectangular barrier.

To assist in the benefit-cost analyses of these air pollution control policies, the U.S. EPA has developed the Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP). BenMAP is meant to (1) provide a flexible tool for systematically analyzing impacts of changes in environmental quality in a timely fashion, (2) ensure that stakeholders can understand the assumptions underlying the analysis, and (3) adequately address uncertainty and variability. BenMAP uses a ""damage-function"" approach to estimate the health benefits of a change in air quality. The major components of the damage-function approach are population estimates, population exposure, adverse health effects, and economic costs. To demonstrate BenMAP's ability to analyze PM2.5 pollution control policy scenarios, we assess two sample applications: (1) benefits of a national-level air quality control program, and (2) benefits of attaining two annual PM2.5 standards in California (annual average standards of 15 μg/m3 and 12 μg/m3). In the former, we estimate a scenario where control of PM2.5 emissions results in $100 billion of benefits annually. In the analysis of alternative standards, we estimate that attaining the more stringent standard (12 μg/m3) would result in approximately 2000 fewer premature deaths each year than the 15 μg/m3 achieves. BenMAP has a number of features to help clarify the analysis process. It allows the user to record in a configuration all of the choices made during an analysis. Configurations are especially useful for recreating already existing policy analyses.

Increasing habitat connectivity at the landscape-scale has a vital role to play in the conservation of species restricted to such remnant patches, especially as species may attempt to track zones of habitat that satisfy their niche requirements as the climate changes. Conservation policies and management strategies frequently advocate corridor creation as one approach to restore connectivity and to facilitate species movements through the landscape. Here we examine the utility of hedgerows as corridors between woodland habitat patches using rigorous systematic review methodology. Systematic searching yielded 26 studies which satisfied the review inclusion criteria. The empirical evidence currently available is insufficient to evaluate the effectiveness of hedgerow corridors as a conservation tool to promote the population viability of woodland fauna. However, the studies did provide anecdotal evidence of positive local population effects and indicated that some species use hedgerows as movement conduits. More replicated and controlled field investigations or long-term monitoring are required in order to allow practitioners and policy makers to make better informed decisions about hedgerow corridor creation and preservation. The benefits of such corridors in regard to increasing habitat connectivity remain equivocal, and the role of corridors in mitigating the effects of climate change at the landscape-scale is even less well understood. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Climate change; Connectivity; Conservation; Habitat fragmentation; Habitat loss; Landscape-scale; Movement; Population; Systematic review; Woodland fauna","anthropogenic effect; climate change; connectivity; ecological approach; habitat corridor; habitat fragmentation; habitat loss; hedgerow; minimum viable population; movement; population dynamics; species conservation; woodland",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847252480

Under steady state conditions and with reasonable fuel preparation, three-way catalytic converters can remove around 98% of legislated pollutants. However, during cold start and gear changes, the transient emissions are not fully converted by the catalyst; the cold start alone contributing typically 90% of the total Cycle Hydrocarbon (HC) emissions for the Euro- IV drive cycle [1]. This paper presents data measured pre and post the three-way catalyst on a EURO- III compliant European manufactured production Port-Fuel-Injection (PFI) gasoline engine running on a FTP drive cycle. The transient emissions were measured using fast response gas analyzers, with time response giving resolution at better than engine firing frequency. The paper examines in some detail, the different unsteady phenomena which produce significant emissions and demonstrates how such advanced instrumentation could be used to identify and subsequently improve emissions. It is concluded that transient emissions data will be a significant aid to meeting current and future emissions legislation.

We assessed the impact of these two global changes on above- and below-ground productivity of grassland communities. Experimental ecosystems containing one, three or nine grassland species were grown in 12 sunlit, climate-controlled chambers in Wilrijk, Belgium. Half of these chambers were exposed to ambient air temperatures, while the other half were warmed by 3 °C. Equal amounts of water were added to heated and unheated communities, so that any increases in evapotranspiration due to warmer conditions would result in a drier soil. Warming led to a decreased productivity of both above-ground plant parts (-18%) and roots (-23%), which coincided with a significantly lower soil water content. Complementarity in resource use and/or facilitation slightly enhanced above-ground productivity in multi-species communities, regardless of the induced warming. Interactive effects between temperature treatment and species richness level were found below-ground, however, where warming nullified the positive effect of richness on root productivity. Future warmer conditions could further increase losses of productivity associated with declining species numbers. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, intersections and other local traffic management measures are not always modeled correctly. It is well known that the specific deceleration and acceleration dynamics of traffic at junctions can influence local noise emission. Finding the best strategy for using traffic modeling results in noise mapping is a current topic of research in the IMAGINE project. In this paper, a case study is presented, consisting of a large set of microscopic traffic simulations and associated noise emission calculations, which provides some insight into the specific dynamics of the noise emission near different types of intersections. It will be shown that it is possible to refine current traffic noise prediction models, based on macroscopic traffic simulation, using a correction on the average vehicle emission, aggregated in lane segments. A spatial approach should be used, in which inbound and outbound lanes are divided into deceleration, queuing, stopline and acceleration zones. Results from regression analysis on the numerical simulations indicate that meaningful relations between noise corrections and traffic flow parameters such as traffic intensity and composition can be deduced. © S.

While many measures to alleviate water scarcity are within the water sector, it is increasingly recognized that many drivers, policies and institutions outside the water sector have large and real implications on how water is being allocated and used. Important drivers for water use include population and income growth, urbanization, trade and other macroeconomic policies, environmental regulations and climate policy. While some of these processes and trends, especially those at global level, may prove difficult to influence directly, it is important to understand their linkages with water issues to analyze the relative impact of various policies in the agricultural and water sectors on water and food security. The strong linkages between economic trends, agricultural policies and water use call for an integrated and multidisciplinary modelling approach. The WATERSIM model, developed by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) is a suitable tool to explore the impacts of water and food related policies on global and regional water demand and supply, food production and the environment.

In Mexico 95% of total logging is conducted in native forests, and 80% of it in pine-oak forests. In this paper we compare the carbon mitigation dynamics of mixed native pine-oak forests in Central Mexico under current management - used as a reference scenario - with two alternative scenarios: (a) oak conservation and (b) oak conservation + bioenergy. To estimate the carbon fluxes for each scenario and each forest type we used the CO2FIX V3.1 model, a user-friendly tool designed to calculate all carbon fluxes in forest stands, forest-derived products and bioenergy technologies based on forest slash and industrial residues. The CO2FIX model applies a cohort-type approach to estimate carbon fluxes in mixed or uneven-aged forests where species groups or age cohorts typically show differences in growth, biomass allocation, intra and inter-cohort competition, and mortality. The product module tracks the carbon in products derived from the forests until the decomposition is complete, whereas the bioenergy module compares total greenhouse gas dynamics of reference and alternative bioenergy technologies, applying IPCC guidelines to estimate the carbon equivalence of the various greenhouse gases. We compare the outcome of the three scenarios in a managed community forest of about 11,000 ha in Michoacan, Central Mexico. The carbon mitigation potential after 20 years varied between 8.2 and 19.3 t C/ha for the oak conservation scenario and between 21.6 and 42.9 t C/ha for the oak conservation-bioenergy scenario. The bioenergy scenario results in a continuous stream of about 1.36 t C/ha of carbon benefits per year, whereas the oak conservation scenario will stop accumulating carbon after 40 years, compared to current forest management and energy generation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Much of the increased analytical relevance of these gases, which include methane, nitrous oxide, and a group of fluorinated compounds, is due to work conducted under the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum (EMF) and facilitated by meetings at Snowmass, Colorado, going back to 1998. The two principal insights from over five years of analysis on NCGGs are (1) the range of economic sectors from which these emissions originate is far larger and more diverse than for carbon dioxide (CO2); and (2) the mitigation costs for these sectors and their associated gases can be lower than for energy-related CO2. Taken together, these two factors result in a larger portfolio of potential mitigation options, and thus more potential for reduced costs, for a given climate policy objective. This is especially important where carbon dioxide is not the dominant gas, on a percentage basis, for a particular economic sector and even for a particular region. This paper provides an analytical history of non-CO2 work and also lays out promising new areas of further research. There are five sections following this introduction. Section 22.2 provides a summary of non-CO2 gases and important economic sectors. Section 22.3 covers early efforts to estimate non-CO2 emissions and mitigation potential.

Methods: We examined the database of all patients who underwent surgery for primary non-small cell lung cancer in our institute. The criteria required for inclusion in this analysis were diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer with synchronous hematogenous solitary metastasis by staging workup with total body computed tomography scan and brain magnetic resonance if indicated, total body positron emission tomography scan, radical surgery for the primary tumors, local treatment of the solitary metastasis, and systemic chemotherapy administration. Results: We analyzed the data from 1,509 patients treated from January 2000 to December 2005: 10 patients (0.7%) satisfied the selection criteria. The median overall survival was 26 months, and the median time to progression was 20 months; 6 patients were alive at the time of analysis, with a median follow-up of 30 months. Four patients were tumor progression-free after 9, 18, 23, and 32 months from the start of their treatment. Conclusions: The presentation of non-small cell lung cancer with a synchronous hematogenous solitary metastasis identified by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography containing complete staging workup is extremely rare.

Unlike the emotions experienced in an individual's personal life, these modal feelings reflect a collective response to the socio-economic-political situation of the society and influence how most people behave toward one another and their government. A government may foster a climate of fear to ensure social control, or it may encourage the formation of heterogeneous social groups to facilitate a climate of trust between people from different groups. On one hand, emotional climates may be viewed as reflecting the relative peacefulness or violence of a society. Thus, an assessment of emotional climate may provide a subjective index of human security to complement objective measures of democracy, human rights, equality, and other factors that we presume are beneficial to human welfare. On the other hand, we may view emotional climates as influences that act to further or to impede the development of the culture of peace advocated by the General Assembly of the United Nations. Thus, their assessment may have predictive power, and measuring a society's emotional climate may help us to create desirable policy. In this article we show that it is possible to measure some important aspects of the emotional climates of three nations that have different degrees of a culture of peace: Norway, the United States, and India. We show that estimates of the collective emotions that constitute climate can be distinguished from reports of personal emotions in that the former are more influenced by nation and the latter by social class. It is the subjective experience of national emotional climate, rather than personal emotional experience, that appears most related to objective indices for the culture of peace in the different nations. © 2007 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues.",,"nation state; peace process; security; social behavior; socioeconomic conditions; welfare economics; Asia; Eurasia; Europe; India; North America; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia; South Asia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249995376

There is probably no other policy area where this shift is clearer than on climate change, and the development of the EU ETS is undoubtedly the most remarkable example of both developments. It was indispensable for all those involved in the development of climate change policy to be able to rely on solid academic work in both Europe and the world at large. It is very welcome for me as a policy-maker that this work is not limited only to conceptual thinking, but also takes in the evaluation of practical choices made in mundane matters such as allocation. This book is therefore a timely contribution for all those involved in the design of further trading schemes around the world for the first Kyoto Protocol period 2008-2012 and beyond. All observers realised that the learning-by-doing phase of the EU ETS in 2005 would be challenging from several perspectives. Perhaps the most important was the absence of a comprehensive database concerning the emissions of the 11,500 installations covered by the EU ETS. Many pragmatic solutions had to be invented on the spot by the national officials in the capitals and in the Commission's offices. © Cambridge University Press 2007 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928279260

We analyzed the optical properties of atmospheric aerosol particles obtained during one such episode using a sun/sky radiometer at two measurement sites: one located in the densely populated and industrialized central part of Israel, and the other in a reference site, about 150 km away. Aerosol optical thickness and volume size distributions showed an increased burden of fine aerosol particles in the central part of Israel. In order to verify the local origin and anthropogenic nature of the effect, the analysis was accompanied by examinations of the synoptic conditions, air mass backward trajectories, and conventional in situ air pollution measurements made by a ground-based sampling station. This case study shows the ability of optical measurements to track urban and industrial atmospheric air pollution expressed by high concentration of fine aerosol particles. In addition, it emphasizes the role of local Israeli air pollution sources and may explain the difference in the properties of long-term aerosol optical observations between the two sites. The advantages of the optical method presented are speed (almost instantaneous), automated measurement, and sensitivity to aerosol particle concentration as well as aerosol size fraction. The drawback is that the optical measurements discussed deal only with aerosol particles and cannot distinguish between different types of pollutant gases. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Aerosol; Air pollution; Case study; Israel; Optical measurements","Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric optics; Boundary layers; Optical properties; Case studies; Optical measurements; Surface inversions; Air pollution; Air pollution; Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric optics; Boundary layers; Optical properties; aerosol; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; ground-based measurement; industrial emission; optical method; optical property; pollutant source; pollution monitoring; size distribution; tracking; urban atmosphere; aerosol; air pollution; analytic method; anthropology; article; concentration (parameters); environmental monitoring; Israel; particle size; particulate matter; radiation detector; Asia; Eurasia; Israel; Middle East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846866032

What we do not understand, however, is how species respond when the stressor no longer exists, especially across landscapes and over a considerable length of time. Once anthropogenic disturbance is removed and if there is an ecological trade-off associated with local adaptation to such an historical stressor, then evolutionary theory would predict evolutionary reversals. On the Boreal Shield, tens of thousands of lakes acidified as a result of SO2 emissions, but many of these lakes are undergoing chemical recovery as a consequence of reduced emissions. We investigated the adaptive consequences of disturbance and recovery to zooplankton living in these lakes by asking (1) if contemporary evolution of acid tolerance had arisen among Leptodiaptomus minutus copepod populations in multiple circum-neutral lakes with and without historical acidification, (2) if L. minutus populations were adaptively responding to reversals in selection in historically acidified lakes that had recovered to pH 6.0 for at least 6-8 years, and (3) if there was a fitness trade-off for L. minutus individuals with high acid tolerance at circum-neutral pH. L. minutus populations had higher acid tolerances in circum-neutral lakes with a history of acidification than in local and distant lakes that were never acidified. However, copepods in circum-neutral acid-recovering lakes were less acid-tolerant than were copepods in lakes with longer recovery time. This adaptive reversal in acid tolerance of L. minutus populations following lake recovery was supported by the results of a laboratory experiment that indicated a fitness trade-off in copepods with high acid tolerances at circum-neutral pH. These responses appear to have a genetic basis and suggest that L. minutus is highly adaptive to changes in environmental conditions. Therefore, restoration managers should focus on removing environmental stressors, and adaptable species will be able to reverse evolutionary responses to environmental disturbance in the years following recovery. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","Acidification history; Adaptive reversal; Anthropogenic disturbance; Boreal shield lakes; Copepods; Ecosystem recovery; Environmental tolerance; Fitness trade-off; Local adaptation; pH; Rapid evolution; Zooplankton","acidification; crustacean; disturbance; evolutionary theory; experimental study; fitness; habitat restoration; human activity; laboratory method; lacustrine environment; local adaptation; pH; pollution tolerance; restoration ecology; trade-off; zooplankton; Boreal Shield; Canada; North America; Copepoda; Leptodiaptomus minutus; acid; fresh water; adaptation; animal; article; copepod; ecosystem; pH; physiology; Acids; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Copepoda; Ecosystem; Fresh Water; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447136131

It was organized under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Environment Canada and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC). Topics included the development of agriculture, land use change, the interactions between physiological properties of vegetation, ecosystem physical properties and climate, the impact of agriculture on weather and climate, interactive mechanisms resulting from human activities, the acquisition of relevant greenhouse gas (GHG) emission data, and the promotion/adoption of management practices to reduce the impact of agriculture on the environment. It was demonstrated that important biophysical forcing with significant climate feedback exist as a result of agriculture-related land use change. It was concluded that biogeochemical forcing is usually considered but that biophysical impacts are not well characterized, and few studies have included both of these aspects. For example, human disturbances of the earth's surface that affect the energy budget might be as important climatologically as GHG emissions arising from land disturbance. It was suggested that current GHG mitigation practices should be reassessed to account for both the biogeochemical and the biogeophysical forcing, and that there are significant opportunities and risks that occur in the complex interactions between agriculture and the environment. Workshop recommendations on how to minimize the impact of agriculture on climate were developed for the scientific community, funding agencies, and the agricultural community. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents an assessment framework that allows the identification of adaptation strategies that are robust (i.e. insensitive) to climate change uncertainties. The framework is applied to a case study of water resources management in the East of England, more specifically to the Anglian Water Services' 25 year Water Resource Plan (WRP). The paper presents a local sensitivity analysis (a 'one-at-a-time' experiment) of the various elements of the modelling framework (e.g., emissions of greenhouse gases, climate sensitivity and global climate models) in order to determine whether or not a decision to adapt to climate change is sensitive to uncertainty in those elements. Water resources are found to be sensitive to uncertainties in regional climate response (from general circulation models and dynamical downscaling), in climate sensitivity and in climate impacts. Aerosol forcing and greenhouse gas emissions uncertainties are also important, whereas uncertainties from ocean mixing and the carbon cycle are not. Despite these large uncertainties, Anglian Water Services' WRP remains robust to the climate change uncertainties sampled because of the adaptation options being considered (e.g. extension of water treatment works), because the climate model used for their planning (HadCM3) predicts drier conditions than other models, and because 'one-at-a-time' experiments do not sample the combination of different extremes in the uncertainty range of parameters. This research raises the question of how much certainty is required in climate change projections to justify investment in adaptation measures, and whether such certainty can be delivered. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

EFs of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), methoxyphenols (MP), levoglucosan (LG), elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) from wheat and Kentucky bluegrass (KBG) stubble burning were quantified in a US EPA test burn facility. The PAH and MP EFs for combined solid+gas phases are 17±8.2 mg kg-1 and 79±36 mg kg-1, respectively, for wheat and 21±15 mg kg-1 and 35±24 mg kg-1, respectively, for KBG.

Positive artifacts associated with OC sampling were evaluated and remedied with a two-filter system. EC and OC accounted for almost two-thirds of PM2.5 mass, while LG accounted for just under 3% of the PM2.5 mass. Since EFs of these pollutants generally decreased with increasing combustion efficiency (CE), identifying and implementing methods of increasing the CEs of burns would help reduce their emissions from agricultural field burning. PAH, OC and EC EFs are comparable to other similar studies reported in literature. MP EFs appear dependent on the stubble type and are lower than the EFs for hard and softwoods reported in literature, possibly due to the lower lignin content in wheat and KBG. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide (DCD), in reducing N2O emissions from animal urine patches in four different soils located in different regions of New Zealand with different soil, climatic and management conditions. The four soils are Templeton fine sandy loam and Lismore stony silt loam in Canterbury in the South Island, Horotiu silt loam in the Waikato region and Taupo pumice sand near Lake Taupo, both in the North Island. Results showed that the application of a fine-particle suspension nitrification inhibitor, DCD, to grazed pasture soils was very effective in reducing N2O emissions in all four different soils. Total N2O emissions (over 69-137 days) from animal urine patches ranged from 1 to 20.9 kg N2O-N ha-1 without DCD. These were reduced to 0.31-5.7 kg N2O-N ha-1 by the use of DCD, representing 61-73% reductions (with an average of 70% reduction). The N2O-N emission factor from animal urine N, EF 3, was reduced from an average of 0.9 to 0.3% by the use of DCD.

Data from the 2001 farm survey conducted by the Ecole Nationale d'Economie Appliquée were used to parameterize a spatially explicit econometric-process simulation model for the peanut-millet production system. The economic simulation model was used to simulate a carbon-payment scheme that requires farmers to apply higher fertilizer rates and incorporate some crop residues into the soil. The results show that the combination of increased fertilizer use and crop residue incorporation could result in the supply of marketable quantities of carbon that could be sequestered in the soils of the Nioro region. However, the sensitivity of results to the levels of labor costs of incorporating crop residues, the value of crop residues, and the transaction costs of implementing carbon payment schemes, suggests the need for better data on these variables and for an accurate assessment of the capabilities of local institutions to implement carbon contracts. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The evaluation procedure relies on the assessment of energy-related externalities by exploiting the methodology developed in the framework of the ExternE project. The analysis focuses on 2 industrial units located in the Greater Athens area and examines three types of abatement measures that can be used independently of the extent energy saving or end-of-pipe emission reduction measures are used: substitution of fuel oil with natural gas, relocation of the units several hundreds of kilometers far from Athens and increase of stack height in the same site. It results that the use of natural gas is by far the most effective among these measures, leading to a reduction of more than 90% of both local and regional damages. The relative effectiveness of the examined measures does not change if the significant uncertainties associated with the accounting procedure are taken into account, while inclusion of the external cost due to greenhouse gases emissions is further accentuating the advantages of natural gas. Moreover, it is shown that the quantifiable energy-related external costs of a single industrial product, may be very low compared to the corresponding private costs, but they sum up to significantly high damages to society if we take into account the total energy consumption in the industrial sector. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

With the exception of taxes on gasoline and ""gas guzzlers,"" a majority of respondents supported all other mitigation policies. Multivariate analyses revealed that greater trust in environmentalists and less trust in industry, greater recognition of the consequences of climate change, higher income, being black, and older age were predictive of greater policy support.

This heat stress intensification is due to preferential warming of the hot tail of the daily temperature distribution, with 95th percentile maximum and minimum temperature magnitude increasing more than 75th percentile magnitude. This preferential warming of the hot tail is dictated in large part by a surface moisture feedback, with areas of greatest warm-season drying showing the greatest increases in hot temperature extremes. Fine-scale topographic and humidity effects help to further dictate the spatial variability of the heat stress response, with increases in dangerous Heat Index magnified in coastal areas. Further, emissions deceleration substantially mitigates heat stress intensification throughout the Mediterranean region, implying that emissions reductions could reduce the risk of increased heat stress in the coming decades.

We examined how plant species richness (1 or 16 species), elevated [CO2] (ambient or 560 ppm), and inorganic N addition (0 or 4 g·m-2·yr-1) affected ecosystem N losses, specifically leaching of dissolved inorganic N (DIN) and organic N (DON) in a grassland field experiment in Minnesota, USA. We observed greater DIN leaching below 60 cm soil depth in the monoculture plots (on average 1.8 and 3.1 g N·m-2·yr-1 for ambient N and N-fertilized plots respectively) than in the 16-species plots (0.2 g N·m -2·yr-1 for both ambient N and N-fertilized plots), particularly when inorganic N was added. Most likely, loss of complementary resource use and reduced biological N demand in the monoculture plots caused the increase in DIN leaching relative to the high-diversity plots. Elevated [CO2] reduced DIN concentrations under conditions when DIN concentrations were high (i.e., in N-fertilized and monoculture plots). Contrary to the results for DIN, DON leaching was greater in the 16-species plots than in the monoculture plots (on average 0.4 g N·m -2·yr-1 in 16-species plots and 0.2 g N·m2·yr-1 in monoculture plots). In fact, DON dominated N leaching in the 16-species plots (64% of total N leaching as DON), suggesting that, even with high biological demand for N, substantial amounts of N can be lost as DON. We found no significant main effects of elevated [CO2] on DIN or DON leaching; however, elevated [CO 2] reduced the positive effect of inorganic N addition on DON leaching, especially during the second year of observation. Our results suggest that plant species richness, elevated [CO2], and N deposition alter DIN loss primarily through changes in biological N demand. DON losses can be as large as DIN loss but are more sensitive to organic matter production and turnover. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","Dissolved inorganic nitrogen; Dissolved organic nitrogen; Drainage; Elevated CO2; Grassland; Leaching; Lysimeter; Nitrogen deposition; Nitrogen loss; Plant species richness","carbon dioxide; dissolved inorganic nitrogen; dissolved organic nitrogen; grassland; leaching; lysimeter; nitrogen compound; nutrient loss; species diversity; species richness; Minnesota; North America; United States; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; article; biodiversity; metabolism; plant; Poaceae; soil; Biodiversity; Carbon Dioxide; Nitrogen; Plants; Poaceae; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247114981

The collected information, mainly originating in Samnium River Region (SRR), were codified to obtain quantitative indices representative of a preliminary reconstruction of the precipitation anomalies. Historical written records of weather conditions that affect agriculture and living conditions have been taken as a proxy for instrumental observations of the relative wetness and dryness. As a consequence a numerical index was established to characterize the rainfall regime and its evolution. So, for the first time a series of the precipitation anomalies in SRR-continental southern Italy during the second half of the Little Ice Age was generated, and subsequently jointed to the instrumental series (1869-2002). Afterwards, in order to identify possible climatic change situations from 1675 today Normalized Cumulative Anomalies (NCA)-serie's and Climograms were produced. This historical period offered a sufficient range of natural variability in climate and circulation together with their relationships. Wettest period were detected in the 19th century, while that driest in the 18th century. However, the Mediterranean climate appearing from our study is far more complex than can be captured by a simple classification.

To begin to explain how differing effects on host resistance might arise after exposure to PM2.5 from various sites, we hypothesized that select metals (e.g., V, Al, and Mn) in each PM2.5 caused changes in alveolar macrophage (AM) Fe status that, ultimately, would lead to altered antibacterial function. To test this, iron-response protein (IRP) binding activity in a rat AM cell line was assessed after exposure to Fe alone and in conjunction with V, Mn, and/or Al at ratios of V:Fe, Al:Fe, or Mn:Fe encountered in PM2.5 samples from New York City, Los Angeles, and Seattle. Results indicated that V and Al each significantly altered IRP activity, though effects were not consistently ratio-(i.e., dose-) dependent; Mn had little impact on activity. We conclude that the reductions in Fe status detected here via the IRP assay arose, in part, from effects on transferrin-mediated Fe3 + delivery to the AM. Ongoing studies using this assay are allowing us to better determine: (1) whether mass (and/or molar) relationships between Fe and V, Al, and/or Mn in any PM2.5 sample consistently govern the extent of change in AM Fe status; (2) how much any specified PM2.5 constituent (metal or nonmetal) contributes to the overall disruption of Fe status found induced by an intact parent sample; and (3) whether induced changes in binding activity are relatable to other changes expected to occur in the AM, that is, in IRP-dependent mRNA/levels of ferritin/transferrin receptor and Fe-dependent functions. These studies demonstrate that pollutant-induced effects on lung cell Fe status can be assessed in a reproducible manner using an assay that can be readily performed by investigators who might otherwise have no access to other very costly analytical equipment, such as graphite atomic absorption or x-ray fluorescence spectro(photo)meters.

It has been observed that hydrocarbon treated wastewaters still contain high COD and a number of intermediates. This suggests that the required catabolic gene pool for further degradation might be absent in the system or, that its titer value is not significant enough. By providing the desired catabolic potential, the overall efficiency of the treatment system can be improved. This study aims to demonstrate this concept by bioaugmentation of a lab-scale reactor treating refinery wastewater with a consortium having the capacity to complement the alkB genotype to the available microbial population. Methods. Two reactors were set up using activated biomass collected from a refinery treatment plant and operated at a continuous mode for a period of 8 weeks. The feed to both reactors was kept constant. Crude oil was spiked regularly. One reactor was bioaugmented with a consortium previously described for crude oil spill remediation. The efficiency of the bioaugmented reactor was demonstrated by reduced COD. The changes in the microbial population over a period of time were analyzed by RAPD. Catabolic activity of the biomass in both reactors was monitored by PCR. The presence of the catabolic loci was confirmed by Southern Hybridization. Results and Discussion. 52.2% removal of COD was observed in the bioaugmented reactor while only 15.1% reduction of COD was observed in the reactor without bioaugmentation. The change in microbial population can be seen from the 4th week, which also corresponds to improved catabolic activity. The presence of the bedA locus was seen in all samples, which indicates the presence of aromatic degraders, but the appearance of the alkB locus, from the 6th week onwards, which was observed only in the samples from the bioaugmented reactor. The results suggest that the gene pool of the bioaugmented reactor has catabolic loci that can degrade accumulated intermediates, thus improving the efficiency of the system. Conclusions. In this study, improvement of efficiency of bioremediation was demonstrated by addition of catabolic loci that are responsible for degradation. Bioaugmentation was carried out in biomass that was collected from an ETP (effluent treatment plant) treating hydrocarbon containing wastewater to study the strategies for improvement of the treatment system. Biostimulation, only marginally improved the efficiency, when compared to bioaugmentation. The improved efficiency was demonstrated by COD removal. The presence of the alkB locus suggests the importance of a catabolic gene pool that acts on accumulated intermediates. It is well documented that straight chain aliphatics and intermediates of aromatic compounds after ring cleavage, accumulate in refinery wastewater systems, thereby hindering further degradation of the wastewater. Supplementation of a catabolic gene pool that treats the lower pathway compounds and alkanes will improve the overall efficiency. In this study, results suggest that the alkB locus can also be used to monitor the degradative mode of the activated biomass. Recommendations and Perspectives. Pollution from petroleum and petroleum products around the globe are known to have grave consequences on the environment. Bioremediation, using activated sludge, is one option for the treatment of such wastes. Effluent treatment plants are usually unable to completely degrade the wastewater being treated in the biological unit (the aerator chambers). The efficiency of degradation can be improved by biostimulation and bioaugmentation. This study demonstrates the improved efficiency of a treatment system for wastewater containing hydrocarbons by bioaugmentation of a consortium that supports degradation. Further experiments on a pilot scale are recommended to assess the use of bioaugmentation on a large scale. The use of molecular tools, like DNA probes for alkB, to monitor the system also needs to be explored. © 2007 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).","alkB; Bioaugmentation; Catabolic potential; COD removal; Effluent treatment plant (ETP); Petroleum hydrocarbons; Petroleum refinery wastewater","bacterial DNA; oxygen; petroleum; activated sludge; bacterium; biodegradation; bioreactor; bioremediation; chemical oxygen demand; efficiency measurement; genetics; genotype; hydrocarbon; microbial community; oil pollution; petrochemical industry; refining industry; waste treatment; wastewater; anaerobic bacterium; article; bioreactor; evaluation; genetics; human; metabolism; microbiology; polymerase chain reaction; sewage; water pollutant; Bacteria, Anaerobic; Bioreactors; DNA, Bacterial; Humans; Oxygen; Petroleum; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Microbiology; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846851977

Chemical compound specific emission factors were obtained for different months of the year. Net-leaf oak is an isoprene emitter whereas the other tree species emit monoterpenes. α-Pinene and linalool are the main compounds emitted from sacred fir and patula pine, respectively. In general, the emission of monoterpenes is temperature dependent, whereas α-pinene emission of sacred fir is controlled by light and temperature like the isoprene emission of net-leaf oak. All isoprenoids show a strong seasonality which is plant species specific. Emission factors for the conifers were high in October and low in April (sacred fir: 6.07 μ g C g- 1 dw h- 1 in October and 0.02 μ g C g- 1 dw h- 1 in April; patula pine: 4.22 μ g C g- 1 dw h- 1 in October and 1.13 μ g C g- 1 dw h- 1 in June). Isoprene emission potential of net-leaf oak was very variable in the different seasons with low source strengths in July (rainy season: 1.19 μ g C g- 1 dw h- 1) and November (cold/dry season: 18.50 μ g C g- 1 dw h- 1) but high in May (warm/dry season: 66.27 μ g C g- 1 dw h- 1). The results indicate that present biogenic emission inventories of the Mexico City area have to be revised by using the new emission factors of native tree species including the seasonal impact. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was conducted to quantify annual emission rates (ERs) of greenhouse gases (GHGs)-methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from naturally ventilated swine gestation (GE), farrowing (FA), nursery (NU) and growing-finishing (GF) barns under typical operational conditions in suburban Beijing, China. Variables relative to the GHG ERs were measured every two months for a one-year period, with each measurement episode lasting 72 h. Air exchange rate of the naturally ventilated barns was estimated using CO2 balance method. The annual mean daily GHG ERs (mean ± SD), expressed in g d- 1 AU- 1(AU = animal unit = 500 live body weight), for the GE, FA, NU, and GF barns were, respectively, 5920 ± 440, 7490 ± 110, 29 670 ± 1090 and 16 730 ± 1060 for CO2; 9.6 ± 1.9, 9.6 ± 3.6, 58.4 ± 21.8 and 32.1 ± 11.7 for CH4; and 0.75 ± 0.56, 0.54 ± 0.15, 1.29 ± 0.37 and 0.86 ± 0.75 for N2O. The GHG ER values from the current study paralleled those reported in the literature in some cases but differed considerably in other cases.

Therefore, a proteomic and biochemical study of anaerobic growth in 'Ferroplasma acidarmanus' Fer1 has been carried out. Anaerobic growth in Ferroplasma spp. occurred by coupling oxidation of organic carbon with the reduction of Fe 3+; but sulfate, nitrate, sulfite, thiosulfate, and arsenate were not utilized as electron acceptors. Rates of Fe3+ reduction were similar to other acidophilic chemoorganotrophs. Analysis of the 'F. acidarmanus' Fer1 proteome by 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed ten key proteins linked with central metabolic pathways ≥4 fold up-regulated during anaerobic growth. These included proteins putatively identified as associated with the reductive tricarboxylic acid pathway used for anaerobic energy production, and others including a putative flavoprotein involved in electron transport. Inhibition of anaerobic growth and Fe3+ reduction by inhibitors suggests the involvement of electron transport in Fe3+ reduction.

Although receptor models have been used to do source apportionment, they do not fully take into account the chemical reactions (including photochemical reactions) involved in the formation of secondary fine particles. Secondary fine particles are formed from photochemical and other reactions involving precursor gases, such as sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, ammonia, and volatile organic compounds. This paper presents the results of modeling work aimed at developing a source apportionment of primary and secondary PM 2.5. On-road mobile source and point source inventories for the state of Tennessee were estimated and compiled. The national emissions inventory for the year 1999 was used for the other states. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Models3/ Community Multi-Scale Air Quality modeling system was used for the photochemical/secondary particulate matter modeling. The modeling domain consisted of a nested 36-12-4-km domain. The 4-km domain covered the entire state of Tennessee. The episode chosen for the modeling runs was August 29 to September 9, 1999. This paper presents the approach used and the results from the modeling and attempts to quantify the contribution of major source categories, such as the on-road mobile sources (including the fugitive dust component) and coal-fired power plants, to observed PM2.5 concentrations in Tennessee. The results of this work will be helpful in policy issues targeted at designing control strategies to meet the PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standards in Tennessee.

This water has to be analyzed with relation to the chemical composition to deduce the environmental impact of its discharge after a treatment process. Therefore, a study was carried out to evaluate preliminarily the BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals contents in produced water samples taken from effluents of the Bonsucesso treatment plant located in the city of Carmópolis, the most important oil and gas producer in the State of Sergipe, North-east of Brazil. Three methods were optimized to determine the target compounds. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were determined by gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS), volatile aromatic hydrocarbons (BTEX) by gas chromatography with photoionization detector (GC/PID) and metals were analyzed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). The results showed that concentrations of the target compounds in these samples ranged from 96.7 to 1397 μg L- 1 for BTEX, from 0.9 to 10.3 μg L- 1 for PAHs and from 0.003 to 4540 mg L- 1 for metals. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The imaging spectrometer Observatoire pour la Minéralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces et l'Activité (OMEGA) of Mars Express contributes to such a task by regularly acquiring hyperspectral images of the polar regions in the 0.35-5.10 μ m range. We analyze five OMEGA observations that were acquired over the high southern latitudes in 2004 at the end of summer (LS = 335-348{ring operator}). We conduct statistical analyses of data as well as radiative transfer modelings of selected spectra in order to investigate the nature, distribution and properties of various icy terrains: the bright permanent polar cap (BPPC), the layered deposits (SPLD), and the seasonal accumulations of water frost (SFA). Annealed CO2 ice, potentially polycrystalline, dominates the BPPC and contains trace amounts of dust and water probably trapped in the cap during southern winter. Vast areas of the BPPC are quite homogeneous with dust and water contents of ≈ 0.03-0.06 and ≈ 0.02-0.06 wt%, respectively, but we observe larger variations for specific regions. The BPPC lays on a water-rich (≈ 75 wt %) basement that emerges at the edges of the cap. In the circumpolar region, we observe the superficial part of the SPLD that shows a mixture of perennial H2O ice (up to ≈ 70 wt %) and dust. The SPLD are generally buried under an optically thick layer of sand or of seasonal frost accumulations. The SFA are composed of water ice (≈ 65-70 wt%) and dust and cover large areas at the outskirts of the BPPC or at distance from it. We also found intermediate situations (≈ 20 water wt%) between the SFA and the dust cover. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

These depositional sequences are characterized in terms of vertical and lateral litho- and biofacies changes. Using accurate ammonite biostratigraphic control, sequence boundaries are assigned to the lowermost polymorphum Zone (SBT1), polymorphum-levisoni Zone boundary (SBT2), intra-bifrons Zone (SBT3) and uppermost bonarelli Zone (SBT4). Maximum flooding intervals are identified in the uppermost polymorphum (ST1), uppermost levisoni (ST2) and uppermost bifrons (ST3) Zones.

We used data spanning 25 years (1981-2005) from temperate headwaters at Llyn Brianne (UK) to test three hypotheses: (1) stream macroinvertebrates vary with winter climate; (2) ecological effects attributable to directional climate change and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are distinguishable and (3) climatic effects on macroinvertebrates depend on whether streams are impacted by acidification. Positive (i.e. warmer, wetter) NAO phases were accompanied by reduced interannual stability (=similarity) in macroinvertebrate assemblage in all streams, but associated variations in composition occurred only in acid moorland. The NAO and directional climate change together explained 70% of interannual variation in temperature, but forest and moorland streams warmed respectively by 1.4 and 1.7° C (P <0.001) between 1981 and 2005 after accounting for NAO effects. Significant responses among macroinvertebrates were confined to circumneutral streams, where future thermal projections (+1, +2, +3° C) suggested considerable change. Spring macroinvertebrate abundance might decline by 21% for every 1°C rise. Although many core species could persist if temperature gain reached 3° C, 4-10 mostly scarce taxa (5-12% of the species pool) would risk local extinction. Temperature increase in Wales approaches this magnitude by the 2050s under the Hadley HadCM3 scenarios. These results support all three hypotheses and illustrate how headwater stream ecosystems are sensitive to climate change. Altered composition and abundance could affect conservation and ecological function, with the NAO compounding climate change effects during positive phases. We suggest that acidification, in impacted streams, overrides climatic effects on macroinvertebrates by simplifying assemblages and reducing richness. Climatic processes might, nevertheless, exacerbate acidification or offset biological recovery. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Insects; Models; NAO; Rivers; Streams; Temperature","acidification; annual variation; climate change; ecological impact; environmental factor; freshwater ecosystem; macroinvertebrate; North Atlantic Oscillation; species richness; stream; temperature effect; Eurasia; Europe; Llyn Brianne; United Kingdom; Wales; Western Europe; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247603419

In a subset of these households (n = 110), ARTI undertook a comprehensive assessment of the impact of the improved Laxmi (vented) and Bhagyalaxmi (unvented) stoves on indoor air quality. Measurements of carbon monoxide (CO) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were taken for a 48-hour period in kitchens before and after installation of improved stoves. One year after the installation of the improved stoves, the 48-hr mean CO concentration was reduced, on average, by 39% for the Laxmi and 38% for the Bhagyalaxmi. Similarly, the 48-hr mean PM2.5 concentration was reduced, on average, by 24% for the Laxmi and 49% for the Bhagyalaxmi. Key challenges during the monitoring were: (1) motivating household members to purchase the improved cookstoves (ICSs); (2) ensuring that the households made the transition to using the ICSs; and (3) maintaining high standards of data quality as a field team. Despite the challenges, the importance of monitoring and evaluation remains critical in verifying the benefits of improved stove designs. Building on the lessons that we have learned, future efforts will focus on monitoring and evaluating fewer villages to concentrate resources, establishing a stronger rapport with study participants, and better understanding the dynamics of stove adoption in each home.

Seed collections were made from 12 of the 14 populations that were identified through explorations and seedlings were established in either species, species/provenance, provenance/progeny trials or arboreta plantings in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and South Africa. Productivity of P. herrerae in 13 field trials ranged from 3 to 24 m3/ha/year (overbark), assessed at between 8 and 13 years. P. herrerae from temperate areas in Mexico is best adapted to cool dry areas in South Africa where minimum nighttime winter temperatures range -5 °C to 7 °C. Provenances of P. herrerae from subtropical regions in Mexico grew well in areas of similar climate in Brazil, Colombia, and South Africa where frosts seldom occurs. P. herrerae exhibited good stem form in most trials but growth of temperate sources was not comparable to that of P. patula, P. radiata or P. taeda, even when differences due to levels of genetic improvement were considered. The subtropical source of P. herrerae from Oaxaca (Juquila) grew as well as average unimproved sources of P. tecunumanii from Chiapas, Mexico when planted on appropriate sites in trials in Brazil, Colombia, and South Africa. Within provenance heritability (h2) for height and diameter of P. herrerae ranged from 0.08 to 0.14 in South Africa and from 0.44 to 0.46 in Brazil in two orthogonal trials. Heritability values for forking were 0.10 and 0.06 at each location, respectively. The ecological niche for P. herrerae as an exotic plantation species appears to climatically fall between (and often overlap with) areas that are currently being commercially planted to subtemperate species like P. greggii var. australis and the subtropical species P. tecunumanii. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The participation of stakeholders in defining appropriate adaptation strategies is increasingly recognized as a critical element in the translation of climate change impact research into effective actions to reduce future vulnerability, yet the process by which stakeholders are included in such initiatives is not well-defined. This article presents the results of a pilot project in which a participatory approach was employed to identify and evaluate adaptation options to climate change scenarios for Sonora's capital city, Hermosillo. In an iterative process, stakeholders representing different water users and managers in the city met to discuss climate change scenarios, identify specific adaptation options, and evaluate a subset of options for possible future implementation. This process enabled the focus of the investigation on those adaptations that addressed not only concerns with the potential future impacts of climate change but also the immediate and pressing concerns about development patterns and water use in the city. Two of the adaptations to climate change identified by stakeholders would also reduce energy demand. The simplicity of the approach makes it a feasible model for adaptation initiatives in other regions of Mexico and in other countries in Latin America. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.","Adaptation; Mexico; Stakeholder participation; Water management","climate change; climate effect; local participation; stakeholder; vulnerability; water availability; water management; water use; Hermosillo; Mexico [North America]; North America; Sonora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447095160

Multinationals may be more concerned with intellectual property rights violations, corruption, and potential political instability, but the Chinese government, NGOs, and the Chinese press have been focused squarely on the country's energy shortages, soil erosion, lack of water, and pollution problems, which are so severe they might constrain GDP growth. What's more, the Chinese expect the international community to take the lead in environmental protection. If that doesn't happen, multinationals face clear risks to their operations, their workers' health, and their reputations. In factoring environmental issues into their China strategies, foreign firms need to be both defensive, taking steps to reduce harm, and proactive, investing in environmental protection efforts. CocaCola, for example, installed state-of-the-art bottling plants in China that operate with no net loss of water resources. Mattel increased the safety of its Barbiemanufacturing process to protect workers' health. With its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, GE is shrinking its environmental footprint in China; more proactively, GE is working closely with the Chinese government and scientists to develop clean coal, water purification, and water reuse technologies.

As Wigley et al. (1996) showed, this goal implies a peak in emissions of carbon to the atmosphere followed by a decline in global carbon emissions that goes on indefinitely thereafter. Carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning is the dominant anthropogenic emission to the atmosphere. A central question in limiting emissions is therefore how to provide the energy services that are at present delivered predominantly using fossil fuels, without concurrently releasing CO2 into the atmosphere. Prior analysis, including that of Edmonds et al. (2004), has shown that carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) has the potential to reduce emissions and limit emissions mitigation costs. Furthermore, earlier surveys of aggregate global CO2 storage capacity such as Edmonds et al. (2001) indicate that potential gross global reservoir capacity is larger – potentially many times larger – than the scale of gross global CO2 capture from energy and industrial processes over the course of the twenty-first century. However, this simplification does not reflect the reality that CO2 would be captured at point sources and deposited into specific reservoirs. Work has begun to consider local source–reservoir relationships within a specific country (see for example Dooley et al. [2004]). The analysis we present here is the first to examine the implications of regionally heterogeneous CO2 storage on a global scale. © Cambridge University Press 2007, Cambridge University Press, 2010.",,"Aluminum alloys; Carbon dioxide; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Anthropogenic emissions; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Emissions mitigation; Fossil fuel burning; Global carbon emission; Industrial processs; Integrated assessment models; Reservoir capacity; Carbon capture",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70749090041

The large-scale atmospheric circulation, as expressed by the mean sea level pressure (MSLP) patterns in the wider Euro-Atlantic region, plays a significant role in the climate variability in winter, but less in summer. In. winter, high-altitude temperatures are markedly linked with the Northern Hemisphere (NH) zonal circulation, as expressed by the NH annular mode (NAM), whereas the low-level temperature field is associated more with the circulation over the NE Atlantic. The Alpine mountain chain delimits the different winter precipitation regimes between the northern and southern side of the GAR. While a British Isles-centered pressure pattern plays the principal role in influencing northern Alpine precipitation, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and in particular its Mediterranean component, is the large-scale atmospheric mode affecting precipitation over the southern Alpine region. The impact of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon on GAR climate is weak, though it is distinctly manifested within intermittent multidecadal periods. The most pronounced impact is found for late-autumn and early-winter temperature and late-winter precipitation. In these cases, GAR climate exhibits significant correlations with ENSO state of the preceding early autumn and late summer. The ENSO impact is associated with atmospheric pressure anomaly patterns in the European region indicating modifications of large-scale circulation whose effects are also found in the climates of larger areas of Europe.

This day marked the start of the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), a cap-and-trade programme inspired by the Kyoto Protocol, but more importantly, the prototype of the multinational collaboration that will be required if a global climate change regime is to be established. This achievement is remarkable in view of the differing circumstances of these nations, their varying obligations under the Kyoto Protocol and their uneven commitment to climate policy. Even more remarkable is the ambition of the project in its scope, timing and novelty. Commitments under the Kyoto Protocol were known as of the end of 1997, but as late as 2000, when a formal discussion on including a cap-and-trade system in the EU's Climate Change Programme began (European Commission 2000), it would have been visionary to expect that more than a few of the nations most committed to climate change policy would adopt such a policy, not to mention those less committed to effective action, those hostile to emissions trading or those not facing binding targets under the Kyoto Protocol. Moreover, the decision to have a pre-Kyoto trial period from 2005 to 2007 compressed the timing to beyond what seemed feasible. © Cambridge University Press 2007 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878455058

The resulting global dimethyl sulfide simulation framework was then subjected to variation in plant cell precursor content and the kinetic form of removal terms. Chi square type merit minima were computed analytically along a release rate axis over global, low latitude and localized domains. A band of width 60 degrees centered on the equator proved to be the most effective optimization area because it greatly exceeded resolution of the validation data set but avoided fronts where the driver ecodynamics module overpredicts chlorophyll. Loss terms involving bacterial consumption formulated as bimolecular kinetics and photochemical decay sensitized by dissolved organic matter independently provided superior agreement with data by modulating peaks along the equatorial divergence. Factor of ten reductions in the sulfur precursor content of diatoms or small noncalcite secretors respectively flattened and exaggerated the same features, but intermediate compositions were not tested. The parameter suite of constant intracellular sulfur, second order osmotrophy (microbial uptake) and photochemistry set proportional to photosynthetic radiation is recommended and packaged as a startup mechanism. This particular combination optimizes large-scale reduced sulfur fields across well-understood ecosystems while simultaneously maintaining parsimony. Visualizations from the inverse procedure are offered for multiple mechanisms, as mappings of both normalized deviation and concentration. The value of the rate constant for injection from plant and animal material was often determined to be of the order weeks, consistent with emission via grazing or aging/mortality. Refinement of the model will require linkage to the ecological flows associated with cell disruption, accounting of elemental metabolic stresses which in part govern reduced sulfur storage, addition of true microbial ecology, further studies of open ocean sulfur photochemistry and longer duration/more detailed optimization exercises. A stepwise strategy is outlined for moving through this task list. In next-generation experiments it may prove expedient to fix sulfur content ratios within taxonomic classes while varying the maximum cell content. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a study to predict the response of a cryptogam species, the epiphytic lichen Lecanora populicola, to climate change scenarios. L. populicola is an easily dispersed species that occurs predictably in a widespread habitat, i.e. aspen stands. The study area was geographically constrained to a clean-air region of northern Britain. Thus, using the popular bioclimatic envelope approach, the projected climatic response of L. populicola is not expected to be confounded by air-borne pollution effects, or dispersal and habitat limitation. Non-parametric multiplicative regression was used to describe the response of L. populicola to seven climate variables, and an optimum model projected using UKCIP02 scenarios, comprising two time-frames (2020 s and 2050 s) and two greenhouse gas emission levels (low and high). Model predictions suggest an overall increase in the potential range of L. populicola, and, by association, several other 'Boreal' lichen epiphytes. Projected increases in the occurrence of L. populicola are associated with predicted summer drying, and indicate a putative threat to negatively associated 'oceanic' lichens. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

While these responses are well documented in many species, implications for plant growth and nutrient cycling in native ecosystems are not clear. Here we present data on 18 years of measurement of above and belowground biomass, tissue [N] and total standing crop of N for a Scirpus olneyi-dominated (C3 sedge) community, a Spartina patens-dominated (C4 grass) community and a C3 -C4-mixed species community exposed to ambient and elevated (ambient +340ppm) atmospheric [CO2] in natural salinity and sea level conditions of a Chesapeake Bay wetland. Increased biomass production (shoots plus roots) under elevated [CO2] in the S. olneyi-dominated community was sustained throughout the study, averaging approximately 35% while no significant effect of elevated [CO2] was found for total biomass in the C4 -dominated community. We found a significant decline in C4 biomass (correlated with rising sea level) and a concomitant increase in C3 biomass in the mixed community. This shift from C4 to C3 was accelerated by the elevated [CO2] treatment. The elevated [CO2] stimulation of total biomass accumulation was greatest during rainy, low salinity years: the average increase above the ambient treatment during the three wettest years (1994, 1996, 2003) was 2.9tha-1 but in the three driest years (1995, 1999, 2002), it was 1.2tha-1. Elevated [CO2] depressed tissue [N] in both species, but especially in the S. olneyi where the relative depression was positively correlated with salinity and negatively related with the relative enhancement of total biomass production. Thus, the greatest amount of carbon was added to the S. olneyi-dominated community during years when shoot [N] was reduced the most, suggesting that the availability of N was not the most or even the main limitation to elevated [CO2] stimulation of carbon accumulation in this ecosystem. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Elevated CO2; Net primary productivity; Salinity; Scirpus olneyi; Sea level; Spartina patens","accumulation rate; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon fixation; coastal wetland; grass; intertidal environment; net primary production; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; plant community; salinity; sea level; sedge; Chesapeake Bay; North America; United States; Schoenoplectus americanus; Spartina patens",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846203313

We compare the indicators and measures that five past national-level studies have used and examine how and why their approaches have differed. Other relevant indicator studies of social facets of society as well as vulnerability studies at sub-national level are also examined for lessons regarding best practice. We find that the five studies generally emphasise descriptive measures by aggregating environmental and social conditions. However, they vary greatly both in the types of indicators and measures used and differ substantially in their identification of the most vulnerable countries. Further analysis of scientific approaches underlying indicator selection suggests that the policy relevance of national-level indicators can be enhanced by capturing the processes that shape vulnerability rather than trying to aggregate the state itself. Such a focus can guide the selection of indicators that are representative even when vulnerability varies over time or space. We find that conceptualisation regarding how specific factors and processes influencing vulnerability interact is neither given sufficient consideration nor are assumptions transparently defined in previous studies. Verification has been neglected, yet this process is important both to assess the credibility of any set of measures and to improve our understanding of vulnerability. A fundamental lesson that emerges is the need to enhance our understanding of the causes of vulnerability in order to develop indicators that can effectively aid policy development. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Adaptation; Climate change; Climate policy; Coping; Vulnerability; Vulnerability indicators","adaptation; climate change; environmental conditions; environmental indicator; environmental policy; national planning; policy development; social indicator; vulnerability",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247531537

Forests are also habitats for a large number of species which are important for biodiversity. In some cases, these two roles may conflict. The aim of this study was to model the implications of specific environmental quality objectives on the potential of forestry to reduce net CO2 emissions by addressing interim targets 1 and 2 in the environmental quality objective, sustainable forests for Uppsala County and used this region as a case study. The carbon stock in the biomass, the substitution effect, and the economic consequences associated with six forest management scenarios were considered. The development for the scenarios was simulated at stand level using an empirical model. The results of the study showed that the shortest rotation period was preferable to mitigate net CO2 emissions since it resulted in more biomass that could replace fossil fuel. However, such a strategy might affect sustainable policies negatively. Increasing the extent of mixed stands could be a preferable strategy since it may achieve several objectives. © Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2007.

It begs the question, therefore, what factors were driving this decline in carbon intensity and will this decline be maintained in future? Moreover, what measures can be adopted to ensure a continual decline in carbon intensity? These questions led to increased research in the factors governing CO2 emission in China. This paper quantifies the driving force behind China's primary energy-related carbon intensity and measures the material production sectors' final energy-related carbon intensity. Our results show that the overwhelming contributor to the decline of energy-related carbon intensity was the reduction in real energy intensity. However, policies that focus only on the decline in energy intensity are insufficient to further decrease carbon intensity. The change of primary energy mix can improve the decline of carbon intensity. This should focus on the material production sectors' development strategies and final energy use. Greater emphasis should be given to secondary industry, which needs national and regional governments' policy support. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the input-output approach, CErCmA was designed for scenario analysis of energy requirements and CO2 emissions to support policymakers, planners and others strategically plan for energy demands and environmental protection in China. In the system, major drivers of energy consumption are identified as technology, population, economy and urbanization; scenarios are based on the major driving forces that represent various growth paths. The input-output approach is employed to compute energy requirements and CO2 emissions under each scenario. The development of CErCmA is described in a case study: China's energy requirements and CO2 emissions in 2010 and 2020 are computed based on the input-output table of 1997. The results show that China's energy needs and related CO2 emissions will grow exponentially even with many energy efficiency improvements, and that it will be hard for China to maintain its advantage of low per capita emissions in the next 20 years.

The objectives of this study were to: (i) develop a semiempirical model and forecast average net infiltration rates, using the limited meteorological data from analog meteorological stations, for interglacial (present day), and future monsoon, glacial transition, and glacial climates over the Yucca Mountain region; and (ii) corroborate the computed net infiltration rates by comparing them with the empirically and numerically determined groundwater recharge and percolation rates through the unsaturated zone from published data. This study approached calculations of net infiltration, aridity, and precipitation-effectiveness indices using a modified Budyko's water-balance model, with reference-surface potential evapotranspiration determined from the radiation-based Penman formula. Results of calculations show that net infiltration rates are expected to generally increase from the present-day climate to monsoon climate, to glacial transition climate, and then to the glacial climate, following a power law relationship between net infiltration and precipitation. The forecasting results indicate the overlap between the ranges of net infiltration for different climates. Forecasting of net infiltration for different climate states is subject to numerous uncertainties associated with selecting climate analog sites, using relatively short analog meteorological records, neglecting the effects of vegetation and surface runoff and run-on on a local scale, as well as possible anthropogenically induced climate changes. © Soil Science Society of America.",,"climate prediction; evapotranspiration; infiltration; meteorology; numerical model; Penman-Monteith equation; percolation; potential evapotranspiration; recharge; soil profile; vadose zone; water budget; weather forecasting; Nevada; North America; United States; Yucca Mountain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547864202

BR-163, which is slated to be paved as an export corridor for soybeans via the Amazon River, traverses an area that is largely outside of Brazilian government control. A climate of generalized lawlessness and impunity prevails, and matters related to environment and to land tenure are especially unregulated. Deforestation and illegal logging have accelerated in anticipation of highway paving. Paving would further speed forest loss in the area, as well as stimulate migration of land thieves (grileiros) to other frontiers. An argument is made that the highway should not be reconstructed and paved until after a state of law has been established and it has been independently certified that sufficient governance prevails to secure protected areas and enforce environmental legislation. A waiting period is needed after this is achieved before proceeding with the highway paving. Above all, the logical sequence of steps must be followed, whereby environmental costs are assessed, reported, and weighed prior to making de facto decisions on implementation of infrastructure projects. Deviation from this logical sequence is a common occurrence in many parts of the world, especially in tropical areas. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Amazonia; BR-163; Brazil; Deforestation; Environmental impact; Highways; Roads; Santarém-Cuiabá; Soybeans","Amazonia; BR-163; Environmental legislation; Soybeans; Brazil; Costs; Decision making; Highway systems; Laws and legislation; Roads and streets; Environmental protection; deforestation; environmental impact; environmental policy; infrastructure; logging (timber); pavement; protected area; road; soybean; article; climate; construction work; cost; decision making; deforestation; environment; forest; government regulation; highway; law; logging; migration; soybean; tropics; Brazil; Conservation of Natural Resources; Decision Making; Environment; Soybeans; Transportation; Amazon River; South America; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247350390

The lower position of the ring is typically occupied by the nucleotide base (Bzm), whereas the upper surface coordinates exchangeable ligands. We have found that amino-tetrazole can coordinate to H2O · Cbl (Co3+) with Kd = 10-5-10-6 M. A specific group (presumably tetrazole, TZ) can be easily created in CNBr-activated Sepharose by treatment with N3 -. The prepared matrix (STZ) contained ≈10 mM of the active groups, which bound H2O · corrinoids with Kd = 10-5-10-6 M. Stability of STZ-Cbl bonds gradually increased and reached Kd = 10-7 M over 10-20 h (20 °C, pH 6-7). This effect can be ascribed to partial displacement of Bzm and coordination of TZ to the lower position. The binding was most efficient at pH 4-7 and low ionic strength, yet, noticeable adsorption took place even at extreme conditions, pH 1-9 and I = 0-2 M. Reduced corrins (Co2+) also exhibited high affinity for STZ. The bound ligands could be eluted as H2O · Cbl (pH 0), HO · Cbl (pH 14) or diCN · Cbl (pH 9-12, CN-).

Erosion from fields managed in a conventional winter wheat-summer fallow rotation was monitored during the fallow period near Washtucna, WA, in 2003 and 2004. Loss of soil and PM10 (particulates ≤10 μm in diameter) was measured during six high wind events (sustained wind speed at 3 m height &gt;6.4 m s-1). Soil loss associated with suspension, saltation and creep as well as PM10 emission was used to validate the Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS) erosion submodel. Input parameters for WEPS simulations were measured before each high wind event. The erosion submodel produced no erosion for half of the observed events and over-predicted total soil toss by 200-700 kg ha-1 for the remaining events. The model appears to over-predict total soil loss as a result of overestimating creep, saltation and suspension. The model both over-predicted and underpredicted PM10 loss. High values for the index of agreement (d &gt; 0-5) suggest that the performance of the model is acceptable for the conditions of this study. White the performance of the model is acceptable, improvements can be made in modeling efficiency by better specifying the static threshold friction velocity or coefficients that govern emissions, abrasion and breakage of silt loams on the Columbia Plateau.

However, the carbon dynamics of individual peatland plant species is poorly understood, despite the potential for rising atmospheric CO2 to affect the vegetation's contribution to overall ecosystem carbon function. Here, we examined the effects of 3 years exposure to elevated CO2 (eCO2) on (a) peatland plant community composition and biomass, and (b) plant carbon dynamics and the production of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) using a 13CO2 pulse-chase approach. Results showed that under eCO2, Sphagnum spp. cover declined by 39% (P &lt; 0.05) and Juncus effusus L. cover increased by 40% (P &lt; 0.001). There was a concurrent increase in above- and belowground plant biomass of 115% (P &lt; 0.01) and 96% (P &lt; 0.01), respectively. Vascular species assimilated and turned over more 13CO2-derived carbon than Sphagnum spp. (49% greater turnover of assimilated 13C in J. effusus and F. ovina L. leaf tissues compared with Sphagnum, P &lt; 0.01). Elevated CO2 also produced a 66% rise in DOC concentrations (P &lt; 0.001) and an order of magnitude more 'new' exudate 13DOC than control samples (24 h after 13CO2 pulse-labelling 2.5 ± 0.5 and 0.2 ± 0.1% in eCO2 and control leachate, respectively, P &lt; 0.05). We attribute the observed increase in DOC concentrations under eCO2 to the switch from predominantly Sphagnum spp. to vascular species (namely J. effusus), leading to enhanced exudation and decomposition (litter and peat). The potential for reduced peatland carbon accretion, increased DOC exports and positive feedback to climate change are discussed. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","13CO2 pulse-labelling; Carbon cycling; Carbon sequestration; Dissolved organic carbon; Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide; Exudation; Peatland; Photosynthate turnover; Plant species composition","biomass; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; community composition; ecosystem function; exudation; moss; nutrient dynamics; peatland; photosynthesis; plant community; Juncus effusus; Sphagnum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34748922834

Unlike lower photosynthetic organisms, which only contain A4-GAPDH, the major GAPDH isoform of land plants is made up of A and B subunits, the latter containing a C-terminal extension (CTE) with fundamental regulatory functions. Light-activation of AB-GAPDH depends on the redox state of a pair of cysteines of the CTE, which can form a disulfide bond under control of thioredoxin f, leading to specific inhibition of the NADPH-dependent activity. The tridimensional structure of A2B2-GAPDH from spinach chloroplasts, crystallized in the oxidized state, shows that each disulfide-containing CTE is docked into a deep cleft between a pair of A and B subunits. The structure of the CTE was derived from crystallographic data and computational modeling and confirmed by site-specific mutagenesis. Structural analysis of oxidized A 2B2-GAPDH and chimeric mutant [A+CTE]4-GAPDH revealed that Arg-77, which is essential for coenzyme specificity and high NADPH-dependent activity, fails to interact with NADP in these kinetically inhibited GAPDH tetramers and is attracted instead by negative residues of oxidized CTE. Other subtle changes in catalytic domains and overall conformation of the tetramers were noticed in oxidized A2B2-GAPDH and [A+CTE]4-GAPDH, compared with fully active A4-GAPDH. The CTE is envisioned as a redox-sensitive regulatory domain that can force AB-GAPDH into a kinetically inhibited conformation under oxidizing conditions, which also occur during dark inactivation of the enzyme in vivo. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Calvin cycle; Disulfide; Light/dark; Protein structure; Redox","arginine; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; thioredoxin; article; carbon dioxide fixation; carboxy terminal sequence; catalysis; chloroplast; conformation; disulfide bond; enzyme activation; enzyme inhibition; enzyme structure; enzyme subunit; nonhuman; oxidation; oxidation reduction reaction; photosynthesis; priority journal; protein domain; regulatory mechanism; site directed mutagenesis; spinach; Catalytic Domain; Chloroplasts; Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (NADP+)(Phosphorylating); Light; Oxidation-Reduction; Photosynthesis; Plant Physiology; Protein Conformation; Protein Subunits; Spinacia oleracea; Thioredoxins; Embryophyta; Spinacia oleracea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547488309

Temporal variability in the total abundance of copepods appears to be indicative of the southern spreading of the Northern Current, and therefore of meridional transport of water masses in the Balearic Sea. The results show that the largescale atmospheric variability in the North Atlantic Ocean acts as a main driver of regional meteorological variations and hydrographic patterns in the Balearic Sea area. The clearly most novel insight from this study is that the effects of the North Atlantic climate on hydrographic variability and the abundance of copepods in the studied area are noticeable at monthly scales. Thus, the North Atlantic climate influence on the structure and biogeochemical fluxes in the Western Mediterranean pelagic ecosystems deserve more attention that they have been received so far.

The inner partvs of the creek is affected by the inputs coming from an intensive fish farm and the drainage of an extensive salt marsh area.

Dissolved CH4, CO2 and N2O showed a significant tidal and seasonal variability. Over a tidal cycle, concentrations were always highest during low tide, which points to the influence of the inputs from the fish farm effluent and the drainage of the adjacent salt marsh area, as well as in situ production within the system.

It is projected that a sustained increase in the demand for energy, particularly in developing countries, and the continued reliance on fossil fuels as an energy source, will cause anthropogenic emissions to rise substantially into the future. The continued growth in emissions is expected to significantly increase atmospheric concentrations of green-house gases beyond current levels. Evidence now suggests that these human-induced increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations have the potential to alter the Earth’s climate dramatically, leading to possible environmental and economic damage (Schneider and Sarukhan, 2001). Human-induced climate change is a global phenomenon that is expected to have impacts in all regions of the world, although with differing specific effects. As a result, responding to the climate problem poses several challenges. One key challenge is to design policies that balance the cost of any damage from climate change with the cost of actions to reduce that damage. However, the considerable uncertainties surrounding the causes, nature, and impacts of possible climate change magnify this challenge. A second challenge will be for countries to manage adaptation, which could involve major investments and managing economic and social change. Of course, significant adaptation will occur as a result of economic agents responding to changes in both their physical and economic environments. © Cambridge University Press 2007, Cambridge University Press, 2010.",,"Developing countries; Earth (planet); Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Investments; Anthropogenic activity; Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric concentration; Atmospheric greenhouse; Industrial production; Industrial revolutions; International coordination; Policies and measures; Climate change",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926968108

The aim of this research was to investigate the effects of oxygen surface functional groups, in activated carbons, on the adsorption characteristics of water vapor. Activated carbon G was oxidized using nitric acid and then heat treated in the range 387-894 K to produce a suite of adsorbents with varying oxygen contents in the range 0.4-21.5 wt % daf, but very similar porous structure characteristics, thereby minimizing effects due to changes in porous structure. The type and concentration of surface oxygen groups present in each sample were assessed using TPD, FTIR, Boehm titration, and analytical methods. Water vapor adsorption at low relative pressure was dramatically enhanced by the presence of functional groups, in particular, carboxylic groups. Kinetic profiles for each pressure increment were modeled using a set of nested kinetic models, which allow the adsorption kinetics to be analyzed in relation to the adsorption mechanism. Relationships between water adsorption kinetics at low surface coverage and the type and concentration of oxygen surface functional groups were observed. A two component double exponential kinetic model was used when carboxylic groups were present in significant amounts with a slow kinetic component associated with adsorption on these groups. In the case of carbons where carboxylic groups were only present in, at most, relatively small amounts, a stretched exponential kinetic model was used and the rate constants in the low-pressure region decreased linearly with increasing Henry's Law constant and oxygen content. The results indicate the importance of adsorbate-adsorbent interactions in water adsorption kinetics and are consistent with a site-to-site hopping mechanism between functional groups. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Activated carbon; Adsorption; Functional groups; Heat treatment; Porous materials; Temperature programmed desorption; Adsorbate-adsorbent interactions; Adsorption kinetics; Hydrophobic graphene layers; Kinetic models; Water vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34347329138

However, major tectonic events, such as the break-up of Gondwana, or sea level changes inducing the flooding of vast continental areas, occurred from 120 to 95 Ma resulting in drastic climatic re-organisations. In order to investigate the impact of plate tectonics and sea level change on climate, we performed climatic simulations during the Cenomanian (95 Ma) and Aptian (120 Ma) using an atmospheric general circulation model. Problems with models lie in our knowledge of a few key factors. For examples, the middle Cretaceous sea surface temperature gradient from equator to pole remains an open question and it is not clear yet how flat it was. Two sensitivity experiments for each period prescribing a flatter SST gradient based on oxygen isotopic data have been done in order to test its climatic consequences. We discuss separately the effect of palaeogeography and meridional SST gradient impacts. In the northern hemisphere, the flooding of large continental areas due to sea level rise leads to a more equable climate in the mid-latitudes. However the impact of epicontinental seas varies seasonally from site to site due to local feedbacks. In the southern hemisphere, the breakup of Gondwana deeply affects the climate of this region, moderating the seasonal thermal variations. In addition, we test the impact of a flatter SST gradient on climate and we show that simulations with flat SST gradients compare well with field data. We analyse the remaining model/data discrepancies in terms of missing feedbacks (CO2, vegetation) but also of new measurements that enable to infer a better meridional variation of sea surface temperature. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The commitment to reduce passenger car average CO2 emissions at 140 g/km in 2008 signed by European car manufacturers and the European Commission is up to now the most important initiative towards limiting CO2 emissions from road transportation and particularly from passenger cars. Until today, annual reports show the manufacturers' efforts in limiting CO2 emissions is within the intermediate target set by the commitment and these results are incorporated in emissions estimations and scientific studies. This paper analyses the origin of the progress achieved so far in CO2 emissions and attempts an assessment of the commitment using independent experimental emission data. Additionally, the applicability of the commitment-monitoring data into policy and decision-making tools is being examined. The results indicate that a significant part of the reductions achieved so far is due to a market shift towards diesel vehicle sales and that no reduction factors should be applied yet in CO2 emissions estimation models. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

These changes have taken place during a period in which the primary gases and the wet deposition throughout Europe were extensively monitored. Since the end of the 1970s, for example land based sulphur emissions declined by between 90 and 70% depending on the region. Over the same period the total deposition of sulphur and its partitioning into wet and dry deposition have declined, but the spatial pattern in the reduction in deposition differs from that of emission and has changed with time. Such non-linearities in the emission-deposition relationship are important to understand as they complicate the process of assessing the effects of emission reduction strategies. Observed non-linearities in terrestrial sulphur emission-deposition patterns have been identified in north west Europe due to increases in marine emissions, and are currently slowing the recovery of freshwater ecosystems. Changes in the relative amounts of SO2 and NH3 in air over the last two decades have also changed the affinity of terrestrial surfaces for SO2 and have therefore changed the deposition velocity of SO2 over substantial areas. The consequence of this effect has been the very rapid reduction in ambient SO2 concentration in some of the major source areas of Europe, where NH3 did not change much. Interactions between the different pollutants, generating non-linearities are now being incorporated in long-range transport models to simulate the effects of historical emission trends and to provide projections into the future. This paper identifies non-linearities in emission deposition relationships for sulphur and nitrogen compounds in Europe using data from the EMEP long-rang transport model and measured concentration fields of the major ions in precipitation and of SO 2 and NO2 in surface air. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Nitrogen; Non-linearity; Shipping; Sulphur; Wet and dry deposition","dry deposition; emission control; freshwater ecosystem; long-term change; nitrogen compound; nonlinearity; pollutant transport; pollution monitoring; sulfur dioxide; wet deposition; Eurasia; Europe",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247633010

Suggested approaches entail varied risks of impermanence, delay, high costs, and unknowable side-effects. An under-researched alternative approach is to extract from biomass black (elemental) carbon, which can be permanently sequestered as mineral geomass and may be relatively advantageous in terms of those risks. This paper reviews salient features of black carbon sequestration and uses a high-level quantitative model to compare the approach with the alternative use of biomass to displace fossil fuels. Black carbon has been demonstrated to produce significant benefits when sequestered in agricultural soil, apparently without bad side-effects. Black carbon sequestration appears to be more efficient in general than energy generation, in terms of atmospheric carbon saved per unit of biomass; an exception is where biomass can efficiently displace coal-fired generation. Black carbon sequestration can reasonably be expected to be relatively quick and cheap to apply due to its short value chain and known technology. However, the model is sensitive to several input variables, whose values depend heavily on local conditions. Because characteristics of black carbon sequestration are only known from limited geographical contexts, its worldwide potential will not be known without multiple streams of research, replicated in other contexts. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Of 21 parameters assessed, significantly more differed between Great Lakes colonies and reference colonies than between the two reference colonies. Relative adrenal, kidney, and liver masses of gulls from some Great Lakes colonies were reduced and thyroid masses increased relative to gulls from reference colonies. Foci of cellular atypia were observed in the hepatocytes of two Great Lakes gulls. Chronic periportal hepatitis, lipogranulomas and vacuolation of hepatocytes, and chronic granulomatous interstitial nephritis were more prevalent or severe in gulls from Great Lakes colonies and were associated with contaminants. The kidneys of gulls from the three most contaminated locations were damaged and functionally compromised. Interstitial nephritis was likely the most functionally significant histopathological lesion. Portal-tract fibrosis, granulomatous hepatitis, and kidney tubule dilation/obstruction and splenic enlargement were more prevalent or severe at reference sites and were associated with blood-borne parasites. Amyloid deposits were observed in the spleen, kidneys, or liver of nearly half of the gulls. Associations between the prevalence or severity of lesions and contaminant levels in gull tissues or the trophic level of their diet suggest some lesions are toxicopathic. Associations were most frequently found with planar halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons and lead. The stress response, as measured by the heterophil/lymphocyte ratio, was attenuated in gulls from Areas of Concern and associated with decreased adrenal mass. Our findings suggest that adult Great Lakes gulls suffered from chronic exposure to chemical stressors in the early 1990s sufficient to modulate endocrine function and physiological processes and induce structural changes in tissues.

These conditions impose a selection pressure on plants for strong stomatal regulation of transpiration to maintain water balance. Diurnal adjustments of non-photochemical energy dissipation in photosystem II (PSII) provide a dynamic mechanism to reduce the risk of photoinhibitory damage during the middle of the day when irradiances and leaf temperatures are high and partial closure of the stomata results in considerable reductions in internal CO2 concentration. At the end of the dry season, we measured diurnal changes in gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and carotenoid composition in two savanna tree species differing in photosynthetic capacity and in the duration and extent of the midday depression of photosynthesis. Non-photochemical quenching and its quantum yield were tightly correlated with zeaxanthin concentrations on a total chlorophyll basis, indicating that the reversible de-epoxidation of violaxanthin to antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin within the xanthophyll cycle plays a key role in the regulation of thermal energy dissipation. In both cases, a single linear relationship fitted both species. Although efficient regulation of photochemical and non-photochemical quenching and adjustments in the partitioning of electron flow between assimilative and non-assimilative processes were operating, these trees could not fully cope with the rapid increase in irradiance after sunrise, suggesting high vulnerability to photoinhibitory damage in the morning. However, both species were able to recover quickly. The effects of photoinhibitory quenching were largely reversed by midday, and zeaxanthin rapidly converted back to violaxanthin as irradiance decreased in late afternoon, resulting in the maximal quantum yield of PSII of around 0.8 just before sunrise. © 2007 Heron Publishing.","Cerrado; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Fluorescence quenching; Photosynthesis; Quantum yield of non-photochemical quenching; Xanthophyll cycle","carotenoid; Neotropical Region; photochemistry; photoinhibition; photosynthesis; savanna; Brazil; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250803838

However, much less is known about indoor PM concentrations and associated health risks. In particular, data are needed on air quality in schools, since children are assumed to be more vulnerable to health hazards and spend a large part of their time in classrooms. On this background, we evaluated indoor air quality in 64 schools in the city of Munich and a neighbouring district outside the city boundary. In winter 2004-2005 in 92 classrooms, and in summer 2005 in 75 classrooms, data on indoor air climate parameters (temperature, relative humidity), carbon dioxide (CO2) and various dust particle fractions (PM10, PM2.5) were collected; for the latter both gravimetrical and continuous measurements by laser aerosol spectrometer (LAS) were implemented. In the summer period, the particle number concentration (PNC), was determined using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). Additionally, data on room and building characteristics were collected by use of a standardized form. Only data collected during teaching hours were considered in analysis. For continuously measured parameters the daily median was used to describe the exposure level in a classroom. The median indoor CO2 concentration in a classroom was 1603 ppm in winter and 405 ppm in summer. With LAS in winter, median PM concentrations of 19.8 μg m-3 (PM2.5) and 91.5 μg m-3 (PM10) were observed, in summer PM concentrations were significantly reduced (median PM2.5=12.7 μg m-3, median PM10=64.9 μg m-3). PM2.5 concentrations determined by the gravimetric method were in general higher (median in winter: 36.7 μg m-3, median in summer: 20.2 μg m-3) but correlated strongly with the LAS-measured results. In explorative analysis, we identified a significant increase of LAS-measured PM2.5 by 1.7 μg m-3 per increase in humidity by 10%, by 0.5 μg m-3 per increase in CO2 indoor concentration by 100 ppm, and a decrease by 2.8 μg m-3 in 5-7th grade classes and by 7.3 μg m-3 in class 8-11 compared to 1-4th class. During the winter period, the associations were stronger regarding class level, reverse regarding humidity (a decrease by 6.4 μg m-3 per increase in 10% humidity) and absent regarding CO2 indoor concentration. The median PNC measured in 36 classrooms ranged between 2622 and 12,145 particles cm-3 (median: 5660 particles cm-3). The results clearly show that exposure to particulate matter in school is high. The increased PM concentrations in winter and their correlation with high CO2 concentrations indicate that inadequate ventilation plays a major role in the establishment of poor indoor air quality. Additionally, the increased PM concentration in low level classes and in rooms with high number of pupils suggest that the physical activity of pupils, which is assumed to be more pronounced in younger children, contributes to a constant process of resuspension of sedimented particles. Further investigations are necessary to increase knowledge on predictors of PM concentration, to assess the toxic potential of indoor particles and to develop and test strategies how to ensure improved indoor air quality in schools. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Simple models and indices were used to assess impacts on the growing season, potential biomass, thermal suitability for the cultivation of crops, and potential energy demand for indoor cooling. Impacts were estimated for climate during the 1961-1990 baseline period (both observed and modelled) and projected during 2071-2100 based on outputs from a range of regional climate models (RCMs) driven by general circulation models (GCMs) assuming forcing by SRES emission scenarios A2 and B2, and from six atmosphere-ocean GCMs forced by a wider range of emission scenarios. Uncertainties in the projected impacts of climate change are assessed with respect to: (1) the direct climate model output vs. delta change approach, (2) differences in the driving GCMs and the RCM runs, (3) differences across a range of emission scenarios, (4) changes in long-term mean climate, and (5) changes in inter-annual climate variability. Future simulations show substantial changes in all analysed impact sectors, but with a relatively large spread of results attributable to uncertainties in future climate expressed by the different scenarios. Results included shifts of the northern limits of areas thermally suitable for the cultivation of soya bean and grain maize by several hundred kilometres, lengthening of the thermal growing season by 3-12 weeks, strong increases of potential biomass in northern Europe and slight decreases in southern Europe, and increased energy demand for cooling throughout Europe. Our results hint at systematic differences between RCM and GCM projections of temperature, though not precipitation, over Europe. The results also highlight the importance of accounting for inter-annual variability in estimating future impacts, through its affect on levels of risk. However, the results caution against the use of direct RCM outputs in impact models, due to biases in the representation of present-day climate. The delta change approach still appears to be the preferred option for most applications. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.",,"Biomass; Crops; Environmental impact; Mathematical models; Climate variability; General circulation models (GCM); Potential energy demand; Regional climate models (RCM); Climate change; annual variation; assessment method; biomass; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; general circulation model; growing season; maize; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; soybean; uncertainty role; Biomass; Farm Crops; Mathematical Models; Seasonal Variation; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Southern Europe; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248217973

The input for an emissions processing system that was originally configured forthe study of criteria air pollutants was updated to calculate emissions of six semivolatile PAHs. The goal of the work was to produce emissions estimates with the spatial and temporal resolution needed to serve as input to a regional air quality model for southern Canada and the U.S. Such modeling is helpful in determining reductions in PAH emissions that may be necessary to protect human and ecosystem health. The total annual emission of the six PAHs (Σ6PAH) for both countries was estimated at 18 273 Mg/year. A total of 90% of these emissions arise from U.S. sources. The top six source types account for 73% of emissions and are related to metal production, open burning, incineration, and forest fires. The emission factors used in this study were derived from published compilations. Although this approach has the advantage of quality control during the compilation process, some compilations include factors from older studies that may overestimate emissions since they do not account for recent improvements in emission control technology. When compared to estimates published in the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) for 2002, the U.S. emissions in this study are higher by a factor of 4 (16 424 vs 4102 Mg/year). The cause of this difference has been investigated, and much of it is likely due to our use of data unavailable in the 2002 NEI but inferred here on the basis of the PAH emissions literature. Augmenting the 2002 NEI with this additional information would bring its reported annual emissions to 8213 Mg/year, which is within a factor of 2 of the estimates herein.

The studied sections are located within the Triassic Tethys Himalayan belt (Losar section, Himachal Pradesh, India) and the Nanpanjiang Basin in the South China Block (Jinya section, Guangxi Province), respectively. Carbon isotopes from the studied sections confirm the previously observed carbon cycle perturbations at a time of major paleoceanographic changes in the wake of the end-Permian biotic crisis. This study documents the coincidence between a sharp increase in the carbon isotope composition and the worldwide ammonoid evolutionary turnover (extinction followed by a radiation) occurring around the Smithian-Spathian boundary. Based on recent modeling studies on ammonoid paleobiogeography and taxonomic diversity, we demonstrate that the late Early Triassic (Smithian and Spathian) was a time of a major climate change. More precisely, the end Smithian climate can be characterized by a warm and equable climate underlined by a flat, pole-to-equator, sea surface temperature (SST) gradient, while the steep Spathian SST gradient suggests latitudinally differentiated climatic conditions. Moreover, sedimentary evidence suggests a transition from a humid and hot climate during the Smithian to a dryer climate from the Spathian onwards. By analogy with comparable carbon isotope perturbations in the Late Devonian, Jurassic and Cretaceous we propose that high atmospheric CO2 levels could have been responsible for the observed carbon cycle disturbance at the Smithian-Spathian boundary. We suggest that the end Smithian ammonoid extinction has been essentially caused by a warm and equable climate related to an increased CO2 flux possibly originating from a short eruptive event of the Siberian igneous province. This increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations could have additionally reduced the marine calcium carbonate oversaturation and weakened the calcification potential of marine organisms, including ammonoids, in late Smithian oceans. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In order to understand the carbon dynamics in the climate-sensitive Arctic permafrost environments, the activity and diversity of methanogenic communities were studied in three different permafrost soils of the Siberian Laptev Sea coast. The effect of temperature and the availability of methanogenic substrates on CH4 production was analysed. In addition, the diversity of methanogens was analysed by PCR with specific methanogenic primers and by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) followed by sequencing of DGGE bands reamplified from the gel. Our results demonstrated methanogenesis with a distinct vertical profile in each investigated permafrost soil. The soils on Samoylov Island showed at least two optima of CH4 production activity, which indicated a shift in the methanogenic community from mesophilic to psychrotolerant methanogens with increasing soil depth. Furthermore, it was shown that CH4 production in permafrost soils is substrate-limited, although these soils are characterized by the accumulation of organic matter. Sequence analyses revealed a distinct diversity of methanogenic archaea affiliated to Methanomicrobiaceae, Methanosarcinaceae and Methanosaetaceae.

Water application to the soil surface (or water seal) has been demonstrated to reduce 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) emissions in soil column tests. This study determined the effectiveness of water application to reduce emissions of 1,3-D and chloropicrin (CP) in comparison to other surface seals under field conditions. In a small-plot field trial on a Hanford sandy loam soil (coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Typic Xerorthents) in the San Joaquin Valley, CA. Telone C35 (61% 1,3-D and 35% CP) was shank-applied at a depth of 46 cm at a rate of 610 kg ha-1. Soil surface seal treatments included control (no tarp and no water application), standard high density polyethylene (HDPE) tarp over dry and pre-irrigated soil, virtually impermeable film (VIF) tarp, initial water application by sprinklers immediately following fumigation, and intermittent water applications after fumigation. The atmospheric emissions and gas-phase distribution of fumigants in soil profile were monitored for 9 d. Among the surface seals, VIF and HDPE tarp over dry soil resulted in the lowest and the highest total emission losses, respectively.

Soil organic C storage in mountain areas is highly heterogeneous, mainly as a result of local-scale variability in the soil environment (topography, stoniness, parent material) and microclimate. The aims of the present study are to estimate soil organic C stocks (SOCS) in mineral soils of high-altitude grasslands of the Pyrenees and determine whether climatic and topographic variables can be used as predictors of SOCS and organic C content in the surface soil horizons of these ecosystems. For that purpose we sampled 35 soil profiles in subalpine and alpine grasslands including a range of altitudes, slopes and aspects. We analysed the soils for stoniness, bulk density, total C, texture, and C-to-N ratio and determined topographical variables. We used georeferenced climatic information for climatic descriptions of the sites. SOCS were highly correlated with soil depth. However, we were not able to predict soil depth by using environmental and topographic variables. In spite of this fact, altitude and aspect explained 41.2% of the SOCS variability while summer temperature and precipitation combined with aspect explained 56.9% of the variability of the organic C content of the surface layer (OC). The SOCS were low at high altitudes, probably as a result of an overall temperature limitation of net primary productivity. Under these conditions, the effect of aspect was small. The highest SOCS occurred at the lowest altitudes for ENE or WNW aspects, showing sharper decreases towards the south than to the north. The harsh climatic conditions and low-plant productivity that occur at the northern slopes reduced SOCS at the highest altitudes. In contrast, southern aspects showed similar organic C content along the altitudinal gradient. The OC variability in the surface soils not explained by climatic or topographic variables was partially related to the characteristics of soil organic matter, which may depend on the plant communities. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Climate; Mountain grasslands; Pyrenees; Soil organic carbon storage; Topography","altitude; carbon sequestration; climate effect; grassland soil; mountain region; organic carbon; primary production; soil carbon; soil horizon; topographic effect; Eurasia; Europe; Pyrenees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947222226

Various land cover data sets, including historically reconstructed, recently observed, and future projected, have been used in numerous climate modeling studies at regional to global scales. However, little attention has been paid to the effect of land cover classification accuracy on climate simulations, though accuracy assessment has become a routine procedure in land cover production community. In this study, we analyzed the behavior of simulated precipitation in the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) over a range of simulated classification accuracies over a 3 month period. This study found that land cover accuracy under 80% had a strong effect on precipitation especially when the land surface had a greater control of the atmosphere. This effect became stronger as the accuracy decreased. As shown in three follow-on experiments, the effect was further influenced by model parameterizations such as convection schemes and interior nudging, which can mitigate the strength of surface boundary forcings. In reality, land cover accuracy rarely obtains the commonly recommended 85% target. Its effect on climate simulations should therefore be considered, especially when historically reconstructed and future projected land covers are employed.

The 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb isotopic ratios of the steel plant's filter dust are similar to values found in dust of waste incinerators. The 87Sr/86Sr ratio is similar to present-day ratios of Phanerozoic or Precambrian granitic rocks. The 143Nd/144Nd isotopic composition is very low and corresponds to an ε{lunate}Nd value of - 17.5. Such a low value is characteristic of old Precambrian granitic rocks and banded iron formations. Thus, this low ε{lunate}Nd value might point to the origin of the iron necessary for the steel production. The fact, that this isotopic composition does not occur in crustal rocks of Western Central Europe makes the Nd isotope ratio a powerful tool to trace steel plants atmospheric emissions. The rare earth element (REE) distribution pattern of the steel plant's filter dust shows very specific fractionations like La and Nd enrichments which are traceable in tree barks over a distance of 4 km. The Pb, Sr and Nd isotope ratios not only enable the steel plant's emissions to be traced in a north-easterly direction, along the principal wind pathway but also enables the interference of this emission at 4 km NE from the steel plant with another atmospheric component originating from the Strasbourg Rhine harbour to be identified. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the cost of power and gas and the carbon emission reduction from AD plants receiving manure from multiple sources is calculated for plants of varying scale. The study area is Red Deer County, Alberta, a typical mixed farming area. Costs are based on a detailed analysis of manure and digestate transport and processing costs at an AD plant; carbon emission reductions from power generation are calculated for displacement of coal and natural gas sourced power. The required value of carbon credit in dollars per tonne of CO2 to cover the cost of AD power or gas is calculated for two cases: gas and power sale, and gas and power sale plus a subsidy plus, for the power generation cases, the sale of waste heat. The cost of power and gas shows a significant economy of scale, with the lowest cost coming from a single AD plant processing manure from the entire county. The required carbon credit to cover the cost of AD processing of manure is greater than $125 per tonne of CO2. These results show that AD treatment of manure from mixed farming areas is not economic given current values of carbon credits. Other factors that might motivate AD processing of manure from mixed farming areas are issues of water quality, odor control, and excess phosphate levels in soils.","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Carbon credit; Gas costs; Power costs","Anaerobic digestion; Carbon; Cost accounting; Electric power generation; Gas emissions; Manures; Carbon credit; Carbon emission; Biogas; biofuel; biogas; carbon emission; digestion; manure; mixed farming; natural gas; power generation; Alberta; Canada; North America; Red Deer Valley; Cervus elaphus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447535018

In addition, many constituencies are looking to managed ecosystems to sequester carbon in plant biomass and soil C to reduce the impact of anthropogenic CO2 on climate. This work builds on a 90-year-old grazing experiment in mountain meadows on the Wasatch Plateau in central Utah. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of 90 years of protection from grazing on processes controlling the input, output, and storage of C in subalpine rangelands. Long-term grazing significantly reduced maximum biomass in all years compared with plots within grazing exclosures. For grazed plots, interannual variability in aboveground biomass was correlated with July precipitation and temperature (R2 = 0.51), while there was a weak correlation between July precipitation and biomass in ungrazed plots (R2 = 0.24). Livestock grazing had no statistically significant impacts on total soil C or particulate organic matter (POM), although grazing did increase active soil C and decrease soil moisture. Grazing significantly increased the proportion of total soil C pools that were potentially mineralizable in the laboratory, with soils from grazed plots evolving 4.6% of total soil C in 1 year while ungrazed plots lost 3.3% of total soil C. Volumetric soil moisture was consistently higher in ungrazed plots than grazed plots. The changes in soil C chemistry may have implications for how these ecosystems will respond to forecast climate change. Because grazing has resulted in an accumulation of easily decomposable organic material, if temperatures warm and summer precipitation increases as is anticipated, these soils may become net sources of CO2 to the atmosphere creating a positive feedback between climate change and atmospheric CO2.","Grazing exclosure; Hydrology; Mineralizable carbon; Soil carbon; Subalpine rangeland","aboveground biomass; carbon dioxide; climate change; ecosystem management; experimental study; grassland soil; grazing management; long-term change; meadow; mineralization; particulate organic matter; rangeland; soil carbon; soil moisture; subalpine environment; North America; United States; Utah; Wasatch Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846940554

Current warming is leading to earlier snowmelt dates and longer snow-free periods. Our hypothesis is that high-mountain Mediterranean plants are not able to take advantage of a lengthened snow-free period because this leads to longer drought that truncates the growing season. However, reproductive timing may somewhat mitigate these negative effects through temporal shifts. • We assessed the effects of flowering phenology on the reproductive success of Silene ciliata, a Mediterranean high-mountain plant, across an altitudinal gradient during two climatically contrasting years. • The species showed a late-flowering pattern hampering the use of snowmelt water. Plant fitness was largely explained by the elapsed time from snowmelt to onset of flowering, suggesting a selective pressure towards early flowering caused by soil moisture depletion. The proportion of flowering plants decreased at the lowest population, especially in the drier year. Plants produced more flowers, fruits and seeds at the highest population and in the mild year. • Our results indicate that water deficit in dry years could threaten the lowland populations of this mountainous species, while high-altitude environments are more stable over time. © The Authors (2006).","Flowering phenology; Mediterranean high mountain; Reproductive success; Silene ciliata","flowering; herb; Mediterranean environment; mountain region; phenology; reproductive success; snowmelt; soil moisture; water stress; altitude; article; climate; flower; greenhouse effect; microclimate; physiology; probability; reproduction; season; Silene; Southern Europe; Altitude; Climate; Flowers; Greenhouse Effect; Mediterranean Region; Microclimate; Probability; Reproduction; Seasons; Silene; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; Ciliophora; Magnoliophyta; Silene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845627040

In particular, we show that the SED is consistent with that of a blazar with synchrotron power peaking in the hard X-ray band. If this is indeed the case, the combination of high-luminosity and synchrotron peak in the hard-X-ray band contradicts the claimed anti-correlation between luminosity and position of the synchrotron peak usually referred to as the ""blazar sequence"".

Gas transfer velocities needed to compute these fluxes can be estimated by combining altimeter-derived mean square slope with an empirical relation between transfer velocity and mean square slope derived from field measurements of gas fluxes and small-scale wave spectra [Frew, N.M., Bock, E.J., Schimpf, U., Hara, T., Hauβecker, H., Edson, J.B., McGillis, W.R., Nelson, R.K., McKenna, S.P., Uz, B.M., Jähne, B., 2004.

We previously reported initial results from a dual-frequency (Ku- and C-band) altimeter algorithm [Glover, D.M., Frew, N.M., McCue, S.J., Bock, E.J., 2002. A Multi-year Time Series of Global Gas Transfer Velocity from the TOPEX Dual Frequency, Normalized Radar Backscatter Algorithm, In: Gas Transfer at Water Surfaces, editors: Donelan, M., Drennan, W., Saltzman, E., and Wanninkhof, R., Geophysical Monograph 127, American Geophysical Union, Washington, DC, 325-331.] for estimating the air-sea gas transfer velocity (k) from the mean square slope of short wind waves (40-100 rad/m) and derived a 6-year time series of global transfer velocities based on TOPEX observations. Since the launch of the follow-on altimeter Jason-1 in December 2001 and commencement of the TOPEX/Jason-1 Tandem Mission, we have extended this time series to 12 years, with improvements to the model parameters used in our algorithm and using the latest corrected data releases. The prospect of deriving multi-year and interdecadal time series of gas transfer velocity from TOPEX, Jason-1 and follow-on altimeter missions depends on precise intercalibration of the normalized backscatter. During the Tandem Mission collinear phase, both satellites followed identical orbits with a mere 73-s time separation. The resulting collocated, near-coincident normalized radar backscatter (σ°) data from both altimeters present a unique opportunity to intercalibrate the two instruments, compare derived fields of transfer velocity and estimate the precision of the algorithm. Initial results suggest that the monthly gas transfer velocity fields generated from the two altimeters are very similar. Comparison of along-track Ku-band and C-band σ° during the collinear phase indicates that observed discrepancies are due primarily to small offsets between TOPEX and Jason-1 σ°. The Jason-1 k values have an apparent bias of + 4% relative to TOPEX, while the precision estimated from the two observation sets is 5-7% and scales with k. The resultant long-term, global, mean k is 16 cm/h. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Prompt CO2 production was observed when the CO beam impinges on the sample followed by a rapid decay of CO2 production in all cases. At oxygen precoverages above 0.5 ML, CO2 production decreases with increasing oxygen precoverage primarily due to the decrease in CO uptake. CO oxidation at 77 K goes through a precursor mediated reaction mechanism, where CO is in a precursor or trapped state and oxygen atoms are in a chemisorbed state. The role of adsorbed water was studied by using isotopically labeled water [H2 18O] to distinguish the oxygen species from that used in oxygen atom exposures [16O].

Authigenic carbonate crusts were observed directly by a submersible in each of these fluid-venting areas, in close association with specific chemosynthetic biological communities. Authigenic carbonates occur typically as pavements, slabs and mounds on the seafloor, but are also present as millimeter- to centimeter-size concretions dispersed within sediments. Mineralogical analyses of carbonate crusts and concretions indicate that aragonite and high-Mg calcite represent the most dominant carbonate phases. Low-Mg calcite, dolomite and ankerite also occur as minor components. Petrographic observations of carbonate crusts and concretions show that they are composed mainly of microcrystalline carbonate cement, with minor amounts of detrital minerals, lithoclasts and bioclasts. Aragonite is present as microcrystalline cement or acicular crystals infilling bioclasts and voids. Pyrite occurs as framboids or cubic crystals, which are often associated with authigenic carbonates, thereby indicating that sulfate reduction was active during carbonate precipitation. Numerous millimeter- to centimeter-size euhedral gypsum crystals have been observed within carbonate crusts and concretions, and as isolated crystals in sediments recovered from the eastern province. In this area, precipitation of gypsum is related to the presence of rising sulfate-rich fluids, which originate from the dissolution of underlying Messinian evaporites. Millimeter-size barite concretions have also been discovered in sediment from the central province and precipitated from ascending fluids, which are enriched in barium due to the dissolution of biogenic and/or authigenic barite below the depth of sulfate depletion. The oxygen and carbon isotopic compositions of the carbonates display very large ranges, from -0.67‰ to 4.15‰ Vienna PeeDee Belemnite (V-PDB) and from -42.14‰ to 3.10‰ V-PDB, respectively. Most carbonates exhibit δ18O values around 3‰, indicating that they have precipitated in isotopic equilibrium with bottom seawater. In contrast, two carbonate concretions from the caldera and the eastern areas are characterized by lower δ18O values (-0.67‰ V-PDB and 0.98‰ V-PDB), which may reflect a contribution from 18O-poor (continental?) water or, most likely, a local high heat flow. A few carbonate crusts exhibit slightly positive δ13C values, which indicate that seawater was the main source of carbon for those carbonates. Authigenic carbonates are typically depleted in 13C, revealing that the major carbon source for those carbonates derives from anaerobic oxidation of methane driven by microbial consortia of archaea and sulfate reducing bacteria. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A survey was conducted of households connected to the natural gas network to correlate use of gas, living area and number of inhabitants per house. The annual average consumption of gas was found to be 169 GJ, and consumption of electricity 8 GJ. This total energy use per household per year is almost double the average value reported for Stockholm, Sweden, although both locations have similar heating requirements. The difference was mainly due to heating energy consumption per unit living space, which in Bariloche was 1530 MJ/m2 per year, while in Stockholm the average is around 570 MJ/m2 per year. The high energy consumption in Bariloche is explained primarily by the construction characteristics of the buildings, and secondarily by the efficiency of the heating devices used. We were able to conclude that subsidies on natural gas tariffs given to the residential sector do not promote a rational use of the resource. Furthermore, almost 40% of the population (mostly households in poverty) are not connected to the subsidised gas resource, but pay prices for alternative fuels that are between 10- and 15 times higher. Policies to improve buildings and appliances would reduce emissions and make access to energy more equitable. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Workplace bans on smoking are interventions to reduce exposure to ETS to try to prevent harmful health effects. On March 29, 2004, the Irish government introduced the first national comprehensive legislation banning smoking in all workplaces, including bars and restaurants. This study examines the impact of this legislation on air quality in pubs and on respiratory health effects in bar workers in Dublin. Methods: EXPOSURE STUDY. Concentrations of particulate matter 2.5 μm or smaller (PM2.5) and particulate matter 10 μm or smaller (PM10) in 42 pubs were measured and compared before and after the ban. Benzene concentrations were also measured in 26 of the pubs. HEALTH EFFECTS STUDY. Eighty-one barmen volunteered to have full pulmonary function studies, exhaled breath carbon monoxide, and salivary cotinine levels performed before the ban and repeated 1 year after the ban. They also completed questionnaires on exposure to ETS and respiratory symptoms on both occasions. Findings: EXPOSURE STUDY. There was an 83% reduction in PM2.5 and an 80.2% reduction in benzene concentration in the bars. HEALTH EFFECTS STUDY. There was a 79% reduction in exhaled breath carbon monoxide and an 81% reduction in salivary cotinine. There were statistically significant improvements in measured pulmonary function tests and significant reductions in self-reported symptoms and exposure levels in nonsmoking barmen volunteers after the ban. Conclusions: A total workplace smoking ban results in a significant reduction in air pollution in pubs and an improvement in respiratory health in barmen.","ETS exposure; Health effects; Smoking ban","benzene; carbon monoxide; cotinine; tobacco smoke; adult; aged; air quality; article; cigarette smoking; controlled study; exhalation; human; Ireland; law; lung function test; male; normal human; occupational exposure; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; questionnaire; respiratory system; saliva analysis; smoking cessation; worker; workplace; Adult; Aged; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Air Pollution, Indoor; Cotinine; Humans; Ireland; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Health; Pulmonary Ventilation; Restaurants; Smoking; Tobacco Smoke Pollution; Total Lung Capacity; Urban Health; Workplace",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34147175748

There are a number of apparent misconceptions, commonly held in the public mind and subsumed in public policy, which need to be corrected in order to reduce the toll of winter cold on older people. The evidence shows that winter deaths are to a large extent avoidable. They are not due to hypothermia as is widely believed, may not be necessarily reduced by climate change in the foreseeable future and may only be partially reduced by improving indoor warmth alone. The key is an integrated policy which reduces all risks equally.

Climate change scenarios from an ensemble of seven RCMs, two global climate models (GCMs), two global emissions scenarios and two RCMs of varying resolution were used. A total of 15 climate change simulations were included in studies on the Lule River basin in Northern Sweden. Two different approaches to transfer climate change from the RCMs to hydrological models were tested. A rudimentary estimate of change in hydropower potential on the Lule River due to climate change was also made. The results indicate an overall increase in river flow, earlier spring peak flows and an increase in hydropower potential. The two approaches for transferring the signal of climate change to the hydrological impacts model gave similar mean results, but considerably different seasonal dynamics, a result that is highly relevant for other types of climate change impacts studies. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.",,"Computer simulation; Environmental impact; Hydrology; Mathematical models; Hydrological impact models; Hydrological models; Hydropower potential; Climate change; assessment method; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; global climate; hydrological modeling; regional climate; seasonal variation; Argentina; Lules Basin; South America; Tucuman",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248199827

While few would argue the inherent merits of such a policy, many believe there may not yet be enough information to differentially regulate PM species. New evidence, using increasingly sophisticated methodologies, has become available in the last several years, allowing more accurate assessment of exposure and resultant associations with specific types of PM, or PM derived from different sources. Such new studies may also allow differentiation of effects from different chemical components in the same study against the same health endpoints. This article considers whether this new evidence might be adequate to allow us to ""speciate"" PM types or sources by severity of health effects. We address this issue with respect to two widespread sources of PM, emissions from motor vehicles and coal-fired power plants. Emissions from less widespread sources, residual oil and steel/coking facilities, are also discussed in order to illustrate how health effects associated with such emissions might instead be associated with more widespread sources when accurate exposure information is unavailable. Based upon evaluation of studies and methodologies which appear to contain the most accurate information on exposure and response to important emissions, including variable local emissions, it is concluded that public health will likely be better protected by reduction of various vehicular emissions than by continued regulation of the total mass of fine PM (PM <2.5 μm, or PM2.5) as if all PM in this mode is equitoxic. However, the knowledge base is incomplete. Important remaining research questions are identified.

In some areas, especially in Germany and France, it was the strongest drought for the last 50 years, lasting for more than 6 months. We used continuous carbon and water flux measurements at 12 European monitoring sites covering various forest ecosystem types and a large climatic range in order to characterise the consequences of this drought on ecosystems functioning. As soil water content in the root zone was only monitored in a few sites, a daily water balance model was implemented at each stand to estimate the water balance terms: trees and understorey transpiration, rainfall interception, throughfall, drainage in the different soil layers and soil water content. This model calculated the onset date, duration and intensity of the soil water shortage (called water stress) using measured climate and site properties: leaf area index and phenology that both determine tree transpiration and rainfall interception, soil characteristics and root distribution, both influencing water absorption and drainage. At sites where soil water content was measured, we observed a good agreement between measured and modelled soil water content. Our analysis showed a wide spatial distribution of drought stress over Europe, with a maximum intensity within a large band extending from Portugal to NE Germany. Vapour fluxes in all the investigated sites were reduced by drought, due to stomatal closure, when the relative extractable water in soil (REW) dropped below ca. 0.4. Rainfall events during the drought, however, typically induced rapid restoration of vapour fluxes. Similar to the water vapour fluxes, the net ecosystem production decreased with increasing water stress at all the sites. Both gross primary production (GPP) and total ecosystem respiration (TER) also decreased when REW dropped below 0.4 and 0.2, for GPP and TER, respectively. A higher sensitivity to drought was found in the beech, and surprisingly, in the broadleaved Mediterranean forests; the coniferous stands (spruce and pine) appeared to be less drought-sensitive. The effect of drought on tree growth was also large at the three sites where the annual tree growth was measured. Especially in beech, this growth reduction was more pronounced in the year following the drought (2004). Such lag effects on tree growth should be considered an important feature in forest ecosystems, which may enhance vulnerability to more frequent climate extremes. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The N-alkyl derivatives and the 9-methylsulfanylacridizinium have an intense intrinsic fluorescence (φf = 0.2-0.6), whereas the N-aryl-substituted compounds are virtually nonfluorescent in liquid solutions (φf ≤ 0.01). The emission intensity of the latter compounds significantly increases with increasing viscosity of the medium. It is demonstrated that the excited-state deactivation of the N-aryl-9-aminoacridizinium derivatives is due to two nonradiative processes: (i) torsional relaxation by rotation about the N-aryl bond and (ii) an electron-transfer process from an electron-donor substituted phenyl ring to the photoexcited acridizinium chromophore. The binding of several representative acridizinium derivatives to double-stranded DNA was studied by the spectrophotometric titrations and linear dichroism spectroscopy. The results give evidence that the prevailing binding mode is intercalation with binding constants in the range (0.5-5.0) x 105 M-1 (in base pairs). Notably, the binding of most of the N-aryl-9-aminoacridizinium derivatives leads to a fluorescence enhancement by a factor of up to 50 upon binding to the biomacromolecules. Moreover, the addition of selected proteins, namely albumins, to N-(halogenophenyl)-9-aminoacridizinium ions in the presence of an anionic surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate) results in a 20-fold fluorescence enhancement. In each case, the emission enhancement is supposed to result from the hindrance of the torsional relaxation in the corresponding binding site of the biomacromolecule, which in turn suppresses the excited-state deactivation pathway. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Chemical bonds; Chromophores; Macromolecules; Relaxation processes; Substitution reactions; Viscosity; Acridizinium derivatives; Biomacromolecules; Fluorophores; Liquid solutions; Salts; acridine derivative; albumin; alkyl group; aminoacridine derivative; anionic surfactant; dodecyl sulfate sodium; double stranded DNA; halogen; phenyl group; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivative; sulfur derivative; article; binding site; chemical bond; DNA determination; electron transport; fluorescence; intercalation complex; linear dichroism; liquid; macromolecule; photochemistry; spectrophotometry; steady state; stereospecificity; titrimetry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846849349

The use of spatial econometric methods shows only small effects of spatially lagged compliance status, and does not greatly change the estimated contributions of other spatially explicit factors.

Observations of HFC-152a at five locations (four European and one Australian) over a 10 year period were recorded. The annual average growth rate of HFC-152a in the midlatitude Northern Hemisphere has risen from 0.11 ppt/yr to 0.6 ppt/yr from 1994 to 2004. The Southern Hemisphere annual average growth rate has risen from 0.09 ppt/yr to 0.4 ppt/yr from 1998 to 2004. The 2004 average mixing ratio for HFC-152a was 5.0 ppt and 1.8 ppt in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, respectively. The annual cycle observed for this species in both hemispheres is approximately consistent with measured annual cycles at the same locations in other gases which are destroyed by OH. Yearly global emissions of HFC-152a from 1994 to 2004 are derived using the global mean HFC-152a observations and a 12-box 2-D model. The global emission of HFC-152a has risen from 7 Kt/yr to 28 Kt/yr from 1995 to 2004. On the basis of observations of above-baseline elevations in the HFC-152a record and a consumption model, regional emission estimates for Europe and Australia are calculated, indicating accelerating emissions from Europe since 2000. The overall European emission in 2004 ranges from 1.5 to 4.0 Kt /year, 5-15% of global emissions for 1,1-difluoroethane, while the Australian contribution is negligible at 5-10 tonnes/year, <0.05% of global emissions.

Methods and Findings: We measured the feasibility of community-based peer education, free condom distribution, income-generating projects, and clinic-based STI treatment and counselling services and evaluated their impact on the incidence of HIV-1 measured over a 3-y period in a cluster-randomised controlled trial in eastern Zimbabwe. Analysis of primary outcomes was on an intention-to-treat basis. The income-generating projects proved impossible to implement in the prevailing economic climate. Despite greater programme activity and knowledge in the intervention communities, the incidence rate ratio of HIV-1 was 1.27 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92-1.75) compared to the control communities. No evidence was found for reduced incidence of self-reported STI symptoms or high-risk sexual behaviour in the intervention communities. Males who attended programme meetings had lower HIV-1 incidence (incidence rate ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.24-0.98), and fewer men who attended programme meetings reported unprotected sex with casual partners (odds ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.28-0.75). More male STI patients in the intervention communities reported cessation of symptoms (odds ratio 2.49, 95% CI 1.21-5.12). Conclusions: Integrated peer education, condom distribution, and syndromic STI management did not reduce population-level HIV-1 incidence in a declining epidemic, despite reducing HIV-1 incidence in the immediate male target group. Our results highlight the need to assess the community-level impact of interventions that are effective amongst targeted population subgroups. © 2007 Gregson et al.",,"article; clinical trial; community program; condom; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; economic aspect; female; health education; health program; human; human experiment; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; incidence; income; infection control; knowledge; male; patient counseling; prognosis; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; sex ratio; sexual behavior; sexually transmitted disease; Zimbabwe; community care; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; methodology; outcome assessment; outpatient department; risk; sexually transmitted disease; time; treatment outcome; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Community Health Services; Female; Health Education; HIV Infections; Humans; Incidence; Male; Odds Ratio; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Sexual Behavior; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Zimbabwe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947698925

The resulting platinized carbon aerogels (Pt/CA) are characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electrochemistry. The active area of platinum is estimated from hydrogen adsorption/desorption or CO-stripping voltammetry: it is possible to deposit platinum nanoparticles onto the cellulose acetate-based carbon aerogel surface in significant proportions.

It is important to assess changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) under future climate change scenarios using models at regional or global scales. This paper aims to calibrate the RothC model on non-waterlogged soils in northern China to obtain the necessary model input parameters for later use in large-scale studies. Data sets from three long-term experiments in northern China were used to evaluate the performance of the RothC soil carbon turnover model. The plant carbon input rate, an important model input parameter, was calibrated using experimental data under typical rotation systems with different fertilization. The results showed that RothC accurately simulated the changes in SOC across a wide area of northern China (northeast, north, and northwest China. The modelling error expressed as root mean square error for four treatments (nil, manure, fertilizer, fertilizer + manure) at three sites were less than 20.2%, and less than 7.8% if occasional extreme measured values were omitted. The simulation biases expressed as M (i.e. relative error) for all treatments at the three sites were non-significant. Observed trends in SOC included a decrease for the nil (no fertilizer or manure) treatment and an increase for the treatments which received both manure and fertilizers. The experiments also indicated that manures applied at an appropriate rate were more effective in increasing or maintaining SOC than fertilizers which were more effective in increasing crop yields. © 2007 The Authors.

In particular, we follow the nucleosynthetic evolution of an accreted fluid element from its deposition into the atmosphere down to a depth where the electron Fermi energy is 20 MeV. We include temperature-dependent continuum electron capture rates and realistic sources of heat loss by thermal neutrino emission from the crust and core. We show that, in contrast to previous calculations, electron captures to excited states and subsequent γ-emission significantly reduce the local heat loss due to weak-interaction neutrinos. Depending on the initial composition, these reactions release up to a factor of 10 times more heat at densities &lt;10 11 g cm-3 than obtained previously. This heating reduces the ignition depth of superbursts.

A theoretical framework is proposed, capturing the interactions between behaviors, transportation costs and urban structure. Numerical simulations show that changes in households and landowners' choices reduce significantly the long-term adverse effects of a shock in transportation costs. Indeed, the shock translates, over the long run, into a more concentrated housing that limits households utility losses and maintains landowners' income. But, because of building inertia, the shock leads first to a long transition, during which the adjustment is constrained by a suboptimal housing-supply structure. Then, households support larger losses than in the final stage, though lower than with no behavior adjustment, and landowners experience a large decrease in their aggregate income and an important redistribution of wealth. Thus, behaviors and building inertia are key factors in determining the vulnerability to transportation price variability and to the introduction of climate policies. Our policy conclusions are that: (i) if a long-term increase in transportation costs is unavoidable because of climate change or resource scarcity, a smooth change prevents to some extent the negative transition effects and (ii) fast-growing cities of the developing world can reduce their future vulnerability to shocks in transportation costs through the implementation of policies that limit urban sprawl. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In the absence of policies to promote forest carbon storage, land owners have incentives to employ clear-cut harvesting regimes with relatively short rotation periods. Under conservative assumptions regarding the social benefits of carbon storage, optimal rotation periods are extended by between 16 and 133 years depending on the forest type under consideration. If policy-makers pursued a cost-effective strategy to stabilize atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations at twice the pre-industrial norm, optimal rotation periods would be extended by a full 180-347 years. The analysis suggests that partial harvesting regimes (in which approximately 35% of timber volume is removed at 15-year intervals after the timber stand reaches an initial age of 45 years) provide relatively high net benefits under a variety of circumstances. This finding is relevant because partial harvesting is an accepted and relatively common practice that could be adopted more widely. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Particles were collected on highly temporally and spatially resolved samples and investigated using a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM). From morphology and elemental composition, particles were categorized in terms of seven groups: aggregated soot particles, mineral dust, sulphates (SO42-), sea-salt, tar balls/fly ash, rod-shaped particles associated with soot agglomerates, and those that could not be attributed to any of these groups. Refractive indices of aerosols were derived from chemical distributions obtained from SEM analysis and combined with in situ measurements of number-size distributions to determine optical properties of dry particles in the size range 0.1-3.5 μm. Particles exhibited marked spatial and temporal variability in chemical composition. They were externally mixed with highly absorbing soot particles. From number concentrations, light extinction and absorption coefficient ranges were σap = 19-755 Mm-1 and σap = 7-103 Mm-1, respectively (at wavelength λ = 550 nm). Single scattering albedo, ω0, varied from 0.61 to 0.87 with a mean value of 0.72 ± 0.08; this value was much lower than generally reported in the literature, a resuit that was attributed to high concentrations of highly absorbing soot (fractional number concentrations of up to 46% were observed in the SEM). The haze could be attributed to extinction of light by fine aerosols composed mainly of anthropogenic particles. High extinction coefficients and low single scattering albedo computed here demonstrate quantitatively the contributions of particulate matter to visibility reduction and the brown haze phenomenon in Cape Town.",,"aerosol; aerosol property; chemical composition; in situ measurement; morphology; optical property; physical property; scanning electron microscopy; winter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34347221570

We examined how climate influences Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) recruitment, mortality, and species interactions at three elevation zones (low, mid, high) across its elevation range (1550-2470 m) in the semi-arid Carson Range of western Nevada. Local climate was correlated with several aspects of stand structure, including smaller trees, slower growth rates, greater predation by seed insects, and higher tree mortality at low elevation. Cone crop was not affected by elevation, but there were more mature trees and more filled seeds per cone at mid- and high elevations. Populations of seed-caching rodents were largest at mid-elevation, but sufficient rodents were present at all elevations to cause rapid removal and dispersal of pine seeds. Seedling emergence from rodent caches was greatest at low and middle elevation, but seedling survival was best at middle and high elevations. The number of saplings was greatest at mid-elevation sites. These results suggest a retracting population at low elevation (high adult tree mortality and low recruitment), a rapidly expanding population at mid-elevation (low adult tree mortality and high recruitment), and a slowly expanding population at high elevation (low adult tree mortality and low recruitment). These demographic patterns foreshadow a shift in distribution upslope over future decades, driven by changes in climate and facilitated by biotic interactions. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Despite three decades of settlement and intensive development, the forest is still relatively intact compared with similar areas elsewhere. The region is an increasingly important source of natural assets for both regional and national economic growth, and provides livelihood support to a population of several million. In addition, the Amazon supplies key environmental services in terms of the conservation of biological diversity, climate regulation and watershed management, as well as sequestering an estimated 10 per cent of global carbon emissions. Traditional forest-dwelling populations such as rubber tappers and indigenous groups have been stewards of the natural resource base in Amazonia through their use of non-destructive technologies at low demographic densities. As the frontier has advanced, however, they have come under growing peril from rent-seeking interests that threaten to destroy the forest and people's livelihoods with it. Official policies have tended to reward such predatory forms of occupation through generous subsidies, while ignoring the ecological services provided by local populations. Brazil's rubber tappers were the first social group to pose a major challenge to this ‘development’ model.

Although, it is essential to understand the environmental benefits and economic challenges involved in fleet conversion, the literature provides little understanding of the implementation issues associated with alternative fuel vehicles. This paper examines the cost effectiveness and environmental impact of the conversion of a 180 plus vehicle fleet to alternative fuel vehicle technologies by a public organization at the mid-point of the project implementation. Using multi-year micro data on fuel usage, operational and capital expenditures, mileage and emissions, the paper examines conversion costs and infrastructure investments required, extent of user adoption, and emissions reductions achieved. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for managerial practice in local government fleet agencies and for future research. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The approach is centred on a broad set of policy evaluation criteria that merge traditional economic and sectoral goals and broader social issues related to health and income distribution. The approach is inspired by institutional economics and development paradigms that emphasise human wellbeing, resource access, empowerment, and the arrived freedoms. It is outlined how indicators of wellbeing can be used to assess policies that integrate development and climate change policy objectives, and this approach is discussed in comparison with other work that rather have been inspired by sustainable development aspects of manmade, natural, and social capital. The experiences and results from case studies of development and climate that have done a first attempt to use human wellbeing indicators are reported and discussed. The studies include work from India, China, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, and Senegal. A number of policy examples in the energy-, food-, and water sectors in these studies have shown up to demonstrate numerous linkages between development policies and climate change. Various analytical tools have been used in the studies including quantitative and qualitative scenario work as well as detailed micro-based analysis. The methodological conclusion that can be drawn from these studies, is that it is possible to apply wellbeing indicators to the more detailed policy assessment, but a link to more general national and regional scenario work is not yet established. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.","Development and climate change linkages; Energy-, food-, and water security in developing countries; Wellbeing indicators","adaptation; climate change; developing world; environmental policy; food security; mitigation; policy analysis; social capital; Africa; Asia; Bangladesh; Brazil; China; Eurasia; Far East; India; Senegal; South Africa; South America; South Asia; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; West Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447100225

In this context, we initiated the development of new approaches for linking climate change information and economic studies. We have considered a number of case studies that illustrate how linkages can be established between geographically detailed climate data and economic information. The case studies included wheat production in agriculture, where regional climate data has been linked to farm enterprise data in an integrated model of physical conditions, production inputs and outputs, and farm management practices. Similarly, temperature data were used to assess consequences of extreme heat and excess mortality in urban areas. We give an introduction of an analytical approach for assessing economic impacts of climate change and discuss how economic concepts and valuation paradigms can be applied to climate change impact evaluation. A number of methodological difficulties encountered in economic assessments of climate change impacts are described and a number of issues related to social and private aspects of costs are highlighted.

Here we examine the impact of liming on global warming potential by comparing the sum of Ca+ and Mg2+ to carbonate alkalinity in soil solutions beneath unmanaged vegetation versus limed row crops, and of streams and rivers in agricultural versus forested watersheds, mainly in southern Michigan. Soil solutions sampled by tension indicated that lime can act as either a source or a sink for CO2. However, infiltrating waters tended to indicate net CO2 uptake, as did tile drainage waters and streams draining agricultural watersheds. As nitrate concentrations increased in infiltrating waters, lime switched from a net CO2 sink to a source, implying nitrification as a major acidifying process. Dissolution of lime may sequester CO2 equal to roughly 25-50% of its C content, in contrast to the prevailing assumption that all of the carbon in lime becomes CO2. The ∼30 Tg/yr of agricultural lime applied in the United States could thus sequester up to 1.9 Tg C/yr, about 15% of the annual change in the U.S. CO2 emissions (12 Tg C/yr for 2002-2003). The implications of liming for atmospheric CO2 stabilization should be considered in strategies to mitigate global climate change.

The increase has closely followed the increase in CO2 emissions from the use of fossil fuels. Global warming caused by increasing amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is the major environmental challenge for the 21st century. Reducing worldwide emissions of CO2 requires multiple mitigation pathways, including reductions in energy consumption, more efficient use of available energy, the application of renewable energy sources, and sequestration. Sequestration is a major tool for managing carbon emissions. In a majority of cases CO2 is viewed as waste to be disposed; however, with advanced technology, carbon sequestration can become a value-added proposition. There are a number of potential opportunities that render sequestration economically viable. In this study, we review these most economically promising opportunities and pathways of carbon sequestration, including reforestation, best agricultural production, housing and furniture, enhanced oil recovery, coalbed methane (CBM), and CO2 hydrates. Many of these terrestrial and geological sequestration opportunities are expected to provide a direct economic benefit over that obtained by merely reducing the atmospheric CO2 loading. Sequestration opportunities in 11 states of the Southeast and South Central United States are discussed. Among the most promising methods for the region include reforestation and CBM. The annual forest carbon sink in this region is estimated to be 76 Tg C/year, which would amount to an expenditure of $11.1-13.9 billion/year. Best management practices could enhance carbon sequestration by 53.9 Tg C/year, accounting for 9.3% of current total annual regional greenhouse gas emission in the next 20 years. Annual carbon storage in housing, furniture, and other wood products in 1998 was estimated to be 13.9 Tg C in the region. Other sequestration options, including the direct injection of CO2 in deep saline aquifers, mineralization, and biomineralization, are not expected to lead to direct economic gain. More detailed studies are needed for assessing the ultimate changes to the environment and the associated indirect cost savings for carbon sequestration. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","Carbon sequestration; Coalbed methane; Enhanced oil recovery; Mineralization","carbon; methane; best management practice; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide enrichment; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; coalbed methane; emission control; gas hydrate; greenhouse gas; reforestation; agriculture; aquifer; biomineralization; carbon mineralization; carbon sequestration; cost control; economic evaluation; environmental change; environmental management; environmental protection; exhaust gas; geographic distribution; greenhouse effect; housing; oil industry; reforestation; review; United States; Agriculture; Air; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; Vehicle Emissions; North America; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847131431

The model was validated by comparison with several experimental findings, thus providing an effective tool for the primary and promoted SNCR process simulation. Experimental and simulated results show part-per-million level of sodium carbonate enhances NO removal efficiency and extend the effective SNCR temperature range in comparison with use of a nitrogen agent alone. The kinetic modeling, sensitivity and rate-of-production analysis suggest that the performance improvement can be explained as homogeneous sodium species reactions producing more reactive OH radicals. The net result of sodium species reactions is conversion of H2O and inactive HO2 radicals into reactive OH radicals, i.e. H2O+HO2=3OH, which enhances the SNCR performance of nitrogen agents by mainly increasing the production rate of NH2 radicals. Moreover, N2O and CO are eliminated diversely via the reactions Na+N2O = NaO+N2, NaO+CO=Na+CO2 and NaO2+CO=NaO+CO2, in the promoted SNCR process, especially in the NOxOUT process. © 2007 Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China (CIESC) and Chemical Industry Press (CIP).","kinetic model; mechanism; nitric oxide; selective non-catalytic reduction; simulation; sodium carbonate","Catalyst activity; Computer simulation; Nitric oxide; Sensitivity analysis; Sodium compounds; Thermal effects; SNCR performance; Sodium carbonate; Reaction kinetics; Catalyst activity; Computer simulation; Nitric oxide; Reaction kinetics; Sensitivity analysis; Sodium compounds; Thermal effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548428773

The nature and scale of these impacts will vary between the wool growing regions, depending on the manifestation of the climate change. The growth and quality of pasture and fodder crops may be affected by changes in rainfall amounts and variability as well as higher CO2 concentrations. Water resources in many regions are projected to decrease and become more variable. Animal health is expected to be adversely affected by rising temperatures and a greater incidence and range of pests and diseases. There is likely to be greater stress on the landscape principally brought about by rainfall deficits and increased climatic variability. There is also a strong possibility of increased competition for water and land resources from other agricultural activities, particularly cropping and meat production. The combination of these effects is likely to have an impact on both wool production and quality, with reduced productivity in marginal areas, possibly increased productivity in higher rainfall regions, increases in vegetable fault and dust contamination and changes in mean fibre diameter and staple strength. National and international markets could also be affected, with reductions in demand for apparel wool fibre in response to a more temperate climate. International production and supply markets might also shift, with the wetter wool growing areas of both New Zealand and China potentially being advantaged by climate change, and the drier wool regions of these countries being disadvantaged. A preliminary qualitative scenario analysis suggests that although the wool industry will be significantly affected by climate change, as a whole it is likely to be relatively robust to it. Early adaptation, for example through efforts to produce low emission grazing systems, more sustainable management especially in the rangelands, and improved management of the effects of climate variation, could significantly reduce the downsides of climate change impacts. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The UK has made climate change a public policy priority and it had already implemented various policy measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), including a smaller Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS). The UK experience provides insights into the complex issues involved in translating the need to allocate allowances under a cap-and-trade programme into a practical and workable allocation programme. Background on UK emissions and climate policies In 2003, GHG emission sources in the UK were responsible for around 655 Mt CO2 equivalents (of which 556 Mt, or 85%, was CO2), making it the second largest emitter of GHGs in Europe. The European Burden-Sharing Agreement (BSA) commits the UK to reducing emissions of all six Kyoto GHGs by 12.5% below its 1990 emissions by the first Kyoto commitment period. In addition to its international commitments, the UK has set for itself a more demanding national target for 2010 to reduce emissions of CO2 alone by 20% below 1990 levels, and to put itself ‘on a path towards’ a 60% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 (Department of Trade and Industry 2003). During the 1990s, the UK significantly reduced its GHG emissions. A major factor contributing to this development was substantial fuels-witching in the electric power sector from coal-fired to gas-fired generation. © Cambridge University Press 2007 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928305405

He states (correctly) that global warming is due primarily to the increase in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, and then proceed as though the only way to control the level of this offending gas is to restrict its emission rate. This procedure works by removing dilute CO2 from the atmosphere by the growth of biomass, which is converted by anaerobic digestion to yield methane, CO2, and stabilized digester residue. The first of these products is used beneficially; the latter two are segregated to be kept out of the active cycle, lowering CO2 levels if emission rate stays where it is. This process is called anthropogenic peat (AP) because the stabilized digester residue is like peat made in nature by the same process. The best plant for this purpose is sugarcane, the most efficient large converter of CO2 to biomass; this may well change in the future.",,,Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947240453

Layers of varying depths in the Kazan sediments were investigated in terms of (1) chemical parameters and (2) DNA-based microbial population structures. The latter was accomplished by analyzing the sequences of directly amplified 16S rRNA genes, resulting in the phylogenetic analysis of the prokaryotic communities. Sequences of organisms potentially associated with processes such as anaerobic methane oxidation and sulfate reduction were thus identified. Overall, the sediment layers revealed the presence of sequences of quite diverse bacterial and archaeal communities, which varied considerably with depth. Dominant types revealed in these communities are known as key organisms involved in the following processes: (1) anaerobic methane oxidation and sulfate reduction, (2) sulfide oxidation, and (3) a range of (aerobic) heterotrophic processes. In the communities in the lowest sediment layer sampled (22-34 cm), sulfate-reducing bacteria and archaea of the ANME-2 cluster (likely involved in anaerobic methane oxidation) were prevalent, whereas heterotrophic organisms abounded in the top sediment layer (0-6 cm). Communities in the middle layer (6-22 cm) contained organisms that could be linked to either of the aforementioned processes. We discuss how these phylogeny (sequence)-based findings can support the ongoing molecular work aimed at unraveling both the functioning and the functional diversities of the communities under study. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"archaeal DNA; bacterial DNA; lipid; methane; primer DNA; ribosome DNA; RNA 16S; Archaebacterium; bacterium; biodiversity; chemistry; classification; conference paper; ecosystem; gene library; genetics; isolation and purification; Mediterranean Sea; metabolism; Methanosarcina; microbiology; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; sediment; Archaea; Bacteria; Base Sequence; Biodiversity; DNA Primers; DNA, Archaeal; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Ecosystem; Environmental Microbiology; Gene Library; Geologic Sediments; Lipids; Mediterranean Sea; Methane; Methanosarcinales; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Prokaryota",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248196945

For this the mesoscale meteorological model LM, a dust emission scheme and a transport model were coupled. To test the model performance, two major Saharan dust outbreaks directed to Europe in August and October 2001 are simulated. Comparisons with sounding data and 10-m wind speeds from north African sites show that the LM provides reliable meteorological fields to describe the emission and near-source transport of dust. As shown by comparisons with satellite observations, lidar profiles, and Sun photometer measurements at selected stations, the spatiotemporal evolution of the dust plume is reasonably well reproduced by the model. The predicted dust interacts with the LM radiation at solar and thermal wavelengths. Saharan dust causes a negative effect on the net radiative budget at the top of the atmosphere in the source regions and accounts for a reduction in 10-m wind speeds. Thus it is responsible for a reduction in the dust production of up to about 50% during the October 2001 event.

This is a daunting task, and its magnitude and costs are debated among scientists as well as policy-makers [Stern, 2006]. While most GHGs in the past have been emitted by developed countries and they are called upon to reduce their emissions and take responsibility for past mistakes, the contribution of developing countries in the future will reach similar magnitudes and is equally threatening for life on this planet. While developing countries have no commitments under the UNFCCC, they can still contribute voluntarily to climate change mitigation. The Global Environment Facility (GEF), as the financial mechanism of the UNFCCC and the leading multilateral entity promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy in developing countries and countries in transition, needs to provide significant support to these countries with respect to reaching a path of sustainable energy supply and sustainable economic and social development. Since 1992, the GEF has provided around US$ 2 billion in grants to support projects in the climate change focal area, leveraging over US$ 10 billion in total investments. Most of these funds have been spent on climate change mitigation projects. The GEF's mandate with respect to mitigation is to develop, expand, and transform markets for energy and mobility in developing countries, enabling them to grow toward and efficiently operate on a less carbon-intensive path. In doing so, the GEF applies the incremental cost principle and is restricted in the selection of technologies by a number of factors. Developing markets for sustainable energy technologies and sustainable framework conditions is a long-term effort, and it is hard to understand how effective the GEF is or can be in fulfilling this mission. This paper discusses the magnitude of the challenge, and demonstrates that this challenge is too big for the GEF's limited funds, and provides some suggestions for the GEF's programming for maximizing its impact on global GHG emissions by seeking out the most rewarding opportunities and maximizing replication of successful project examples by effective outreach and knowledge management. © 2007 International Energy Initiative, Inc.",,"Carbon; Commerce; Developing countries; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Environmental regulations; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; International cooperation; Investments; Knowledge management; Planning; Sustainable development; Climate change mitigation; Developed countries; Framework conditions; Global environment facilities; Sustainable economics; Sustainable energy supply; Sustainable energy technology; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Climate change; climate change; concentration (composition); cost-benefit analysis; developing world; electricity supply; emission control; greenhouse gas; mitigation; policy making; renewable resource; social development; stabilization; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43449136714

Due to increasing fuel prices and limited crude oil resources the worldwide demand for Diesel engines for the passenger car sector is increasing - even in typical gasoline markets like the United States. The key factors for the further success of the HSDI Diesel engine are the fulfillment of future worldwide emission legislation and that the production costs of the technologies necessary to do so, do not make it uncompetitive in comparison to the various gasoline engine concepts. Heavy SUVs with relatively small engines will therefore have to face the biggest challenge. For the EU5 proposal currently under discussion, such vehicles will have to be certified as passenger cars (vehicle category M) and are no longer allowed to use the LCV standards (Light Commercial Vehicles, vehicle category N1 - Class III), which means a NOx reduction of 50% in the European Driving Cycle (EDC) will be necessary. In the USA, the FTP75 driving cycle and the highly loaded US06 cycle are the challenges which have to be met. In this paper a system approach to cope with future emission legislation is discussed, based on multicylinder engine results with different technology packages applied. Following technology assessment, the individual potential of each package to achieve legislative targets in US and EU is deduced in addition, development scenarios for the US and EU are discussed and the possibility of commonising technologies in the two markets evaluated.

One known source of emission of Cr(VI) is welding, especially with high Cr-content materials, such as stainless steels. An experimental effort was undertaken to expand and update Cr(VI) emission factors by conducting tests on four types of arc-welding operations: gas-metal arc welding (GMAW), shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), flux-core arc welding, and pulsed GMAW. Standard American Welding Society hood results were compared with a total enclosure method that permitted isokinetic sampling for particle size-cut measurement, as well as total collection of the aerosol. The fraction of Cr(VI) emitted per unit mass of Cr electrode consumed was determined. Consistent with AP-42 data, initial results indicate that a significant fraction of the total Cr in the aerosol is in the +6 oxidation state. The fraction of Cr(VI) and total aerosol mass produced by the different arc welding methods varies with the type of welding process used. Self-shielded electrodes that do not use a shield gas, for example, SMAW, produce greater amounts of Cr(VI) per unit mass of electrode consumed. The formation of Cr(VI) from standard electrode wires used for welding mild steel was below the method detection limit after eliminating an artifact in the analytical method used. © 2007 Air & Waste Management Association.",,"Chromium compounds; Electric shielding; Gas metal arc welding; Particle size; Steel; Welding electrodes; Emission reduction; Flux-core arc welding; Isokinetic sampling; Shielded metal arc welding (SMAW); Particulate emissions; chromium; stainless steel; buffer; chromium; aerosol; air pollutant; air sampling; article; comparative study; electrode; exhaust gas; filtration; flow rate; gas flow; oxidation; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; United States; vapor; welding; air pollutant; air pollution; chemistry; color; standard; welding; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Air Pollution; Buffers; Chromium; Color; Particle Size; Reference Standards; Welding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947720061

Emission of 1,3-butadiene has been controlled by a voluntary reduction program since 1997. Although the industrial emission of 1,3-butadiene in Japan has decreased in recent years, primarily due to a voluntary industrial emissions reduction program, the risks of exposure to it remain largely unknown. We assessed the risks and consequences of exposure to 1,3-butadiene on human health. A remarkable advantage of our risk assessment approach is the detailed assessment of exposure. Previously, we developed two different models that can be applied for the assessment of exposure: the first, the AIST-ADMER model estimates regional concentration distributions, whereas the second, the METI-LIS model estimates concentration distributions in the vicinity of factories. Both models were used for the assessment of exposure to 1,3-butadiene. Using exposure concentration and carcinogenic potency determined and reported by Environment Canada and Health Canada, we evaluated the excess lifetime cancer risk for persons exposed to 1,3-butadiene over the course of a lifetime. The results suggested that the majority of the population in Japan has an excess lifetime cancer risk of less than 10-5, whereas a small number of people living close to industrial sources had a risk of greater than 10-5. The results of the present assessment also showed that 1,3-butadiene in the general environment originates primarily from automobile emissions, such that a countermeasure of reducing emissions from cars is expected to be effective at reducing the total cancer risk among Japanese. On the other hand, individual risks among a population living in the vicinity of certain industrial sources were found to be significantly higher than those of the population living elsewhere, such that a reduction in emissions from a small number of specific industrial sources should be realized in order to reduce the high level of individual risk. Based on the results of our assessment, the Industrial Structure Council of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) in Japan decided to announce that the voluntary reduction program had been successful, and that emissions reductions should no longer be targeted across all industries in general, but instead that such reductions should be carried out in a small number of selected factories that emit excessively large amounts of emissions. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The start point of transcription of the mspA gene was mapped by primer extension and S1 nuclease experiments. The main promoter driving transcription of mspA was identified by single point mutations in lacZ fusions and resembled σA promoters of M. smegmatis. However, a 500-bp upstream fragment including PmspA in a transcriptional fusion with lacZ yielded only low β-galactosidase activity, whereas activity increased 12-fold with a 700-bp fragment. Activation of PmspA by the 200-bp element was almost eliminated by increasing the distance by 14 bp, indicating binding of an activator protein. The chromosomal mspA transcript had a size of 900 bases and was very stable with a half-life of 6 minutes, whereas the stabilities of episomal mspA transcripts with three other 5′ untranslated region (UTRs) were three- to sixfold reduced, indicating a stabilizing role of the native 5′ UTR of mspA. Northern blot experiments revealed that the amount of mspA mRNA was increased under nitrogen limitation but reduced under carbon and phosphate limitation at 42°C in stationary phase in the presence of 0.5 M sodium chloride, 18 mM hydrogen peroxide, and 10% ethanol and at acidic pH. These results show for the first time that M. smegmatis regulates porin gene expression to optimize uptake of certain nutrients and to protect itself from toxic solutes.

Certain policy, technological and educational initiatives taken to address the mounting problem, however, have proved marginally effective at best, having been designed and implemented without careful analysis of mine community dynamics, the organization of activities, operators' needs and local geological conditions. Marked improvements can only be achieved in this area through increased government-initiated dialogue with the now-ostracized illegal galamsey mining community; introducing simple, cost-effective techniques for the reduction of mercury emissions; and effecting government-sponsored participatory training exercises as mediums for communicating information about appropriate technologies and the environment. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Since the 1970s, however, deforestation and drainage have progressed on an enormous scale. In addition, El NiÑo and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drought and large-scale fires, which grow larger under the drought condition, are accelerating peatland devastation. That devastation enhances decomposition of soil organic matter and increases the carbon release to the atmosphere as CO2. This phenomenon suggests that tropical peatlands have already become a large CO2 source, but related quantitative information is limited. Therefore, we evaluated the CO2 balance of a tropical peat swamp forest in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, using 3 years of CO2 fluxes measured using the eddy covariance technique from 2002 through 2004. The forest was disturbed by drainage; consequently, groundwater level (GL) was reduced. The net ecosystem CO2 production (NEP) measurements showed seasonal variation, which was slightly positive or almost zero in the early dry season, and most-negative late in the dry season or early the rainy season. This seasonality is attributable to the seasonal pattern of climate, tree phenology and fires. Slightly positive NEP resulted from smaller ecosystem respiration (RE) and larger gross primary production (GPP) under conditions of high photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and large leaf area index (LAI). The most-negative NEP resulted from smaller GPP and larger RE. The smaller GPP was related to high vapor pressure deficit (VPD), small LAI and low PPFD because of smoke from fires. The larger RE was related to low GL. Annual NEP values were estimated respectively as -602, -382 and -313g Cm-2 yr-1 for 2002, 2003 and 2004. These negative NEP values show that the tropical peat swamp forest, disturbed by drainage, functioned as a CO2 source. That source intensity was highest in 2002, an ENSO year, mainly because of low PPFD caused by dense smoke emitted from large fires. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","CO22 balance; Disturbance; Drainage; Drought; ENSO; Fires; Flux measurement; Peatde composition; Southeast Asia; Tropical peat swamp forest","carbon balance; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; drought; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; environmental disturbance; net ecosystem production; peatland; photon flux density; seasonal variation; soil carbon; swamp forest; tropical region; Asia; Eurasia; Indonesia; Kalimantan; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846905525

The present paper first introduces the reasons for tillage in agriculture and discusses how this age-old agricultural practice is responsible for the degradation of natural resources and soils. The paper goes on to introduce conservation tillage (CT), a minimum tillage and surface mulch practice that was developed in response to the severe wind erosion caused by mouldboard tillage of grasslands and referred to as the American dust bowl of the 1930s. CT is then compared with CA, a suggested improvement on CT, where no-till, mulch, and rotations significantly improve soil properties (physical, biological, and chemical) and other biotic factors, enabling more efficient use of natural resources. CA can improve agriculture through improvement in water infiltration and reducing erosion, improving soil surface aggregates, reducing compaction through promotion of biological tillage, increasing surface soil organic matter and carbon content, moderating soil temperatures, and suppressing weeds. CA also helps reduce costs of production, saves time, increases yield through more timely planting, reduces diseases and pests through stimulation of biological diversity, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Availability of suitable equipment is a major constraint to successful CA, but advances in design and manufacture of seed drills by local manufacturers are enabling farmers to experiment and accept this technology in many parts of the world. Estimates of farmer adoption of CA are close to 100 million ha in 2005, indicating that farmers are convinced of the benefits of this technology. The paper concludes that agriculture in the next decade will have to produce more food, sustainably, from less land through more efficient use of natural resources and with minimal impact on the environment in order to meet growing population demands. This will be a significant challenge for agricultural scientists, extension personnel, and farmers. Promoting and adopting CA management systems can help meet this complex goal. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.",,"agricultural management; conservation management; conservation tillage; crop yield; food production; mulching; soil degradation; sustainability; wheat; yield response; Mexico [North America]; North America; Obregon; Sonora; Triticum aestivum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847350846

We examine these tensions through the development of the hydrogen energy economy in London and through attempts to cultivate new techniques of governance in realizing this vision. Through case study material, we develop two representations of the negotiation of new forms of governance. First, we outline the representation of 'London as world leader in progressive urban governance'. Second, we develop a characterization of 'the politics of the world city in CO2 reduction'. The article moves on to address the scalar making up of these representations, in relation to and through analysing multiple interpretations of London as a 'national exemplar'. The active positioning and representation of London as the exemplar by the national state and the specificities of London governance, we claim, enables the mayor to actively negotiate between the two sets of apparently conflicting logics of hydrogen development. London's energy strategy is therefore to a large extent 'nationalized' while at the same time national energy policy is also regionalized around London. Consequently, London is differentially and positively positioned in comparison to other city-regions of the UK. The need to develop a sustainability fix that can allow London, and the greater South East of England, to continue to grow economically and within the apparent constraints of environmental limits requires a specific governance fix around the national exemplar and new socio-technical energy networks, which we characterize as 'strategic glurbanization'. © 2007 The Authors.

James argues that in the face of these changes, Saskatchewan wants to expand its diverse renewable and non-renewable energy resources by stimulating further investment, to meet the needs of our consumers, to create employment opportunities and to generate wealth from exports to markets both in Canada and around the world. On the electricity front, Saskatchewan requires new electricity supplies to replace old plants and to meet load growth. Traditional compliant coal powered generating facilities face an uncertain future due to significant greenhouse gas emission concerns from such plants. This uncertainty has given rise to innovative ideas for continued use of the province's abundant lignite resource to generate power in environmentally responsible ways, and to augmenting power supply from renewable energy sources. More fundamentally, there appears to be a shift underway in Canada to consider power supply needs in regional contexts rather than only from province-centric perspectives. This shift could lend support to the consideration of new base load power generating facilities that supply a region extending beyond the province's borders, and made possible by strong regional power transmission systems.",,"electricity industry; electricity supply; employment; energy market; energy use; greenhouse gas; renewable resource; Canada; North America; Saskatchewan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447293568

Using molecular dynamics (MD) we studied the effect of Ser46 phosphorylation on the molecular properties of HPr and its capability to act as the co-repressor of carbon catabolite protein A (CcpA). The calculated pKa values for a representative set of HPr(Ser46P) structures indicate that the phosphate group of HPr(Ser46P) exists predominately in the unprotonated form under neutral conditions. A hydrogen bond detected in HPr(Ser46P) between one phosphate-group oxygen and a side-chain hydrogen of Asn43 - an amino acid conserved in all HPr proteins of Gram-positive bacteria that regulate their carbon consumption by CCR - might fulfil an important role in CcpA-HPr(Ser46P) complex formation. MD simulations show that the Ser46P-Asn43 hydrogen bond present in the unbound structure is replaced by intermolecular interactions upon complex formation. The degree to which amino acids in the CcpA-HPr(Ser46P) interface contribute to cofactor binding was analyzed by in silico alanine scanning. Lys307, Arg303, Asp296, Val300, and Tyr295 of CcpA were identified as important amino acids for the CcpA-HPr(Ser46P) interaction. Three of these residues are directly involved in sensing the correct phosphorylation state at His15(HPr) and Ser46(HPr). A substitution of interface residues Val319, Val314, Ser316, Leu321 and Gln320 by alanine showed that these amino acids, which contact helix α2 of HPr(Ser46P), play a less prominent role for complex formation. © Springer-Verlag 2007.","Alanine scan; HPr; Hydrogen bond; Molecular dynamics; pK calculation; Transcriptional control","alanine; amino acid; arginine; aspartic acid; bacterial protein; carbon; glucagon; histidine; histidine containing phosphocarrier protein; hydrogen; leucine; lysine; oxygen; serine; tyrosine; unclassified drug; valine; amino acid sequence; amino acid substitution; article; complex formation; computer model; Gram positive bacterium; hydrogen bond; molecular dynamics; molecular interaction; nonhuman; pKa; priority journal; protein analysis; protein binding; protein interaction; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; protein structure; proton transport; sequence alignment; simulation; transcription regulation; Amino Acid Substitution; Amino Acids; Bacterial Proteins; Binding Sites; Gram-Positive Bacteria; Models, Molecular; Phosphoenolpyruvate Sugar Phosphotransferase System; Phosphorylation; Phosphoserine; Protein Conformation; Recombinant Proteins; Transcription, Genetic; Bacteria (microorganisms); Posibacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947581228

A great challenge during engineering work was ensuring a high concentration of the reactive gas where needed and at the same time minimising work place impact in a machine basically without housing. Preliminary 2D-models of the machine geometry proved to be insufficient in describing all the governing flow phenomena. A simplified 3D-geometry containing all important parts of the complex machinery was necessary for accurate predictions. It was found that the driving force of air movement and transport of reactive gas (which acts as an adhesive agent) from the reaction zone in the interior of the laminating machine to the outside is a boundary flow caused by the rapid movement of carton material and rotating cylinders. A physically correct simulation result of the boundary flow is a premise for correct prediction of air flow in and around the machinery. Lacking experimental data (due to an inaccessible geometry) a worst case scenario was constructed by generating a grid and using turbulence models that maximised mass transport in the boundary layer region and thus emission of (tracer)gas from the machine. CFD simulations were done using the geometry preprocessor Gambit™, and the finite volume solver Fluent™. The results of the analysis of the emission paths from the machine were surprising and led to the construction of an effective off-take relatively far away from the emission source. The chosen position ensures low disturbance of highly sensitive flow patterns inside the machine and diffusive mixing, dilution and contamination of the surroundings. The effect of the new off-take is an immediate and significant rise in air quality in the vicinity of the laminating machine and ensures maximum allowed concentration in the plant area. The product quality furthermore is uncompromised by the working off-take which was another important goal of this work. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Shifts in flowering phenology were particularly evident for Montréal, a large metropolitan region; this suggests that global climate warming, and its effects on plant phenology, may be exacerbated by local conditions, particularly those associated with large urban areas.

Moreover, the tropical species we examined changed their dominant nitrogen source abruptly, and in unison, in response to precipitation change.

The emission of all complexes originates from the lowest triplet excited-states (T1), and the corresponding emissive states are assigned as the mixture of the metal-centered charge transfer and ligand-to-metal charge transfer. The features of the emission spectrum are clarified in detail. The bulk emission spectrum of complex is mainly determined by the stacked dimers rather than the individual monomers. The predicted maximum emission wavelength (λem) are in good agreement with experimental values, indicating that the phosphorescence bands can be assigned to two different conformations for the neighboring stacked dimers sharing the same monomer in the complex. Energy transfer from T 1 of one stacked dimer to the neighboring one is responsible for the disappearance of the shoulder, leaving only the main peak upon heating. With the aim to reveal the conformational dependence for the triplet excited-state emission spectrum, the optical properties of various stacked dimers with different conformations are investigated by varying the relative arrangements through changing inter-monomer distance or rotational angles for the dimer which is responsible for the main peak emission. Calculation results suggest that the shortest intermolecular Cu⋯Cu distance plays an important role in the emission spectra of the vertical- and tilting-movement dimers, which is ascribed to the variation of the energy gap for the frontier molecular orbitals involved in the main emitting transition. The blue shift of λem in parallel-movement and rotational dimers can be traced back to the variation of the mutual spatial orientation. Therefore, the modulation of the extent of movement or rotational angles for stacked dimers by external perturbations creates new possibilities for the design of molecular light-emitting devices. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Complexation; Copper compounds; Dimers; Emission spectroscopy; Molecular orbitals; Monomers; Optical properties; Frontier molecular orbitals; Phosphorescence bands; Stacked dimers; Esters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34347344898

Net primary production (NPP) of Chinese croplands and driving factors are seldom taken into account in the regional carbon budget. We studied crop NPP by analyzing the documented crop yields from 1950 to 1999 on a provincial scale. Total NPP, including estimates of the aboveground and belowground components, was calculated from harvested yield data by (1) conversion from economic yield of the crop to aboveground mass using the ratio of aboveground residue production to the economic yield, (2) estimation of belowground mass as a function of aboveground mass, and (3) conversion from total dry mass to carbon mass. This approach was applied to 13 crops, representing 86.8% of the total harvested acreage of crops in China. Our results indicated that NPP in Chinese croplands increased markedly during this period. Averaging for each decade, the amount of NPP was 146 ± 32, 159 ± 34, 260 ± 55, 394 ± 85, and 513 ± 111 Tg C/yr (mean ± SD) in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, respectively. This increase may be attributed to synthetic fertilizer application. A further investigation indicated that the climate parameters of temperature and precipitation determined the spatial variability in NPP. Spatiotemporal variability in NPP can be well described by the consumption of synthetic fertilizer and by climate parameters. In addition, the total amount of residue C and root C retained by the soils was estimated to be 618 Tg, with a range from 300 to 1040 Tg over the 50 years. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","Agricultural statistics; China; Crop yield; Net primary production; Spatiotemporal variability","carbon; fertilizer; rain; aboveground biomass; agricultural land; carbon budget; crop yield; fertilizer application; net primary production; spatial variation; temporal variation; article; China; crop; growth, development and aging; soil; temperature; Carbon; China; Crops, Agricultural; Fertilizers; Rain; Soil; Temperature; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247186963

Development agencies and policy makers tasked with implementing adaptive strategies recognize the need to plan for these impacts. However at present there is little guidance on how to prioritize their funding to best improve the resilience of vulnerable communities. Here we address this issue by arguing that closer collaboration between the climate modelling and health communities is required to provide the focused information necessary to best inform policy makers. The immediate requirement is to create multidisciplinary research teams bringing together skills in both climate and health modelling. This will enable considerable information exchange, and closer collaboration will highlight current uncertainties and hopefully routes to their reduction. We recognize that climate is only one aspect influencing the highly complex behaviour of health and disease issues.

Photosynthetic microbes were the focus of similar consideration in the 1990s. However, two major government-sponsored research programs in Japan and the USA concluded that the requisite technology was not feasible, and those programs were terminated after investing US$117 million and US$25 million, respectively. We report here on the results of a privately funded US$20 million program that has engineered, built, and successfully operated a commercial-scale (2 ha), modular, production system for photosynthetic microbes. The production system couples photobioreactors with open ponds in a two-stage process - a combination that was suggested, but never attempted - and has operated continuously for several years to produce Haematococcus pluvialis. The annually averaged rate of achieved microbial oil production from H. pluvialis is equivalent to &lt;420 GJ ha -1 yr-1, which exceeds the most optimistic estimates of biofuel production from plantations of terrestrial ""energy crops."" The maximum production rate achieved to date is equivalent to 1014 GJ ha-1 yr-1. We present evidence to demonstrate that a rate of 3200 GJ ha-1 yr-1 is feasible using species with known performance characteristics under conditions that prevail in the existing production system. At this rate, it is possible to replace reliance on current fossil fuel usage equivalent to ∼300 EJ yr -1 - and eliminate fossil fuel emissions of CO2 of ∼6.5 GtC yr-1 - using only 7.3% of the surplus arable land projected to be available by 2050. By comparison, most projections of biofuels production from terrestrial energy crops would require in excess of 80% of surplus arable land. Oil production cost is estimated at $84/bbl, assuming no improvements in current technology. We suggest enhancements that could reduce cost to $50/bbl or less. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Biodiesel; Bioenergy; Bioengineering; Biofuels; Microalgae; Microbes; Mitigation; Photobioreactor; Photosynthesis","biofuel; bioreactor; carbon dioxide; cost-benefit analysis; microalga; microorganism; mitigation; oil production; renewable resource; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Japan; North America; United States; Haematococcus pluvialis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247366382

Since the breaking of agricultural land in most regions, the carbon stocks have been depleted to such an extent, that they now represent a potential sink for CO2 removal from the atmosphere. Improved management will however, be required to increase the inputs of organic matter in the top soil and/or decrease decomposition rates. In this paper we use data from selected regions to explore the global potential for carbon sequestration in arable soils. While realising that C sequestration is not limited to the selected regions, we have, however, focussed our review on two regions: (i) Canadian Prairies and (ii) The Tropics. In temperate regions, management changes for an increase in C involve increase in cropping frequency (reducing bare fallow), increasing use of forages in crop rotations, reducing tillage intensity and frequency, better crop residue management, and adopting agroforestry. In the tropics, agroforestry remains the primary method by which sequestration rates may be significantly increased. Increases in soil C may be achieved through improved fertility of cropland/pasture; on extensive systems with shifting cultivation cropped fallows and cover crops may be beneficial, and adopting agro forestry or foresting marginal cropland is also an alternative. In addition, in the tropics it is imperative to reduce the clearing of forests for conversion to cropland. Some regional analyses of soil C sequestration and sequestration potential have been performed, mainly for temperate industrialized North America where the majority of research pertaining to C sequestration has been carried out. More research is needed, especially for the Tropics, to more accurately capture the impact of region-specific interactions between climate, soil, and management of resources on C sequestration, which are lost in global level assessments. By itself, C sequestration in agricultural soils can make only modest contributions (3-6% of fossil fuel contributions) to mitigation of overall greenhouse gas emissions. However, effective mitigation policies will not be based on any single 'magic bullet' solutions, but rather on many modest reductions which are economically efficient and which confer additional benefits to society. In this context, soil C sequestration is a significant mitigation option. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We have cloned the acuG gene encoding fructose-1,6 bisphosphatase and found that expression of this gene is regulated by carbon catabolite repression as well as by induction by a TCA cycle intermediate similar to the induction of the previously studied acuF gene encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. The acuN356 mutation results in loss of growth on gluconeogenic carbon sources. Cloning of acuN has shown that it encodes enolase, an enzyme involved in both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. The acuN356 mutation is a translocation with a breakpoint in the 59 untranslated region resulting in loss of expression in response to gluconeogenic but not glycolytic carbon sources. Mutations in the acuK and acuM genes affect growth on carbon sources requiring gluconeogenesis and result in loss of induction of the acuF, acuN, and acuG genes by sources of TCA cycle intermediates. Isolation and sequencing of these genes has shown that they encode proteins with similar but distinct Zn(2) Cys(6) DNA-binding domains, suggesting a direct role in transcriptional control of gluconeogenic genes.

Nevertheless, because of numerical difficulties in evaluating the contribution from supersonic sources, most of the computing tools are still unable to treat the critical velocities at which the shock delocalization occurs. At those conditions, the attention is usually limited to the comparison between the noise prediction and the experimental data in the narrow time region where the pressure peak value is located, but there has been little attention paid to the singular behaviour of the governing equation at supersonic speeds. The aim of this paper is to couple the advantages of the porous formulation to an emission surface integration scheme in order to show if and how the singularities affect the noise prediction and to demonstrate a practical way to remove them. Such an analysis enables an investigation of some interesting and somewhat hidden features of the numerical solution of the governing equation and suggests a new solution approach to predicting the noise of a rotor at any rotational velocity. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.",,"Aircraft propellers; Helicopter rotors; Integration; Supersonic aerodynamics; Aeroacoustic analysis; Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equation; Noise prediction; Rotating blades; Acoustic noise; Acoustic noise; Aircraft propellers; Helicopter rotors; Integration; Supersonic aerodynamics; Kirchhoff equation; noise; numerical method; rotating flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845985653

We have investigated the interaction between AHR and hypoxia signaling pathways in regulation of angiogenesis with the use of a surgical model of ischemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ischemia was induced by femoral artery occlusion in wild-type and AHR-null mice. Ischemia-induced angiogenesis was markedly enhanced in AHR-null mice compared with that in wild-type animals. Ischemia-induced upregulation of the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and ARNT as well as that of target genes for these transcription factors, such as that for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), were also enhanced in AHR-null mice. Furthermore, the DNA binding activity of the HIF-1α-ARNT complex as well as the association of HIF-1α and ARNT with the VEGF gene promoter were increased by ischemia to a greater extent in AHR-null mice than in wild-type animals. CONCLUSIONS: Ablation of AHR resulted in enhancement of ischemia-induced angiogenesis. This effect was likely attributable in part to the associated enhancement of ischemia-induced VEGF expression, which in turn may be caused by an increased abundance and activity of the HIF-1α-ARNT heterodimer. © 2007 American Heart Association, Inc.","Angiogenesis; Hypoxia; Ischemia; Peripheral vascular disease; Smoking","aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; DNA; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; hypoxia inducible factor 1beta; transcription factor; vasculotropin; angiogenesis; animal tissue; artery occlusion; article; comparative study; controlled study; DNA binding; femoral artery; ischemia; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein binding; protein expression; protein function; protein interaction; upregulation; Angiogenic Proteins; Animals; Anoxia; Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator; Benzo(a)pyrene; Blood Flow Velocity; Capillaries; Carcinogens; Disease Models, Animal; DNA; Femoral Artery; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; Ischemia; Laser-Doppler Flowmetry; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor; Regional Blood Flow; RNA, Messenger; Time Factors; Up-Regulation; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249655769

Location: Alpine zone in the Japanese archipelago. Methods: We determined the chloroplast (cp) DNA haplotypes of 155 individuals (22 populations) based on sequence data from the trnL-F and trnT-L intergenic spacers and the trnL intron, whose phylogenetic relationships were analysed using the program tcs. To examine the genetic structure, analysis of molecular variance (amova) was carried out and the population differentiation was shown by the parameters GST and NST. Results: The haplotype composition and the results of amova showed that populations in the Japanese Central Mountain Region (JCMR) and in the westernmost region were highly divergent (18.8%). The diversity within populations was very high in the JCMR (hS = 0.421); less variation was found within populations located in other regions at lower elevations. Main conclusions: Phyllodoce nipponica survived climatic changes during the Quaternary in the JCMR and the westernmost region.

The simulated carbon tax leads to reduced harvest and increased carbon stock in the standing trees and understory biomass. Changes in the level of silvicultural investments vary by owner, depending on the nature of their initial inventory. In general investment under the tax is concentrated in regimes that establish faster growing plantations. Average rotation age increases, varying in extent across ownerships and site qualities. The carbon tax reduces both consumer and producer surpluses in regional timber markets. Producers are compensated by the carbon subsidies, except at low carbon tax levels. Not all rates of carbon tax will attract interest from private owners if participation is voluntary.

We previously reported that the introduction of a certain rpoB mutation (rpoB5) into Bacillus subtilis enables the cells to overproduce NTD. B. subtilis mini-Tn10 transposant libraries have been screened for genes that affect NTD production. Inactivation of ccpA, which encodes a major transcriptional regulator of carbon catabolite regulation, markedly reduced NTD production. By contrast, inactivation of glcP, which is situated just downstream of ntdABC and encodes a glucose/mannose:H+ symport permease, stimulated NTD production. Overexpression of glcP led to the repression of ntdABC expression (and thus NTD production) in response to GlcP-mediated glucose uptake. These results suggest that CcpA-mediated catabolite activation of ntdABC expression occurs in response to the increase of the in vivo concentration of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate via glucose-6-phosphate and that GlcP-mediated glucose repression of ntdABC expression occurs in association with the increase of the in vivo concentration of unphosphorylated glucose. In addition, Northern analysis showed that glcP is transcribed from the ntdABC promoter through transcription readthrough at the ntdABC transcription terminator site, which enables NTD to function as a modulator of glucose uptake through the stimulation of ntdABC-glcP transcription, even in wild-type (rpoB+) cells. A trace amount (0.5 to 3 μg/ml) of NTD was sufficient to ensure expression of glcP, thus demonstrating the physiological role of ""antibiotic"" in the producing bacteria by functioning as an autoinducer for glucose uptake modulation.

Temperature and soil moisture content are important environmental variables in bioremediation technologies. Optimizing these variables in-situ would enhance and maintain remediation of hazardous wastes during cold winter seasons or in cold regions and may lead to reduced maintenance and/or cost. The effect of elevated temperature and soil moisture on bioremediation efficiency was investigated using a laboratory mesocosm approach. Selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and phenols degradation in contaminated flooded soils, commonly found in Superfund sites situated in coastal plains sediments/soils, were evaluated in the mesocosms. Material and Methods. Four laboratory mesocosm treatments in triplicate simulating in-situ bioremediation of contaminated site soils using an immobilized microbe bioreactor system, i.e., bioplug, were established to evaluate temperature effects. Elevated temperature treatments of site soils with and without contaminant-specific micro-organisms were established at a temperature of 42±2°C. Similarly, treatment of site soils with and without contaminant-specific micro-organisms were established at an ambient temperature of 21±1°C. Composite samples were analyzed for selected PAHs and chlorinated phenols to determine rates of mineralization and overall remediation efficiency for different temperature regimes. Results. Mesocosm studies indicated that the high temperature inoculated treatment demonstrated a significant reduction in mean total PAHs and total phenols with a kinetic rate (KR) of 76±13 ng g-1 d-1 in 49 days (approximately 84% reduction; p≤0.01) The KR for low temperature inoculated treatment was 54±1 ng g-1 d-1 in 49 day (approximately 66% reduction; p≤0.01). High temperature non-inoculated mesocosms exhibited significant mineralization of all constituents with KR of 15±6 ng g-1 d-1 (approximately 65% reduction; p≤0.01) in 49d compared to 54% reduction for low temperature non-inoculated treatment with KR of 12±3 ng g-1 d-1 (p=0.1794). Phenol compounds in inoculated treatments were also significantly reduced (65%, p≤0.01) at elevated temperatures compared to ambient (52%, p≤0.01). Discussion. Increased bioavailability and desorption were noted for elevated temperature and moisture in the soil laboratory mesocosms simulating a field in situ remediation protocol. This protocol employing the application of immobilized microflora indicated that in situ systems provide an economical advantage if optimal elevated temperature and moisture are controlled properly. Results also suggested that temperature and moisture optimization needs to be combined with efficient nutrients delivery systems for impacted soils/sediments. Conclusions. The study demonstrated that temperature and sod moisture contents are important factors in the success of in-situ bioremediation techniques at hazardous waste sites situated in a coastal zone. Kinetic rates were significantly enhanced to remediate known recalcitrant compounds (PAHs and phenols) in aged soil. Recommendations and Perspectives. The placement of a preferred microbial consortia such as an immobilized microbial population in an entrained bioreactor, i.e., bioplug, can significantly reduce constituents of concern in a timely manner for contaminated soils/sediments. However, frequent monitoring of the soil temperature, moisture content, nutrient level, and dissolved oxygen is necessary to achieve predictable kinetic rates of mineralization. © 2007 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).","Bioremediation; Immobilized microbe bioreactor; Kinetic rates; Mesocosm; Phenols; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Superfund; Temperature","bioremediation; hazardous waste; mesocosm; PAH; PCP; soil moisture; soil pollution; Superfund; temperature effect; Louisiana; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34347243503

It is considered a developing country that is deficient in generating its own energy source, and it relies significantly on imports of fuels from other countries, which plays an important role in various environmental related problems and issues. Jordan is distinguished among the developing countries by its reasonable industrialization and significant agricultural activities. The amount of waste generated is on the increase due to a continuing significant increase in population and it currently faces pollution of its limited fresh water sources. To mitigate the current and future environmental problems facing Jordan due to fossil fuel use and associated environment problems, Jordan is taking into consideration steps including the utilization of the biogas technology to replace fossil fuel, since Jordan is a nation striving to meet the expected energy demand that grows annually by 6%. Studies of quantity per capita estimates Jordan's generated daily waste as 8,000 tons, which is comparable to that of most semi-industrialized nations. Of that, 3,200 tons is household waste and the rest of it is waste related to industry or agricultural. Much of the total waste is organic, which could be utilized through a process of anaerobic digestion and already has been in use for decades in industrialized nations to produce clean burning methane gas, electricity, fuel, and fertilizers. Anaerobic digestion process releases no greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Jordan's generated daily waste is estimated around the same as that of most moderately developing nations. Most of the total waste is organic, which could be utilized through a process of anaerobic digestion that does not release greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Renewable energy and energy conservation, if efficiently utilized, might help to meet the expected increase demand on energy that is growing rapidly. A combined facility (landfill operation and biogas plant) that is established in the capital of Jordan could help reduce the disposal and accumulation of biodegradable solid waste significantly; by 90%. This will help reduce emissions of green house gases (CO2), reduce the dependency of foreign fossil fuel and would improve issues related to the general environment. This project would be self-supported. This project, if proved to be successful, would be an example that others will follow throughout.","Anaerobic digestion; Jordan; Renewable energy; Solid waste","Anaerobic digestion; Greenhouse gases; Jordan; Land fill; Methane; Renewable energy resources; Biogas plant; Environmental related problems; Landfill operation; Methane gas; Solid wastes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34147130742

The levels of Ox′ (where [Ox′] = [O3] + [NO2] - 0.1 × [NOx] where the last term accounts for primary emissions of NO2) were uniform within the city even in the photochemically active season. We suggested that NO oxidation by peroxy radicals was a minor contributor, and that oxidation of locally emitted NO by background O3 in the city was the primary control on NO2 concentrations. Ozone concentrations increased linearly from 1985 to 2002 at a rate of 0.6 ppbv/yr, even though Ox′ concentrations remained constant after the mid 1990s. The trend for Ox′ concentrations could not be explained in terms of an increase in local O3 production, and the trend was found to reflect background O3 concentrations in Japan. There was a clear relationship between the NO2/Ox′ ratio and NOx concentration: the ratio decreased with decreasing NOx concentration. As a consequence, O3 increased with decreasing NOx concentration. The reduction of NOx emissions was deemed to be an important factor for the recent trend of increasing O3 concentrations in Osaka City. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This sample constitutes the largest and most homogeneous high-quality data set in existence for the determination of Yp. For comparison, and to improve the statistics in our investigation of systematic effects aifecting the Y p determination, we have also considered a sample of 271 low-metallicity H II regions selected from Data Release 5 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Although this larger sample shows more scatter, it gives results that are consistent at the 2 σ level with our original sample. We have considered known systematic effects that may affect the 4He abundance determination. They include different sets of He I line emissivities and reddening laws, collisional and fluorescent enhancements of He I recombination lines, underlying He I stellar absorption lines, collisional excitation of hydrogen lines, temperature and ionization structure of the H II region, and deviation of He I and H emission-line intensities from case B. However, the most likely value of Yp depends on the adopted set of He I line emissivities. Using Monte Carlo methods to solve simultaneously the above systematic effects, we find a primordial helium mass fraction of Yp = 0.2472 ′ 0.0012 when using the He I emissivities from Benjamin and coworkers and 0.2516 ′ 0.0011 when using those from Porter and coworkers. The first value agrees well with the value given by standard big bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN) theory, while the value obtained with the likely more accurate emissivities of Porter and co-workers is higher at the 2 σ level. This latter value, if confirmed, would imply slight deviations from SBBN. © 2007. The American Astronomical Society.

Here, a nested global-through-urban air pollution/weather forecast model is combined with high-resolution future emission inventories, population data, and health effects data to examine the effect of converting from gasoline to E85 on cancer, mortality, and hospitalization in the United States as a whole and Los Angeles in particular. Under the base-case emission scenario derived, which accounted for projected improvements in gasoline and E85 vehicle emission controls, it was found that E85 (85% ethanol fuel, 15% gasoline) may increase ozone-related mortality, hospitalization, and asthma by about 9% in Los Angeles and 4% in the United States as a whole relative to 100% gasoline. Ozone increases in Los Angeles and the northeast were partially offset by decreases in the southeast. E85 also increased peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) in the U.S. but was estimated to cause little change in cancer risk. Due to its ozone effects, future E85 may be a greater overall public health risk than gasoline. However, because of the uncertainty in future emission regulations, it can be concluded with confidence only that E85 is unlikely to improve air quality over future gasoline vehicles.

Utilization of terrestrial C sinks alleviates the burden of countries which are committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. Land-use changes such as those which result from afforestation and management of fast-growing tree species, have an immediate effect on the regional rate of C sequestration by incorporating carbon dioxide (CO2) in plant biomass. The potential for such practices is limited in Europe by environmental and political constraints. The management of existing forests can also increase C sequestration, but earlier reviews found conflicting evidence regarding the effects of forest management on soil C pools. We analyzed the effects of harvesting, thinning, fertilization application, drainage, tree species selection, and control of natural disturbances on soil C dynamics. We focused on factors that affect the C input to the soil and the C release via decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM). The differentiation of SOM into labile and stable soil C fractions is important. There is ample evidence about the effects of management on the amount of C in the organic layers of the forest floor, but much less information about measurable effects of management on stable C pools in the mineral soil. The C storage capacity of the stable pool can be enhanced by increasing the productivity of the forest and thereby increasing the C input to the soil. Minimizing the disturbances in the stand structure and soil reduces the risk of unintended C losses. The establishment of mixed species forests increases the stability of the forest and can avoid high rates of SOM decomposition. The rate of C accumulation and its distribution within the soil profile differs between tree species. Differences in the stability of SOM as a direct species effect have not yet been reported. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

These decisions were taken in Poland after a lot of hesitation and discussions, which often expressed fears as to whether the policy of reducing CO2 emission would impose too much burden on Poland, because of the heavy domination of coal in its fuel consumption. Many concerns were expressed regarding the introduction of a ‘coal tax’, which at that time was expected to be the most realistic instrument of coal emission control. However, the political will to support the efforts of the international community on climate protection prevailed. General economic, social and environmental context Until the fall `of the communist political regime in 1989, the centralised economic system dominated in Poland, largely based on development of heavy industry. Special environmental policy was not carried out. The economic transition period started in 1989, after important political changes aimed at creating a market-oriented economy. Transition costs were very high. The GDP dropped drastically during the first years and in 1991 it was 18% lower than in 1989. Unemployment rose and is in constant growth.

With these coming pressures, how can we foster permanence on the lands that sustain us? In this essay I contemplate the hypothesis that the greenhouse gases, because they emanate from the interwoven flows of C, N, and energy in ecosystems, can help steer us toward permanence (sustainability). Alongside other indicators these emissions may detect the ecosystem's pulse, alerting us to inefficiencies and guiding us to better practices. To be effective signals, however, the greenhouse gases will need to be considered in their local settings, monitored longer and in more ""listening places,"" and measured across boundaries of disciplines and biomes. This approach may help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our farmlands.

Of the references cited in this review, 60% date from 2000 onward. This is despite the fact that the use of CO2 as a viscosity-reducing agent for crude oil has been investigated since 1951 (see references within ref 219). Nevertheless, the creativity of the research community is now fully engaged, and there are already many examples of facilitated separations, reactions, materials processing, and particle formation. In virtually every application, the GXLs represent an enabling tool for effecting significant improvements in one or more process performance measures such as reaction rate, transport rate, product selectivity, product quality, and environmental friendliness. New research directions include cleaning, in situ acid-promoted reactions, and multifunctional CO2-aided continuous catalytic reaction systems that integrate reaction and separation. Successful development of new technologies will require multi-scale interdisciplinary research collaborations involving scientists and engineers. There are gray areas between expanded liquids and supercritical fluid mixtures that have not been discussed in this paper. For example, the CO2/coating material mixtures that are used in CO2-based spray coating systems are usually described as being supercritical, but they may not be supercritical in comparison to the true critical point of the mixture. CO2 /liquid mixtures of all kinds, whether expanded, supercritical, or both, will continue to be applied in new areas, including many that have not yet been imagined. Industrialization of expanded liquids has started in applications requiring viscosity reduction (e.g., crude oil recovery). Future commercial applications that exploit viscosity reduction will be most likely in polymer processing and particle formation.

Marine sediments from the Balearic basin (ODP Site 975) was analysed at high resolution to obtain both geochemical and mineralogical data. These data were compared with climate records from nearby areas. Baexcces was used to characterize marine productivity and then related to climatic variability. Since variations in productivity were the consequence of climatic oscillations, climate/productivity events have been established. Sedimentary regime, primary marine productivity and oxygen conditions at the time of population replacement were reconstructed by means of a multiproxy approach. Climatic/oceanographic variations correlate well with Homo spatial and occupational patterns in Southern Iberia. It was found that low ventilation (U/Th), high river supply (Mg/Al), low aridity (Zr/Al) and low values of Baexcess coefficient of variation, may be linked with Neanderthal hospitable conditions. We attempt to support recent findings which claim that Neanderthals populations continued to inhabit southern Iberia between 30 and ∼28 ky cal BP and that this persistence was due to the specific characteristics of South Iberian climatic refugia. Comparisons of our data with other marine and continental records appear to indicate that conditions in South Iberia were highly inhospitable at ∼24 ky cal BP. Thus, it is proposed that the final disappearance of Neanderthals in this region could be linked with these extreme conditions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The proxy record was established in the Sanjiaocheng (SJC), Triangle Town in Chinese, Section (103°20′25″E, 39°00′38″N), which is located at the northwestern boundary of the present Asian summer monsoon in China, and is sensitive to global environmental and climate changes. Applying singular spectrum analysis (SSA) to the TOC series, principal climatic oscillations and periodical changes were studied. The results reveal 3 major patterns of climate change regulated by reconstructed components (RCs). The first pattern is natural long-term trend of climatic change in the local area (Minqin Basin), indicating a relatively wetter stage in early Holocene (starting at 9.5 kaBP), and a relatively dryer stage with a strong lake desiccation and a declined vegetation cover in mid-Holocene (during 7-6 kaBP). From 4.0 kaBP to the present, there has been a gradually decreasing trend in the third reconstructed component (RC3) showing that the local climate changed again into a dryer stage. The second pattern shows millennial-centennial scale oscillations containing cycles of 1 600 and 800 years that have been present throughout almost the entire Holocene period of the last 10 000 years. The third pattern is a millennial-centennial scale variation with a relatively smaller amplitude and unclear cycles showing a nonlinear interaction within the earth's climate systems. © 2007 Science Press.","climatic change; lake sediment; oscillation analysis; proxy record; Quaternary Holocene; singular spectrum analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955376997

In combination with a global growing demand for food, this could lead to a food-fuel competition for bio-productive land. Proponents of bioenergy have suggested that energy crop plantations may be established on less productive land as a way of avoiding this potential food-fuel competition. However, many of these suggestions have been made without any underlying economic analysis. In this paper, we develop a long-term economic optimization model (LUCEA) of the U.S. agricultural and energy system to analyze this possible competition for land and to examine the link between carbon prices, the energy system dynamics and the effect of the land competition on food prices. Our results indicate that bioenergy plantations will be competitive on cropland already at carbon taxes about US $20/ton C. As the carbon tax increases, food prices more than double compared to the reference scenario in which there is no climate policy. Further, bioenergy plantations appropriate significant areas of both cropland and grazing land. In model runs where we have limited the amount of grazing land that can be used for bioenergy to what many analysts consider the upper limit, most of the bioenergy plantations are established on cropland. Under the assumption that more grazing land can be used, large areas of bioenergy plantations are established on grazing land, despite the fact that yields are assumed to be much lower (less than half) than on crop land. It should be noted that this allocation on grazing land takes place as a result of a competition between food and bioenergy production and not because of lack of it. The estimated increase in food prices is largely unaffected by how much grazing land can be used for bioenergy production. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.",,"Carbon; Costs; Economic analysis; Food processing; Fuel consumption; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Vegetation; Bioenergy production; Fuel competition; Plantations; Climatology; bioenergy; commodity price; competition (economics); food production; land use; pollution tax; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247197226

This means to reduce the primary energy used for heating which in this paper is analyzed in the context of various heating technologies and CO2 emissions. The analysis is applied to a region in Sweden (southern Sweden) for which detailed information on the energy infrastructure (the capital stock of the buildings and heating systems together with geographical variations in heat intensity) is available from a previous work [Johansson, P., Nylander, A., Johnsson, F., 2005. Electricity dependency and CO2 emissions from heating in the Swedish building sector-current trends in conflict with governmental policy? Energy policy] and which is large enough to be assumed representative for Sweden as a whole. The detailed mapping of the energy infrastructure allows a good estimate on the rate at which the energy system can be expected to be replaced with respect to economical lifetime of the capital stock (the year 2025 in this case). Two scenarios are investigated; a target scenario for which energy savings are employed (e.g. improving climate shell in buildings) and oil and most of the electricity used for heating purposes are phased out and a second for which the current trend in the heating market continues. In the target scenario it is shown that although only applying commercially competitive heating technologies, it is possible to achieve a 47% reduction in primary energy use for heating with a 34% decrease in heat demand together with significant reduction in CO2 emissions. However, the scenario which continues the current trends on the heating market instead yields an increase (of about 10%) in primary energy use (reduction in conversion efficiency) of the heating system of the region over the period studied, in spite of a slight decrease in heat demand (9%, mainly due to energy efficiency measures) as well as in CO2 emissions. In light of the recently proposed introduction of energy performance certification of buildings in Sweden (and in EU), it can be concluded that such a certification system must take into account the primary energy use and local conditions. A politically acceptable way to do so would be to propose municipalities to develop ""best strategies"" on development of the heating market for various house types and districts within the municipality which can then be included as recommendations in the energy performance certification of the buildings. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

By 2030, when California's light-duty vehicle stock has been substantially replaced by regulation-compliant vehicles, total emissions from regulated vehicles are projected to be reduced by 27% relative to ""business-as-usual"", but are nevertheless expected to be 8.7% higher than 2004 emissions. If an 8.7% increase truly represents the ""maximum feasible and cost-effective"" emissions reduction from transportation vehicles, then global climate stabilization clearly will not be attained within limits of ""feasibility"" and ""cost-effectiveness"", and climate sustainability will only be achievable through severely draconian measures. On the other hand, if significantly greater emissions reduction would be feasible and cost-effective, then the AB 1493 regulations fail to satisfy the legislative policy mandate and the task is to find a regulatory mechanism that will.

If promulgated, the reversal of the policy will allow facilities currently subject to MACT standards to be exempt from MACT upon reducing emissions below major source thresholds for hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) publicly released the draft proposed rule in April 2006, claiming that the rule would weaken nearly 100 toxic air pollution standards and allow industrial plants across the country to emit significantly greater amount of toxins. EPA disagrees, concluding that such an outcome is unlikely because pollution control devices installed to meet MACT standards are designed to operate a certain way and cannot be operated at a level that achieves only partial reduction, sources will maintain the level of emission reduction associated with the MACT standard because the level is required to meet other requirements of the Clean Air Act. The proposed rule includes some caveats on switching from a major source to an area source and reverting from an area source back to a major source. For instance, once a source switches from major source status to area source status, it may not switch back to major source status to avoid having to meet the MACT standard for an additional 3 years.",,"Air pollution control; Environmental Protection Agency; Industrial emissions; Particulate emissions; Regulatory compliance; atmospheric pollution; industrial emission; pollution control; standard (regulation); toxin; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947280929

Part one reviews the application of risk management methods to climate change assessments. Formal investigations of the enhanced greenhouse effect have produced three generations of risk assessment. The first led to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), First Assessment Report and subsequent drafting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The second investigated the impacts of unmitigated climate change in the Second and Third IPCC Assessment Reports. The third generation, currently underway, is investigating how risk management options can be prioritised and implemented. Mitigation and adaptation have two main areas of complementarity. Firstly, they each manage different components of future climate-related risk. Mitigation reduces the number and magnitude of potential climate hazards, reducing the most severe changes first. Adaptation increases the ability to cope with climate hazards by reducing system sensitivity or by reducing the consequent level of harm. Secondly, they manage risks at different extremes of the potential range of future climate change. Adaptation works best with changes of lesser magnitude at the lower end of the potential range. Where there is sufficient adaptive capacity, adaptation improves the ability of a system to cope with increasingly larger changes over time. By moving from uncontrolled emissions towards stabilisation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mitigation limits the upper part of the range. Different activities have various blends of adaptive and mitigative capacity. In some cases, high sensitivity and low adaptive capacity may lead to large residual climate risks; in other cases, a large adaptive capacity may mean that residual risks are small or non-existent. Mitigative and adaptive capacity do not share the same scale: adaptive capacity is expressed locally, whereas mitigative capacity is different for each activity and location but needs to be aggregated at the global scale to properly assess its potential benefits in reducing climate hazards. This can be seen as a demand for mitigation, which can be exercised at the local scale through exercising mitigative capacity. Part two of the paper deals with the situation where regional bodies aim to maximise the benefits of managing climate risks by integrating adaptation and mitigation measures at their various scales of operation. In north central Victoria, Australia, adaptation and mitigation are being jointly managed by a greenhouse consortium and a catchment management authority. Several related studies investigating large-scale revegetation are used to show how climate change impacts and sequestration measures affect soil, salt and carbon fluxes in the landscape. These studies show that trade-offs between these interactions will have to be carefully managed to maximise their relative benefits. The paper concludes that when managing climate change risks, there are many instances where adaptation and mitigation can be integrated at the operational level. However, significant gaps between our understanding of the benefits of adaptation and mitigation between local and global scales remain. Some of these may be addressed by matching demands for mitigation (for activities and locations where adaptive capacity will be exceeded) with the ability to supply that demand through localised mitigative capacity by means of globally integrated mechanisms. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change risks; Integration; Mitigation; Risk management; Tradeoffs","adaptation; climate change; emission; greenhouse effect; mitigation; regional planning; revegetation; risk assessment; Australasia; Australia; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447104357

Here we cloned the paralogous CYP1C2, showing that the amino acid sequence is 78% identical to CYP1C1, and examined gene structure and expression of CYP1A, CYP1B1, CYP1C1, and CYP1C2. Xenobiotic response elements were observed upstream of the coding regions in all four genes. Zebrafish adults and embryos were exposed (24 h) to 100 nM 3,3′,4,4′,5-polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB126) or 20 ppm acetone and subsequently held in clean water for 24 h (adults) or 48 h (embryos). All adult organs examined (eye, gill, heart, liver, kidney, brain, gut, and gonads) and embryos showed basal expression of the four genes. CYP1A was most strongly expressed in liver, whereas CYP1B1, CYP1C1, and CYP1C2 were most strongly expressed in heart and eye. CYP1B1 and the CYP1C genes showed an expression pattern similar to one another and to mammalian CYP1B1. In embryos CYP1C1 and CYP1C2 tended to have a higher basal expression than CYP1A and CYP1B1. PCB126 induced CYP1A in all organs, and CYP1B1 and CYP1C1 in all organs except gonads, or gonads and brain, respectively. CYP1C2 induction was significant only in the liver. However, in embryos all four genes were induced strongly by PCB126. The results are consistent with CYP1C1 and CYP1C2, as well as CYP1A and CYP1B1, being regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. While CYP1A may have a protective role against AHR agonists in liver and gut, CYP1B1, CYP1C1, and CYP1C2 may also play endogenous roles in eye and heart and possibly other organs, as well as during development. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Five different compounds of iron oxides were characterized: hematite α-Fe2O3, goethite α-FeOOH, ferrihydrite Fe5HO8·4H2O, magnetite Fe3O4 and wüstite FeO. In the case of iron oxide-hydroxides, goethite and ferrihydrite, the reduction process takes place after accompanying dehydration below 300 °C. Instead of the commonly accepted two-stage reduction of hematite, 3 α-Fe2O3 → 2 Fe3O4 → 6 Fe, three-stage mechanism 3Fe2O3 → 2Fe3O4 → 6FeO → 6Fe is postulated especially when temperature of reduction overlaps 570 °C. Up to this temperature the postulated mechanism may also involve disproportionation reaction, 3Fe2+ ⇌ 2Fe3+ + Fe, occurring at both the atomic scale on two-dimensional interface border Fe3O4/Fe or stoichiometrically equivalent and thermally induced, above 250 °C, phase transformation-wüstite disproportionation to magnetite and metallic iron, 4FeO ⇌ Fe3O4 + Fe. Above 570 °C, the appearance of wüstite phase, as an intermediate of hematite reduction in hydrogen, was experimentally confirmed by ""in situ"" XRD method. In the case of FeO-H2 system, instead of one-step simple reduction FeO → Fe, a much more complex two-step pathway FeO → Fe3O4 → Fe up to 570 °C or even the entire sequence of three-step process FeO → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe up to 880 °C should be reconsidered as a result of the accompanying FeO disproportionation wüstite ⇌ magnetite + iron manifesting its role above 150 °C and occurring independently on the kind of atmosphere-inert argon or reductive hydrogen or carbon monoxide. The disproportionation reaction of FeO does not consume hydrogen and occurs above 200 °C much easier than FeO reduction in hydrogen above 350 °C. The main reason seems to result from different mechanistic pathways of disproportionation and reduction reactions. The disproportionation reaction wustite ⇌ magnetite + iron makes simple wüstite reduction FeO → Fe a much more complicated process. In the case of thermodynamically forced FeO disproportionation, the oxygen sub-lattice, a closely packed cubic network, does not change during wüstite → magnetite transformation, but the formation of metallic iron phase requires temperature activated diffusion of iron atoms into the region of inter-phase FeO/Fe3O4. Depending on TPRH2 conditions (heating rate, velocity and hydrogen concentration), the complete reduction of hematite into metallic iron phase can be accomplished at a relatively low temperature, below 380 °C. Although the reduction behavior is analogical for all examined iron oxides, it is strongly influenced by their size, crystallinity and the conditions of reduction. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The former involves enhanced pre-stage flushing with the addition of microaeration and inoculum in the methane phase. The latter involves leachate cross-recirculation between the mature and fresh waste reactors without conducting a pre-stage operation. The optimized process for combined anaerobic digestion showed that reducing the pre- stage operation with the maximum removal of organics from the waste bed is beneficial. Moreover, the sequential staging concept offers an improved process over the combined anaerobic digestion wherein the specific methane yield of 11.9 and 7.2 L CH4 kg-1 volatile solids (VS) per day was achieved, respectively. After 28 days of operation, the sequential staging process showed an improved waste stabilization with 86 and 79% mass and volume reduction, respectively.

The present study illuminates the information content of coronal emission line measurements that include all four Stokes parameters. The simplest case of localized emission along the line of sight, such as that from a single bright loop, is scrutinized. Knowledge of the ""atomic alignment"" is central to the diagnosis of magnetic fields beyond determining the field's azimuth projected on the plane of the sky. For localized emission, a method to determine the atomic alignment is presented, combining Stokes I, Q, and U observations and statistical equilibrium calculations, related to work by Querfeld. The method yields the sign of the alignment under conditions that might exist 25% of the time, thereby reducing the Van Vleck ambiguity from one of 90° to 180°. Even then, the magnitude of the alignment is sometimes ambiguous. With measurements of Stokes V, unambiguous knowledge of the alignment also yields the vector field B with just an ambiguity of 180° in the plane of the sky. In other, more general cases, neither the sign nor the magnitude of the atomic alignment can be uniquely determined. Suggestions are made as to how these more serious ambiguities might be ameliorated by assuming continuity of magnetic fields underlying the polarization maps, an idea first expressed by House in 1972. Some conclusions are offered concerning the relative merits of formal inversions, diagnosis of magnetic properties from a localized region, tomography using solar rotation, and forward modeling. © 2007, The American Astronomical Society, All rights reserved.","Polarization; Sun: atmosphere; Sun: corona; Sun: magnetic fields",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34347231957

This study exploits the potential of a 'natural experiment' to assess a temporal association between adjusted annual lung cancer death rates and the changing annual mean urban air-pollution concentrations in Dublin from 1981 to 2000. Annual mean 'black smoke' (BS) concentration was used as an indicator variable for the urban air-pollution mixture. Loglinear Poisson regression model (with an offset) was used to estimate adjusted rate ratios of lung cancer death rates between two periods (1981-1990 and 1991-2000) relative to the year 1990. A significant (p<0.0001) two-third decline in BS concentration (28.2 μg/m3) was seen between the two periods [pre-ban (46.4 μg/m3) vs. post-ban (18.2 μg/m3). Relative to 1990 (rate ratio=1), a slightly greater decline (2%) in death rates was achieved in the pre-ban period (1981-1990) when mean annual BS concentrations were very high, but a lower decline (1%) was seen in the post-ban period (1991-2000) corresponding to very low mean annual BS concentrations. In other words, a further fall in adjusted rates in lung cancer was achievable both in the pre-ban and the post-ban periods when simultaneously controlling for BS and smoking. A temporal association thus observed between lung cancer death rates and the changing BS concentrations suggests that control of particulate air-pollution could further reduce lung cancer rates, irrespective of smoking patterns. © Copyright 2004-2005 Irish Medical Journal.",,"air pollution; air pollution control; air pollution indicator; article; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; controlled study; female; human; Ireland; linear regression analysis; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; particulate matter; Poisson distribution; prevalence; smoking; statistical significance; time; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental exposure; health; incidence; Ireland; lung tumor; mortality; risk factor; season; coal; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Coal; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Incidence; Ireland; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Poisson Distribution; Risk Factors; Seasons; Time Factors; Urban Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34147127043

Also, if the Asia–Pacific region fails to adopt such countermeasures, it has been estimated that its emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) will increase to over 50% of total global emissions by 2100. To respond to such a serious and long-term threat, it is critical to establish communication and evaluation tools for policymakers and scientists in the region. The Integrated Assessment Model provides a convenient framework for combining knowledge from a wide range of disciplines, and is one of the most effective tools to increase the interaction among groups. The Asia–Pacific Integrated Model (AIM) is one of the most frequently used models in the Asia–Pacific region (Kainuma et al., 2003; Shukla et al., 2004). The distinctive features of AIM are: (1) it involves Asian country teams from Japan, China, India, Korea, Thailand, and so on; (2) it has detailed description of technologies; and (3) it uses information from a detailed geographic information system to evaluate and present the distribution of impacts at local and global levels. Besides preparing country models for evaluation at the state and national level, we have also developed global models to analyze international economic relationships and climate impacts in order to evaluate policy options from a global viewpoint. © Cambridge University Press 2007, Cambridge University Press, 2010.",,"Aluminum alloys; Climate change; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Climate impacts; Economic burden; Global climate changes; Global emissions; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Integrated assessment models; Integrated modeling; International economics; Climate models",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927008954

The total amplitude of the stress pulse generated due to the transfer of energy, momentum and volume from an incident ion to the target material is found, using a spherical approximation of the thermoelastic peak - the nanometric region where the phonon energy loss of the ion is thermalized. The spatial dependence of the amplitude of the generated pulse adjusted for sound absorption follows a power law rather than an exponential law. Due to such long-range action, the acoustic pulses from the ions of C+, Ar+ and Xe+ bombarding the DLC target can activate migration of defects at depths up to 50 nm and considerably reduce the activation energy of kinetic process at depths up to 300 nm. The dependence of the maximum depth of defect activation on the type of defect and on the energy of the ion was investigated for two typical values of the activation energy.

We compare our results, assuming the ethanol is utilized as E85 (blended with 15% gasoline) in a light-duty vehicle, with extant life cycle assessments of gasoline, corn-ethanol, and energy crop-cellulosic-ethanol fueled vehicles. We also compare MSW-ethanol production, as a waste management alternative, with landfilling with gas recovery options. We find that the life cycle total energy use per vehicle mile traveled for MSW-ethanol is less than that of corn-ethanol and cellulosic-ethanol; and energy use from petroleum sources for MSW-ethanol is lower than for the other fuels. MSW-ethanol use in vehicles reduces net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 65% compared to gasoline, and by 58% when compared to corn-ethanol. Relative GHG performance with respect to cellulosic ethanol depends on whether MSW classification is included or not. Converting MSW to ethanol will result in net fossil energy savings of 397-1830 MJ/MT MSW compared to net fossil energy consumption of 177-577 MJ/MT MSW for landfilling.

Crop simulation models help greatly in this regard. Crop models such as WTGROWS, INFOCROP, ORYZA and DSSAT have been widely used for land use planning, agri-production estimates, impact of climate change and environmental impact analysis. Vulnerable regions under future scenarios of climate change and adaptation strategies (agronomic and input management) have been evolved for many important crops by using simulation techniques. One of the simple empirical techniques for evaluating the impact of future climate change is through historic analysis of the response of crops to inter-seasonal climatic variability. The impact of temperature rise is different for crops grown under variable production environments. Interactions exist for changes in temperature, carbon dioxide concentration, solar radiation and rainfall on growth and yield of crops. Adaptation strategies through the adoption of agronomic management options (such as altered date of sowing, scheduling of water and nutrients) can sustain agricultural productivity under climate change. The rapid changes in land use and land cover have to be included for impact analysis. Linking of the socioeconomic aspects needs to be strengthened.","Climate change; Climatic variability; Crop model; Crop yield; Pests; Soil health",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547260089

For many environmental contaminants, there is a lack of sufficient information about multiple components of the risk assessment framework. In such cases, the use of default assumptions and extrapolations to fill in the data gaps is a common practice. Nanoparticle risks, however, pose a new form of risk assessment challenge. Besides a lack of data, there is deep scientific uncertainty regarding every aspect of the risk assessment framework: (a) particle characteristics that may affect toxicity; (b) their fate and transport through the environment; (c) the routes of exposure and the metrics by which exposure ought to be measured; (d) the mechanisms of translocation to different parts of the body; and (e) the mechanisms of toxicity and disease. In each of these areas, there are multiple and competing models and hypotheses. These are not merely parametric uncertainties but uncertainties about the choice of the causal mechanisms themselves and the proper model variables to be used, i.e., structural uncertainties. While these uncertainties exist for PM2.5 as well, risk assessment for PM2.5 has avoided dealing with these issues because of a plethora of epidemiological studies. However, such studies don't exist for the case of nanoparticles. Even if such studies are done in the future, they will be very specific to a particular type of engineered nanoparticle and not generalizable to other nanoparticles. Therefore, risk assessment for nanoparticles will have to deal with the various uncertainties that were avoided in the case of PM2.5. Consequently, uncertainties in estimating risks due to nanoparticle exposures may be characterized as 'extreme'. This paper proposes a methodology by which risk analysts can cope with such extreme uncertainty. One way to make these problems analytically tractable is to use expert judgment approaches to study the degree of consensus and/or disagreement between experts on different parts of the exposure-response paradigm. This can be done by eliciting judgments from a wide range of experts on different parts of the risk causal chain. We also use examples to illustrate how studying expert consensus/disagreement helps in research prioritization and budget allocation exercises. The expert elicitation can be repeated over the course of several years, over which time, the state of scientific knowledge will also improve and uncertainties may possibly reduce. Results from expert the elicitation exercise can be used by risk managers or managers of funding agencies as a tool for research prioritization. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Deep uncertainty; Degree of expert consensus; Model uncertainty; Nanoparticle health risks; Occupational health; Parametric uncertainty; Probabilistic expert judgment","Environmental impact; Health risks; Impurities; Nanostructured materials; Probabilistic logics; Uncertain systems; Deep uncertainty; Degree of expert consensus; Model uncertainty; Nanoparticle health risks; Occupational health; Parametric uncertainty; Probabilistic expert judgment; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845917622

In this study, we examined the effects of elevated CO2 and nitrogen (N) inputs on plant and soil microbial community characteristics of plant communities invaded by reed canary grass, Phalaris arundinacea L. We grew the invasive grass under two levels of invasion: the invader was either dominant (high invasion) at &gt;90% plant cover or sub-dominant (low invasion) at &lt;50% plant cover. Experimental wetland communities were grown for four months in greenhouses that received either 600 or 365 μl l-1 (ambient) CO2. Within each of three replicate rooms per CO2 treatment, the plant communities were grown under high (30 mg l-1) or low (5 mg l-1) N. In contrast to what is often predicted under N limitation, we found that elevated CO2 increased native graminoid biomass at low N, but not at high N. The aboveground biomass of reed canary grass did not respond to elevated CO2, despite it being a fast-growing C3 species. Although elevated CO2 had no impact on the plant biomass of heavily invaded communities, the relative abundance of several soil microbial indicators increased. In contrast, the moderately invaded plant communities displayed increased total root biomass under elevated CO2, while little impact occurred on the relative abundance of soil microbial indicators. Principal components analysis indicated that overall soil microbial community structure was distinct by CO2 level for the varying N and invasion treatments. This study demonstrates that even when elevated CO2 does not have visible effects on aboveground plant biomass, it can have large impacts belowground. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, such forcing is not necessarily provided near the land-sea boundary because 1) the atmospheric model grid used for forcing is frequently much coarser than the ocean model grid, and 2) some of the atmospheric model grid over the ocean includes land values near coastal regions. This paper presents a creeping sea-fill methodology to reduce the improper representation of scalar atmospheric forcing variables near coastal regions, a problem that compromises the usefulness of the fields for ocean model simulations and other offshore applications. For demonstration, atmospheric forcing variables from archived coarse-resolution gridded products - the 1.125° × 1.125° 15-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-15) and 1.0° × 1.0° Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS) - are used here. A fine-resolution [1/25° × 1/25° cos(lat)], (longitude × latitude) (∼3.2 km) eddy-resolving Black Sea Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) is then forced with/without sea-filled atmospheric variables from these gridded products to simulate monthly mean climatological sea surface temperature (SST). Using only over-ocean values from atmospheric forcing fields in the ocean model simulations significantly reduces the climatological mean SST bias (by ∼1°-3°C) and rms SST difference over the seasonal cycle (by ∼2°-3°C) in coastal regions. Performance of the creeping sea-fill methodology is also directly evaluated using measurements of wind speed at 10 m above the surface from the SeaWinds scatterometer on the NASA Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) satellite. Comparisons of original monthly mean wind speeds from operational ECMWF and NOGAPS products with those from QuikSCAT give basin-averaged rms differences of 1.6 and 1.4 m s-1, respectively, during 2000-03. Similar comparisons performed with sea-filled monthly mean wind speeds result in a much lower rms difference (0.7 m s-1 for both products) during the same time period, clearly confirming the accuracy of the methodology even on interannual time scales. Most of the unrealistically low wind speeds from ECMWF and NOGAPS near coastal boundaries are appropriately corrected with the use of the creeping sea fill. Wind speed errors for ECWMF and NOGAPS (mean bias of ≥ 2.5 m s-1 with respect to QuikSCAT during 2000-03) are substantially eliminated (e.g., almost no bias) near most of the land-sea boundaries. Finally, ocean, atmosphere, and coupled atmospheric-oceanic modelers need to be aware that the creeping sea fill is a promising methodology in significantly reducing the land contamination resulting from an improper land-sea mask existing in gridded coarse-resolution atmospheric products (e.g., ECMWF).",,"Atmospheric temperature; Climatology; Coastal zones; Contamination; Weather forecasting; Wind effects; Atmospheric forcing variables; Creeping sea-fill methodology; Land-sea boundary; Sea surface temperature; Oceanography; atmospheric forcing; land use; scatterometer; sea surface temperature; wind velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249071032

In the past, the waste management sector was dominated by private sector with selective operations in what makes business sense through recycling of saleable products. Materials mostly recycled included paper and hard board, plastics, glass, tinplate and aluminum. The rest of the waste materials estimated at 10.2 million tons of both general and hazardous end up in landfills. This trend is now getting reversed as development agencies such as Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit Gmbh (GTZ), Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), Danish Co-operation for Environment and Development (DANCED) and Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) are identifying opportunities in the sector for sustainable development purposes. Two key areas for investments include capturing methane emissions from landfills for trading in carbon markets and financing both physical and moveable assets to enhance sustainable development. However, the challenges for cost-effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability in the sector prevail in relation to lack of sound knowledge to design and implement integrated programmes that incorporate environment, development and sustainability.

""Surface type 1,"" lying mostly within southern low-albedo terrain, is likely to be composed of basalt. However, there are several competing mineralogical models for ""surface type 2,"" which is found primarily in northern low-albedo terrain. We attempt to identify which models better agree with element concentrations determined through the Gamma Subsystem (GS) of the Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) instrument suite aboard the Mars Odyssey spacecraft. We have binned GS data over threshold regions derived from maps of surface types 1 and 2 and examined the spatial correlation of element concentrations with surface type 2. The elements we have examined are Cl, Fe, H, K, Si, and Th. Our results show that K concentration, Th concentration, and the areal abundance of surface type 2 are strongly correlated, with significant enrichment of both K and Th in regions representative of surface type 2. In addition, Si does not appear to be significantly enriched in surface type 2. These results are more consistent with surface type 2 originating from a compositionally distinct mantle source than the aqueous alteration of basalts.

We examine the importance of land-use history variables, as well as topographic and edaphic variables, on soil C in a range of forest types - native forest, pine plantations, secondary forest and rehabilitated forest - at three contrasting locations in south eastern Australia. Our comparisons include a novel forest conversion of exotic pine plantations to native, broadleaf forest. Using nested ANOVAs, we detected few differences in soil C concentration indices (total C, microbial biomass C, K2SO4-C) and C content among eucalypt-dominated vegetation and pine plantations within each location (0-10 cm depth). However, planned contrasts indicated a 30% decrease in soil C content with conversion of native forest to pine plantation of age 37 years. The reverse land-use change - pine plantation to native, broadleaf forest - was associated with a decrease in soil C concentration and content at one location (40%; age 12-13 years) and no detectable changes at another (to age 7 years). Variable effect between locations of this novel land-use change on soil C could be due to differences in potential productivity, conifer species, and plantation age. We used correlation coefficients and general linear models to identify widely applicable variables for predicting soil C concentration and content at local scales (≤ 20 km2). Within-location relationships with topographic variables were weak and infrequent relative to those with edaphic and land-use history variables. Soil texture was strongly correlated with soil C at each location, although the relative significance of different particle size fractions differed among locations. Electrical conductivity appeared more widely applicable since it was included in C models at two locations. Combining land-use history and edaphic variables produced strong predictive models for soil C concentrations and content at two locations (total r2 0.83 to 0.95). Positive relationships were indicated between soil C and 'age of current vegetation' at one location, and negative relationships were indicated with 'number of land uses' at another. These data highlight a potential predictive role for land-use history variables in local-scale assessments of soil C in forested landscapes. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, successful reverberation mapping has yet to be performed for quasars of either high luminosity (above Lopt ∼ 1046 ergs s-1) or high redshift (z ≳ 0.3). Over the past 6 years, we have carried out, at the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, rest-frame ultraviolet spectrophotometric monitoring of a sample of six quasars at redshifts z = 2.2-3.2, with luminosities of Lopt ∼ 10 46.4-1047.6 ergs s-1, an order of magnitude greater than those of previously mapped quasars. The six quasars, together with an additional five having similar redshift and luminosity properties, were monitored photometrically at the Wise Observatory during the past decade. All 11 quasars monitored show significant continuum variations of order 10%-70%. This is about a factor of 2 smaller variability than for lower luminosity quasars monitored over the same rest-frame period. In the six objects that have been spectrophotometrically monitored, significant variability is detected in the C IV λ1550 broad emission line. In several cases the variations track the continuum variations in the same quasar, with amplitudes comparable to, or even greater than, those of the corresponding continua. In contrast, no significant Lyα variability is detected in any of the four objects in which it was observed. Thus, UV lines may have different variability trends in high-luminosity and low-luminosity AGNs. For one quasar, S5 0836+71 at z = 2.172, we measure a tentative delay of 595 days between C iv and UV continuum variations, corresponding to a rest-frame delay of 188 days and a central black hole mass of 2.6×109M⊙. © 2007.

The present paper synthesizes the new simulations of both the twentieth- and twenty-first-century arctic freshwater budget components for use in the IPCC AR4, and attempts to determine whether demonstrable progress has been achieved since the late 1990s. Precipitation and its difference with evapotranspiration are addressed over the Arctic Ocean and its terrestrial watersheds, including the basins of the four major rivers draining into the Arctic Ocean: the Ob, the Yenisey, the Lena, and the Mackenzie. Compared to the previous [IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR)] generation of AOGCMs, there are some indications that the models as a class have improved in simulations of the Arctic precipitation. In spite of observational uncertainties, the models still appear to oversimulate area-averaged precipitation over the major river basins. The model-mean precipitation biases in the Arctic and sub-Arctic have retained their major geographical patterns, which are at least partly attributable to the insufficiently resolved local orography, as well as to biases in large-scale atmospheric circulation and sea ice distribution. The river discharge into the Arctic Ocean is also slightly oversimulated. The simulated annual cycle of precipitation over the Arctic Ocean is in qualitative agreement between the models as well as with observational and reanalysis data. This is also generally the case for the seasonality of precipitation over the Arctic Ocean's terrestrial watersheds, with a few exceptions. Some agreement is demonstrated by the models in reproducing positive twentieth-century trends of precipitation in the Arctic, as well as positive area-averaged P-E late-twentieth-century trends over the entire terrestrial watershed of the Arctic Ocean. For the twenty-first century, three scenarios are considered: A2, A1B, and B1. Precipitation over the Arctic Ocean and its watersheds increases through the twenty-first century, showing much faster percentage increases than the global mean precipitation. The arctic precipitation changes have a pronounced seasonality, with the strongest relative increase in winter and fall, and the weakest in summer. The river discharge into the Arctic Ocean increases for all scenarios from all major river basins considered, and is generally about twice as large as the increase of freshwater from precipitation over the Arctic Ocean (70°-90°N) itself. The across-model scatter of the precipitation increase for each scenario is significant, but smaller than the scatter between the climates of the different models in the baseline period. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"climate modeling; evapotranspiration; freshwater; general circulation model; hydrometeorology; precipitation (climatology); river discharge; water budget; Arctic Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847361676

The need for expensive after treatment technologies has imposed constraints on Euro-IV Gasoline and Diesel engine development. On the contrary CNG engines have easily met Euro-III norms with Carburetion technology and Euro-IV and beyond norms with Injection technology. CNG has proved to be a clean and environmentally friendly fuel, significantly improving the ambient air quality of cities. The addition of Hydrogen to CNG has potential to even lower the CNG emissions and is considered to be the first step towards promotion of a Hydrogen economy. Worldwide experts have described Hydrogen as the cleanliest fuel for IC Engines [1, 2 and 3]. Hythane is the patented blend of 15% of Hydrogen in CNG by Energy content. HCNG is the blend of Hydrogen and CNG in varying proportions. From the literature [4-5] it has been observed that HCNG reduces NOx emissions by 50%, non-methane hydrocarbons by 58%, and total hydrocarbons by 23% and CO2 by 7% as compared to CNG. This paper presents the results obtained during the optimization of a dedicated CNG Injection 6-Cylinder naturally aspirated engine and optimization strategy for further up gradation to run on HCNG. The original carbureted CNG Euro-III compliant engine was upgraded to meet Euro-IV norms by replacing the carburetion kit with a injection kit. Work is in progress to further upgrade this engine to run on HCNG.

It provides a quantitative/qualitative analysis of vegetation-environment relationships for four summits along an altitude gradient on the Lefka Ori massif Crete (1664-2339 m). The GLORIA multi-summit approach was used to provide vegetation and floristic data together with temperature records for every summit. Species richness and species turnover was calculated together with floristic similarity between the summits. 70 species were recorded, 20 of which were endemic, belonging to 23 different families. Cretan endemics dominate at these high altitudes. Species richness and turnover decreased with altitude. The two highest summits showed greater floristic similarity. Only 20% of the total flora recorded reaches the highest summit while 10% is common among summits. Overall there was a 4.96°C decrease in temperature along the 675 m gradient. Given a scenario of temperature increase the ecotone between the sub-alpine and alpine zone would be likely to have the greatest species turnover. Southern exposures are likely to be invaded first by thermophilous species while northern exposures are likely to be more resistant to changes. Species distribution shifts will also depend on habitat availability. Many, already threatened, local endemic species will be affected first. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Global change; Greece; Islands; Mountains; Species richness; Species turnover","alpine environment; altitude; climate change; ecotone; endemic species; habitat availability; latitudinal gradient; species diversity; species richness; temperature effect; vascular plant; vegetation dynamics; Canea; Crete; Eurasia; Europe; Greece; Southern Europe; White Mountains; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249656958

These buses are now starting to be seen in significant numbers in some city bus fleets. However, whilst some designs have been successful, others have been plagued by battery problems and failure to achieve predicted fuel savings in service. This has sometimes been caused by lack of understanding by both the vehicle designer and battery supplier, who generally have little experience in each other's areas.

We measured aceticlastic and autotrophic methanogenesis, sulfate reduction, denitrification, and iron reduction in a bog, an intermediate fen, and a rich fen in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan for one growing season. In 3-d anaerobic incubations of slurried peat, denitrification and iron reduction were minor components of anaerobic carbon mineralization. Experiments using 14C-labeled methanogenic substrates showed that methanogenesis in these peatlands was primarily through the aceticlastic pathway, except early in the growing season in more ombrotrophic peatlands, where the autotrophic pathway was dominant or codominant. Overall, methane production was responsible for 3-70% of anaerobic carbon mineralization. Sulfate reduction accounted for 0-26% of anaerobic carbon mineralization, suggesting a rapid turnover of a very small sulfate pool. A large percentage of anaerobic carbon mineralization (from 29% to 85%) was unexplained by any measured process, which could have resulted from fermentation or possibly from the use of organic molecules (e.g., humic acids) as alternative electron acceptors. © 2007, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.",,"anoxic conditions; carbon cycle; denitrification; fermentation; iron; methanogenesis; ombrotrophic environment; peatland; sulfate; Michigan; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250813059

Climate change impacts can be reduced by abating CO2 emissions. What would be an economically optimal investment in abating CO2 emissions? Economic models typically suggest that reducing CO2 emissions by roughly ten to twenty percent relative to business-as-usual would be an economically optimal strategy. The currently implemented CO2 abatement of a few percent falls short of this benchmark. Hence, the global community may be procrastinating in implementing an economically optimal strategy. Here we use a simple economic model to estimate the regrets of this procrastination - the economic costs due to the suboptimal strategy choice. The regrets of procrastination can range from billions to trillions of US dollars. The regrets increase with increasing procrastination period and with decreasing limits on global mean temperature increase. Extended procrastination may close the window of opportunity to avoid crossing temperature limits interpreted by some as 'dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system' in the sense of Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Global Climate Change. © IOP Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Climate threshold; Economically efficient climate change strategies","Climate change; Cost benefit analysis; Economics; Optimal systems; Anthropogenic carbon dioxide; Anthropogenic interference; Climate change impact; Climate threshold; Economically efficient climate change strategies; Global climate changes; Global-mean temperature; Optimal investments; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547639531

PRTRs require reporting of emissions from specific industrial sectors and making the information publicly available. This article suggests a framework for comparing PRTRs in order to determine whether they attain their declared goals and which factors, if any, influence their effectiveness. The challenges to such a comparison can be divided into three groups. The first refers to changes that are directly linked to the characteristics of PRTRs: both the changes within a specific system over time and variations among different systems. The second refers to parameters that affect the outcomes of the systems without being directly a part of them. The third involves the relations between the emissions reported to the PRTRs and the associated environmental risk. We suggest an approach that relies on relative comparison, commensurate with the unique characteristics of each PRTR, that compares their actual outcomes. Such an approach is necessary both due to significant variations among current PRTRs as well as for following the unique policy objectives that are manifested in different PRTRs. Application of this comparative approach in the United States, England, Canada, and Australia demonstrates significant differences in PRTR systems across countries and suggests that the mere presence of a PRTR may not lead to reduced industrial emissions. The analysis also demonstrates that emission reductions do not correlate with reductions in risk-related measures. The article proposes several simple modifications to the composition of current PRTR databases that may facilitate more accurate analysis of results and effective oversight of implementation. © 2007 Society for Risk Analysis.","Comparative research; Emissions and risk; Pollutant release and transfer registers (PRTRs); Reported emissions; Toxic release inventory (TRI)","Database systems; Industrial emissions; Industrial research; Risk management; Comparative research; Reported emissions; Toxic release inventory (TRI); Pollution control; comparative study; conceptual framework; database; emission control; industrial emission; pollution monitoring; pollution policy; article; Australia; Canada; data base; environmental impact; field emission; industrial waste; pollutant; register; risk reduction; United Kingdom; United States; Air Pollutants; Australia; Canada; England; Environmental Illness; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Environmental Pollution; Hazardous Substances; Neoplasms; Risk; Risk Assessment; Time Factors; United States; Australasia; Australia; Canada; England; Eurasia; Europe; North America; United Kingdom; United States; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947164335

Thus, we evaluated the variability of N2O emissions measured by microchambers (cross section: 184 cm2) from a groundnut-fallow-maize-fallow cropping system of the humid tropics. The crops received inorganic nitrogen (N) plus crop residues (NC), inorganic N alone as ammonium sulfate (RN), and half of the inorganic N along with crop residues and chicken manure (N1/2CM), amounting for the crop rotation to 322, 180, and 400 kg N ha-1 yr-1, respectively. The N2O fluxes during the groundnut-maize crop rotation were log-normally distributed, and the frequency distributions were positively skewed. Daytime changes in N2O fluxes were inconsistent, and the 50% of total N2O emission during the 12 h measurement periods was attained earlier under maize (∼11:00 h) than groundnut covers (∼13:00 h). Spatial variability in each treatment with eight gas chambers was large but smaller during the cropping periods than the fallow, indicating masking efficiency of crop covers for the soil heterogeneity that was accelerated presumably by antecedent climatic variables. The temporal variability of N2O emissions was also large (coefficients of variation, CV, ranged from 60 to 81%), involving both input differences between treatments and measurement periods. As such, the relative deviation from the annual mean of total N2O emission was high during the period after a large N application with a maximum of +480%, due to addition of chicken manure. The seasonal contribution of summer and monsoon to N 2O emissions was insignificant. However, intensive rainfall negatively (-0.65**) and the amount of added N from either source positively (0.83***) correlated with the integrated N 2O emissions, and those were exponential. Results suggest that around noon (12:00 h) gas collection could represent well the daily N2O fluxes, increasing the number or size of the gas chambers could minimize the large variability, and mainly the rainfall and N inputs regulated its emissions in the humid tropics of Malaysia.

We utilized the fact that the decline of the Arctic fox in Finnmark has been spatially heterogeneous by contrasting ecosystem state variables between regions and landscape areas (within regions) with and without recent Arctic fox breeding. Within the region of Varanger peninsula, which has the highest number of recorded dens and the most recent breeding records of Arctic fox, we found patterns largely consistent with a previously proposed climate-induced, bottom-up trophic cascade that may exclude the Arctic fox from tundra. Landscape areas surrounding dens without recent Arctic breeding were here more productive than areas with recent breeding in terms of biomass of palatable and climate sensitive plants, the number of insectivorous passerines and predatory skuas. Even the frequency of unspecified fox scats was the highest in landscape areas where arctic fox breeding has ceased, consistent with an invasion of the competitively dominant red fox. The comparisons made at the regional level were not consistent with the results within the Varanger region, possibly due to different causal factors or to deficiencies in Arctic fox monitoring at a large spatial scale. Thus long-term studies and adequate monitoring schemes with a large-scale design needs to be initiated to better elucidate the link between climate, food web dynamics and their relations to Arctic and red foxes. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Ultimately, not only should manufacturers of LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs and their importers in the United States meet the new Tier 2 standards, but all exporters outside the United States, such as Korean car makers, must also certify their vehicles by using this standard program. The principal rule for successfully applying this program to all the LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs is the use of the same Tier 2 standards if these vehicles are included in the same weight rating category, irrespective of fuel and engine types being used. This review provides an indepth discussion of key issues and provisions related to Tier 2 vehicles with engine measure strategies for automotive engineers and related academic researchers who are particularly interested in investigating how manufacturers will develop, certify, produce, and market their Tier 2 vehicles. A detailed mechanism for the phase-in of the Tier 2 standards to different vehicle weight categories will be discussed in this review, and the major difference between the US Tier 2 standards during the phase-in years and the EURO ones will be substantially compared.

SKYDM can work with multicomponents in a single model run, as well as with a single compound in a model run and produces 2D meteorological field results due to an integration approach. The present study aims to develop and evaluate a SKYDM at local spatial scales, in the short term. A comparative study is conducted to estimate the effects of model parameters in defining the applicability limits of dispersion models and to examine the integration approach methodology. All simulations are run for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as BTXS (Benzene, Toluene, Xylene, and Styrene) emitted from non-point sources, located at 151 villages in seven divisions, in a northeastern portion of Seoul, Korea, with eight different meteorological data sets during 2002. Modeled toluene concentrations are compared with those observed at ten monitoring sites. The main findings of the present study are as follows: (a) Model uncertainties are obviously caused by limitations of meteorological conditions and emission and topographical information, by removal processes, and by user errors or application skills - the chemical decay term was a comparatively significant parameter in the removal of toxic air pollutants, (b) the integration approach indicated a correlation between observations and the model, and (c) the SKYDM showed potential as a useful tool for assessing the air quality in urban areas. In further work, the SKYDM will be upgraded to an improving model algorithm with fully detailed input information, and evaluated in comparison with other Gaussian dispersion models. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Interpretations of paleoenvironments at the Pliocene locality of Laetoli in northern Tanzania have figured prominently in these discussions, primarily because early hominins recovered from Laetoli are generally inferred to be associated with grassland, savanna or open woodland habitats. As these reconstructions effectively extend the range of habitat preferences inferred for Pliocene hominins, and contrast with interpretations of predominantly woodland and forested ecosystems at other early hominin sites, it is worth reevaluating the paleoecology at Laetoli utilizing a new approach. Isotopic analyses were conducted on the teeth of twenty-one extinct mammalian herbivore species from the Laetolil Beds (∼ 4.3-3.5 Ma) and Upper Ndolanya Beds (∼ 2.7-2.6 Ma) to determine their diet, as well as to investigate aspects of plant physiognomy and climate. Enamel samples were obtained from multiple localities at different stratigraphic levels in order to develop a high-resolution spatio-temporal framework for identifying and characterizing dietary and ecological change and variability within the succession. In general, dietary signals at Laetoli suggest heterogeneous ecosystems with both C3 and C4 dietary plants available that could support grassland, woodland, and forested communities. All large-bodied herbivores analyzed yielded dietary signatures indicating mixed grazing/browsing strategies or exclusive reliance on C3 browse, more consistent with wooded than grassland-savanna biomes. There are no clear isotopic patterns documenting shifting ecology within the Laetolil Beds or between the Laetolil and overlying Upper Ndolanya Beds, although limited data from the U. Ndolanya Beds constrains interpretations. Comparison of the results from Laetoli with isotopic enamel profiles of other African fossil and modern communities reveals significant differences in dietary patterns. Relative to extant taxa in related lineages, carbon isotopic ranges of a number of Laetoli fossil herbivores are anomalous, indicating significantly more generalized intermediate C3/C4 feeding behaviors, perhaps indicative of dietary niches and habitat types with no close modern analogs. Enamel oxygen isotope ranges of fossil taxa from Laetoli are consistently more 18O depleted than modern E. African herbivores, possibly indicating more humid conditions during that interval in the past. These data have important implications for reconstructing dietary trajectories of mammalian herbivore lineages, as well as the evolution of ecosystems in East Africa. Isotopic analyses of similar or related taxa at other hominin fossil sites yield signatures generally consistent with Laetoli, suggesting that mammalian communities in East Africa were sampling ecosystems with similar proportions of browse and grass. Collectively, the isotopic dietary signatures indicate heterogeneous habitats with significant wooded or forested components in the Laetoli area during deposition of the Laetolil and Upper Ndolanya Beds. Early hominin foraging activity in this interval may have included access to forest or woodland biomes within this ecosystem, complicating traditional interpretations linking early human evolutionary innovations with a shift to savanna habitats. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

It discusses the main approaches to and diagnoses of problem estates, including the failure of the welfare state, the absence of enterprise, the failure of housing management, 'housing is not enough' and 'effort fragmentation', and provides an evaluation of the impacts of the main programmes, based mainly on the results of official evaluations. The paper notes the difficulties in making assessments of impacts in this area due to data shortcomings, but concludes that over 20 years of policies and programmes did not resolve the complex problems of these estates, nor reposition council-built estates from the bottom of the residential hierarchy. It suggests the reason for this failure was partly that the macro-economic climate and other government policies were countervailing, but also that policy lacked both clear goals and a good understanding of the problems to be faced. It also notes that housing improvements were often compromised by the failure to deal with wider problems. The paper argues that recent policy shows more promise, and seeks to better integrate mainstream spending programmes with area initiatives, although there is little evidence yet on how this is really working.","England; Housing estates; Neighbourhoods; Regeneration","housing management; housing policy; neighborhood; England; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947136344

Here, we examine whether the diversity of food plants, contemporary climate and energy, or habitat heterogeneity determine species richness patterns of avian frugivores across sub-Saharan Africa. Path models indicate that species richness of Ficus (their fruits being one of the major food resources for frugivores in the tropics) has the strongest direct effect on richness of avian frugivores, whereas the influences of variables related to water-energy and habitat heterogeneity are mainly indirect. The importance of Ficus richness for richness of avian frugivores diminishes with decreasing specialization of birds on fruit eating, but is retained when accounting for spatial autocorrelation. We suggest that a positive relationship between food plant and frugivore species richness could result from niche assembly mechanisms (e.g. coevolutionary adaptations to fruit size, fruit colour or vertical stratification of fruit presentation) or, alternatively, from stochastic speciation-extinction processes. In any case, the close relationship between species richness of Ficus and avian frugivores suggests that figs are keystone resources for animal consumers, even at continental scales. © 2007 The Royal Society.","Africa; Coevolution; Community assembly; Macroecology; Plant-frugivore interactions; Spatial autoregressive model","adaptation; bird; coevolution; extinction; frugivory; habitat structure; macroecology; plant-herbivore interaction; speciation (biology); species diversity; species richness; stochasticity; adaptation; Africa; article; biodiversity; climate; coevolution; ecological niche; ecology; energy; Ficus; frugivore; fruit; habitat; nonhuman; plant; priority journal; spatial autocorrelation analysis; species differentiation; species richness; tropics; animal; biological model; bird; classification; evolution; feeding behavior; Ficus; fruit; geography; histology; physiology; regression analysis; Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Animalia; Aves; Animals; Biodiversity; Birds; Evolution; Feeding Behavior; Ficus; Fruit; Geography; Models, Biological; Regression Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247208705

It explains the links between social and environmental determinants of health in urban settings. Interventions to improve health equity through the environment include actions and policies that deal with proximal risk factors in deprived urban areas, such as safe drinking water supply, reduced air pollution from household cooking and heating as well as from vehicles and industry, reduced traffic injury hazards and noise, improved working environment, and reduced heat stress because of global climate change. The urban environment involves health hazards with an inequitable distribution of exposures and vulnerabilities, but it also involves opportunities for implementing interventions for health equity. The high population density in many poor urban areas means that interventions at a small scale level can assist many people, and existing infrastructure can sometimes be upgraded to meet health demands. Interventions at higher policy levels that will create more sustainable and equitable living conditions and environments include improved city planning and policies that take health aspects into account in every sector. Health equity also implies policies and actions that improve the global living environment, for instance, limiting greenhouse gas emissions. In a global equity perspective, improving the living environment and health of the poor in developing country cities requires actions to be taken in the most affluent urban areas of the world. This includes making financial and technical resources available from high-income countries to be applied in low-income countries for urgent interventions for health equity.

A reduced-form hydrological model for flood prediction and a downscaling approach suitable for integrated assessment modeling are presented. Based on these components, the fraction of world population living in river basins affected by changes in flooding probability in the course of climate change is determined. This is then used as a climate impact response function in order to derive emission corridors limiting the population affected. This approach illustrates the consideration of probabilistic impacts within the framework of the tolerable windows approach. Based on the change in global mean temperature, as calculated by the simple climate models used in integrated assessment, spatially resolved changes in climatic variables are determined using pattern scaling, while natural variability in these variables is considered using twentieth century deviations from the climatology. Driven by the spatially resolved climate change, the hydrological model then aggregates these changes to river basin scale. The hydrological model is subjected to a sensitivity analysis with regard to the water balance, and the uncertainty arising through the different projections of changes in mean climate by differing climate models is considered by presenting results based on different models. The results suggest that up to 20% of world population live in river basins that might inevitably be affected by increased flood events in the course of global warming, depending on the climate model used to estimate the regional distribution of changes in climate. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",,"Catchments; Floods; Hydraulic models; Hydrology; Probability; Climate impact response functions; Flooding probability; Global mean temperature; Hydrological models; Climate change; climate change; climate modeling; environmental assessment; flooding; global warming; probability; river basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847640663

However, there is a risk of nerve root and endplate injury owing to heat generated by laser irradiation during PLDD. We recently performed salvage surgery on a patient with heat injury to the L5 nerve root that developed after PLDD. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: One month before presenting to our hospital, the patient underwent two sessions of PLDD for lumbar vertebral disk herniation at another institution. The patient developed worsening sciatica, as well as bowel and urinary problems after the PLDD. INTERVENTION: We performed salvage surgery after PLDD. The intraoperative findings in the present case included carbon spots in the dura mater of the nerve root and a disc herniation strongly adherent to the nerve roots. These findings indicate that the area adjacent to the nerve roots was damaged by excessive heat during laser irradiation. CONCLUSION: When salvage surgery is performed after a PLDD procedure, disc and nerve root injuries owing to laser heat energy must be considered.

This induced emission of volatiles is considered to be a strategy of plants to effectively defend against herbivores by employing bodyguards. Recent empirical research has revealed that these volatiles can also affect neighboring undamaged plants and cause them to emit volatiles secondarily. Provided that signal emission imposes some cost on plants, the evolutionary advantage to undamaged plants in the emission of such secondary signals is unclear. We hypothesized that plants have evolved to emit a secondary signal to help nearby relatives by promoting the recruitment of natural enemies, whereby they increase inclusive fitness. We constructed a simulation model to evaluate this hypothesis. Our simulations suggest that a secondary signal evolves if the following five conditions are met: the cost of the signal is low; the potential risk of infestation is high; the attractiveness of the signal to natural enemies is highly positively correlated with the local density of the signal chemical; dispersal of offspring is spatially restricted, causing population viscosity, and; sufficient vacant space is available, allowing the population to be elastic. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Altruism; Eavesdropping; Elasticity; HIPV; Kin selection; SOS signal; Talking plants; Viscous population","altruism; arthropod; elasticity; evolution; fitness; herbivory; kin selection; natural enemy; plant defense; signal; simulation; volatile substance; Arthropoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248223244

It is the source crater of the Ivory Coast tektites. The structure was excavated in 2.1-2.2 Gyr old metasediments and metavolcanics of the Birimian Supergroup. A drilling project was conceived that would combine two major scientific interests in this crater: 1) to obtain a complete paleoenvironmental record from the time of crater formation about one million years ago, at a near-equatorial location in Africa for which very few data are available so far, and 2) to obtain a complete record of impactites at the central uplift and in the crater moat, for ground truthing and comparison with other structures. Within the framework of an international and multidisciplinary drilling project led by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP), 16 drill cores were obtained from June to October 2004 at six locations within Lake Bosumtwi, which is 8.5 km in diameter. The 14 sediment cores are currently being investigated for paleoenvironmental indicators. The two impactite cores LB-07A and LB-08A were drilled into the deepest section of the annular moat (540 m) and the flank of the central uplift (450 m), respectively. They are the main subject of this special issue of Meteoritics & Planetary Science, which represents the first detailed presentations of results from the deep drilling into the Bosumtwi impactite sequence. Drilling progressed in both cases through the impact breccia layer into fractured bedrock. LB-07A comprises lithic (in the uppermost part) and suevitic impact breccias with appreciable amounts of impact melt fragments. The lithic clast content is dominated by graywacke, besides various metapelites, quartzite, and a carbonate target component. Shock deformation in the form of quartz grains with planar microdeformations is abundant. First chemical results indicate a number of suevite samples that are strongly enriched in siderophile elements and Mg, but the presence of a definite meteoritic component in these samples cannot be confirmed due to high indigenous values. Core LB-08A comprises suevitic breccia in the uppermost part, followed with depth by a thick sequence of graywacke-dominated metasediment with suevite and a few granitoid dike intercalations. It is assumed that the metasediment package represents bedrock intersected in the flank of the central uplift. Both 7A and 8A suevite intersections differ from suevites outside of the northern crater rim. Deep drilling results confirmed the gross structure of the crater as imaged by the pre-drilling seismic surveys. Borehole geophysical studies conducted in the two boreholes confirmed the low seismic velocities for the post-impact sediments (less than 1800 m/s) and the impactites (2600-3300 m/s). The impactites exhibit very high porosities (up to 30 vol%), which has important implications for mechanical rock stability. The statistical analysis of the velocities and densities reveals a seismically transparent impactite sequence (free of prominent internal reflections). Petrophysical core analyses provide no support for the presence of a homogeneous magnetic unit (= melt breccia) within the center of the structure. Borehole vector magnetic data point to a patchy distribution of highly magnetic rocks within the impactite sequence.

The three sites were at waterworks in Hämeenlinna, Jyväskylä and Tuusula, sites A, B and C, respectively. Site A used groundwater recharge by both basin and sprinkling infiltration, site B used only sprinkling infiltration, and site C used only basin infiltration. Reductions of total organic carbon at sites A, B and C were 91%, 84% and 74%, respectively, in the winter, and 88%, 77% and 73%, respectively, in the summer. The Finnish national recommended value of 2 mg/l for TOC was achieved at all sites and the TOC of natural groundwater at site C was much lower, at 0.6 mg/l. Large molecular fractions of NOM were removed more efficiently than the smaller ones. Total amount of DAPI-stained cells decreased during infiltration at sites A, B and C in winter by 94%, 94% and 75% and in summer by 96%, 97% and 94%, respectively. Bacterial communities in raw waters and extracted groundwaters were diverse with changes occurring during infiltration, which was shown by DNA extraction followed by PCR of 16S rRNA genes and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting. While the natural groundwater microbial community was diverse, it was different from that of the extracted groundwater in the AGR area. Simultaneous organic carbon removal and the decrease of bacterial counts during infiltration indicated biodegradation. In addition, the changing DGGE profiles during the process of infiltration, demonstrated that changing environmental conditions were reflected by changes in bacterial community composition. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Climate change is not just an environmental issue - it is an energy issue and an economic development issue. Global in extent, it is characterized by its century scale as well as substantial uncertainties in science (highlighted in earlier chapters of this book) and economics. This section examines a number of important issues in climate policy. While not comprehensive, the chapters tackle many of the critical factors that are likely to drive climate policies. In Chapter 25, Billy Pizer addresses the fundamental question of how climate policy should change given real uncertainty about climate impacts and in fact, most dimensions of the climate problem. Does the presence of uncertainty imply different policy prescriptions than if uncertainty were absent or modest? In Chapter 26, Mikiko Kainuma and colleagues present a suite of disaggregated models, collectively known as the Asia-Pacific Integrated Model, used to formulate climate policy in the Asian region, particularly Japan. The chapter demonstrates the usefulness of the model in looking at specific policies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. In Chapter 27, W. David Montgomery and Anne Smith take a closer look at policies to induce innovation in technologies for abating carbon or otherwise reducing emission of greenhouse gases. The authors argue that imposing a cost on emitting carbon is, by itself, ineffective at catalyzing fundamental technological advances. © Cambridge University Press 2007, Cambridge University Press, 2010.",,"Climate models; Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Asia-pacific integrated models; Climate research; Critical factors; Economic development; Environmental issues; Government investment; Reducing emissions; Technological advances; Climate change",Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926974762

For snow on land in non-forested areas, the original linear temperature-dependent snow albedo is suggested to be replaced with a polynomial temperature-dependent scheme. For sea ice albedo none of the evaluated schemes manage to simulate the annual cycle successfully. A suggestion of a new sea ice albedo including the effects of melt ponds, snow on the sea ice and the surface temperature is presented. Simulations with original and new snow and sea ice albedo are performed in the regional atmospheric model HIRHAM and the results are compared. Compared with ERA40 the control simulation with original surface albedo reveals a warm bias during spring in the Arctic. Changing the surface albedo, the biggest differences are found in the same period. Model simulations with old and new surface albedo in HIRHAM clearly reveal that the new albedo scheme is superior to the currently implemented scheme in reproducing the ERA40 temperature climatology. In these experiments the new snow albedo scheme has less impact than the new sea ice albedo. This is probably because areas with changed snow albedo have smaller extent than areas with sea ice in the model setup and are more constraint by the lateral boundaries.

Today's agricultural technologies may be increasing productivity to meet world food demand, but they may also be threatening agricultural ecosystems. For the global environment, agricultural systems provide both sources and sinks of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). This paper addresses the importance of soil organic carbon (SOC) for agro-ecosystems and GHG uptake and emission in agriculture, especially SOC changes associated with soil management. Soil management strategies have great potential to contribute to carbon sequestration, since the carbon sink capacity of the world's agricultural and degraded soil is 50-66% of the historic carbon loss of 42-72 Pg (1 Pg=1015 g), although the actual carbon storage in cultivated soil may be smaller if climate changes lead to increasing mineralization. The importance of SOC in agricultural soil is, however, not controversial, as SOC helps to sustain soil fertility and conserve soil and water quality, and organic carbon compounds play a variety of roles in the nutrient, water, and biological cycles. No-tillage practices, cover crop management, and manure application are recommended to enhance SOC storage and to contribute to sustainable food production, which also improves soil quality. SOC sequestration could be increased at the expense of increasing the amount of non-CO2 GHG emissions; however, soil testing, synchronized fertilization techniques, and optimum water control for flooding paddy fields, among other things, can reduce these emissions. Since increasing SOC may also be able to mitigate some local environmental problems, it will be necessary to have integrated soil management practices that are compatible with increasing SOM management and controlling soil residual nutrients. Cover crops would be a critical tool for sustainable soil management because they can scavenge soil residual nitrogen and their ecological functions can be utilized to establish an optimal nitrogen cycle. In addition to developing soil management strategies for sustainable agro-ecosystems, some political and social approaches will be needed, based on a common understanding that soil and agro-ecosystems are essential for a sustainable society. © Integrated Research System for Sustainability Science and Springer 2007.","Cover crop; Greenhouse gas emission; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil management; Sustainable agriculture",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047172614

Steady-state product selectivities over these oxides are not determined by their initial (fresh) composition but a new catalyst composition created under the reaction conditions. At similar degrees of propane conversion, this steady-state composition depends on the oxidizing agent (O2 or N2O). For an oxygen (C3H8/O2 = 2) containing mixture (X(C3H8) &lt; 5%, X(O2) &lt; 10%), vanadium species are stabilized in penta- and tetravalent oxidation states, with the former being the main one. In the presence of N2O, the oxidation state of vanadium is lower under controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion (X(C3H8) &lt; 5%, X(N2O) &lt; 10%). It is suggested that the difference in the oxidation state of vanadium with O2 and N2O is related to the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species as compared to O2. Moreover, individual vanadium oxides poorly performing with O2 become selective in the ODP reaction using N2O. This improving effect of N2O on the catalytic performance of vanadium oxides is related to the degree of catalyst reduction under reaction conditions and to the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Drought-related disasters could be mitigated by warnings if skillful summer rainfall predictions were possible with sufficient lead time. This study examines the predictive potential for June-September rainfall in Ethiopia using mainly statistical approaches. The skill of a dynamical approach to predicting the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which impacts Ethiopian rainfall, is assessed. The study attempts to identify global and more regional processes affecting the large-scale summer climate patterns that govern rainfall anomalies. Multivariate statistical techniques are applied to diagnose and predict seasonal rainfall patterns using historical monthly mean global sea surface temperatures and other physically relevant predictor data. Monthly rainfall data come from a newly assembled dense network of stations from the National Meteorological Agency of Ethiopia. Results show that Ethiopia's June-September rainy season is governed primarily by ENSO, and secondarily reinforced by more local climate indicators near Africa and the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Rainfall anomaly patterns can be predicted with some skill within a short lead time of the summer season, based on emerging ENSO developments. The ENSO predictability barrier in the Northern Hemisphere spring poses a major challenge to providing seasonal rainfall forecasts two or more months in advance. Prospects for future breakthroughs in ENSO prediction are thus critical to future improvements to Ethiopia's summer rainfall prediction. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climate change; Drought; Meteorology; Rain; Statistical methods; Climate indicators; El Niño-Southern oscillation; Sea surface temperatures; Weather forecasting; climate prediction; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; rainfall; sea surface temperature; statistical analysis; Africa; East Africa; Ethiopia; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847388090

Fitting the energy spectrum of the BL Lac object Mrk 501, we obtain tight constraints on the beam properties. Launching a sufficiently energetic beam requires rather strong magnetic fields close to the black hole (∼ 100-1000 G). However, the model fits imply that the magnetic field in the emission region is only ∼0.02 G. Thus, the particles are accelerated close to the black hole and propagate a considerable distance before instabilities trigger the dissipation of energy through synchrotron and self-Compton emission. We discuss various approaches to generate enough power to drive the jet and, at the same time, to accelerate particles to ∼20 TeV energies. Although the parallel beam model has its own problems, it explains some of the long-standing problems that plague models based on Fermi-type particle acceleration, such as the presence of a very high minimum Lorentz factor of accelerated particles. We conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of the model for the difference between the processes of jet formation in BL Lac-type objects and those in quasars. © 2007.

The purpose of this paper is to review the more than 35 research posters presented at the conference, including exposure, toxicological, and epidemiological studies of air pollution. Collectively, these papers support previous evidence that both short- and long-term exposures to particulate air pollution have adverse population health impacts, including effects on children. Cellular studies also suggest that air pollution can cause mutagenic and oxidative effects, raising concerns about carcinogenicity and cellular regeneration. Studies of biomarkers, such as Clara-cell proteins and lymphocyte damage assessment, provide further evidence of air pollution effects at the cellular level. Other studies have focused on improvements to measurement and sources of air pollution. These studies suggest that particle mass rather than particle composition may be a more useful indicator of potential human health risk. It is well known that emissions from transportation sources are a major contributor to ambient air pollution in large urban centres. Epidemiologic researchers are able to reduce bias due to misclassification and improve exposure assessment models by allocating air pollution exposure according to distance from traffic sources or land-use patterns. The close association between traffic patterns and air pollution concentrations provides a potential basis for the development of transport policies and regulations with population health improvements as a primary objective. The results of the research presented here present opportunities and challenges for the development of policies for improvements to air quality and human health. However, there remains the challenge of how best to achieve these reductions.

Approaches currently used can be broken into two classes: those using categorical, primarily qualitative shape characters (such as round base) and those describing shape as ratios or other abstract mathematical descriptors (such as perimeter-to-area ratio). Both classes of approach have limitations and are hard to compare to one another. We show how eigenshape analysis provides both interpretable characters and measures of continuous variation, thus potentially overcoming the limitations of both current approaches. We applied eigenshape analysis to a sample of 394 nonlobed leaves from extant assemblages to empirically identify independent leaf shape characters. This resulted in the identification of 20 shape characters. Of these, 13 reflected variation due to broad-scale asymmetry as well as asymmetry localized to the tip, base, and lamina-petiole junction. The remaining seven characters, in order of variance explained, corresponded roughly to base shape, tip angle, location of widest portion of the leaf (ovate to obovate variation), extent of widest portion of the leaf (elliptic to oblong variation), tip shape (blunt to drip tip), ovate to obovate variation localized to the middle of the leaf, and extension of the lamina along the petiole at the lamina-petiole junction. All 7 of these characters and only 1 of the 13 asymmetry characters had an association with climate. These characters corresponded to five of the seven broad categories of Wolfe's Climate-Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program shape descriptors, excluding only tooth shape and lobing.

More importantly, fuel economy data for pre- and post-consent decree engines are compared. The objective of this study was to determine the changes in brake-specific emissions of NOx as a result of emission regulations, and to highlight the effect these have had on brake-specific CO2 emission; hence, fuel consumption. For this study, in-use, on-road emission measurements were collected. Test vehicles were instrumented with a portable on-board tailpipe emissions measurement system, WVU's Mobile Emissions Measurement System, and were tested on specific routes, which included a mix of highway and city driving patterns, in order to collect engine operating conditions, vehicle speed, and in-use emission rates of CO2 and NOx. Comparison of on-road in-use emissions data suggests NOx reductions as high as 80% and 45% compared to the US Federal Test Procedure and Not-to-Exceed standards for model year 1995-2002. However, the results indicate that the fuel consumption; hence, CO2 emissions increased by approximately 10% over the same period, when the engines were operating in the Not-to-Exceed region. © 2006.","CO2 emissions; Diesel emissions; Fuel economy; NOx emissions","Brakes; Carbon dioxide; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Fuel economy; CO2 emissions; Diesel emissions; In-use emission rates; NO2 emissions; Not-to-Exceed standards; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; fuel; nitric oxide; carbon dioxide; data set; diesel engine; emission; fuel consumption; measurement method; nitrous oxide; air pollution; air pollution control; article; comparative study; diesel engine; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845438009

The Proterozoic Molar-tooth (MT) carbonate rocks refer to those Meso-to Neoproterozoic (1600-650 Ma) carbonates with MT structure, i.e., a series of peculiar, ptygmatically folded and spar-filled cracks in fine-grained carbonates of Precambrian age, located in the environment of mid-to inner ramp and shallow platform. MTS, like a bridge connecting the inorganic world with the organic one, are closely related to the evolution of paleo-oceans, atmosphere and biosphere. Their development and/or recession are/is related to the origin of life and the abruption of sedimentary geochemistry events of marine carbonates. By using modern instruments and testing methods adequately, the contents of oxides in sandstones were measured and the REE distribution pattern curves were established; an accurate value of isotopic ratio of 87Sr/86Sr was obtained, that is, the age of MT formation is about 750-900 Ma; C and O isotopes of some fresh micrite limestone samples were analyzed; the energy spectrum analysis revealed that the MT consists mainly of microspar calcite, while as for its chemical composition, the matrix shows outstanding peaks of Ca, Mg, Al, Si, and K. The geochemical indicators proved that Neoproterozoic MT carbonates in the Jilin-Liaoning region were developed at the margin of a stable continent, in the torrid zone where the paleo-temperature was about 50°C, the seawater had normal salinity when MT was formed during the Wanlong period in southern Jilin and during the Yingchengzi and Xingmincun periods in eastern Liaoning. The sedimentary environment was located in the inner ramp. In summary, it is of great importance to understand the origin of MT, ascertain the paleo-climate and paleo-environment characteristics, constrain the age and the stratigraphic division and comparison of the Proterozoic so as to study the geochemical characteristics of MT carbonates and their formation environment. © Science Press 2007.","Geochemistry; Jilin-Liaoning region; Microsparite carbonate; Molar tooth; Neoproterozoic","Carbonate minerals; Mineralogy; Sedimentology; Stratigraphy; Chemical composition; Sedimentary geochemistry; Geochemistry; carbonate rock; isotopic composition; Proterozoic; sediment chemistry; tooth; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Jilin; Liaoning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250706378

Application of CO2 pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopy affects superoxide anion release, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear and the data reported are conflicting. We investigated the direct and pH-mediated impact of CO2 and air on macrophage superoxide anion production. Methods: Cells of the NR 8383 rat macrophage cell line were incubated for 2 hours in 5% CO2, 100% CO2, and room air or pH 7.4, pH 6.5, and pH 5.5. The extracellular pH was monitored during incubation. At 0, 2, and 6 hours after incubation, the release of superoxide anions was determined fluorometrically. The mitochondrial activity was determined via the conversion of MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] during and after incubation. Results: Extracellular pH decreased to 6.4 during incubation in a CO2 atmosphere. The release of superoxide anions was significantly reduced immediately after CO2 incubation. It was restored at all other time-points. Decreasing the extracellular pH to 6.5 had no effect on superoxide anion release, whereas acidification of the extracellular milieu to pH 5.5 significantly suppressed subsequent superoxide release. Mitochondrial activity was significantly decreased by CO2 up to 2 hours and by acidic milieu up to 6 hours. Incubation in room air had no effect. Conclusions: Incubation in CO2 can directly suppress macrophage superoxide anion production. This effect is of short duration, fully reversible, and not correlated to changes in extracellular pH or mitochondrial activity. Air contamination does not affect macrophage superoxide anion release. We speculate that CO2 pneumoperitoneum could attenuate the intraoperative free radical production by directly inhibiting superoxide anion release of macrophages without long-lasting suppression of macrophages and their capacity to release superoxide anions postoperatively. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The thawing of soils during winter-summer transitions induces the release of decomposable organic carbon and acceleration of soil respiration. The winter-spring fluxes of CO2 from permanently and seasonally frozen soils are essential part of annual carbon budget varying from 5 to 50%. The mechanisms of the freeze-thaw activation are not absolutely clear and need clarifying. We investigated the effect of repeated freezing-thawing events on CO2 emission from intact arable and forest soils (Luvisols, loamy silt; Central Germany) at different moisture (65% and 100% of WHC). Results: Due to the measurement of the CO2 flux in two hours intervals, the dynamics of CO2 emission during freezing-thawing events was described in a detailed way. At +10°C (initial level) in soils investigated, carbon dioxide emission varied between 7.4 to 43.8 mg C m-2h-1 depending on land use and moisture. CO2 flux from the totally frozen soil never reached zero and amounted to 5 to 20% of the initial level, indicating that microbial community was still active at -5°C. Significant burst of CO2 emission (1.2-1.7-fold increase depending on moisture and land use) was observed during thawing. There was close linear correlation between CO2 emission and soil temperature (R2 = 0.86-0.97, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Our investigations showed that soil moisture and land use governed the initial rate of soil respiration, duration of freezing and thawing of soil, pattern of CO2 dynamics and extra CO2 fluxes. As a rule, the emissions of CO2 induced by freezing-thawing were more significant in dry soils and during the first freezing-thawing cycle (FTC). The acceleration of CO2 emission was caused by different processes: the liberation of nutrients upon the soil freezing, biological activity occurring in unfrozen water films, and respiration of cold-adapted microflora. © 2007 Kurganova et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248598527

A basic approach to the problem is proposed synthesizing present-day solid-state physics and classical electrodynamics of nonhomogeneous mediums.[1] The developed theoretical model predicts the property of CNTs to be a strong slowing-down system for surface waves[1,2] and allows proposing the physical schemes of the carbon nanotube use as monomolecular optoelectronic devices, such as a surface wave waveguide in IR frequency range, a monomolecular optical nanoantenna, a nanoantenna excitation device based on the Purcell effect, etc. A particular emphasis is given to the stimulated emission of electromagnetic waves by electron beam in nanotube. The significant retardation of the surface wave along with the ballistic character of the electron motion in nanotubes are shown[3] to be underlying the idea of the monomolecular light emitter with the Cherenkov lasing mechanism: the electrons in nanotube imposed to a realistic voltage can be accelerated to the velocities synchronous with the phase velocity of the surface wave. Since the achievable current density in nanotubes exceeds drastically corresponding characteristic values in vacuum electronic devices, the stimulated emission in CNTs is started at a very small, of the order of several microns, length of electron-photon interaction. A dispersion equation for the electron beam instability in a nanotube is presented and analyzed. The potential of carbon nanotube as traveling wave tube (TWT) and backward wave oscillator (BWO) is demonstrated.","Carbon nanotube; Free electron laser; Monomolecular light emitter; Nanoelectromagnetics",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250336362

The US currently has no RPS requirement although some state RPS regulations have been adopted but not uniformly enforced (see http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/analysispaper/rps/index.html for a recent summary on RPSs in the US). The renewable portfolio standard (RPS) requires that 20 percent of the power sold must come from qualifying renewable facilities. The analysis of the 20 percent RPS was developed by using the December 2001 version of the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the assumptions and results of the Annual Energy Outlook 2002 (AEO2002) reference case.22The outlook for natural gas wellhead prices has changed considerably in the Annual Energy Outlook 2006 (AEO2006) (Energy Information Administration, 2006). Natural gas prices in the AEO2004 are projected to remain well above $ 4.00 per mcf throughout the forecast, reaching $5.20 per mcf by 2025 in 2002 dollars. While higher natural gas prices are projected to make wind systems somewhat more attractive, the main impact of higher natural gas prices is to increase coal-fired capacity additions in the projection period. While the numerical results in the renewable portfolio analysis presented in this paper are expected to be somewhat different if AEO2006 are used, the trends and general conclusions are unlikely to be affected by the choice of baseline. A policy that requires a 20 percent non-hydro-electric RPS by 2020 appears to be effective in promoting the adoption of renewable generation technologies while also reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides by 6 percent, mercury by 4 percent and carbon dioxide by about 16.5 percent relative to the reference case in 2020. Electricity prices are expected to rise about 3 percent while the cost to the electric power industry could rise between 35 and 60 billion dollars (in year 2000 dollars in net present value terms). © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The cold-climate carbonate precipitates were classified into three broad categories: powders, crusts and speleothem. The carbonate powders include those that precipitated in relation to aufeis aggradation (cryogenic aufeis calcite) and in relation to the growth of various annual/perennial ice formations in freezing caves (cryptocrystalline calcite and calcite pearls). The carbonate crusts can be further subdivided based on their lithic environment; those that precipitated on the upper surface of bedrock/clasts (i.e. subglacially precipitated calcite and evaporative calcite crusts); those that are located on the underside of clasts (i.e. pedogenic carbonates); and those that precipitated in rock outcrop fissures (i.e. endostromatolites). The cold-climate carbonate precipitates have a highly variable isotopic composition with δ18O values ranging between -6.5‰ and 28‰ VSMOW and δ13C values in the -10-20‰ VPDB range. However, each type of carbonate precipitates has a specific δ13C and δ18O range, suggesting that their environmental setting and the mechanism by which they formed controls their 13C and 18O signature. It was found that carbonate deposits that precipitated under equilibrium physico-chemical conditions had a δ13C value that is in equilibrium with that of the parent water, while its δ18O composition was more variable, as it is in part controlled by the temperature of reaction and by the δ18O and calcite saturation state of the parent water. By contrast, the δ18O composition of biologically precipitated carbonate deposits (endostromatolites) reflect that of the parent water, while its δ13C composition was enriched over that of the parent water due to bacterial methanogenesis. In the case of kinetically precipitated carbonate deposits, the δ18O and δ13C values are out-of-equilibrium relative to that of the parent water due to the faster rate of reaction. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A viable solution lies in a paradigm shift of not taking soils for granted. Soils must be improved, restored and used, rather than depleted, degraded and abused. Basic principles of soil management are: (i) creating a positive nutrient balance in agro-ecosystems, (ii) using crop residue, manure and other bio-solids as components of integrated nutrient management of enhancing nutrient-use efficiency, (iii) improving water-use efficiency, and (iv) reducing or eliminating plowing. Adoption of these measures requires a radical shift in the scientific, social, ethnic and cultural fabric of a society through developing alternatives to: (i) using dung as cooking fuel, (ii) crop residue as fodder, (iii) top soil for brick making, (iv) plowing for weed control, and (v) flood irrigation for improving soil-water regime. These practices, used for thousands of years, may have been sustainable when population was low. With large and increasing population, these extractive practices degrade natural resources, pollute the environment and change the climate. Establishing bio-fuel plantations on the village common land and degraded soils, using forage-based crop rotations, making bricks from fly ash and other by-products, adopting no-till farming and using drip or sub-irrigation are high priorities that require serious and immediate attention of policy makers, land managers, farmers and the public at large. While improving agronomic production and advancing food security, soil applications of dung, crop residue and other bio-solids have strong regional and global impacts on the carbon cycle, hydrologic balance, climate and drought, ecosystem restoration and quality of surface and ground waters. © 2007 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Earlier studies have identified high profile shape sensitivity of retrieved TOZ in polar latitudes, in particular at high solar zenith angles (SZA). This paper is devoted to the question of how TOZ retrievals are influenced by the choice of ozone and temperature profiles from various currently available climatologies. Ozone and temperature profiles from those climatologies are applied in the Weighting Function Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (WFDOAS) algorithm to retrieve TOZ from GOME spectral measurements. Comparison of the retrieved TOZ with ground based measurements from selected stations in the polar, middle-, and low-latitude regions indicate both systematic error and random errors associated with the profile shapes. Those errors become prominent at SZA more than 70°. The systematic error might be caused by the differences in the ozone number density peak altitude between the climatological profile and the actual profile. Biases in true temperature with respect to the climatological temperature profile contribute to the TOZ error by their impact on the ozone absorption coefficient and molecular scattering. Our studies based on GOME spectral measurements and synthetic radiance show that at high SZA, more than 10% systematic error in the retrieved TOZ can be easily introduced by the choice of climatological profiles. The random error is of the same order of magnitude, and it can be related to day-to-day variability of ozone and temperature profiles. In this paper we show that an improved and updated ozone and temperature climatological profiles can reduce the systematic errors in the retrieved TOZ from satellite spectral measurements.

The ""north patch,"" established within the Subantarctic Zone (∼56°S), was characterized by high nitrate (∼21 mmol m-3) but low silicic acid (2 mmol m-3) concentrations. North patch iron enrichment increased chlorophyll (Chl) by 12-fold to 2.1 mg m-3 and primary productivity (PPEU) by 8-fold to 188 mmol C m-2 d-1. Surprisingly, despite low silicic acid concentrations, diagnostic pigment and size-fraction composition changes indicated an assemblage shift from prymnesiophytes toward diatoms. The ""south patch,"" poleward of the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (SBACC) (∼66°S), had high concentrations of nitrate (∼27 mmol m-3) and silicic acid (64 mmol m-3). South patch iron enrichment increased Chl by 9-fold to 3.8 mg m-3 and PPEU 5-fold to 161 mmol C m-2 d-1 but, notably, did not alter the phytoplankton assemblage from the initial composition of ∼50% diatoms. South patch iron addition also reduced total particulate organic carbon:Chl from ∼300 to 100; enhanced the presence of novel non-photosynthetic, but fluorescent, compounds; and counteracted a decrease in photosynthetic performance as photoperiod decreased. These experiments show unambiguously that in the contemporary, high nitrate Southern Ocean increasing iron supply increases primary productivity, confirming the initial premise of the Martin Iron Hypothesis. However, despite a 5-fold increase in PPEU under iron-replete conditions in late summer, the effect of iron on annual productivity in the Southern Ocean poleward of the SBACC is limited by seasonal ice coverage and the dark of polar winter. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the necessity for the establishment of such measures appears to be justified by bad air quality records over large European cities, individual short-term action plans (STAPs) have been blindly elaborated by regional authorities. Moreover, as they impose industrial and road traffic emission restrictions, these measures have an elevated economical cost. It is consequently crucial to determine their efficiency and potential for ozone peak reduction. The study presented in this paper aims to draw up an expertise on standard European STAPs, through the example of a French Mediterranean city. The objective is to determine and investigate the impact of current STAPs on ozone peak formation and to test ways to optimise their efficiency. In this frame, a set of emission scenarios has been elaborated and tested with the chemistry-transport model CHIMERE on the Berre-Marseille area. Simulations have shown that the tested action plans are not sufficient to eradicate severe ozone peaks and that more drastic restrictions on emissions are required to significantly affect ozone plumes. However, results also showed that the potential for ozone reduction remains small, with a maximum impact of only 5 ppbv for feasible STAPs. Finally, a temporal analysis of the ozone-emission relationship was engaged in order to optimise their application. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.","2010 NEC directive; Emission scenarios; ESCOMPTE; Ozone production; Short-term action plans","air quality; anthropogenic source; industrial emission; measurement method; ozone; pollution control; traffic emission; air pollution control; air quality; article; chemical industry; environmental planning; forecasting; industrial area; ozone layer; photochemistry; plume; Bouches-du-Rhone; Eurasia; Europe; France; Marseilles; Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249288321

To determine the effect of the contaminant, adults and embryos at different stages of development were exposed to a sublethal concentration of WSF for 7 days. After exposure, microsomal palmitoyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) showed a two-fold increase in adult midgut gland. Embryo's ACS activity was also affected, the increment being correlated with the developing stage. Endoplasmic reticulum acylglycerol synthesis was also increased by WSF exposure in adults and stage 5 embryos, but not at earlier stages of development. Triacylglycerol synthesis was particularly increased (18.5%) in adult midgut gland. The microsomal membrane properties were studied by fluorescent steady-state anisotropy, using the rotational behavior of the fluorescent probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH). Microsomes from midgut gland of WSF-exposed prawn showed no differences in fluidity. Nevertheless, microsomes incubated with WSF in vitro increased their fluidity in a temperature- and WSF concentration-dependent fashion. Both, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons individually tested elicited an increase in membrane fluidity at 10 mg/l, but at 4 mg/l only nC10-C16 aliphatics did. In vivo results indicate that WSF increased the activity of microsomal enzymes that are critical in lipid metabolism, though this change was not due to direct alterations in membrane fluidity, suggesting a synthesis induction, or an enzyme-regulatory mechanism. Nevertheless, hydrocarbons elicited membrane fluidity alterations in in vitro experiments at concentrations that could be found in the environment after an oil spill. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This procedure includes the briquetting of the carbon material, subsequent activation and finally an equilibrium adsorption impregnation of the active phase. A local low-rank coal was used for the preparation of the carbon briquettes, while both a model vanadium compound (V2O5) and the ashes of a petroleum coke (PCA) were used as the precursors of the active phase. The catalytic briquettes have been tested for NO reduction. The effect of a HNO3-oxidation previous to the impregnation has been also evaluated. The reduction tests have been carried out in presence of oxygen and with the addition of ammonia as reducing agent. The briquettes have shown to be active for NO reduction at low temperature (100-300 °C). Surface chemistry as well as the porous structure of the support, affect the catalyst behaviour. In general terms, higher NO reduction efficiencies were measured for the catalysts prepared using the pre-oxidised briquettes. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the research was to develop a method for measuring the sediment elemental composition, including minor elements, which could be implemented in-situ. The plasma was generated by a double-pulse, Q-Switched Nd:YAG laser operated at 1064 nm. For signal detection, both ICCD and non-gated, compact detectors were used. The major difficulties in underwater sediment analyses are related to the natural and laser induced surface roughness, and to the sample softness. The latter is responsible for the formation of particle clouds above the surface, which scatter both the laser and plasma radiation, and often results in breakdown formation above the analyzed surface. In such cases, a broad sonoluminescence emission from water, formed during the gas bubble collapse was sometimes registered. Under optimized experimental conditions, even by using a non-gated detector and single shot acquisition, it was possible to detect several minor sediment constituents, such as titanium, barium, manganese and others. A crude estimation of the Limit of Detection (LODs) for these elements was performed by underwater measurements on certified soils/sediments. Due to strong shot-to-shot fluctuations in the plasma temperature, well correlated calibration curves, aimed for quantitative analyses, could only be obtained after applying an appropriate data processing procedure. The latter selects automatically only the spectra characterized by similar plasma parameters, which are related to their continuum spectral distribution. Application of such a procedure improves the measurement accuracy also in other surroundings and on samples different from the ones analyzed here. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of JCSDA is to accelerate the use of observations from Earth-orbiting satellites in operational environmental analysis and prediction models for the purpose of improving weather, ocean, climate, and air quality forecasts and the accuracy of climate datasets. Advanced instruments of current and planned satellite missions do and will increasingly provide large volumes of data related to the atmospheric, oceanic, and land surface state. During this decade, this will result in a five order of magnitude increase in the volume of data available for use by the operational and research weather, ocean, and climate communities. These data will exhibit accuracies and spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions never before achieved. JCSDA will help ensure that the maximum benefit from investment in the space-based global observation system is realized. JCSDA will accelerate the use of satellite data from both operational and experimental spacecraft for weather and climate prediction systems. To this end, the advancement of data assimilation science by JCSDA has included the establishment of the JCSDA Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM), which has continual upgrades to allow for the effective use of current and many future satellite instruments. This and other activity within JCSDA have been supported by both internal and external (generally university based) research. Another key activity within JCSDA has been to lay the groundwork for and to establish common NWP model and data assimilation infrastructure for accessing new satellite data and optimizing the use of these data in operational models. As a result of this activity, common assimilation infrastructure has been established at NOAA and NASA and this will assist in a coordinated and integrated move to four-dimensional assimilation among the partner agencies. This paper discusses the establishment of JCSDA and its mission, goals, and science priorities. It also discusses recent advances made by JCSDA, and planned future developments. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Air quality; Climatology; Computer simulation; Data processing; Environmental impact assessments; Oceanography; Optimization; Weather forecasting; Climate prediction system; Community radiative transfer model; Weather satellites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247611508

Studies of mycorrhizal functioning have focused on their roles in providing nutrients to plants, but their importance as a significant component of the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle has generally been overlooked. However, over 80% of plant species invest substantial amounts of their below-ground C flow into these fungal symbionts (Smith & Read, 1997; Leake italic., 2004). At the global scale, the annual C flux through soil respiration is ten times greater than fossil fuel combustion and recycles c. 10% of atmospheric CO2(Raich italic., 2002). Roots and associated mycorrhizas are the single most important component of this flux. Knowledge of the mycorrhizal contribution to the C cycle is of increasingly paramount importance, as this component is likely to be among the most sensitive to ongoing anthropogenic disturbance of both C (Staddon italic., 2002) and nitrogen (N) biogeochemical cycles (Nilsson & Wallander, 2003). The major biomes are dominated by plants with one of three kinds of mycorrhiza (Fig. 8.1), each of which is adapted to the particular vegetation and soil characteristics of the bioclimatic regions in which it is most important (Read italic., 2004). Central to understanding the contributions of mycorrhizas to the plant–soil–atmosphere continuum of the C cycle is appreciation of the properties and functions of these three major types of mycorrhiza and the ecosystems in which they are of greatest importance. © Cambridge University Press 2007 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649362410

As positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) are proven complementary modalities in clinical staging, recent advances in PET technology have brought forth integrated PET/CT as the new standard. We tested the hypothesis that improvements in PET technology have not increased the sensitivity or specificity of PET in the staging of non-small cell lung cancer to an extent that surgical staging is no longer required. Methods: This is a retrospective, single-institution review of 336 patients from 1995 to 2005 with biopsy-proven non-small cell lung cancer who underwent [18F] fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose-PET before mediastinal lymph node sampling by cervical mediastinoscopy or thoracotomy. Clinical records, histopathologic reports, and PET findings were reviewed. Data were analyzed by the Pearson χ2 test. Results: Within the study population, 210 patients had routine PET and 126 had integrated PET/CT. For detecting mediastinal metastases the sensitivities of PET versus integrated PET/CT were 61.1% versus 85.7% (P &lt; .05), specificities were 94.3% versus 80.6% (P &lt; .001), positive predictive values were 68.8% versus 55.8%, negative predictive values were 92.1% versus 95.2%, and overall accuracy was 88.6% versus 81.7%. Conclusions: Improvements in PET technology have increased integrated PET/CT sensitivity at the cost of significantly decreased specificity. Although it may appear that integrated PET/CT incurs fewer false negative results, the dramatic increase in false positive results reinforces the notion that integrated PET/CT should be used only as an adjunct to clinical staging and that surgical staging remains the gold standard in non-small cell lung cancer. © 2007 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.",,"fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; adult; aged; apparatus; article; cancer staging; chi square test; computer assisted tomography; data analysis; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic value; false negative result; false positive result; female; histopathology; human; image analysis; lung biopsy; lung non small cell cancer; major clinical study; male; mediastinoscopy; mediastinum lymph node; mediastinum metastasis; medical record; positron emission tomography; prediction; priority journal; retrospective study; thoracotomy; treatment planning; tumor biopsy; United States; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biopsy, Needle; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mediastinoscopy; Middle Aged; Needs Assessment; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Staging; Positron-Emission Tomography; Predictive Value of Tests; Probability; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Thoracotomy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847084665

Reduction efforts may involve the agricultural sector through options such as planting of trees, altering crop and livestock management, and increasing production of biofuels. However, such options can be competitive with domestic food production. In a free trade arena, reduced domestic food production could stimulate increased production and exports in other countries, which are not pursuing net emission reductions. As a consequence, emission reduction efforts in implementing countries may be offset by production increases stimulated in other countries. We examine the competitive effects of agriculturally related emission reduction actions on agricultural production and international trade. In doing this, we employ the assumption that U.S. emission reduction caused cost increases will also occur in other reducing countries. We consider emission reduction: 1) unilaterally by the U.S., 2) by all Kyoto Protocol Annex B countries, and 3) globally. The results, which are only suggestive of the types of effects that would be observed due to the simplifying cost assumptions, indicate compliance causes supply cutbacks in regulated countries and increases in non-regulated countries. The study results show that producers in regulating countries are likely to benefit and consumers lose due to commodity price increases. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Agricultural and forest sector; Greenhouse gas; International trade; Leakage; Mitigation implementation","agricultural emission; agricultural production; comparative advantage; emission control; greenhouse gas; international trade; Kyoto Protocol; leakage; legislative implementation; mitigation; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247326024

Most of the biochemical and toxic effects of TCDD are mediated by a basic helix-loop-helix and a conserved region among Per, ARNT, and Sim (bHLH/PAS) proteins, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT). To study the molecular mechanism of TCDD toxicity in common cormorant as an avian model species, characterization of the AHR/ARNT signaling pathway in this species is necessary. The present study focuses on molecular characterization of ARNT from common cormorant (ccARNT). The cDNA of the ccARNT isoform, ccARNT1 obtained by the screening of hepatic cDNA library contains a 2424-bp open reading frame that encodes 807 amino acids, exhibiting high identities (92%) with chicken ARNT. This isoform contains a unique 22 amino acid residue in 3′ end of PAS A domain as is also recognized in chicken ARNT. The ccARNT2 cDNA isolated from brain tissue has a 2151-bp open reading frame. The deduced amino acid sequence of ccARNT2 protein (716 aa) shows a conservation of bHLH and PAS motif in its N-terminal region with high similarities (96% and 78%, respectively) to that of ccARNT1. Using quantitative RT-PCR methods, the tissue distribution profiles of ccARNT1 and ccARNT2 were unveiled. Both ccARNT1 and ccARNT2 mRNAs were ubiquitously expressed in all examined tissues including liver. The expression profile of ccARNT1 was comparable with that of rodent ARNT1, but ccARNT2 was not with rodent ARNT2, implying different roles of ARNT2 between the two species. There was a significant positive correlation between ARNT1 and ARNT2 mRNA expression levels in the liver of wild cormorant population, indicating that their expressions may be enforced by similar transcriptional regulation mechanism. Novel variants of ccARNT1 and ccARNT2 isoforms that were supposed to arise from their splicing process were also identified and their hepatic expression profiles were determined. These results indicate that ccARNT1, ccARNT2 and their splice variants may more intricately regulate the AHR/ARNT signaling pathway and consequently may be responsible for the species diversity of toxic effects and susceptibility to PHAHs. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The emission of PCDD/Fs by MSWIs is a controversial subject in human health risk assessment. In this study the effect of a MSWI on a residential area was assessed before and after the installation of an additional treatment system for flue gas. This additional treatment system resulted in a dramatic decrease in PCDD/F concentrations in stack flue gas samples by 99.98%, while the concentrations in air decreased by approximately 50% (36,500 and 0.75 pg I-TEQ m-3 for air in 1999; 3.5 and 0.38 pg I-TEQ m-3 in 2002; 1.6 and 0.076 pg I-TEQ m-3 in 2005 for stack gas and air, respectively). Considering the congener distributions of PCDD/Fs between stack flue gas and air samples, the study area seemed to have been contaminated by other urban sources as well as the MSWI. ISC3 model results support the conclusion that this incinerator became only a minor contributor to the study area after installation of the supplementary systems. This resulted from both proper MSWI operation using modern technology and additional sources of contaminants in this region. Finally, PCDD/F uptake by humans through inhalation of contaminated air was estimated. Assuming that inhalation exposure contributes 10% of total exposure, total exposure was lower than WHO guidelines. These results confirm that proper operation and maintenance of the incinerator led to a reduction in emissions and potential health impacts of PCDD/Fs. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In June, soil water stress is relatively low with moderate vapor pressure deficit while in July both soil water stress and vapor pressure deficit are high. The comparison of the CO2 flux with observation has been made during daytime when the eddy flux is close to net ecosystem exchange. The model explained 88% of observed half hourly variance of latent heat flux and 86% of that of the CO2 flux. It was also found that the model simulates quite well the mean diurnal variations of latent and sensible heat flux and net ecosystem exchange in early June (Case 1) and that it reproduces the reduced carbon uptake due to the partial stomatal closure in the afternoon in late July (Case 2). However, the model overestimates the turbulent fluxes in the morning, in association with observed low energy balance closure due to the weak turbulent mixing in late July (Case 2). The simulated carbon uptake shows an earlier peak compared to the measured CO2 flux in Case 2 when weak wind prevails during the nights, probably due to the stored CO2 within the canopy which is assimilated by vegetation in the first few hours of the day. However, CO2 storage does not explain the measured low respiration rate throughout the night, suggesting the importance of other processes such as advection by drainage flows on the carbon budget during calm nights at this site. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Though the chemical structures of POPC and POPE are largely similar (choline versus ethanolamine headgroup), their transformation processes from a gel to a liquid-crystalline state are contrasting. In the similarities, the lipid tails for both systems are tilted below the phase transition and become more random above the phase transition temperature. The average area per lipid and bilayer thickness were found less sensitive to phase transition changes as the unsaturated tails are able to buffer reordering of the bilayer structure, as observed from hysteresis loops in annealing simulations. For POPC, changes in the structural properties such as the lipid tail order parameter, hydrocarbon trans-gauche isomerization, lipid tail tilt-angle, and level of interdigitation identified a phase transition at about 270 K. For POPE, three temperature ranges were identified, in which the lower one (270-280 K) was associated with a pre-transition state and the higher (290-300 K) with the post-transition state. In the pre-transition state, there was a significant increase in the number of gauche arrangements formed along the lipid tails. Near the main transition (280-290 K), there was a lowering of the lipid order parameters and a disappearance of the tilted lipid arrangement. In the post-transition state, the carbon atoms along the lipid tails became less hindered as their density profiles showed uniform distributions. This study also demonstrates that atomistic simulations of current lipid force fields are capable of capturing the phase transition behavior of lipid bilayers, providing a rich set of molecular and structural information at and near the main transition state. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Amines; Annealing; Gels; Hysteresis loops; Lipid bilayers; Molecular dynamics; Molecular structure; Phase transitions; Bilayer thickness; Bilayers; Molecular dynamics simulations; Liquid crystals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250315776

Therefore, changes in soil characteristics associated with land use history can influence the volatile emissions of plants affecting the structure of arthropod assemblies in croplands. This study aims (1) to study the relationships between soil degradation levels due to land-use history, and the change in particular soil chemical characteristics; (2) to analyze plant-soil interactions quantifying the effect of soil degradation on the production of biomass and grain yield of coriander and wheat crops, and on the production and chemical composition of volatile secondary metabolites in coriander grain; (3) to find the relationship between the analyzed plant-soil interactions and the emission of volatile signals affecting arthropod assemblies; and (4) to determine the relationship between particular chemical soil characteristics and the structure of arthropod assemblies. For these purpose, two experiments were carried out in which volatile compounds were conducted from source plots with soils with different levels of degradation, sown with wheat or coriander, to sink plots with similar soil, sown with wheat. Crops were evaluated on source plots, and the arthropods communities were assessed on sink-plots. Coriander produced high biomass, grain yield and essential oil in the favorable environments and wheat produced higher biomass and grain yield in soil with low degradation than with high degradation. Particular chemical soil elements, for example, Na, Fe, Mn, N and CEC and essential oil components, for example, γ-trepanned, p-cymene, asinine and β-pinene could be involved in the arthropods assemblies. Based on these results, arthropods communities in agricultural systems are, at least, partially controlled by chemical signals, which depend on plant-soil interactions. © 2007.","Arthropods; Coriander; Soil degradation; Volatile compounds; Wheat","arthropod; bottom-up control; chemical cue; crop yield; herb; land use change; phytochemistry; secondary metabolite; soil biota; soil chemistry; soil degradation; soil-vegetation interaction; volatile organic compound; wheat; yield response; Arthropoda; Coriandrum sativum; Equus asinus; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947663940

Methods: We simulated various ways by which emission reductions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides, and fine particulate matter (particulate matter &lt; 2.5 μm in diameter; PM2.5) could be distributed to reach national emissions caps. We applied a source-receptor matrix to determine the PM2.5 concentration changes associated with each control scenario and estimated the mortality reductions. We estimated changes in the spatial inequality of health risk using the Atkinson index and other indicators, following previously derived axioms for measuring health risk inequality. Results: In our baseline model, benefits ranged from 17,000-21,000 fewer premature deaths per year across control scenarios. Scenarios with greater health benefits also tended to have greater reductions in the spatial inequality of health risk, as many sources with high health benefits per unit emissions of SO2 were in areas with high background PM2.5 concentrations. Sensitivity analyses indicated that conclusions were generally robust to the choice of indicator and other model specifications. Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrates an approach for formally quantifying both the magnitude and spatial distribution of health benefits of pollution control strategies, allowing for joint consideration of efficiency and equity.","Environmental justice; Equity; Particulate matter; Power plant; Premature mortality; Risk assessment","nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; air pollution control; article; control strategy; cost control; electric power plant; environmental health; environmental impact assessment; environmental protection; field emission; health hazard; health insurance; human; mortality; particulate matter; priority journal; public health; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; risk reduction; sensitivity analysis; simulation; United States; Air Pollution; Computer Simulation; Environment; Models, Theoretical; Power Plants; Public Health; Risk Assessment; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249112266

Using models of landscape indices such as diversity, fragmentation, and mean patch fractal dimension, dynamic spatio-temporal changes of landscape patterns of the province were analyzed. The results: 1 cropland and forestland were the main landscape types, and forestland became a landscape matrix; 2 in the study area, landscapes were distributed unevenly, and there was low heterogeneity, a simple ecosystem structure and a tendency of irrational landscape patterns. There were also simple spatial shapes of patches and strong self-similarities, and in terms of dynamic change analysis, patch shapes tended to be more simple; 3 from 1980 to 2000, holistic landscape fragmentation was low and changed slightly. As far as landscape elements were concerned, the fragmentation of grassland, water area, land for residential area and factory facilities was relatively low; land distribution for residential areas and factory facilities was dispersed; and cropland and forestland were most concentrated - an indication that the trend will continue. Comprehensive effects among human activity, local policy, regional climate and environmental change led to the results.","Dynamic change; Jilin Province; Landscape index; Landscape pattern","Ecosystems; Forestry; Fractal dimension; Housing; Remote sensing; Dynamic changes; Jilin Province; Landscape fragmentation; Landscape index; Landscape pattern; Remote sensing images; Spatial informations; Spatio-temporal changes; Climate change; ecosystem structure; forest cover; GIS; landscape change; remote sensing; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Jilin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547445009

By a facile solid-state reaction process using graphite-like phase of C3N4 (g-C3N4) as the carbonizing reagent, we synthesized three technologically important carbides including cubic NbC and TaC, and hexagonal WC nanoparticles at relatively low temperature (1150 °C). The products were characterized by power X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). The results show that g-C3N4 is a highly efficient carbonizing reagent and the oxides Nb2O5, Ta2O5 and WO3 are completely converted into the corresponding carbides at 1150 °C, which is significantly lower than that reported for the commercial preparation of the carbides, typically &gt;1600 °C. The NbC, TaC and WC nanoparticles are found to have an average particle size of 4, 35 and 60 nm, respectively. An important feature of this solid-state reaction process is that g-C3N4 plays double roles as both efficiently reducing and carbonizing reagent. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The strong affinity between PFOMA and CO2 is found to induce phase segregation when annealing PEO-b-PFOMA films at the same temperature as compared with vacuum. In vacuum, PED-b-PFOMA films remain disordered from 80 to 180°C, whereas, in Sc-CO2 at 13.9 MPa an upper order-disorder transition (UODT) between 116 and 145°C is found. In Sc-CO2, the observed ordered structure is layers of PEO spheres embedded in the matrix of PFOMA, followed by a brush layer, in which PEO wets the substrate. The swelling isotherms of PFOMA and PEO in CO2 are correlated with the Sanchez-Lacombe equation of state (SLEOS) to estimate the interaction parameters, χPFOMA-CO2 and χPEO-CO2- The phase segregation (order) induced by CO2 relative to vacuum at a given temperature is explained in terms of two factors: (1) copolymer volume fraction upon dilution with CO2, ø, and (2) the relative interaction parameter, Δχ = χPEO-CO2 χPFOMA-CO2- The latter factor favors order and is dominant at low temperatures over the Π factor, which always favors disorder. At high temperatures (above the TODT), the preferential swelling of PFOMA by CO2 is less pronounced (Δχ decreases), and the copolymer is disordered. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Block copolymers; Compressible flow; Polyethylene oxides; Supercritical fluids; Swelling; Thermal effects; Interaction parameters; Phase segregation; Upper order-disorder transition (UODT); Plastic films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847127540

Here we present estimates of terrestrial carbon pools as soil organic carbon and carbonate carbon in soils of China by using inventory data from the National Soil Resource Survey and Chinese Academy of Sciences. The total soil organic carbon and carbonate carbon in soils of China for a depth of 100 cm were estimated to be 83.8 Pg and 77.9 Pg C, respectively, and for whole soil profile was estimated to be 147.9 Pg and 234.2 Pg, respectively, with the sum of overall carbon storage 382.1 Pg. Terrestrial soil carbon storage and density (both organic carbon and carbonate carbon) in soils of China vary with and are modulated by bioclimatic conditions (temperature and precipitation/evaporation). The temperate regions have sequestered more terrestrial carbon in soils than the tropical and subtropical regions. This study suggests that terrestrial carbon in China is mainly sequestered in soil pool instead of aboveground forest biomass.

The proposed simulation model was fitted to experimental data by implementing surface-related and thermally activated coefficients. It is improved compared to our previous model by incorporating a depth-dependent probability for out-diffusion of hydrocarbons. The local reduction of carbon density due to either physical sputtering or chemical erosion was also taken into account. Furthermore, the erosion for all three hydrogen isotopes - hydrogen, deuterium, and tritium - was modeled. All the calculated and fitted results are in good agreement with measured data.

Tobacco smoking and indoor air pollution are persistent or growing exposures in regions where TB poses a major health risk. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the association between these exposures and the risk of infection, disease, and death from TB. Methods and Findings: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies reporting effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals on how tobacco smoking, passive smoke exposure, and indoor air pollution are associated with TB. We identified 33 papers on tobacco smoking and TB, five papers on passive smoking and TB, and five on indoor air pollution and TB. We found substantial evidence that tobacco smoking is positively associated with TB, regardless of the specific TB outcomes. Compared with people who do not smoke, smokers have an increased risk of having a positive tuberculin skin test, of having active TB, and of dying from TB. Although we also found evidence that passive smoking and indoor air pollution increased the risk of TB disease, these associations are less strongly supported by the available evidence. Conclusions: There is consistent evidence that tobacco smoking is associated with an increased risk of TB. The finding that passive smoking and biomass fuel combustion also increase TB risk should be substantiated with larger studies in future. TB control programs might benefit from a focus on interventions aimed at reducing tobacco and indoor air pollution exposures, especially among those at high risk for exposure to TB. © 2007 Lin et al.",,"tobacco smoke; air pollution; cigarette smoking; clinical trial; correlation analysis; environmental exposure; evidence based medicine; human; infection risk; latent period; lung tuberculosis; meta analysis; mortality; observational study; outcome assessment; passive smoking; pathogenesis; publishing; quality control; quantitative analysis; review; systematic review; tuberculin test; indoor air pollution; passive smoking; risk factor; smoking; survival rate; tuberculosis; Air Pollution, Indoor; Humans; Risk Factors; Smoking; Survival Rate; Tobacco Smoke Pollution; Tuberculosis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846651370

The time-dependent, two-dimensional numerical code, which includes a detailed kinetic model and diffusive transport, has predicted the flame extinction within 4 or 8% for each. Analysis of the flame structure has allowed the mechanisms of flame weakening in the base and trailing flame regions to be compared. The agents CF3Br and Br2 behave very similarly with regard to flame extinguishment: both raise the temperature in the flame everywhere, as well as lower radical volume fractions in the trailing diffusion flame and at the peak reactivity spot (the ""reaction kernel"") at the flame base where the flame is stabilized. The mechanism of lowered radical volume fractions is shown primarily to be due to a catalytic cycle involving bromine species in both regions of the flame, with small contributions from radical trapping by fluorinated species in the trailing diffusion flame. In the reaction kernel, the radical volume fractions are reduced more, and the catalytic radical recombination cycles are shown to be more effective as compared to in the trailing diffusion flame. At the latter location, the effectiveness of the agents is reduced because the hydrocarbon species, which are necessary for the regeneration of HBr, are scarce at the location of the peak radical volume fraction (i.e., at the flame zone), a limitation which does not exist in the reaction kernel, where there is good upstream mixing of the fuel and oxidizer because the base is lifted. That is, the premixed character of the reaction kernel actually allows the HBr in the catalytic cycle to be more effective there because of the effective overlap between the Br and the hydrocarbon species, which allows efficient regeneration of HBr. © 2007.","CF3Br; Cup burner; Fire suppression; Flame extinction; Halon replacement","Codes (symbols); Diffusion; Mathematical models; Mixing; Numerical methods; Volume fraction; Cup burner; Fire suppression; Flame extinction; Flame structure; Halon replacement; Flame research; bromine; carbon; fluorine; hydrocarbon; Codes (symbols); Diffusion; Flame research; Mathematical models; Mixing; Numerical methods; Volume fraction; article; catalysis; fluorination; gas diffusion; kernel method; kinetics; mathematical model; oxidation; priority journal; reaction analysis; temperature dependence; time",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947599710

Since the end of 2003, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI) H5N1 have caused many outbreaks in poultries and wild birds from East Asia and have spread to at least 48 countries. For such a fast and wide-spreading virulent pathogen, prediction based on changes of micro- and macro-environment has rarely been evaluated. In this study, we are developing a new climatic approach by investigating the conditions that occurred before the H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks for early predicting future HPAI outbreaks and preventing pandemic disasters. The results show a temperature drop shortly before these outbreaks in birds in each of the Eurasian regions stricken in 2005 and 2006. Dust storms, like those that struck near China's Lake Qinghai around May 4, 2005, exacerbated the spread of this HPAI H5N1 virus, causing the deaths of a record number of wild birds and triggering the subsequent spread of H5N1.

When unfavorable weather conditions are forecasted, it is desirable to reduce a certain amount of pollutant emissions to maintain a given level of air quality. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a new approach to find the optimal reduction, and we contribute to the methodology of decision support of short-term emission control. This approach is based on weather forecasts and state-of-the-art 3-dimensional numerical air-quality prediction models by solving an optimal control problem with the emission cuts as the control variables. The objective of the optimal problem is to minimize the total cost due to the emission cuts, subject to feasibility constraints, system-governing model constraints, and target constraints. When a high-resolution numerical model is used as the state constraint, the problem can become a very high dimensional one. A practical approach to solving this problem with high dimension is proposed, based on the adjoint technique. The proposed approach is demonstrated with two computational test cases in Jinan, China for the control of sulfur dioxide. The results show the capability and computational efficiency of the method and suggest a promising potential for emission planning applications based on weather forecasts. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Two dominant modes of sea ice variability in the North Pacific were identified. The first mode features a dipole pattern between the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea. The second mode is characterized by more uniform ice changes throughout the North Pacific. Using the principal components of the two dominant modes as the indices (PC1 and PC2), analyses show that the positive phases of PC1 feature a local warming (cooling) in the Sea of Okhotsk (the Bering Sea), which is associated with the formation of the anomalous anticyclone extending from the northern Pacific to Siberia, accompanied by a weakening of the east Asian jet stream and trough. The associated anomalous southeasterlies/easterlies reduce the climatological northwesterlies/ westerlies, leading to warm and wet conditions in northeast China and central Siberia. The positive phases of PC2 are characterized by a strong local warming in the northern Pacific that coincides with the anomalous cyclone occupying the entire North Pacific, accompanied by a strengthening of the east Asia jet stream and trough. The associated anomalous northerlies intensify the east Asian winter monsoon (EAWM), leading to cold and dry conditions in the east coast of Asia. The intensified EAWM also strengthens the local Hadley cell, which in turn strengthens the east Asian jet stream and leads to a precipitation deficit over subtropical east Asia. The linkages between PC1 and PC2 and large-scale modes of climate variability were also discussed. It is found that PC1 is a better indicator than the Arctic Oscillation of the recent Siberian warming, whereas PC2 may be a valuable predictor of EAWM. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric movements; Precipitation (meteorology); Principal component analysis; Sea ice; Climate variability; Monsoon; Winter; Climate change; Arctic Oscillation; climate variation; cooling; cyclone; easterly wave; jet stream; precipitation (climatology); principal component analysis; sea ice; trough; warming; westerly; Asia; Bering Sea; China; Eurasia; Far East; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Sea of Okhotsk; Siberia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250677609

A 501-bp portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase gene was sequenced from a minimum of eight individuals from each population, and 43 haplotypes were observed in the six Bactrocera dorsalis populations. When comparing the genetic diversity of populations in the northern and southern regions, which differ with respect to elevation, climate and plant phenology, we found a significantly greater haplotype diversity in the southern region (permutation test; P &lt; 0.05), suggesting that the northern populations, those at Kunming and Qujing, probably originated from somewhere in the southern region. FST and number of pairwise differences revealed a high level of differentiation between the Panxi population and the other populations (permutation test; P &lt; 0.05). Although the difference was marginally insignificant, the Shuitang population seemed to have differentiated from both northern populations. The Mantel test did not detect any isolation due to geographic distance. An AMOVA analysis found that 2.56% of the variance was caused by the Panxi population. Haplotype network analysis showed that none of the six populations had a specific genetic lineage. Together, these analyses suggest that long-distance dispersal has occurred for this species, and the species most probably took advantage of both a mountain pass and prevailing air currents. The Panxi population was significantly isolated from the others, probably because of its distinguishing habitat features, host plants or the recent reduction of the population size. © 2007 The Entomological Society of Japan.","Bactrocera dorsalis; Cytochrome oxidase gene; Dispersal; mtDNA sequence; Population genetics","Bactrocera dorsalis; Diptera; Tephritidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846894470

The objectives are to (i) develop a new approach to characterizing interrelations of yield (Y), evapotranspiration (ET), water use efficiency (WUE), and soil fertility using an elasticity index, and (ii) to further derive optimal-coupling domains of water and fertilizer inputs using maize data of 1997 and 1998, as an example. The experiment was an incomplete factorial design with two factors (water supply and fertilizer input) with five levels each, and had a total of 13 treatments with three replicates each. A maize cultivar (Zhongdan 2, Zea mays L.) was grown in a loessial silt loam in the hilly region of the Loess Plateau of China. Irrigation was hand applied at predetermined amounts as needed, and fertilizers including nitrogen, phosphate, and yard manure were applied at planting and jointing at predetermined rates. Approaches on how to use the crop-water production function and elasticity index (EI) to characterize the interrelations of Y, ET, and WUE were presented, and further extended to derive the optimal-coupling domains of water and fertilizer inputs. Yield responses to water and fertilizer inputs followed a quadratic function with a positive interactive term. When constrained by local maximum yields, the optimal-coupling domain took a half-ellipse form with the global maximum WUE and Y (or maximum ET) corresponding to the left and right end points on its long axis. As water supply increased, WUE reached its maximum before yield did. If water supply is limiting, fertilizer rates that maximize WUE rather than yield should be used; otherwise, seeking maximum yield may be desirable. For irrigation management, total water supply to maize should not exceed 550 mm in the region. Furthermore, the optimal domain can be used to determine optimal fertilizer rates for any given water supply, which may be estimated from seasonal climate forecasts in the case of dryland farming or based on available water supply for future irrigation. For a given water supply, fertilizer rates should be between the rate of reaching local maximum WUE and the rate of reaching local maximum yield. © 2006.","Fertility; Maize; Optimization; Production function; Water use efficiency","Evapotranspiration; Fertilizers; Optimization; Water analysis; Production function; Water use efficiency (WUE); Crops; crop yield; evapotranspiration; experimental study; fertilizer application; irrigation; maize; optimization; silty loam; soil fertility; water availability; water supply; water use efficiency; Corn; Evaporation; Fertilizers; Optimization; Transpiration; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Loess Plateau; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751439366

Due to its proximity to the coast, the tributary is tidally affected resulting in continuous water quality changes. Of the three iron-based coagulants tested, all provided nearly 10% greater reductions in total organic carbon when compared to alum. The pH ranges using the iron-based coagulants were much lower than those experienced with alum. Turbidity removal was approximately 100% for all coagulants. Ferric sulfate required the highest average dosage for proper coagulation/flocculation with efficient turbidity removal at 110 ppm. The performance of the PFS was comparable to that of ferric sulfate. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The difference between field scale and regional scale yield risk, which can be significant, also represents an important measure of the factors that cause the yield gap - the difference between average and maximum yields. While field scale yield risk is difficult to assess with traditional data sources, yield maps derived from remote sensing offer promise for obtaining the necessary data in any region. We analyzed remotely sensed yield datasets for two regions in Northwest Mexico, the Yaqui and San Luis Rio Colorado Valleys, in conjunction with time series of aggregated regional yields for 1976-2002. Regional scale yield risk was roughly 8% of average yields in both regions. Field scale yield risk was determined to be 58% higher than regional scale risk in both regions. The difference between field and regional scale risk accounted for 50% of the spatial variance in yields in the Yaqui Valley, and 70% in the San Luis Rio Colorado Valley, indicating that climatic uncertainty represents an important source of the spatial yield variability. This implies that accurate seasonal climate forecasts could substantially reduce yield losses in farmers' fields. The results were shown to be fairly sensitive to assumptions about the magnitude and nature of errors in yield estimation, suggesting that improved understanding of estimation errors are needed to realize the full potential of remote sensing for yield risk analysis. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Electrodeposition of Zn-Co alloys is usually divided into two potential regions, i.e. normal (positive to Zn deposition potential EZn0 = - 1.05 V versus SCE) and anomalous (negative to EZn0). In order to elucidate the deposition mechanism a complementary approach was used based on the combination of various electrochemical techniques. The morphology of the deposits and elemental composition analysis were determined by using SEM/EDX. It was found that the presence of Zn2+ in electrolyte inhibited Co2+ and H+ reductions in normal region. A critical potential was also noticed in the so-called normal deposition range above which a Co-enriched phase of Co-Zn alloy was favored and below that a severe mitigation to deposition occurred that was considered due to underpotential deposition (UPD) of Zn on the substrate and on active Co sites at either nucleation or growth stage. Beyond EZn0 the deposition is considered anomalous due to the fact that Zn deposits preferentially compared to the more noble Co. This anomalism was explained by the faster deposition kinetics of Zn as compared to Co on steel and could be overcome by either increasing the Co2+/Zn2+ ratios in the electrolyte or by carrying out the deposition at higher temperature. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Policy 10] posit the idea of ""reconciling supply and demand of science"" as a conceptual tool for assessment of science programs. We apply the concept to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) carbon cycle science program. By evaluating the information needs of decision makers, or the ""demand"", along with the supply of information by the USDA, we can ascertain where matches between supply and demand exist, and where science policies might miss opportunities. We report the results of contextual mapping and of interviews with scientists at the USDA to evaluate the production and use of current agricultural global change research, which has the stated goal of providing ""optimal benefit"" to decision makers on all levels. We conclude that the USDA possesses formal and informal mechanisms by which scientists evaluate the needs of users, ranging from individual producers to Congress and the President. National-level demands for carbon cycle science evolve as national and international policies are explored. Current carbon cycle science is largely derived from those discussions and thus anticipates the information needs of producers. However, without firm agricultural carbon policies, such information is currently unimportant to producers. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In light of the variability to both aerosol properties and environmental properties affected by aerosols, observational evidence alone cannot provide accurate and global answers, because detailed observations are locally limited and/or lack statistical significance. Thus, current understanding is predominantly derived from simulations with global models. General discrepancies to envelope (backward) modeling, however, suggest that many aerosol processes in global (forward) modeling are not properly considered. Using analytically derived parameterizations is recommended wherever possible. If an analytical method does not exist or is too demanding computationally, laboratory results augmented by field data are the second-best approach. For the constraint of so-derived parameterizations at the GCM scale, evaluating individual parameterizations using statistical relationships of satellite-retrieved quantities relevant to the process is recommended. The set of parameterizations may also be evaluated and improved using the data assimilation technique. To improve the quality of data references to modeling, there is a need to link available atmospheric data from all scales, and establish and support validation networks and experiments, and a commitment to fine-tune and improve satellite retrievals in an iterative process even beyond the anticipated period of the mission. Only then can more reliable estimates of the indirect aerosol effect be expected. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climatology; Clouds; Data processing; Iterative methods; Parameterization; Radiation budget; Satellite-retrieved quantities; Atmospheric aerosols",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947662528

Many UK waste disposal authorities (WDAs) are currently deciding which energy-from-waste policies are most suitable for their respective municipal areas. Such decisions are challenging since the environmental, economic and social implications of any EfW policy must be fully considered, now that planning guidelines require a full Sustainability Assessment. More specifically, WDAs must identify suitable site locations for facilities, and the optimal scale and number of facilities. This paper reports the results from a study that has developed and appraised EfW policy options using Geographical Information Systems and Multi Criteria Analysis modelling. These methods were used to evaluate and compare the impacts of several EfW strategies in the UK administrative areas of Cornwall and Warwickshire. Different strategies have been defined by the size and number of the EfW facilities, as well as the technology chosen, which includes conventional incineration and advanced thermal treatment. The overall conclusion of this work is that distributed small-scale EfW facilities score most highly overall on the chosen decision criteria and that scale is more important than technology design in determining overall EfW policy impact. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The reaction temperature was in the 573-773 K range, and the GHSV for nitric oxide was varied between 6000 and 60,000 h-1. In general, the Co-containing mordenite catalysts were more active than the HM. Over each catalyst two major surface intermediates were identified such as nitrosonium ion (NO+) and ammonia. The NO+ cations were shown to balance the negative charge on the zeolite framework. The NH3 molecules were bound either coordinately to Lewis-acid site Co2+ ions or were protonated on Brønsted acid sites and retained by the zeolite as NH4+ cations. The prevailing route of N2 formation was found to involve the reaction of NO+ and NH3 or NH4+ surface species. It was shown that the surface concentration of the intermediate ammonia governed the rate of NO conversion. If O2 was present in the feed gas it competed with the NO in the oxidation of methane and the surface intermediate ammonia. As a result, the steady-state concentration of the ammonia intermediate and the overall NO conversion to N2 decreased. Additional routes of N2 formation were revealed over the CoM and CoPtM catalysts. The cobalt facilitated the formation of NO+ and surface nitrate (NO3-). Also nitrile (CN) and isocyanate (NCO) surface species were detected. The NO3- could be rapidly reduced by methane to intermediate NH3 and, thereby, it increased the rate of NO conversion significantly. Nitrogen forming reactions can pass also through CN and NCO intermediates; however, the share of these reaction routes in the overall N2 generation process was minor. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The rain ratio may be altered by changes in the nutrient chemistry of the thermocline. Such changes in the tropical Pacific are revealed by the carbon isotope values of thermocline-dwelling planktonic foraminifera (Neogloboquadrina dutertrei). The tropical Pacific record over the last 30 kyr in the region south, or along, the equator, which is fed by upwelling of deeper equatorial undercurrent water (EUC), shows a carbon isotope signal distinct from any other in global mixed-layer or benthic environments. This unique record is consistent across the Pacific. Unlike carbon isotope data from other basins and oceanic habitats, the tropical Pacific thermocline tracer shows last glacial values more positive than those of post-glacial times. The isotopic shift occurs in the early deglacial (20-17 kyr) and leads to a deglacial carbon isotope minimum whose timing differs from that seen elsewhere. The deglacial record of the Pacific seems best interpreted as the progressive development of the modern, nutrient-rich thermocline under high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) conditions. The eastern tropical Atlantic also has a unique glacial to modern carbon isotope record that is essentially opposite to that seen in the Pacific. Strongly negative values in glacial times differ from those of the 'standard stratified' ocean, indicating higher nutrient concentrations. A large shift to more positive values occurs rapidly at about 13-14 kyr. This indicates a marked reduction in thermocline nutrients. The implication is that nutrient flow to the tropics from the deep ocean (via sub-Antarctic sources) was stronger for the Atlantic during the glacial, but was weaker in the Pacific. Transformation to modern conditions occurred in two steps, at 17-18 and 13-14 kyr, a timing that matches shifts in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and which would be compatible with driving those concentrations higher over deglacial time. The mechanism could be an inherent difference in production regimes between the tropical Pacific and Atlantic. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A marked positive excursion in δ13C is dated as Middle Oxfordian in age. In this study we investigate if changes in carbonate sedimentation coincided with altered carbon cycling and climate. We use C-isotope records as a proxy for the evolution of the carbon cycle and compare δ13C-trends with the evolution of sedimentation in a segment of the opening Tethys seaway. One of the studied sections is located in the Subalpine basin of France (Trescléoux and Oze), the other in the Swiss Jura mountains (Liesberg). Carbon-isotope stratigraphy of carbonate carbon locates the peak values of the Middle Oxfordian positive excursion to the antecedens and parandieri subzones of the plicatilis and transversarium ammonite zones, respectively. Causes of the excursion remain enigmatic. The excursion seems not to coincide with a global oceanic anoxic event, but regionally enhanced organic carbon accumulation during the Early and early Middle Oxfordian may be the cause of the increase in δ13C. The excursion occurs during a time of progressive climate warming, and its peak values coincide with the first calcareous sediments recurring after a period of reduced carbonate accumulation in the Early and early Middle Oxfordian. The excursion is also time-equivalent to a major reorganisation of global ocean currents: the opening Atlantic and Tethys oceans combined with rising sea level led to the formation of an efficient circumglobal seaway. We conclude that this favoured the widespread recurrence of carbonate producers by providing new habitats. As a result, Ccarb burial increased, leading to a lower Corg/Ccarb burial rate and therefore to stabilisation and decrease in δ13C in the Middle Oxfordian. Thus, the mid-Oxfordian positive excursion in carbonate C-isotopes may reflect changes in the carbon cycle that were triggered by a copious reorganisation of the ocean current system caused by major plate tectonic movements. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The interaction between precatalysts and substrates of catalytic polymerization systems, viz., complexes 1 and 2 and unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes and dienes), was studied in the region of concentrations close to catalytic values. For organometallic π-complexes, it has been shown for the first time that, in the case of the unsaturated hydrocarbons, the efficiency of energy transfer obeys the Perrin equation. The process occurs at distances R 0 close to the diameter of the interacting molecules and is well described by the exchange-resonant mechanism of interaction. In the case of the cyclopentadiene-Cp 2MCl2 (M = Zr, Hf) systems, R 0 = 14.6 Å.

The analytical parameters included pH, cations (K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, NH4+), anions (F-, Cl-, SO42 -, NO3-), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). In descending order, concentrations (in meq L-1) of the ions in wet deposition can be ordered as SO42 - &gt; Ca2 + &gt; NH4+ &gt; NO3-&gt;Cl-&gt;Na+&gt;Mg2+&gt;K+&gt;F- with concentratin percentages of 48.7%, 19.1%, 11.6%, 8.1%, 5.6%, 2.6%, 1.7%, 1.6% and 1%, respectively. Rainfall was seasonally variable, with high rates in spring and summer but low rates in autumn and winter, while ion concentrations followed the reverse seasonal cycle. To evaluate deposition rates (DR) of different elements, average DR of each ion was calculated from a simple model. Most of the highest DRs of these substances occurred in Suzhou and Wuxi, located east and north of Lake Taihu, which shows there was considerable variation over the 5 stations. This regional pattern reflects local emissions from industry and agriculture, and suggests that steps need to be taken by local governments for particle emission reductions. The estimated annual inputs of TN and TP over the lake are 4722 and 75 t, respectively, which accounts for around 16.5% and 7.3% of the annual total external inputs of these nutrients. Primary productivity in Lake Taihu associated solely with wet deposition of nitrogen to the lake was estimated to be 7.03×106 mol C day-1. These results suggest that wet deposition can have significant impacts on the trophic status of Lake Taihu and that attention to nutrients in precipitation should be included in the management of external nutrient loads to the lake. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We studied relationships between various phenophases (i.e., seasonal biological events) and interannual variations of air temperature in three woody plant species (Prunus davidiana, Hibiscus syriacus, and Cercis chinensis) in the Beijing Metropolis, China, based on phenological data for the period 1962-2004 and meteorological data for the period 1951-2004. Analysis of phenology and climate data indicated significant changes in spring and autumn phenophases and temperatures. Changes in phenophases were observed for all the three species, consistent with patterns of rising air temperatures in the Beijing Metropolis. The changing phenology in the three plant species was reflected mainly as advances of the spring phenophases and delays in the autumn phenophases, but with strong variations among species and phenophases in response to different temperature indices. Most phenophases (both spring and autumn phenophases) had significant relationships with temperatures of the preceding months. There existed large inter- and intra-specific variations, however, in the responses of phenology to climate change. It is clear that the urban heat island effect from 1978 onwards is a dominant cause of the observed phenological changes. Differences in phenological responses to climate change may cause uncertain ecological consequences, with implications for ecosystem stability and function in urban environments. © 2006 The Ecological Society of Japan.","Beijing Metropolis; Climate change; Phenology; Temperature indices; Urbanization","air temperature; annual variation; climate change; ecological stability; ecosystem function; global climate; heat island; metropolitan area; ontogeny; phenology; seasonal variation; temperature effect; urban area; urbanization; woody plant; Asia; Beijing [China]; China; Eurasia; Far East; Cercis chinensis; Hibiscus; Hibiscus syriacus; Prunus; Prunus davidiana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248165622

The objective of this study was to determine changes in whole-plant carbon balance and root respiration rate in relation to root tolerance to high soil temperature for two Agrostis grass species varying in heat tolerance. Plant tolerance to high soil temperature was compared between Agrostis scabra, a thermal grass species adapted to chronic high-temperature soils in the geothermal areas in Yellowstone National Park, and creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera), a cultivated grass species adapted to cool climatic regions. Plant roots were exposed to low soil temperature (20 °C) or high soil temperature (37 °C) for 17 days in water baths placed in a controlled-environment growth chamber. Root biomass and cell membrane stability were determined to evaluate root thermotolerance of both species. Canopy photosynthetic rate (Pn), whole-plant respiration rate, root respiration rate, and total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) content were measured to assess changes in carbon production and utilization in response to high soil temperature. Root biomass and cell membrane stability declined with increasing soil temperature, but the decline was much less for A. scabra than A. stolonifera, suggesting that roots of A. scabra were more tolerant to heat stress. Canopy Pn decreased and whole-plant respiration rate increased for A. stolonifera, but canopy Pn and respiration rate were unchanged for A. scabra in response to increasing soil temperature. After 17 days of high soil temperature treatment, A. stolonifera exhibited carbon deficit at the whole-plant level, whereas A. scabra maintained positive carbon gain. Root respiration of plants previously grown at 20 °C increased after a short-term treatment (24 h) at 37 °C, but the increase was significantly lower for A. scabra than for A. stolonifera. TNC content in roots did not show response to short-term (24 h) changes in temperature and did not exhibit species variations. Leaves of A. scabra, however, maintained TNC content under both low and high temperature regimes. Our results suggest that root thermotolerance of cool-season grasses could be related to the maintenance of positive whole-plant carbon balance, and down-regulation of whole-plant and root respiration rates in response to increasing soil temperature. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A series of severe air pollution episodes in Europe and North America prior to 1960 have focused scientific and regulatory attention on the adverse effects of air pollution on human health. As a consequence of significant reductions in ambient air pollution levels in the intervening years, scientists and public health officials have become more concerned with the potential health effects of exposure to routine concentrations of air pollution. Several recent time series studies conducted worldwide have found relatively low levels of air pollutants that are below national standards were associated with adverse effects on mortality and morbidity. This study examined the effects of ambient air pollution indicators on the daily rate of pediatric hospital admissions for asthma in the Oklahoma City Metropolitan area from 2001-2003. Methods. Data were collected for the number of children ≤ 14 years old hospitalized for asthma on a daily basis (N = 1270) and ambient concentrations of NO2, O3, PM 2.5, mold and pollen concentrations, and meso-scale meteorological conditions. Results. Negative binomial regression analysis revealed significant relationships between the total number of hospitalizations per day and the one-hour maximum NO2 level, the proportion of susceptible children &lt; 5 years old, and the ratio of temperature to humidity. Discussion. This study of the total number of children aged ≤ 14 years old experiencing hospitalizations on a daily basis in the Oklahoma City area from 2001-2003 underscores factors other than ambient air pollution, especially when concentrations are low, affect hospitalizations for pediatric asthma. For example, information related to indoor air quality, health care, family history, and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and other irritants are not obtainable. Yet, those factors are risk drivers for asthma. Similarly, health privacy requirements prevented obtaining data on physiological factors specific to each child such as differentials in airways functional capacity or other impairments influenced asthma exacerbation. This makes calculating relative risk inappropriate. Conclusions. Although ambient air pollution concentrations and meteorological conditions influence pediatric asthma hospitalizations, they are not the major predictors in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. This is consistent with other research that finds limited effects associated with low levels for concentrations of the criteria pollutants. Recommendations and Perspectives. Although limiting concentrations for criteria air pollutants to levels below human health-based standards exhibited beneficial effects, other factors also need to be identified and addressed in order to reduce pediatric hospitalizations for asthma. © 2007 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).","Ambient air pollution; Environmental health; Pediatric asthma","nitrogen dioxide; ambient air; asthma; atmospheric pollution; child health; health impact; health risk; hospital sector; metropolitan area; morbidity; mortality; pollution exposure; pollution monitoring; adolescent; air pollutant; article; asthma; atmosphere; chemically induced disorder; chemistry; child; child hospitalization; environmental monitoring; female; hospitalization; human; infant; male; newborn; preschool child; statistics; United States; Adolescent; Air Pollutants; Asthma; Atmosphere; Child; Child, Hospitalized; Child, Preschool; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Nitrogen Dioxide; Oklahoma; North America; Oklahoma [United States]; United States; Nicotiana tabacum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846937626

In China, ∼85% of the generated MSW is being disposed of in the landfills. The amount of MSW is growing rapidly with the rate of ∼8–10% annually, which contains a high quantity of moisture and organic matters. The problems of leachate treatment and landfill gas (LFG) emissions are increasing gradually. Reducing the hazard before em-placement, pretreatment of MSW before landfilling has become very important for the conventional landfill. In this study, aerobic pretreatment of mixed MSW was used, and much attention has been given to the natural convection of air in the mixed and unshredded MSW for bioconversion of organic matter (OM). This study is an attempt to investigate aerobic pretreatment suitability for the mixed and unshredded MSW at Beijing. A pilot-scale aerobic pretreatment simulator (APS) was developed at Beishen Shu Landfill in Beijing. To work out the bio-degradation of the OM in the APS, fresh and pretreated MSW samples were collected and analyzed for OM, moisture content, temperature, chemical oxygen demand, total organic carbon, carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, lignocelluloses, and biochemical methane potential at various stages of the pretreatment. Furthermore, results of the fresh and pretreated MSW are compared. Significant reduction in the observed parameters of the pretreated waste samples is observed.

Reducing the hazard before emplacement, pretreatment of municipal solid waste (MSW) prior to landfilling has become very important for the conventional landfill. In this study, pretreated mixed un-shredded MSW by the natural convection of air was employed to assess the aerobic pretreatment suitability. To study the effects of pretreated waste on landfill behavior, landfill simulation reactor (LSR) was developed at laboratory scale; pretreated MSW was placed in it. In a LSR, the behavior of aerobically pretreated waste disposal on a landfill was simulated. The LSR was operated for more than 9 months. The LSR operating phases were analyzed together with the consolidation of the leachate and gas production. The leachate collected was analyzed for pH, BOD (biochemical oxygen demand), COD (chemical oxygen demand), NH3-N and trace metals. The gas collected was analyzed for CH4 and CO2. The COD and BOD values were reduced to 1850 mg/L and 235 mg/L respectively within 5 months respectively. The maximum landfill gas (LFG) generation was observed about 60 m3 per ton dry matter (DM) of MSW.

In this paper, we report the sensitivity of porous silicon photoluminescence (PL) to carbon dioxide and propane gases. A hydrocarbon film has been applied to PS surface to enhance its luminescence since a complete surface passivation is important to suppress or reduce non-radiative recombination centres. The operation sensor effect is based on the variation of the photoluminescence of the CHx/PS region due to the interaction with gaseous substances. Presence of carbon dioxide reduces the PL intensity while propane provokes an opposite behaviour. The PL quenching phenomenon leads itself to interesting optical sensor applications. The annealing effect on the photoluminescence of a p-type CHx/PS has been investigated. The orange light disappears and an intense blue light is obtained. Moreover, the effect of this treatment on the PL response of porous silicon in presence of CO2 and propane gases has also been studied. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Given that increasing low carbon generating capacity is essential to achieve the required carbon reductions, renewable energy policies are a central element of overall climate change policy. To facilitate the building of renewable capacity, greater responsibility has been placed upon the English regions, with the advent of regional sustainable energy strategies, though there remain many profound tensions between the liberalized UK energy system and the adoption of a more strategic approach to renewable energy at the regional scale. This paper uses a 'discourse analysis' framework to explore wind energy policy in the North West of England from the perspective of competing coalitions. In the light of this assessment, it is concluded that the implementation of national energy policy at regional and sub-regional scales can be considered as a process of coalition building, where Government is reliant on building partnership between state and non-state actors to achieve its objectives. © 2007 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"carbon emission; energy policy; Kyoto Protocol; regional planning; renewable resource; wind power; England; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247478610

Location: South-eastern Australia (27°-37°S latitude and 141°-151°E longitude). Methods: We used generalized additive models (GAMs) to model time-specific bird atlas occurrence data against time-specific plant productivity data, plus a range of environmental predictor variables. We then examined the effects of environmental variables on the temporal and spatial patterns of predicted abundance and distribution of the superb parrot using a correlative mapping approach. Results: Key findings from GAM analysis were: (1) there was a strong positive relationship between abundance and plant productivity in all regions, but (2) the response of abundance to other predictor variables often differed between regions. Correlative mapping predictions of the abundance and distribution of the superb parrot also indicated that: (1) predicted abundance varied through time and space, (2) predicted abundance sometimes decreased in all regions, but at other times some regions had high abundance when others had low, and (3) changes in plant productivity (and therefore climate) were associated with this variation. Main conclusion: The superb parrot favours productive landscapes that are also favoured for agriculture. Movements appear to be associated with seasonal and year to year climate variability. Thus, variation in the recorded abundance of the superb parrot may mask population trends, suggesting that existing population estimates are unreliable. Also, high abundances in some areas, and at some times, may reflect deteriorating habitat conditions elsewhere rather than species recovery. Temporal variability in the distribution of the superb parrot makes it difficult to identify specific drought refugia. Consequently, through time, as key habitat continues to deteriorate, the species will become increasingly vulnerable and threatened. Whole-landscape habitat conservation and restoration strategies are therefore needed to sustain superb parrot populations in the long-term. © 2007 The Authors.","Climate; Correlative mapping; Fragmentation; Generalized additive modelling; Landscape ecology; Migration; Parrot conservation; Plant productivity; Polytelis swainsonii; South-eastern Australia","abundance; bird; demographic trend; environmental effect; habitat conservation; landscape protection; migration; spatial variation; temporal variation; Australasia; Australia; Aves; Polytelis swainsonii; Psittacidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846450258

The cAMP receptor protein (CRP) controls the transcription of many catabolic genes. The availability of nitrogen is sensed by the PII protein at the level of intracellular glutamine. Glutamine is transported mainly by GlnHPQ, and synthesized by glutamine synthetase (GS) encoded by glnA. Previous studies suggest that CRP affects nitrogen assimilation. Here we showed that at least two mechanisms are involved. First, CRP activates glnH p1 via synergistic binding with sigma 70 RNA polymerase (E σ70) and represses glnH p2. As a consequence, in the presence of glutamine, the overall enhancement of glnHPQ expression alters GlnB signalling and de-activates glnA p2. Second, in vitro studies show that CRP can be recruited by sigma 54 holoenzyme (E σ54) to a site centred at -51.5 upstream of glnA p2. CRP-induced DNA-bending prevents the nitrogen regulation protein C (NtrC) activator from approaching the activator-accessible face of the promoter-bound E σ54 closed complex, and inhibits glnA p2. Therefore, as the major transcriptional effector of the 'glucose effect', CRP affects both the signal transduction pathway and the overall geometry of the transcriptional machinery of components of the nitrogen regulon. © 2007 Oxford University Press.",,"bacterial protein; carbon; cyclic AMP binding protein; glucose; glutamine; holoenzyme; nitrogen; nitrogen regulation protein C; nitrogen regulatory protein; RNA polymerase sigma 70; sigma factor RpoN; unclassified drug; article; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; carbon metabolism; complex formation; Escherichia coli; gene repression; genetic transcription; in vitro study; nitrogen fixation; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein analysis; protein binding; protein expression; protein function; protein protein interaction; protein purification; real time polymerase chain reaction; regulatory mechanism; regulon; signal transduction; Amino Acid Transport Systems, Basic; Carbon; Cyclic AMP; Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Gene Regulatory Networks; Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase; Glutamine; Nitrogen; Operon; PII Nitrogen Regulatory Proteins; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Sigma Factor; Trans-Activation (Genetics); Transcription Factors; Escherichia coli",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247146736

Methods: Thirty women undergoing first-trimester surgical abortion at the family planning clinics of a large hospital in Quebec City were randomized into a control group that received standard care and a hypnosis group that received, in addition to standard care, an intervention of hypnosis, including analgesia suggestions 20 min before and throughout the surgical procedure. Patients in both groups were given the option to control their pain with nitrous oxide (N2O) sedation administered through a nose mask as often and for as long as they wanted during the procedure. N2O sedation as the primary outcome was assessed at each step of the procedure. The patient's self-reported anxiety and pain were also assessed during the procedure as secondary outcomes. Results: Thirty-six percent of patients in the hypnosis group requested N2O sedation during the procedure versus 87% in the control group (p&lt;.01). No differences between the groups were found in reports of pain and anxiety during the procedure. Conclusion: These results suggest that hypnosis can be integrated into standard care and reduces the need for N2O in patients undergoing first-trimester surgical abortion. This reduction in N2O consumption did not lead to significant changes in pain or anxiety, and a larger sample size is required to assess the possible effects of hypnosis on those variables. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In spite of numerous biochemical studies, the precise localization of skeletal proteins has remained for a long time as an elusive goal. In this paper, we describe a technique for visualizing shell matrix proteins on the surface of calcium carbonate crystals or within the biominerals. The technique is as follows: freshly broken pieces of biominerals or NaOCl then EDTA-etched polished surfaces are incubated with an antibody elicited against one matrix protein, then with a secondary gold-coupled antibody. After silver enhancement, the samples are subsequently observed with scanning electron microscopy by using back-scattered electron mode. In the present case, the technique is applied to a particular example, the calcitic prisms that compose the outer shell layer of the mediterranean fan mussel Pinna nobilis. One major soluble protein, caspartin, which was identified recently, was partly de novo sequenced after enzymatic digestions. A polyclonal antibody raised against caspartin was used for its localization within and on the prisms. The immunogold localization indicated that caspartin surrounds the calcitic prisms, but is also dispersed within the biominerals. This example illustrates the deep impact of the technique on the definition of intracrystalline versus intercrystalline matrix proteins. Furthermore, it is an important tool for assigning a putative function to a matrix protein of interest. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Such an approach can serve as an alternative to using predetermined (measured) source profiles, as traditionally used in CMB applications, which are not always representative of the region and/or time period of interest. Constraints based on ranges of typical source profiles are used to ensure that the compositions identified are representative of sources and are less ambiguous than the factors/sources identified by typical factor analysis (FA) techniques. Gas-phase data (SO2, CO and NOy) are also used, as these data can assist in identifying sources. Impacts of identified sources are then quantified by minimizing the weighted-error between apportioned and measured levels of the fitting species. This technique was applied to a dataset of PM2.5 measurements at the former Atlanta Supersite (Jefferson Street site), to apportion PM2.5 mass into nine source categories. Good agreement is found when these source impacts are compared with those derived based on measured source profiles as well as those derived using a current FA technique, Positive Matrix Factorization. The proposed method can be used to assess the representativeness of measured source-profiles and to help identify those profiles that may be in significant error, as well as to quantify uncertainties in source-impact estimates, due in part to uncertainties in source compositions. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the Sydney urban area was used as the focus of the case study, the estimated impacts of changing freight vehicle operations across the urban area, via vehicle technologies, infrastructure improvements, logistic and land use changes are expected to be generally applicable to Australian cities and potentially applicable to cities elsewhere. This paper presents the results of a case study analysing and evaluating the impacts of a selection of greenhouse gas abatement measures on the emission and dispersion of benzene and 1,3-butadiene in Inner Sydney, the heart of the Sydney metropolitan area. The results discussed cover three demonstration days in February 1997, and are indicative of the type of policy measures that will produce the required reduction in pollution concentration for the air toxics. The results indicate that there were significant differences in the relative impacts of policies for different parts of the urban area. This is a useful finding since it suggests that specific policies could be targeted to give better air quality in places with significant health concerns such as high asthma, or areas with a greater proportion of the population vulnerable to respiratory conditions, such as children or the elderly.

The kerogen occurs in sedimentary rocks as clasts and clots deposited together with other detrital materials that are finely disseminated throughout a chert matrix. The bulk kerogen δ13C values range from -28.3 to -35.8‰. Solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy and FTIR spectroscopy reveals that the kerogen is highly aromatic (fa varying from 0.90 to 0.92) and contains only minor aliphatic carbon or carbon-oxygenated (C-O) functionalities. The Raman carbon first-order spectra for the isolated kerogens are typical of spectra obtained from disordered sp2 carbons with low 2-D ordering (biperiodic structure). The implications of the Raman results show low 2-D ordering throughout the carbonaceous network indicate the incorrect usage of the term graphite in the literature to describe the kerogen or carbonaceous material in the Warrawoona cherts. Hydropyrolysates contain aromatic compounds consisting of 1-ring to 7-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which were covalently bound into the kerogen as well as alkanes (linear, branched and cyclic) which were most probably trapped in the microporous network of the kerogen. These PAHs have mainly C1- and C2-alkylation while C3+-substitued aromatics are low in abundance and do not show a high degree of branched alkylation. For the first time we have shown a correlation between elemental analysis (H/C atomic ratios), Raman spectroscopic parameters (ID1/IG, ID1/(ID1 + IG), and La), and the degree of alkylation of bound polyaromatic molecular constituents generated from HyPy for Archaean kerogens. Similarities in molecular profiles exist between HyPy products of Strelley Pool Chert kerogens and an oil-window-mature Mesoproterozoic kerogen from Roper Group (ca. 1.45 Ga), which is biogenic in origin, suggesting that the Strelley Pool Chert kerogens may also be derived from diagenesis and thermal processing of biogenic organic matter. A combination of Raman spectroscopy, for identifying the least metamorphosed kerogens, used together with HyPy for liberating trapped and bound molecular components of these kerogens, offers a powerful strategy for assessing the origins of Earth's oldest preserved organic matter. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Measurement intensives were performed during 24 February-04 March 1999 and 05-21 June 2000, which corresponded to the climatological dry and wet seasons in South Florida, respectively. During these intensives, direct measurements of mercury dry-deposition were made using a newly developed surrogate water surface technique. These direct measurements were compared with modeled estimates of mercury dry-deposition to the site that were obtained through the use of an inferential or ""bigleaf"" model that was modified for use with speciated mercury. On-site measurements of ambient speciated mercury concentrations and numerous micrometeorological variables were used as input to the model. The average mercury dry-deposition measured during the 1999 FEDDS measurement intensive was 13.3±4.0 ng m-2 day-1, while the modeled deposition for this period was 3.4±2.3 ng m-2 day-1. The average mercury dry-deposition measured during the 2000 FEDDS measurement intensive was lower, 5.9±2.8 ng m-2 day-1, while the average modeled deposition for this period was 1.8±0.6 ng m-2 day-1. A least-squares linear regression suggests that the model was able to explain 74% and 73% of the variability in the datasets for the 1999 and 2000 FEDDS intensives, respectively. While reported reductions in total mercury emissions across South Florida between study periods could explain the reductions in both the measured and predicted mercury dry-deposition estimates, the increased presence of cumulus convection during the summer-intensive could have also resulted in a removal of reactive and particulate mercury species within the atmosphere of South Florida. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A large part of the Inuit population continues to depend on an untreated water supply, however. This traditional activity poses certain risks in a region with an abundant presence of migratory animals. Nunavik has also experienced significant climate warming since the beginning of the last decade. The main goal of this study, which took place in 2003 and 2004, was to evaluate drinking habits that may place Nunavik residents at an increased risk of gastroenteric diseases in the context of climate change. During the Amundsen cruise in fall 2004, we observed that raw water from the collection sites most frequently visited (brooks, lakes, rivers) was of good quality in most of the villages. Regular monitoring of these sites is necessary, however, and the public should be warned when the sites become contaminated. Of particular concern was the water from the individual storage containers, which was much more contaminated than the water at the collection sites. To develop or improve the climate change adaptation strategies in this area, we propose 1) establishing an appropriate environmental monitoring system, 2) improving wastewater disposal and municipal water systems, 3) involving nursing staff in microbiological testing of the water at community sites, 4) raising public awareness of the risks related to raw water consumption, and 5) gathering strategic health information during the periods of the year when cases of gastroenteric diseases are most frequent, in order to establish whether there is a link between these disorders and water quality. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Climate change; Drinking water; Gastroenteric diseases; Human health; Inuit; Nunavik","adaptation; climate change; climate conditions; disease incidence; drinking water; gastroenteritis; health risk; water quality; Canada; North America; Nunavik; Quebec [Canada]; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34347385685

Here, I examine the ability of climate variation to explain long-term changes in bird and plant populations, as well as trophic interactions in a high-elevation riparian system in central Arizona, USA, based on 20 years of study. Abundances of dominant deciduous trees have declined dramatically over the 20 years, correlated with a decline in overwinter snowfall. Snowfall can affect overwinter presence of elk, whose browsing can significantly impact deciduous tree abundance. Thus, climate may affect the plant community indirectly through effects on herbivores, but may also act directly by influencing water availability for plants. Seven species of birds were found to initiate earlier breeding associated with an increase in spring temperature across years. The advance in breeding time did not affect starvation of young or clutch size. Earlier breeding also did not increase the length of the breeding season for single-brooded species, but did for multi-brooded species. Yet, none of these phenology-related changes was associated with bird population trends. Climate had much larger consequences for these seven bird species by affecting trophic levels below (plants) and above (predators) the birds. In particular, the climate-related declines in deciduous vegetation led to decreased abundance of preferred bird habitat and increased nest predation rates. In addition, summer precipitation declined over time, and drier summers also were further associated with greater nest predation in all species. The net result was local extinction and severe population declines in some previously common bird species, whereas one species increased strongly in abundance, and two species did not show clear population changes. These data indicate that climate can alter ecosystem structure and function through complex pathways that include direct and indirect effects on abundances and interactions of multiple trophic components. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","Bird breeding phenology; Bird populations; Climate change; Ecosystem structure; Habitat selection; Nest predation; Plant populations; Riparian systems; Snowfall; Trophic interactions; Ungulate browsing","fresh water; abundance; bird; climate change; climate effect; deciduous tree; ecosystem structure; habitat selection; nest predation; plant community; ruminant; trophic interaction; ungulate; altitude; animal; article; Artiodactyla; bird; climate; ecosystem; feeding behavior; nesting; plant; population dynamics; reproduction; season; time; United States; weather; Altitude; Animals; Arizona; Artiodactyla; Birds; Climate; Ecosystem; Feeding Behavior; Fresh Water; Nesting Behavior; Plants; Population Dynamics; Reproduction; Seasons; Time Factors; Weather; Arizona; North America; United States; Aves; Ungulata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247164402

The boundary clays at both sites are not bounded by coals. Although coals consist mainly of organic matter derived from plant tissue, siliceous sedimentary rocks, such as shale and clay, may contain organic matter derived from microbiota as well as plants. Coals record δ13C values of plant-derived organic matter, reflecting the δ13C value of atmospheric CO2, whereas siliceous sedimentary rocks record the δ13C values of organic matter derived from plants and microbiota. The microbiota δ13C value reflects not only the δ13C value of atmospheric CO2, but also biological productivity. Therefore, the siliceous rocks from these sites yields information that differs from that obtained previously from coal beds. Across the freshwater K-T boundary at Brownie Butte, the δ13C values decrease by 2.6‰ (from - 26.15‰ below the boundary clay to - 28.78‰ above the boundary clay), similar to the trend in carbonate at marine K-T sites. This means that the organic δ13C values reflect the variation of δ13C of atmospheric CO2, which is in equilibrium with carbon isotopes at the ocean surface. Although a decrease in δ13C values is observed across the K-T boundary at Dogie Creek (from - 25.32‰ below the boundary clay to - 26.11‰ above the boundary clay), the degree of δ13C-decrease at Dogie Creek is smaller than that at Brownie Butte and that for marine carbonate. About 2‰ decrease in δ13C of atmospheric CO2 was expected from the δ13C variation of marine carbonate at the K-T boundary. This δ13C-decrease of atmospheric CO2 should affect the δ13C values of organic matter derived from plant tissue. As such a decrease in δ13C value was not observed at Dogie Creek, a process that compensates the δ13C-decrease of atmospheric CO2 should be involved. For example, the enhanced contribution of 13C-enriched organic matter derived from algae in a high-productivity environment could be responsible. The δ13C values of algal organic matter become higher than, and thus distinguishable from, those of plant organic matter in situations with high productivity, where dissolved HCO3- becomes an important carbon source, as well as dissolved CO2. As the δ13C-decrease of atmospheric CO2 reflected a reduction of marine productivity, the compensation of the δ13C decrease by the enhanced activity of the terrestrial microbiota means that the microbiota at freshwater environment recovered more rapidly than those in the marine environment. A distinct positive δ13C excursion of 2‰ in the K-T boundary clays is superimposed on the overall decreasing trend at Dogie Creek; this coincides with an increase in the content of organic carbon. We conclude that the K-T boundary clays include 13C-enriched organic matter derived from highly productive algae. Such a high biological productivity was induced by phenomena resulting from the K-T impact, such as nitrogen fertilization and/or eutrophication induced by enhanced sulfide formation. The high productivity recorded in the K-T boundary clays means that the freshwater environments (in contrast to marine environments) recovered rapidly enough to almost immediately (within 10 yr) respond to the impact-related environmental perturbations. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the catalyst for the O2 reduction at the cathode was formed by carbonizing hemoglobin, which could be abundantly and inexpensively obtained. A substantial enhancement of catalytic properties was achieved by a change in the carbonization process from one step to two steps. The PEFC using the carbonized hemoglobin formed in the modified carbonization process generated a high power comparable to those formed using a Pt-free cathode as reported already. The power densities of 0.11 and 0.16 W cm-2 were attained using H 2 and O2 gases at atmospheric pressure (H2 and O2 partial pressures, 54 kPa) and using pressurized gases (H 2 and O2 partial pressures, 254 kPa), respectively. The carbonization modification reduced the Fe valence state from 3+ to 2+ in the carbonized hemoglobin, which was demonstrated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The catalysis enhancement was probably attributed to the increase in Fe(II), which was required as an O2 bonding site in the first step of the multistep cathodic O2 reduction process. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbonization; Catalysis; Cathodes; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Reduction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Catalytic properties; Fuel cell cathodes; Valence states; Hemoglobin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249283395

In paired comparisons in a subset of kitchens in a single community before and after installation of an improved Patsari cookstove, 48-hour average kitchen concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were reduced by 66% (n = 32) and 67% (n = 33), respectively. Kitchens that had more elevated concentrations during the baseline measurements demonstrated more dramatic reductions, as the overall variability was reduced when the improved stove was used. Thus, the Patsari stove provides an effective means of reducing kitchen air pollution and potential benefits of installing these stoves are considerable.

Previous studies have suggested that MIBI shows very slow myocardial clearance after its initial uptake in an animal model, which is related to mitochondrial function. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that MIBI washout can be used to evaluate the severity of congestive heart failure in comparison to other clinical parameters in patients with cardiomyopathies. Methods and Results: After administration of MIBI, 61 patients with nonischemic congestive heart failure (49 with dilated cardiomyopathy and 12 with other cardiomyopathies) and 7 normal control subjects were examined by electrocardiography-gated myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography and planar data acquisition in the early and delayed phases (interval of 3 hours). Myocardial MIBI washout rates were calculated from the early and delayed planar images. Left ventricular function (systolic and diastolic) was analyzed by use of QGS data. Plasma levels of B-type natriuretic peptide and iodine 123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) parameters were also measured. Patients were followed up for a mean of 12 months (range, 1-19 months). As the severity of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class advanced, the washout rate of MIBI increased (21.6% ± 2.4% in those with NYHA class I [n = 23], 28% ± 4% in those with NYHA class II [n = 27], and 35% ± 5% in those with NYHA class III [n = 10]; P < .05, analysis of variance). The washout rate of MIBI was positively correlated with the level of B-type natriuretic peptide (r = 0.31, P < .05), end-diastolic volume (r = 0.396, P < .01), and end-systolic volume (r = 0.496, P < .01) and was negatively correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction (r = 0.523, P < .01), peak filling rate (r = 0.444, P < .01), and first-third ejection fraction (r = 0.414, P < .01). The parameters of MIBG scintigraphy were calculated as the heart-mediastinum count ratio (1.9 ± 3) and washout rate (38% ± 4%). We found a significant relationship between the washout rate of MIBI and the heart-mediastinum count ratio of MIBG (r = 0.51, P < .01). Patients with a higher washout rate of MIBI had a higher cardiac event rate (≥28%) than those with a lower washout rate (<28%) (P < .05). Conclusions: The myocardial washout rate of MIBI is thought to be a novel marker for the diagnosis of myocardial damage or dysfunction, providing prognostic information in patients with congestive heart failure. © 2007 American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.","congestive heart failure; Technetium 99m sestamibi; washout rate","angiotensin receptor antagonist; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; brain natriuretic peptide; digoxin; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; diuretic agent; methoxy isobutyl isonitrile technetium tc 99m; adult; aged; article; blood level; congestive cardiomyopathy; congestive heart failure; controlled study; disease severity; electrocardiography; female; follow up; heart left ventricle function; heart mitochondrion; heart muscle perfusion; human; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; major clinical study; male; mediastinum; priority journal; scintigraphy; scoring system; single photon emission computer tomography; Aged; Cardiomyopathies; Computer Simulation; Female; Gated Blood-Pool Imaging; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Male; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Middle Aged; Mitochondria, Heart; Models, Cardiovascular; Radiopharmaceuticals; Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947384177

It considers the uniform temperature of a surrounding surface giving off blackbody radiation, which results in the same energy gain of a human body given the prevailing radiation fluxes. This energy gain usually varies considerably in open space conditions. In this paper, the model 'RayMan', used for the calculation of short- and long-wave radiation fluxes on the human body, is presented. The model, which takes complex urban structures into account, is suitable for several applications in urban areas such as urban planning and street design. The final output of the model is, however, the calculated T mrt, which is required in the human energy balance model, and thus also for the assessment of the urban bioclimate, with the use of thermal indices such as predicted mean vote (PMV), physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) and standard effective temperature (SET*). The model has been developed based on the German VDI-Guidelines 3789, Part II (environmental meteorology, interactions between atmosphere and surfaces; calculation of short- and long-wave radiation) and VDI-3787 (environmental meteorology, methods for the human-biometeorological evaluation of climate and air quality for urban and regional planning.

This paper describes a statistical modelling approach, suggested as a policy tool in the Athens area for the assessment of the emissions reduction level required to meet the air quality standards for two criteria air pollutants, namely CO and NO2. Methods. More than ten years of hourly CO and NOx-NO2 concentration data measured by the monitoring network of the Hellenic Ministry for the Environment, Physical Planning and Public Works were analyzed and the original dataset has been reduced using a data evaluation procedure. Results and Discussion. Seasonal pollutant concentration trends suggested that the reduction of CO and NO x concentrations observed in the beginning of the '90s is almost entirely attributed to the increase of the catalyst-equipped cars during this period. The numerical parameters of an empirical model relating EU standard exceedances with mean annual concentrations were defined and the model was validated using datasets from years that were not used for the estimation of these parameters. This model was used in conjunction with a roll-back equation as a policy tool for the assessment of the effect of different CO and NO x emissions reduction scenarios on air quality standard compliance for CO and NO2. Results predicted with this empirical modelling approach were assessed with monitored data averaged over a 3-year period, giving satisfactory results. Conclusion. A methodology suggested for assessing the effects of different emissions reduction scenarios on air quality standard attainment was successfully applied for CO and NO2 in the Athens area. Recommendation and Perspective. The proposed methodology can provide a useful tool for the evaluation of policies already in progress as well as the development of future policies for emissions reduction in urban areas with similar characteristics, aiming at air quality standard compliance on a timely manner. Such a methodology could be applied in other urban areas of Greece characterized by dense traffic, therefore assisting the development of national policies in relation to air pollutants for which standard exceedances occur. © 2007 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).","Air quality standard attainment; Emission abatement policies; Roll-back model","air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon; concentration (composition); emission control; modeling; nitrogen dioxide; pollution effect; pollution monitoring; pollution policy; standard (reference); statistical analysis; urban area; Athens [Attica]; Attica; Eurasia; Europe; Greece; Southern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34147189507

Toads were exposed to 10 days of CH (10% O2) following which in vitro brainstem-spinal cord preparations, with the mid-brain attached, were used to examine central pH/CO2 chemosensitivity. A reduction in artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF) pH increased fictive breathing frequency (fR) and total fictive ventilation. CH reduced fictive fR and total fictive ventilation, compared to controls. Mid-brain transection caused an increase in fictive fR, at the lower aCSF pH levels, in both control and CH preparations. In the CH preparations, mid-brain transection restored fictive breathing to control levels. In both groups, mid-brain transection eliminated fictive breath clustering. The data indicate that CH attenuates central pH/CO2-sensitive fictive breathing but a mid-brain transection in the middle of the optic lobes abolishes this attenuation. The results suggest that CH induces inhibition of central pH/CO2 chemoreceptor function via descending inputs from the mid-brain region. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Such a multi-sector evaluation encompasses potential climate change effects, and mitigative actions within the agricultural and forestry (AF) sectors. In comparison with many of the other sectors covered by IAM, the AF sectors may require somewhat different treatment owing to their critical dependence upon spatially and temporally varying resource and climatic conditions. In particular, in large countries like the United States, forest production conditions vary dramatically across the landscape. For example, some areas in the southern United States present conditions favorable to production of fast-growing, heat-tolerant pine species, while more northern regions often favor slower-growing hardwood and softwood species. Moreover, some lands are currently not suitable for forest production (e.g., the arid western plains). Similarly, in agriculture, the United States has areas where citrus and cotton can be grown and other areas where barley and wheat are more suitable. This diversity across the landscape causes differential GHGE mitigation potential in the face of climatic changes and/or responses to policy or price incentives.It is difficult for a reasonably sized global IAM to reflect the full range of sub-national geographic AF production possibilities alluded to above. AF response in the face of climate change alterations in temperature precipitation regimes plus mitigation incentives will be likely to involve region-specific shifts in land use and agricultural/forest production. © Cambridge University Press 2007, Cambridge University Press, 2010.",,"Agriculture; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Timber; Climatic changes; Climatic conditions; Different treatments; Forest production; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Integrated assessment models; Northern regions; Precipitation regimes; Climate change",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052474990

Many other greenhouse gas emission reduction options require future technological development or must wait for turnover of capital stock. Carbon sequestration options in soils and forests, while ready to go now, generally have a finite life, allowing use until other strategies are developed. This paper reports on an investigation of the competitiveness of biological carbon sequestration from a dynamic and multiple strategy viewpoint. Key factors affecting the competitiveness of terrestrial mitigation options are land availability and cost effectiveness relative to other options including CO2 capture and storage, energy efficiency improvements, fuel switching, and non-CO2 greenhouse gas emission reductions. The analysis results show that, at lower CO2 prices and in the near term, soil carbon and other agricultural/forestry options can be important bridges to the future, initially providing a substantial portion of attainable reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions, but with a limited role in later years. At higher CO2 prices, afforestation and biofuels are more dominant among terrestrial options to offset greenhouse gas emissions. But in the longer run, allowing for capital stock turnover, options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the energy system and biofuels provide an increasing share of potential reductions in total US greenhouse gas emissions. © 2006 Springer Science + Business Media B.V.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Greenhouse effect; Soils; Afforestation; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Gas emissions; biofuel; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; energy efficiency; forest ecosystem; greenhouse gas; soil carbon; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846422686

There has been debate about the viability of using urban tree plantings in these markets. The main concern is whether or not urban planting projects can be cost effective options for investors. We compared the cost efficiency of four case studies located in Colorado, and used a model sensitivity analysis to determine what variables most influence cost effectiveness. We believe that some urban tree planting projects in specific locations may be cost effective investments. Our modeling results suggest that carbon assimilation rate, which is mainly a function of growing season length, has the largest influence on cost effectiveness, however resource managers can create more effective projects by minimizing costs, planting large-stature trees, and manipulating a host of other variables that affect energy usage. © 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

The objectives of the study were (1) to investigate spatial and temporal patterns in species composition, chlorophyll concentration, and primary productivity relative to seasonal patterns of water circulation; (2) to explore relationships between water column chemistry and the taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton; and (3) to determine effects of primary and secondary consumers on the phytoplankton assemblage. An analysis of 690 samples obtained on 50 sampling dates from 14 depths in the water column found a total of 163 phytoplankton taxa, 134 of which were identified to genus and 101 were identified to the species or variety level of classification. Dominant species by density or biovolume included Nitzschia gracilis, Stephanodiscus hantzschii, Ankistrodesmus spiralis, Mougeotia parvula, Dinobryon sertularia, Tribonema affine, Aphanocapsa delicatissima, Synechocystis sp., Gymnodinium inversum, and Peridinium inconspicuum. When the lake was thermally stratified in late summer, some of these species exhibited a stratified vertical distribution in the water column. A cluster analysis of these data also revealed a vertical stratification of the flora from the middle of the summer through the early fall. Multivariate test statistics indicated that there was a significant relationship between the species composition of the phytoplankton and a corresponding set of chemical variables measured for samples from the water column. In this case, concentrations of total phosphorus, ammonia, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and alkalinity were associated with interannual changes in the flora; whereas pH and concentrations of dissolved oxygen, orthophosphate, nitrate, and silicon were more closely related to spatial variation and thermal stratification. The maximum chlorophyll concentration when the lake was thermally stratified in August and September was usually between depths of 100 m and 120 m. In comparison, the depth of maximum primary production ranged from 60 m to 80 m at this time of year. Regression analysis detected a weak negative relationship between chlorophyll concentration and Secchi disk depth, a measure of lake transparency. However, interannual changes in chlorophyll concentration and the species composition of the phytoplankton could not be explained by the removal of the septic field near Rim Village or by patterns of upwelling from the deep lake. An alternative trophic hypothesis proposes that the productivity of Crater Lake is controlled primarily by long-term patterns of climatic change that regulate the supply of allochthonous nutrients. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Chlorophyll; Crater Lake; Phytoplankton; Primary productivity; Species composition","Biodiversity; Chlorophyll; Composition; Dissolution; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Plants (botany); Crater Lake; Phytoplankton; Primary productivity; Species composition; Lakes; chlorophyll; community composition; crater lake; dominance; hydrothermal circulation; phytoplankton; predator-prey interaction; primary production; spatiotemporal analysis; vertical distribution; water chemistry; water column; Crater Lake; North America; Oregon; United States; Ankistrodesmus spiralis; Aphanocapsa delicatissima; Dinobryon sertularia; Gymnodinium inversum; Mougeotia parvula; Nitzschia gracilis; Peridinium inconspicuum; Stephanodiscus hantzschii; Synechocystis; Synechocystis sp.; Tribonema affine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751501374

We examine the sensitivity of these two CO2-related parameters to climate change feedbacks within a coupled atmosphere-ocean model.

Although surface pH is projected to decrease relatively uniformly by about 0.3 by the year 2100, we find pH to be insensitive to climate change feedbacks, whereas Ωarag is buffered by ∼15%. Ocean carbonate chemistry creates a situation whereby the direct pH changes due to ocean warming are almost cancelled by the pH changes associated with dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations changes via a reduction in CO2 solubility from ocean warming. We show that the small climate change feedback on future surface ocean pH is independent to the amount of ocean warming. Our analysis therefore implies that future projections of surface ocean acidification only need to consider future atmospheric CO2 levels, not climate change induced modifications in the ocean. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard.",,"acidification; anthropogenic effect; atmosphere-ocean coupling; climate change; climate feedback; dissolved inorganic carbon; global warming; pH; seawater; solubility",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947430206

Four 5-HT3 antagonists are commercially available in the United States, and numerous reports have been published comparing 2 or more agents. The studies ranged from randomized, double-blinded to open-label or retrospective trials; included chemotherapy-naïve and -non-naïve patients; and covered a range of doses and routes of administration with and without concomitant steroids, for preventing and treating nausea and vomiting after highly and moderately high emetogenic chemotherapy. With few exceptions, the studies uniformly show an equivalent efficacy rate and side effect profile among the various agents at equivalent doses. This article reviews the pharmacology of the class for insight into minor differences among the agents that could possibly influence drug selection for certain patients, and considers data on the absorption, half-life, metabolism, and receptor activity. Clinical trials support the claim of various guidelines that the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are therapeutically similar in safety and efficacy, particularly because the current best practice for preventing nausea and vomiting after highly and moderately high emetogenic chemotherapy is a combination of a 5-HT3 antagonist, steroids, and aprepitant. © Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.","Chemotherapy; Dolasetron; Granisetron; Nausea; Ondansetron; Palonosetron; Vomiting","alpha 1 adrenergic receptor; antineoplastic agent; aprepitant; bleomycin; carbonyl reductase; cisplatin; corticosteroid; cytochrome P450 1A1; cytochrome P450 1A2; cytochrome P450 2D6; cytochrome P450 2E1; cytochrome P450 3A; cytochrome P450 3A4; delta opiate receptor; dexamethasone; dolasetron mesilate; etoposide; granisetron; hydrodolasetron; kappa opiate receptor; mu opiate receptor; muscarinic M2 receptor; ondansetron; palonosetron; serotonin 1A receptor; serotonin 1B receptor; serotonin 2A receptor; serotonin 2C receptor; serotonin 3 antagonist; steroid; article; binding affinity; blurred vision; chemotherapy induced emesis; clinical trial; constipation; controlled clinical trial; diarrhea; dizziness; dose response; drug absorption; drug activity; drug bioavailability; drug cost; drug efficacy; drug half life; drug metabolism; drug protein binding; drug safety; headache; human; hydroxylation; medical practice; meta analysis; monotherapy; multiple cycle treatment; nausea and vomiting; nonhuman; practice guideline; prophylaxis; randomized controlled trial; receptor binding; systematic review; testis cancer; treatment response",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846847899

These regions cover the eight Continental-Scale Experiments (CSEs) of the Global Energy and Water-cycle EXperiment (GEWEX) and encompass a broad variety of physical and dynamical meteorological processes. Gridded observations of the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and the Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC), as well as CEOP reference site precipitation observations are compared with the RSM simulated precipitation for the first half of the CEOP Enhanced Observation Period (EOP) III (October 2002 to March 2003). After estimating the uncertainty ranges of both the model and the observations, model deficiencies were obtained for almost all model domains in terms of the amount of simulated precipitation. Although the RSM is able to accurately simulate the seasonal evolution and spatial distribution of precipitation, the RSM has an almost uniform positive bias (i.e., RSM values are greater than observed values) over almost all the domains. Most of the positive bias is associated with convection in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) or monsoonal convection in Southeast Asia. Predicted stratiform precipitation is also excessive over areas of elevated topography. As the control simulations used a Relaxed Arakawa-Schubert scheme (RAS), sensitivity tests with three additional convection schemes were then carried out to assess whether the simulations could be improved. The additional convection schemes were: 1) the Simplified Arakawa-Schubert scheme (SAS); 2) the Kain-Fritsch scheme (KF); and 3) the National Centers for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model (CCM) scheme.

Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we investigated direct and indirect effects of climate variables, host-plant richness, and habitat diversity on butterfly species richness across Britain, at 20-km grid resolution. These factors were all important determinants of butterfly diversity, but their relative contributions differed between habitat generalists and specialists, and whether the effects were direct or indirect. Climate variables had strong effects on habitat generalists, whereas host-plant richness and habitat diversity contributed relatively more for habitat specialists. Considering total effects (direct and indirect together), climate variables had the strongest link to butterfly species richness for all groups of species. The results suggest that different mechanistic hypotheses to explain species richness may be more appropriate for habitat generalists and specialists, with generalists hypothesized to show direct physiological limitations and specialists additionally being constrained by trophic interactions (climate affecting host-plant richness). © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","Butterfly species richness; Direct and indirect climate effects; Habitat diversity; Host-plant richness","butterfly; climate effect; habitat quality; host plant; plant community; species diversity; species richness; animal; article; biodiversity; butterfly; climate; comparative study; ecosystem; physiology; population density; species difference; theoretical model; United Kingdom; Animals; Biodiversity; Butterflies; Climate; Ecosystem; Great Britain; Models, Theoretical; Population Density; Species Specificity; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247119831

Physical activity reduces CVD risk but climate impacts participation in physical activity. Canada has substantial climatic variation but its relation with physical activity is understudied. In this investigation, we evaluated the relation between seasonality and physical activity among Canadians. Methods: We used public domain data from the Canadian Community Health Survey, Cycle 2.2 (CCHS 2.2), a representative, cross-sectional sample of free-living Canadians in 2004. Leisure-time physical activity was measured using a modified version of the Physical Activity Monitor that was validated. Season was determined by the time of the interview, i.e., Winter: January 1 to March 31, Spring: April 1 to June 30, Summer: July 1 to September 30, and Fall: October 1 to December 31. In all multivariate models, we adjusted for age, sex, education, and income adequacy. Results: There were 20,197 persons aged 19 years and older in this analysis. In the winter, 64% of Canadians were inactive as compared with 49% in the summer. Total average daily energy expenditure was 31.0% higher in summer than winter after multivariate adjustment. Leisure-time physical activity was 86% more likely in the summer than winter (multivariate OR=1.86, 95% Cl 1.40, 2.45). The relation between seasonality and physical activity was weakest in Newfoundland and Labrador and stronger in Saskatchewan and British Columbia (p-value for interaction=0.02). Interpretation: Seasonality impacts physical activity patterns in Canada and varies across the provinces. This needs to be considered in physical activity programming.","Canada; Physical activity; Seasons",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447274504

Acetone droplets were injected in a steady laminar diffusion counterflow flame operating with methane. Planar laser-induced fluorescence measurements applied to OH radical and acetone was used to measure the spatial distribution of fuel vapour and the structure of the flame front around the droplet. High-magnification optics was used in order to image flow areas with a ratio of 1:1.2. The different combustion regimes of an isolated droplet could be observed from the configuration of the envelope flame to that of the boundary-layer flame, and occurrence of these regimes was found to depend on the droplet Reynolds number. Experimental results were compared with 1D numerical simulations using detailed chemistry for the configuration of the envelope flame. Good agreement was obtained for the radial profile of both OH radical and fuel vapour. Influence of droplet dynamics on the counterflow flame front was also investigated. Results show that the flame front could be strongly distorted by the droplet crossing. In particular, droplets with high velocity led to local extinction of the flame front whereas droplets with low velocity could ignite within the flame front and burn on the oxidiser side. © Springer-Verlag 2007.",,"Boundary ayer flames; Convective flow; Droplet crossing; High magnification optics; Acetone; Computer simulation; Diffusion; Fluorescence; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250655337

The modelling results are compared with the case of copper cathodes and with experimental data on vacuum arc erosion characteristics for graphite materials. A region of existence of a physically meaningful solution for self-sustained operation of the steady-state cathode spot is given in the electron temperature-cathode spot plasma pressure space. A solution domain comprised between Te ≈ 1.2-1.5 eV and p≈ 2-45 atm corresponding to carbon surface temperatures in the range 4200-4900 K is found. Values of the local heat flux to the cathode surface are evaluated in the range 1-20 × 1010 W m -2, and ratios of the various contributions to this flux and current density are given. Also given are the cathode spot radii and upper/lower limits for the erosion rate through vapourization, these being compared with experimental data. It is shown that the cathode spot pressure conditions can provide a mechanism for the control of macroparticle emission on carbon. This effect is used experimentally through cathode spot plasma confinement for the reduction of the microdroplet emission in arc sources used for diamondlike film deposition.

The contamination pattern at river mouth is established on the particulate material at different time scales: 1930-2000 for floodplain cores, 1980-2003 for suspended particulate matter (SPM) and bed-sediments, 1994-2003 for atmospheric fallout and annual flood deposits. The Seine has been among the most contaminated catchments with maximum contents recorded at 130 mg kg- 1 for Cd, 24 for Hg, 558 for Pb, 1620 for Zn, 347 for Cu, 275 for Cr and 150 for Ni. Today, the average levels for Cd (1.8 mg kg- 1), Hg (1.08), Pb (108), Zn (370), Cu (99), Cr (123) and Ni (31) are much lower but still in the upper 90% of the global scale distribution (Cr and Ni excepted) and well above the natural background values determined on pre-historical deposits. All metal contents have decreased at least since 1955/65, well before metal emission regulations that started in the mid 1970's and the metal monitoring in the catchment that started in the early 1980's. In the last 20 y, major criteria changes for the management of contaminated particulates (treated urban sludge, agricultural soils, dredged sediments) have occurred. In the mid 1990's, there was a complete shift in the contamination assessment scales, from sediment management and water usage criteria to the good ecological state, now required by the 2000 European Directive. When comparing excess metal outputs, associated to river SPM, to the average metal demand within the catchment from 1950 to 2000, the leakage ratios decrease exponentially from 1950 to 2000 for Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn, meanwhile, a general increase of the demand is observed: the rate of recycling and/or treatment of metals within the anthroposphere has been improved ten-fold. Hg environmental trajectory is very specific: there is a marked decontamination from 1970 to 2000, but the leakage ratio remains very high (10 to 20%) during this period. Drivers and Pressures are poorly known prior to 1985; State evolution since 1935 has been reconstructed from flood plain cores analysis; Impacts were maximum between 1950 and 1970 but remained unknown due to analytical limitation and lack of awareness.

The sluggish implementation of incentives for industrialised country companies to embark on CDM projects and low carbon prices led to a preference for just buying Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) instead of investing in projects. Thus a third option has gained prominence-the unilateral option where the project development is planned and financed within the developing country. We propose that a project should be called ""pure unilateral"" if it involves no foreign direct investment (FDI), only has the approval of the Designated National Authority (DNA) of the host country and sells its CERs after certification directly to an industrialised country. Unilateral projects can become attractive if the host country risk premium for foreign investors is high despite a high human, institutional and infrastructural capacity and domestic capital availability. Moreover, transaction costs can be reduced compared to foreign investments that have to overcome bureaucratic hurdles. On the other hand, technology transfer is likely to be lower, capacity building has to be undertaken by the host country and all risks have to be carried by host country entities. The potential to carry out unilateral CDM projects strongly varies among host countries. Whereas several countries from Asia and Latin America can design and implement projects autonomously, most of the Sub-Saharan countries rely on foreign support. International donors of capacity building grants should increasingly address those countries that are not presently focused on by foreign investors and support them in the design of local projects. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Clean Development Mechanism; Financing; Institutions; Project participants; Risk premium; Unilateral","capacity building; clean development mechanism; developing world; emission control; environmental economics; foreign direct investment; greenhouse gas; Africa; Asia; Eurasia; Latin America; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847680030

Urchin mortality of 100% was observed at pHw 6.16 after 7 days and coincided with a pronounced hypercapnia in the coelomic fluid producing an irrecoverable acidosis. Coelomic fluid acid-base measures showed that an accumulation of CO2 and a significant reduction in pH occurred in all treatments compared with controls. Bicarbonate buffering was employed in each case, reducing the resultant acidosis, but compensation was incomplete even under moderate environmental hypercapnia. Significant test dissolution was inferred from observable increases in the Mg2+ concentration of the coelomic fluid under all pH treatments. We show that a chronic reduction of surface water pH to below 7.5 would be severely detrimental to the acid-base balance of this predominantly intertidal species; despite its ability to tolerate fluctuations in pCO2 and pH in the rock pool environment. The absence of respiratory pigment (or any substantial protein in the coelomic fluid), a poor capacity for ionic regulation and dependency on a magnesium calcite test, make echinoids particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic acidification. Geological sequestration leaks may result in dramatic localised pH reductions, e.g. pH 5.8.

Sites were selected for the analysis to provide a range of plant functional type, climate, soil particle size distribution, and time series of data spanning a minimum of two growing seasons. Soil moisture trends revealed the importance of measuring water content at several depths throughout the rooting zone; soil moisture at the surface (0-10 cm) was approximately 20-30% less than that at 50-60 cm. A modified soil moisture dynamics model was used to generate soil moisture probability density functions at each site. Model calibration results demonstrated that the commonly used soil matric potential values for finding the vegetation stress point and field content may not be appropriate, particularly for vegetation adapted to a water-controlled environment. Projections of future soil moisture patterns suggest that two of the four sites will become severely stressed by climate change induced alterations to the precipitation regime. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We measured the above-canopy fluxes of momentum, sensible heat (H), CO2, and water vapor (Et), and the vertical profiles of CO2 and water vapor, from two 67-m meteorological towers in a selectively logged Brazilian rainforest. The logging removed ∼3.5 trees ha-1, and increased the incidence of gaps by a factor of 3 over nearby undisturbed forest. One tower was located in an intact patch of forest within the selectively logged area; the other was 400 m upwind in a large gap created by the logging. During daytime the subcanopy air in the intact patch of forest had more CO2, more water vapor, and was cooler than the air at comparable altitudes in the gap. Meanwhile, the daytime CO2 flux was less negative (reduced CO2 uptake) above the gap than above the intact forest, the daytime Et was greater above the gap than the intact forest, and the daytime H was lower above the gap than the intact forest. These patterns cannot be explained fully by the local loss of canopy gas exchange in the gap, but are consistent with the horizontal transport into the gap, and subsequent vertical transport out of the gap, of high-CO2, humid, cool air from the forest understory. The understory was drier and warmer during daytime after the logging, which would be expected to increase flammability. Further measurement and modeling efforts are needed to better understand the effect of canopy gaps on the local CO2 and energy exchange, as well as the flux footprint. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This article reviews the implications of climate change for insurers and provides specific examples of insurance-relevant synergisms between adaptation and mitigation in the buildings and energy sectors, agriculture, forestry, and land use. Although insurance is far from a ""silver bullet"" in addressing climate change, it offers significant capacity and ability to understand, manage, and spread risks associated with weather-related events, more so today in industrialized countries but increasingly so in developing countries and economies in transition. Certain measures that integrate climate change mitigation and adaptation also bolster insurers' solvency and profitability, thereby increasing their appeal. Promising strategies involve innovative products and systems for delivering insurance and the use of new technologies and practices that both reduce vulnerability to disaster-related losses and support sustainable development. However, climate change promises to erode the insurability of many risks, and insurance responses can be more reactive than proactive, resulting in compromised insurance affordability and/or availability.

Yet in experiential terms, community-based natural resource management implementation falls short of expectations in many cases. In this paper, we investigate the asymmetry between community capacity and the Land Use Land Use Change Forestry (LULUCF) provisions of the Clean Development Mechanism within community forests in Cameroon. We use relevant aspects of the Clean Development Mechanism criteria and notions of ""community capacity"" to elucidate determinants of community capacity needed for CDM implementation within community forests. The main requirements are for community capacity to handle issues of additionality, acceptability, externalities, certification, and community organisation. These community capacity requirements are further used to interpret empirically derived insights on two community forestry cases in Cameroon. While local variations were observed for capacity requirements in each case, community capacity was generally found to be insufficient for meaningful uptake and implementation of Clean Development Mechanism projects. Implications for understanding factors that could inhibit or enhance community capacity for project development are discussed.

In this paper we examine the compatibility between forestry and related policy provisions in Cameroon and the CDM provisions for Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF). For each CDM requirement such as eligibility, additionality, impact assessment and sustainable development, relevant national forestry policy questions are identified. These relevant policy questions are applied to community forestry policy instruments in Cameroon to analyse the likelihood that they can enhance or inhibit the uptake and implementation of biosphere carbon projects. We found that choosing a single crown cover value (from between 10 and 30%) presented a serious dilemma for Cameroon given its diverse vegetation cover. Adopting any single value within this range is unlikely to optimize national carbon management potential. The current forest institutional and regulatory policy framework in Cameroon is inadequate for promoting carbon forestry under current CDM rules. We conclude that national policy in Cameroon would need to recognise the need for and adopt a pro-active approach for biosphere carbon management, engaging in institutional development, integrated planning, project development support and providing adequate regulatory frameworks to enhance sustainable development through CDM projects. The need for CDM/Kyoto capacity building support for proactive national and local policy development is highlighted. © 2007.","Cameroon; Clean Development Mechanism; Community forestry; Land use, land use change and forestry; Policy instruments","carbon; article; biosphere; Cameroon; environmental impact assessment; environmental planning; forest management; government regulation; land use; policy; priority journal; sustainable development; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047208570

In this study, field soil data are used to calculate the flood mitigation benefits of wetland soils within the Momoge National Nature Reserve, Jilin Province, the People's Republic of China. Calculations are based upon environmental economic assessment methods and GIS techniques. The estimated flood mitigation capacity of wetland soils within the Momoge Reserve was 7.15 × 104 m3/hm2/yr. This translated into an economic benefit of 5700 $/hm2/yr due to flood mitigation. Spatial differences in the flood mitigation ability of soils were observed across the Momoge wetlands. Benefits associated with flood mitigation were highest within the middle reaches of the Momoge wetlands and least in the East. This quantitative analysis of flood mitigation benefit, with its investigation of wetland soils, will be a useful reference both for the assessment of wetland values in the local region and also for the greater understanding wetland function and value assessment methods. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We examined how CO2 enrichment (+200 μL CO2/L air differential) affects forest succession through growth and survivorship of tree seedlings, as part of the Duke Forest free-air CO 2 enrichment (FACE) experiment in North Carolina, USA. We planted 2352 seedlings of 14 species in the low light forest understory and determined effects of elevated CO2 on individual plant growth, survival, and total sample biomass accumulation, an integrator of plant growth and survivorship over time, for six years. We used a hierarchical Bayes framework to accommodate the uncertainty associated with the availability of light and the variability in growth among individual plants. We found that most species did not exhibit strong responses to CO2. Ulmus alata (+21%), Quercus alba (+9.5%), and nitrogen-fixing Robinia pseudoacacia (+230%) exhibited greater mean annual relative growth rates under elevated CO2 than under ambient conditions. The effects of CO2 were small relative to variability within populations; however, some species grew better under low light conditions when exposed to elevated CO2 than they did under ambient conditions. These species include shade-intolerant Liriodendron tulipifera and Liquidambar styraciflua, intermediate-tolerant Quercus velutina, and shade-tolerant Acer barbatum, A. rubrum, Prunus serotina, Ulmus alata, and Cercis canadensis. Contrary to our expectation, shade-intolerant trees did not survive better with CO2 enrichment, and population-scale responses to CO2 were influenced by survival probabilities in low light. CO 2 enrichment did not increase rates of sample biomass accumulation for most species, but it did stimulate biomass growth of shade-tolerant taxa, particularly Acer barbatum and Ulmus alata.

Modifying additives provide increase of thermal stability of porous structure of both highly dispersed Al2O3, as the second support, and the catalyst as a whole. Contribution of La2O3 and CeO2 in increasing the thermal stability is of an additive nature, and lanthanum oxide shows the higher efficiency than cerium one. According to X-ray phase analysis data, stabilizing action is conditioned by occurrence of rare-earth element oxides into lattice of Al2O3, which retards diffusional processes leading to phase transitions of low-temperature crystalline modifications of alumina into high-temperature ones with a low specific surface. For the catalyst samples modified with La2O3 an effect of thermal activation is observed, which is revealed by increase in catalytic activity as a result of annealing at 850 °C. Such a phenomenon, as shown by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy technique, can be explained via stabilization of palladium in singly charged state in the form of groups of Pd+O2- and corresponding increase in concentration of active centers. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The long-term water temperature was related to climate variability by means of a multivariate regression model. Results revealed atmospheric connections that have been elusive so far, and showed that over the period from 1959 to 2000, summer thermal conditions in Lake Geneva appear tightly linked to the long-term variability of the subtropical Atlantic climate. The multivariate model revealed high skills and tight correlations, which suggest the possibility of assessing future thermal changes in Lake Geneva from the Atlantic climate variability. The implications of such climatic forcing on the functioning of the pelagic ecosystem in Lake Geneva were illustrated by analysing the long-term changes in abundance of the summer-dominant carnivorous cladocerans Bythotrephes longimanus and Leptodora kindtii during the period 1974 to 2000. Again, the multivariate model revealed high skills and excellent correlations between the interannual changes in abundance of these species and the variability of summer climate.

We investigated core-top and prebomb sediment intervals at sites from the flanks and depocenters of the basins deposited under contrasting bottom water oxygen concentrations. Bulk organic matter generally has the lowest radiocarbon levels of all sediment constituents measured, whereas planktic foraminifera tend to be the most radiocarbon enriched. Alkenones are systematically depleted in radiocarbon with respect to foraminifera. Short-chain (C14, C16, C18) fatty acids decrease rapidly in absolute abundance and relative to longer-chain (&gt;C24) homologues from core-top to prebomb samples. The loss of short-chain fatty acids with depth is associated with 13C depletion of short-chain fatty acids, indicating preferential preservation of terrestrially derived fatty acids. Short-chain fatty acids tend to be more 14C-enriched relative to alkenones in core-top sediments, whereas longer-chain homologues are generally the most radiocarbon depleted of the lipids studied here. Less refractory compounds (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) are thus enriched in radiocarbon with respect to more recalcitrant biomarkers (alkenones, long-chain fatty acids). The lower 14C content of more refractory compounds reflects a larger proportion of laterally supplied, preaged material. Greater preservation of labile organic compounds observed at the depocenters than in flank sediments results in the presence of ""younger"" biomarkers, underlining the important influence of selective degradation of labile compounds on their radiocarbon ages. © 2007, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.",,"carbon isotope; diagenesis; fatty acid; organic matter; phytoplankton; planktonic foraminifera; sediment analysis; sediment chemistry; total organic carbon; vascular plant; California; North America; Pacific Ocean; Santa Barbara Basin; Santa Monica Basin; United States; Foraminifera; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250860615

New technologies, regulatory regimes, management styles, marketing strategies and environmental priorities have emerged, dramatically reconfiguring patterns of governance within cities and regions. This is particularly obvious in the city region of Berlin, where utility restructuring coincides with a dramatic fiscal crisis in the city. The privatization of the energy utilities and of many public services, the opening of the regional energy markets, public and private climate protection initiatives and the emergence of new market participants are radically changing the conditions of regional governance and energy planning. However, although substantial recasting of policy issues and traditional forms of governance in the energy sector is underway in Berlin, energy management is confronted with severe institutional problems of interpolicy coordination and regional cooperation, entrepreneurial governance and contract management. Thus, this article argues in favour of new policy approaches and institutional reforms to shape the development of energy networks according to local and regional sustainability needs. © 2007 The Authors.

In this paper, we show how information about the range of spatial autocorrelation can be used in a measurement scheme to reduce the size of the confidence intervals that bound estimates of the mean number of C-credits generated per hectare. A tighter confidence interval around the mean number of C-credits sequestered could increase producer payments for each hectare enrolled in a contract to supply C-credits. An empirical application to dry land cropping systems in three regions of Montana shows that information about the spatial autocorrelation exhibited by soil C could be extremely valuable for reducing transactions costs associated with contracts for C-credits but the benefits are not uniform across all regions or cropping systems. Accounting for spatial autocorrelation greatly reduced the standard errors and narrowed the confidence intervals associated with sample estimates of the mean number of C-credits produced per hectare. For the payment mechanism considered in this paper, tighter confidence intervals around the mean number of C-credits created per hectare enrolled could increase producer payments by more than 100 percent under a C-contract. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Measurement scheme; Soil carbon; Spatial autocorrelation; Standard errors; Carbon; Correlation methods; Costs; Error analysis; Soils; autocorrelation; carbon sequestration; error analysis; measurement method; soil carbon; transaction cost; Montana; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846413902

Predictions for the extent of these range shifts are frequently based on 'climate envelope' approaches, which often oversimplify species responses because many do not consider interactions between physical and biological factors. The local persistence of some species, however, is likely to be strongly modulated by microhabitat-forming organisms. Using congeneric patellid gastropods with northern/ boreal and southern/lusitanian distributions, we have demonstrated how the loss of habitat-forming macroalgal species could modify species responses to climate change. The northern limpet Patella vulgata preferentially aggregates beneath Fucus spp. When Fucus vesiculosus was experimentally removed, to simulate a decline in macroalgal abundance in response to climatic warming, P. vulgata suffered increased mortality or relocated home scars, often to nearby Fucus spp. patches. In contrast, the southern limpet P. depressa did not aggregate beneath Fucus spp. and showed no response in terms of movement or mortality to the loss of F. vesiculosus. Based on these results, we predict that the loss of Fucus spp. will influence the relative abundance of these 2 limpet species, particularly at the distributional limit of Fucus spp. In addition, differences in the aggregative behaviour of these limpet species will result in changes in the spatial distribution of grazing in the intertidal, with likely consequences for community dynamics. These outcomes could not be anticipated from predictions based on direct responses to temperature alone, highlighting the need for biotic and abiotic factors to be incorporated into predictions of species responses to climate change. © Inter-Research 2007.","Biological interactions; Biologically generated habitat; Climate change; Climate envelope; Limpets; Macroalgae","aggregation behavior; behavioral response; brown alga; climate change; community dynamics; ecological modeling; gastropod; grazing; habitat restoration; mortality; movement; persistence; population distribution; relative abundance; remediation; warming; Fucus; Fucus vesiculosus; Gastropoda; Patella (gastropod); Patella depressa; Patella vulgata; Patellidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247483555

We used helioseismic holography to image the source of seismic waves emitted into the solar interior from the site of the flare. Acoustic egression power maps at 3 and 6 mHz with a 2-mHz bandpass reveal a compact acoustic source strongly correlated with impulsive hard X-ray and visiblecontinuum emission along the penumbral neutral line separating the two major opposing umbrae in the δ-configuration sunspot that predominates AR10720. At 6 mHz the seismic source has two components, an intense, compact kernel located on the penumbral neutral line of the δ-configuration sunspot that predominates AR10720, and a significantly more diffuse signature distributed along the neutral line up to ∼15 Mm east and ∼30 Mm west of the kernel. The acoustic emission signatures were directly aligned with both hard X-ray and visible continuum emission that emanated during the flare. The visible continuum emission is estimated at 2.0 × 1023 J, approximately 500 times the seismic emission of ∼4 × 1020 J. The flare of 2005 January 15 exhibits the same close spatial alignment between the sources of the seismic emission and impulsive visible continuum emission as previous flares, reinforcing the hypothesis that the acoustic emission may be driven by heating of the low photosphere. However, it is a major exception in that there was no signature to indicate the inclusion of protons in the particle beams thought to supply the energy radiated by the flare. The continued strong coincidence between the sources of seismic emission and impulsive visible continuum emission in the case of a proton-deficient white-lightflare lends substantial support to the 'back-warming' hypothesis, that the low photosphere is significantly heated by intense Balmer and Paschen continuum-edge radiation from the overlying chromosphere in white-light flares. © 2006 RAS.","Sun: flares; Sun: helioseismology; Sun: oscillations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846168428

The analysis of the sucrose-gradient-fractionated in vitro translated AhR complexes revealed that CHIP can mediate hsp90 ubiquitination while cooperating with unidentified factors to promote the ubiquitination of mature unliganded AhR complexes. In addition, the immunophilin-like protein XAP2 was able to partially protect the AhR from CHIP-mediated ubiquitination in vitro. This protection required the direct interaction of the XAP2 with the AhR complex. Surprisingly, CHIP silencing in Hepa-1c1c7 cells by siRNA methods did not reveal the function of CHIP in the AhR complex, because it did not affect well-characterized activities of the AhR nor affect its steady-state protein levels. However, the presence of potential compensatory mechanisms may be confounding this particular observation. Our results suggest a model where the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP cooperates with other ubiquitination factors to remodel native AhR-hsp90 complexes and where co-chaperones such as the XAP2 may affect the ability of CHIP to target AhR complexes for ubiquitination. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhR); Carboxyl terminus; Cellular adaptation; Environmental pollutants; Complexation; Enzymes; Hydrocarbons; Impurities; Mathematical models; Toxicity; Proteins; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; heat shock cognate protein 70; heat shock protein 90; hepatitis B virus X protein; immunophilin; protein CHIP; protein XAP2; small interfering RNA; ubiquitin protein ligase E3; unclassified drug; animal cell; article; carboxy terminal sequence; cell strain; complex formation; controlled study; human; human cell; in vitro study; mouse; nonhuman; pollutant; priority journal; protein function; regulatory mechanism; RNA interference; sucrose gradient; ubiquitination; Animals; Base Sequence; Cell Line; DNA Primers; Gene Silencing; HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins; Humans; Mice; Multiprotein Complexes; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Recombinant Proteins; RNA, Small Interfering; Ubiquitin; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846213538

Programs have attempted to address problems ranging from climate change and energy efficiency, to more localized air and water pollution problems. But do they work? Despite a growing theoretical literature, there is limited empirical evidence on their success or the situations most conducive to the approaches. Even less is known about their cost-effectiveness. Getting credible answers is important. Research to date has been largely limited to individual programs. This innovative book seeks to clarify what is known by looking at a range of program types, including different approaches adopted in different nations. The focus is on assessing actual performance via seven case studies, including the U.S. Climate Wise program, the U.S. EPA's 33/50 program on toxic chemicals, the U.K. Climate Change Agreements, and the Keidanren Voluntary Action Plan in Japan. The central goals of Reality Check are understanding outcomes and, more specifically, the relationship between outcomes and design. By including in-depth analyses by experts from the U.S., Europe, and Japan, the book advances scholarship and provides practical information for the future design of voluntary programs to stakeholders and policymakers on all sides of the Atlantic and Pacific. © 2007 by Resources for the Future.

The meeting was the eighth in a series of transatlantic conferences first held in Penarth, Wales, at the Medical Research Council Pneumoconiosis Unit (1979), that have fostered long-standing collaborations between researchers in the fields of mineralogy, cell and molecular biology, pathology, toxicology, and environmental/occupational health. Results: The goal of this meeting, which was largely supported by a conference grant from the NHLBI, was to assemble a group of clinical and basic research scientists who presented and discussed new data on the mechanistic effects of inhaled particulates on the onset and development of morbidity and mortality in the lung and cardiovascular system. Another outcome of the meeting was the elucidation of a number of host susceptibility factors implicated in adverse health effects associated with inhaled pathogenic particulates. Conclusion: New models and data presented supported the paradigm that both genetic and environmental (and occupational) factors affect disease outcomes from inhaled particulates as well as cardiopulmonary responses. These future studies are encouraged to allow the design of appropriate strategies for prevention and treatment of particulate-associated morbidity and mortality, especially in susceptible populations. © 2007 Mossman et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"antioxidant; asbestos; carbon; chromium; cigarette smoke; hydrocarbon; metallothionein; nanomaterial; nanoparticle; nickel; protein p53; reactive oxygen metabolite; silicon dioxide; transforming growth factor beta1; tumor suppressor protein; vanadium pentoxide; air pollution; airborne particle; article; asbestosis; cardiovascular disease; cigarette smoking; clinical research; cooperation; cytology; environmental factor; environmental health; environmental protection; exhaust gas; health care planning; heredity; host susceptibility; human; inhalation; lung carcinoma; lung disease; mineralogy; molecular biology; morbidity; mortality; nanotechnology; occupational exposure; occupational health; outcome assessment; oxidative stress; particle size; particulate matter; pathology; pathophysiology; priority journal; symposium; toxicology; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34347373485

Such 'composite' emitters are of interest for both fundamental and technological reasons, and can also be used to simulate low-macroscopic-field emission from flat thin-film emitters. This paper reviews the long-standing work aimed at characterizing and optimizing emitters of this kind, which are sometimes called 'M-I-V or 'C-D-V emitters. The coating materials investigated include several types of epoxylite resins, hydrocarbons, alumina, lacomit, plastics, zinc oxide, magnesium oxide, zirconium carbide and tetracyanoethylene. High-resolution electron microscopy was used to monitor the profile of the tip and to measure the coating thickness. The FE emission properties of these composite emitters were studied using both conventional field electron microscope (FEM) techniques and high-resolution FE spectroscopy techniques based on the use of a retarding potential energy analyser. There are common themes to the behaviour of these composite emitters. Characteristic emission properties include: an initial switch-on effect at threshold barrier fields of order 109 V/m; a subsequent I-V characteristic that gives linear Fowler-Nordheim (FN) plots at low fields of &lt;108 V/m, but saturates at higher fields and may exhibit hysteresis; and an energy distribution with a width and shift that are field-dependent. The coatings can give rise to single-spot emission images, attributed to the formation of a conducting channel in the dielectric. In general, the emission stability is improved, as compared with an uncoated cathode. In the case of carbon-fibre cathodes, an optimum coating thickness of 0.2-0.3 μm has been found. Current-dependent peak shifts of up to 1 eV have been observed in the energy spectra. Surprisingly, these peak shifts are comparable with those found for uncoated carbon fibres and also for the resincoated tungsten emitters. Their origin is not clear, but it seems that resistive drop cannot provide the whole explanation. These peak shifts may be related to the dynamics of surface-state occupation at the material/vacuum interface.

It is shown that ABOP reproduces the underlying orthogonal tight-binding model accurately for both hydrocarbon molecules and carbon crystalline phases in their ground-state configurations. However, in order to reproduce also non-equilibrium configurations it is necessary to extend the σ bond-order expression to account for the non-negligible sp atomic energy level separation of carbon. While the Brenner hydrocarbon potential exhibits several deficiencies in the description of amorphous hydrocarbon films, the extended ABOP model comes closer to results of accurate non-orthogonal tight-binding calculations. Remaining discrepancies of ABOP can be traced back to the limitations of the underlying orthogonal tight-binding model and its parameterization. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The city of Cape Town (South Africa) is at risk from projected climate-induced warming and changes in rainfall variability. This makes resource management and infrastructure planning more challenging and increases the urgency of the need to adapt city-level operations to both current climate variability and future climate change. To date, however, the main focus of adaptation planning has been at the nationallevel, and has not adequately addressed municipal-scale adaptation. This paper presents and discusses an overarching framework that would facilitate the development of a Municipal Adaptation Plan (MAP).

Nevertheless, strikingly different perspectives persist about the significance of fires in the tropics to environmental changes and human well-being and consequently how they should be managed. Our synthesis of papers in this special issue suggests both trade-offs and complementarities in various policy responses with differing objectives. There are, however, at least three domains with high potential of meeting multiple objectives. First, is through identification, and improved management, of ecosystems vulnerable to fire under current and future climate. Agriculture, forestry and human settlements on peat land areas in Indonesia are candidates for such a focus. Second, is through building adaptive capacities to manage fire and related land and water resources. Investments in capacity at multiple levels are needed, but particularly at fairly local levels where stakeholders have strong incentives to manage fires appropriate to local contexts. Third, is through building awareness that fire management does not universally equate to fire suppression. Severe smoke haze episodes, for example, are also a result of timing of fires, and some fire-adapted ecosystems may depend on fire to persist.

The average fraction of carbonaceous material in the stratospheric particles decreased rapidly above the tropopause. The decrease in the average carbon content was mostly associated with a sharp increase in the bottom 2 km of the stratosphere in the frequency of fairly pure sulfate particles both with or without meteoric metals. The low potassium content of the fairly pure sulfate particles is used to show that they were formed in the stratosphere and were not tropospheric particles that had lost organics because of oxidation. Of the tropospheric carbonaceous-sulfate particles found in the stratosphere, the mass spectra had similar patterns from the upper troposphere to the maximum altitude sampled, about 19 km. A reduction in the carbon to sulfate ratio in tropospheric particles was only apparent above about 440 K potential temperature. This implies that carbon compounds can remain for months in particles larger than about 300 nm. Despite the slow rate, these data do not exclude rapid heterogeneous reactions of organics in the particles with OH or other radicals. There was no evidence of significant transfer of semivolatile organics between particles in the stratosphere. However, particles that originated in the stratosphere acquired small amount of carbon when they were transported to the tropopause.

Integrated strategy-making and implementation in the agricultural sector to reduce the risks posed by climate change requires the consideration of multiple, interdisciplinary factors and the sensitivities of their interrelationships. Lack of information on the sensitivity of agricultural activities to climate change in Africa hampers climate change adaptation research on the region. In water scarce South Africa, the growth of the agricultural sector is threatened by projected decreases in water availability due to climate change. This paper shows how Bayesian networks may be used to facilitate cross-disciplinary participation in elucidating these sensitivities. Bayesian networks provide a graphical framework for mixing quantitative and qualitative information and can be characterised using information associated with varying degrees of uncertainty. This enables a variety of domain experts to test key driver-response interactions through sensitivity analysis and enables visualisation of the complex inter-relationships between inter-disciplinary variables resulting from the impacts of climate change scenarios on South African agriculture. The ability to represent the sensitivities between key variables for which varying degrees of data-scarcity and uncertainty occur provides agricultural sector researchers with a facilitation tool that may helps visualise and formulate climate change mitigation strategies. The results presented here illustrates the extreme sensitivity of water-scarce South African agricultural sector to projected climate change impacts and provides a framework in which tradeoffs between activities can be preliminarily assessed in strategy-making for adaptation.","Bayesian approach; Climate change adaptation; Water utilization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74349097341

These precipitates include aragonite, low- and high-Mg calcite, and dolomite. The carbon isotopic composition of carbonates varies widely, ranging from -60‰ to +26‰, indicating complex carbon sources that include 13C-depleted microbial and thermogenic methane and residual, 13C-enriched, bicarbonate. A similarly large variability of δ18O values (-5.5‰ to +8.9‰) demonstrates the geochemical complexity of these sites, with some samples pointing toward an 18O-enriched oxygen source possibly related to advection of 18O-enriched formation water or to the decomposition of gas hydrate. Samples depleted in 18O are consistent with formation deeper in the sediment or mixing of pore fluids with meteoric water during carbonate precipitation. A wide range of isotopic and mineralogical variation in authigenic carbonate composition within individual study areas but common trends across multiple geographic areas suggest that these parameters alone are not indicative for certain tectonic or geochemical settings. Rather, the observed variations probably reflect local controls on the flux of carbon and other reduced ions, such as faults, fluid conduits, the presence or absence of gas hydrate in the sediment, and the temporal evolution of the local carbon reservoir. Areas with seafloor carbonates that indicate formation at greater depth below the sediment-water interface must have undergone uplift and erosion in the past or are still being uplifted. Consequently, the occurrence of carbonate slabs on the seafloor in areas of active hydrocarbon seepage is commonly an indicator of exhumation following carbonate precipitation in the shallow subsurface. Therefore, careful petrographic and geochemical analyses are critical components necessary for the correct interpretation of processes related to hydrocarbon seepage in continental margin environments and elsewhere. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The products and services that grassland ecosystems can provide society are detailed. Existing agro-policies are reviewed as to how they reflect social demands on grasslands. A farm level analysis considers many factors that may influence the fulfilment of social demands. Conclusions are drawn on the future of grassland use under different socioeconomic conditions. Traditional (meat, milk, fibre, medicinal plants, fuel and power) and non-traditional (branded products, biodiversity as gene pool and biomass for energy) products are identified. Services of grasslands are summarized at three different levels viz. globally (regulation of climate, air quality, water resources, soil health, carbon sequestration and maintaining biodiversity), regionally (aesthetic and landscape values) and locally (preservation of cultural heritage and maintenance of the significance of religion for pastoralism). Targeted policies are emerging that assist in sustaining healthy grassland ecosystems and fulfilling multifunctional demands at different social levels. In spite of these policies, the future of the world's grasslands seems to vary by country, according to the level of development. In poor countries, production from grassland will remain of vital importance (in some cases, with the threat of ecosystem degradation), while at the same time, ecological and amenity uses of grassland appear to be ignored. Trends in the function of grassland ecosystems in developed countries seem to be just the opposite. The importance of production is declining, while ecological and amenity functions receive increasing attention in response to multifunctional and social demands. © CABI Publishing 2007.","Agricultural policy; Grasslands; Multifunctionality; Products and services; Rural development; Social demands",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891720435

We investigate the sensitivity of direct radiative forcing due to tropospheric ozone and aerosols (carbonaceous and sulfate) to a marginal reduction in their (or their precursor) emissions from major biomass burning regions. We find that the largest negative global forcing is for 10% emission reductions in tropical regions, including Africa (-4.1 mVm-2 from gas and -4.1 mVm-2 from aerosols), and South America (-3.0 mVm-2 from gas and -2.8 mVm-2 from aerosols). We estimate that a unit reduction in the amount of biomass burned in India produces the largest negative ozone and aerosol forcing. Our analysis indicates that reducing biomass burning emissions causes negative global radiative forcing due to ozone and aerosols; however, regional differences need to be considered when evaluating controls on biomass burning to mitigate global climate change.

Using Pxr-/- mice, we have now investigated the PXR-mediated repression of lipid metabolism in the fasting livers. Treatment with PXR activator pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile (PCN) down-regulated the mRNA levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (in β-oxidation) and mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate-CoA synthase 2 (in ketogenesis) in wild-type (Pxr+/+) mice only. In contrast, the stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (in lipogenesis) mRNA was up-regulated in the PCN-treated Pxr+/+ mice. Reflecting these up- and down-regulations and consistent with decreased energy metabolism, the levels of hepatic triglycerides and of serum 3-hydroxybutylate were increased and decreased, respectively, in the PCN-treated Pxr+/+ mice. Using gel shift, glutathione S-transferase pull-down and cell-based reporter assays, we then examined whether PXR could cross-talk with the insulin response forkhead factor FoxA2 to repress the transcription of the Cpt1a and Hmgcs2 genes, because FoxA2 activates these genes in fasting liver. PXR directly bound to FoxA2 and repressed its activation of the Cpt1a and Hmgcs2 promoters. Moreover, ChIP assays showed that PCN treatment attenuated the binding of FoxA2 to these promoters in fasting Pxr+/+ but not Pxr-/- mice. These results are consistent with the conclusion that PCN-activated PXR represses FoxA2-mediated transcription of Ctp1a and Hmgcs2 genes in fasting liver.",,"Hepatic triglycerides; Lipid metabolism; Pregnane X receptor (PXR); Enzyme activity; Insulin; Lipids; Metabolism; Rats; RNA; Drug products; 16alpha cyanopregnenolone; acyl coenzyme A desaturase; carnitine palmitoyltransferase; carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a; cell nucleus receptor; glutathione transferase; hepatocyte nuclear factor 3beta; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase 2; messenger RNA; mitochondrial enzyme; pregnane X receptor; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; 16alpha cyanopregnenolone; Foxa2 protein, rat; pregnane X receptor; steroid receptor; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; down regulation; drug activation; energy metabolism; enzyme activation; enzyme repression; fatty acid oxidation; gene activation; gene repression; genetic transcription; insulin response; ketogenesis; lipid metabolism; lipogenesis; liver; low fat diet; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein protein interaction; upregulation; animal; diet restriction; drug effect; genetics; human; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; liver; male; metabolism; mouse mutant; physiology; rat; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Mus; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Fasting; Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-beta; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred ICR; Mice, Knockout; Pregnenolone Carbonitrile; Rats; Receptor Cross-Talk; Receptors, Steroid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248202757

The analytical methodology was based on sampling with adsorbent tubes once a month during seven occasions within a time period of 1 year. Automated analyses were carried out on-line work-up with thermal desorption directly connected to a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. The effect of different baling techniques, cylindrical and rectangular baling was compared. It was found that cylindrically baled MSW emitted larger concentration of esters than their rectangular counter parts. Conversely, aromatic compounds emissions dominated in rectangularly baled MSW. This indicates that different degradation mechanisms operate in the waste bales. Cylindrical and rectangular bales are generally wrapped with six layers of 250 μm thick low density polyethylene (LDPE). It was observed that by wrapping an extra six layers of LDPE film onto the bales, the emissions from cylindrical bales increased while emissions from the rectangular counterpart decreased. Over time, the volatile organic compound emissions from cylindrical bales decreased two orders of magnitudes from 96.2 ± 20.8 μg m-3 in September 2003 to 0.80 ± 0.07 μgm-3 in July 2004. The rectangular bales exhibited an almost identical relative emission reduction from 54.4 ± 4.3 μg m-3 in September 2003 to 0.46 ± 0.02 μg m-3 in July 2004.

The net energy analysis (NEA) model has been adopted for the study. Energy sources considered for the village are; coal-based thermal power plant, diesel generator and photovoltaic (PV) system to meet energy demand for five hours during off-sunshine hours. Conventional electrical power is generated by thermal power plants that are centralised and require a substantial supply infrastructure. The PV power system is an environment-friendly option for a village to meet local energy demand with modest requirements for infrastructure where there is no proper grid power supply. The most emphatic advantage of PV power generation system is mitigation of CO2 emissions, which is a serious global environmental issue. The PV system has been designed for the village, which has an average energy demand of 156 kWh/day for operating televisions, compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) and fans. © 2007 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,"Electric generators; Electric power generation; Energy utilization; Fluorescent lamps; Fossil fuel power plants; Photovoltaic cells; Diesel generators; Net energy analysis (NBA); Power generation systems; Villages; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847042175

We used the Nasmyth Adaptive Optics System Near-Infrared Imager and Spectrograph (NACO) adaptive optics system at the UT-4 of the Very Large Telescope in Chile to perform both spectroscopic and imaging measurements of Titan. We present here a selected sample of the spectra we acquired on 16 January 2005 in the K band between 2.03 and 2.40 μm. Our spectra include the Huygens landing site and surrounding dark and bright areas. We apply a radiative transfer code using new methane absorption coefficients calculated in the 2-μm region. The analysis of the data yields information on the atmosphere and surface properties of these areas. The latter seem to indicate a strong decrease of Titan's surface albedo between 2.03 and 2.12 μm in all areas. This is compatible with the presence of ices such as CH4 and H2O at the surface. Sensitivity tests on the influence of the haze profile and the methane absorption on these results were performed.

The major goal of the ecommute program was to examine whether a particular type of economic incentive, tradable emissions credits from telecommuting, represents a viable strategy for reducing vehicle miles traveled and improving air quality. A context is established for evaluating whether the envisioned trading scheme represents a feasible approach to reducing mobile source emissions and promoting telecommuting and a review of the limited experience with mobile source emissions trading programs is provided. Using two-and-one-half years of data collected in the ecommute program, telecommuting frequency, mode choice, and emissions reductions are examined. It is found that from a regulatory perspective, the most substantial drawback to such a program is its questionable environmental integrity, resulting from difficulties in designing sufficiently rigorous quantification protocols to accurately measure the emissions reductions from telecommuting. Such a program is not likely to be cost-effective because the emissions reductions from a single telecommuter are very small. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This work is based on the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute's (JAERI) High Temperature Engineering Test Reactor (HTTR) prototype in Japan. The objective of this paper is to show how the PSA can be used for improving the design of the coupled plants. A simplified HAZOP study was performed to identify initiating events, based on existing studies. The results of the PSA show that the average frequency of an accident at this complex that could affect the population is 7 × 10-8 year-1 which is divided into the various end states. The dominant sequences are those that result in a methane explosion and occur with a frequency of 6.5 × 10-8 year-1, while the other sequences are much less frequent. The health risk presents itself if there are people in the vicinity who could be affected by the explosion. This analysis also demonstrates that an accident in one of the plants has little effect on the other. This is true given the design base distance between the plants, the fact that the reactor is underground, as well as other safety characteristics of the HTGR. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Another certainty is that any alternative scheme must involve developing countries. Climate change is a global issue that requires a global response. Washington also remains resistant to mandatory caps on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions - another feature of Kyoto. In this respect, some states are adopting a different stance to the federal government - a collaboration of seven northeastern states, aims to reduce emissions through a cap-and-trade system.

Waste management policies frequently fail to reduce consumption, prevent pollution, conserve resources and foster sustainable products. However, waste policies are changing to focus on lifecycle impacts of products from the cradle to the grave by extending the responsibilities of stakeholders to post-consumer management. Product stewardship and extended producer responsibility are two policies in use, with radically different results when compared for one consumer product, refrigerators. North America has enacted product stewardship policies that fail to require producers to take physical or financial responsibility for recycling or for environmentally sound disposal, so that releases of ozone depleting substances routinely occur, which contribute to the expanding the ozone hole. Conversely, Europe's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive requires extended producer responsibility, whereby producers collect and manage their own post-consumer waste products. WEEE has resulted in high recycling rates of greater than 85%, reduced emissions of ozone-depleting substances and other toxins, greener production methods, such as replacing greenhouse gas refrigerants with environmentally friendly hydrocarbons and more reuse of refrigerators in the EU in comparison with North America.","End-of-life; Extended producer responsibility; Product stewardship; Refrigerator; Waste; wmr 1161-1","Emission control; Hydrocarbons; Public policy; Recycling; Refrigerants; Sustainable development; Extended producer responsibility; Ozone-depleting substances; Post-consumer waste products; Product stewardship; Waste management; hydrocarbon; ozone; Emission control; Hydrocarbons; Public policy; Recycling; Refrigerants; Sustainable development; Waste management; emission control; European Union; pollution policy; recycling; stakeholder; sustainability; waste disposal; waste management; air pollution control; article; consumer; electronics; environmental economics; Europe; European Union; greenhouse gas; life cycle; North America; policy; pollution; priority journal; recycling; refrigerator; resource management; responsibility; sustainable development; waste disposal; waste management; waste minimization; Cities; Conservation of Natural Resources; Electronics; Environmental Monitoring; Europe; Humans; Industrial Waste; North America; Policy Making; Refrigeration; Time Factors; Waste Management; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249683779

However, the still ongoing process of transition is lagging behind due to slow development of institutions, e.g. low capacities of local government and insufficient public involvement in decision making in forestry. Challenges and prospects for the implementation of sustainable forestry and related climate change mitigation policies in transition economies are analysed.

This is thought to be associated with the more efficient formation of beryllium carbide (Be2C). By scanning the parameters, a scaling expression for τBe/C has been derived as {Mathematical expression}, where cBe is dimensionless, Ei in eV, Γi in 1022 m-2 s-1 and Ts in K. Should this scaling extend to an ITER scenario, carbon erosion of the divertor strike point region may be reduced with characteristic time of ∼6 ms.

One-seventh of the global soil carbon pool is stored in the bulk soil component of arctic ecosystems. Consistent climate change predictions of substantial increases in winter air temperatures and snow depths for the Arctic indicate that this region may become a significant net annual source of CO2 to the atmosphere if its bulk soil carbon is decomposed. We used snow fences to investigate the influence of a moderate increase in snow depth from approximately 0.3 m (ambient) to approximately 1 m on winter carbon dioxide fluxes from mesic birch hummock tundra in northern Canada. We differentiated fluxes derived from the bulk soil and plant-associated carbon pools using an experimental 'weeding' manipulation. Increased snow depth enhanced the wintertime carbon flux from both pools, strongly suggesting that respiration from each was sensitive to warmer soil temperatures. Furthermore, deepened snow resulted in cooler and relatively stable soil temperatures during the spring-thaw period, as well as delayed and fewer freeze-thaw cycles. The snow fence treatment increased mean total winter efflux from 27 to 43 g CO2-C m-2. Because total 2004 growing season net ecosystem exchange for this site is estimated at 29-37 g CO2-C m-2, our results strongly suggest that a moderate increase in snow depth can enhance winter respiration sufficiently to switch the ecosystem annual net carbon exchange from a sink to source, resulting in net CO2 release to the atmosphere. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Arctic; Birch; Canada; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Respiration; Snow; Soil; Temperature; Tundra; Winter","arctic environment; carbon dioxide; climate change; deciduous tree; snow; soil carbon; temperature effect; tundra; winter; Canada; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548125269

The experiments were supported by ab initio calculations. tert-Bulyl radicals, generated by flash pyrolysis of azo-tert-butane, were excited into the A 2A1 (3s) state between 347 and 307 nm and the 3p band at 274 and 268 nm and ionized by 810-nm radiation, in a [1 +2′] or [1 + 3′] process. Electronic structure calculations confirm that the two states are of s and p Rydberg characters, respectively. The carbon framework becomes planar and thus ion-like in both states. The photoelectron spectra are broad and seem to be mediated by accidental intermediate resonances in the probe step. All time-resolved photoelectron spectra can be described by a single decay time. For the A 2A1 state, lifetimes between 180 and 69 fs were measured. Surprisingly, a much longer lifetime of around 2 ps was found for the 3p state. To understand the decay dynamics, the potential energy was computed as a function of several important nuclear coordinates. A [1,2] H-atom shift to the isobutyl radical seems not to be important for the excited-state dynamics. Qualitative considerations indicate curve crossings between the ground state, the 3s state, and a valence state along the asymmetric C-C stretch coordinate that correlates to the dimethylcarbene + methyl product channel. The implications of the present study for earlier work on the nanosecond time scale are discussed. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Aromatic compounds; Electronic structure; Excited states; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Photoionization; Pyrolysis; Azo-tert-butane; C-C stretch; Intermediate resonances; Tert-butyl radical; Molecular dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047215218

Current indications are that a global mean temperature rise in excess of 2-3 °C would enhance the risk of destabilizing the climate system as we know it, and possibly lead to catastrophic change such as a shutdown of the deep ocean circulation, and the disintegration of the West Arctic Ice Sheet. Observations have shown that for many small island developing States (SIDS), life-sustaining ecosystems such as coral reefs, already living near the limit of thermal tolerance, are highly climate-sensitive, and can suffer severe damage from exposure to sea temperatures as low as 1 °C above the seasonal maximum. Other natural systems (e.g., mangroves) are similarly susceptible to relatively low temperature increases, coupled with small increments of sea level rise. Economic and social sectors, including agriculture and human health, face similar challenges from the likely impacts of projected climate change. In light of known thresholds, this paper presents the view that SIDS should seek support for a temperature cap not exceeding 1.5-2.0 °C above the pre-industrial mean. It is argued that a less stringent post-Kyoto target would frustrate achievement of the UNFCCC objective. The view is expressed that all countries which emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases should commit to binding reduction targets in the second commitment period, but that targets for developing countries should be less stringent than those agreed for developed countries. Such an arrangement would be faithful to the principles of equity and would ensure that the right of Parties to attain developed country status would not be abrogated. © 2007 The Author.

With the slow progress in achieving this, adaptation was viewed as a viable option to reduce the vulnerability to the anticipated negative impacts of global warming. It is increasingly realized that mitigation and adaptation should not be pursued independent of each other but as complements. This has resulted in the recent calls for the integration of adaptation into mitigation strategies. However, integrating mitigation and adaptation into climate change concerns is not a completely new idea in the African Sahel. The region is characterized by severe and frequent droughts with records dating back into centuries. The local populations in this region, through their indigenous knowledge systems, have developed and implemented extensive mitigation and adaptation strategies that have enabled them reduce their vulnerability to past climate variability and change, which exceed those predicted by models of future climate change. However, this knowledge is rarely taken into consideration in the design and implementation of modern mitigation and adaptation strategies. This paper highlights some indigenous mitigation and adaptation strategies that have been practiced in the Sahel, and the benefits of integrating indigenous knowledge into formal climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. Incorporating indigenous knowledge can add value to the development of sustainable climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies that are rich in local content, and planned in conjunction with local people. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.","Adaptation; Africa; Indigenous knowledge; Mitigation; Sahel; Sustainable development","adaptation; climate change; emission control; greenhouse gas; indigenous knowledge; mitigation; policy strategy; sustainable development; Africa; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447095653

Regional differences in energy resources, growth in energy consumption, current technology diffusions, etc., should be considered in the assessments. A global energy systems model, DNE21+, with high regional resolution had treated the energy supply sectors in a bottom-up fashion and the end-use sectors in a top-down fashion, which was expressed by using long-term price elasticity. However, the assessments of technological options in the end-use sectors are currently more important, particularly for the near and middle terms. In order to evaluate the technological options not only in the energy supply sectors but also in the end-use sectors for energy savings and CO2 emission reductions, DNE21+ has been modified for treating two energy-intensive end-use sectors, i.e. steel and cement sectors, in the bottom-up fashion. The results reveal that the cost-effective global CO2 emission reductions in 2030 for stabilizing the atmospheric CO2 concentration at 550 ppmv in comparison with that in the reference case would be approximately 68 MtC/yr and almost zero in the steel and cement sectors, respectively. The cost-effective options include next-generation coke ovens and coke dry quenching (CDQ) in the steel sector. © 2007 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.","Cement sector; Energy saving; Energy systems model; Global warming mitigation; Iron and steel sector","Carbon dioxide; Cements; Diffusion; Gas emissions; Global warming; Cement sector; Energy systems model; Global warming mitigation; Iron and steel sector; Energy conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847721525

METHOD: In 2002 and 2003, 43 minority medical students participated in one of six two-hour focus groups located in Philadelphia, Pa; Kansas City, Mo; Baltimore, Md; Miami, Fl; New York, NY; and Los Angeles, Calif. Focus groups consisted of an average of seven (range 5-10) individuals. Eighty-eight percent were of black/African descent, 10% were Hispanic, and 2% were Asian/Pacific Islanders. Students discussed their views of personal and professional success, including opportunities and obstacles, and completed a brief demographic survey. Discussions were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and reviewed for thematic content in a three-stage independent review/adjudication process. RESULTS: All 748 comments were grouped into themes relating to definitions of success (35%) and to perceived facilitators (25%) or inhibitors (40%) of success. Participants strove to achieve professional/academic status, financial security, and quality of life. In so doing, participants identified facilitators of success, including support systems, professional exposure, financial aid, and personal characteristics. Lack of financial and social support, challenges with standardized tests, experiences with racial stereotyping and discrimination, and self-imposed barriers were among inhibitors to success. CONCLUSIONS: The opportunities for and barriers to academic success identified by minority students should be heeded by educators and administrators who develop programs and policies to recruit minority medical students and to ensure their professional development. To enhance the institutional climate for diversity, programs that improve cultural awareness and reduce biases among all students, faculty, staff, and administrators are needed. © 2007 Association of American Medical Colleges.",,"academic achievement; African American; article; Asian; demography; ethnic group; female; financial management; Hispanic; human; male; medical education; medical profession; medical student; priority journal; quality of life; racism; social support; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846654686

The IPPS was developed to exploit the fact that the scale of industrial activity, its sectorial composition, and the process technologies, employed in production, heavily affect industrial pollution. Available data, from Manufacturer's Association of Nigeria (M.A.N.) for the years 1997-2002 was used for the estimation. From the cumulative ranking of the pollution load (ton/yr) estimate to all media (i.e. air, land, and water), Chemical and Pharmaceutical (CPH) sector is the highest polluting sector, followed by Basic Metal (BML), Domestic and Industrial Plastics (DIP), and Food, Beverage and Tobacco (FBT) sectors.

These bioconstructions occurred from shallow- to deep-shelf settings, in pure carbonate, carbonate-dominated or clay-rich mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sedimentary contexts. According to the depositional environment, the amount of microbialites strongly fluctuates, to form up to 70% of the reef volume. This study focuses on bioconstructions where microbialites constitute at least 15% of the reef volume. Analysis of the close relationships between the reef structures and the stacking pattern of laterally-deposited sediments reveals analogous architectures and growth modes between coral- and sponge-microbialite bioconstructions. Firstly, corals or sponges erected a primary framework more or less projected above the sea floor (constratal or superstratal growth fabrics). Contemporaneously, a thin microbialite layer encrusted the local dead parts of corals or sponges. In a second stage, microbialites largely developed and entirely covered the reef surface, becoming the main reef builders. The whole development of coral- and sponge-microbialite reefs corresponds to a 'low-frequency reef-growth phase'. These bioconstructions also display surfaces of reef growth interruption delimiting 'medium-frequency reef-growth phases'. They include several 'high-frequency reef-growth phases' (or elementary units) corresponding to coral or sponge frameworks plus microbialite crusts. At the scale of the elementary unit, microbialites are interpreted to reflect nutrient-richer conditions and developed to the detriment of phototrophic-, mixed- or heterotrophic-dominated assemblages of corals or sponges. The development of Jurassic coral and sponge bioconstructions was punctuated by high-frequency (millennial time-scale) ecological crises during which microbialites occurred at the reef surface. Such ecological shifts from skeletal reef metazoans (i.e. corals or sponges) to microbialite crusts were recorded whatever the palaeogeographical position (shallow-proximal platform or deep-distal shelf) along the northwestern Tethys margin. Three main orders of climatic oscillations, correlated to the 'high-, medium- and low-frequency reef-growth phases', could have directly regulated the amount of terrigenous materials and nutrients delivered to the ocean, which in turn controlled platform carbonate production and accumulation, as well as reef development. © 2006 Académie des sciences.","Accumulation rate; Coral and sponge reefs; Jurassic; Microbialites; Nutrients; Palaeoenvironments","Carbonates; Climatology; Correlation methods; Reefs; Sedimentary rocks; coral record; coral reef; depositional environment; Jurassic; microbialite; nutrient dynamics; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; sponge; Tethys; Anthozoa; Metazoa",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846818636

Data were derived from a mesocosm experiment (7 units, 40 m3, 12 m deep) receiving variable nutrient input. The food web included 3 autotrophic groups based on size, and 4 functional heterotrophic groups mainly based on trophic position. Inverse modelling was used to construct networks of carbon flows for the planktonic food web. Heterotrophic nanoplankton, microplankton and mesoplankton (HNP, CIL and COP, respectively) were found to be equally important contributors to grazing and carbon release during undisturbed summer situations. The release of dissolved organic carbon by zooplankton was comparable to that of phytoplankton. Autotrophic food was generally more important for zooplankton than heterotrophic (mean 75 %). Assimilation and growth efficiencies (AE and GE, respectively) of zooplankton groups in undisturbed situations were in the range of 33 to 69 % and 10 to 41 %, respectively. Values were inversely related to gross primary production (GPP). Sedimentation rates of carbon were low. High nutrient input rates increased food availability and most CIL and COP carbon flows. HNP did not respond, and neither did its food, that is, bacteria and picoautotrophs. The response in biomass was generally lower than that for the flows. Values of AE and GE of the zooplankton during high nutrient input and food availability varied between 11 and 29 % and 5.7 and 19 %, respectively, and throughout were lower than at low nutrient input. The sedimentation rate of particulate carbon increased strongly, resulting in an enhanced organic input rate in deep water. © Inter-Research 2007.","Assimilation efficiency; Carbon feeding rates; Carbon release rates; Coastal eutrophication; Growth efficiency; Metazoan; Protozoan","assimilation efficiency; carbon flux; coastal zone; dissolved organic carbon; eutrophication; food availability; food web; growth rate; mesocosm; metazoan; modeling; nutrient enrichment; protozoan; trophic level; zooplankton; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northeast); Bacteria (microorganisms); Metazoa; Protozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947172642

The pilot-scale CO2 sequestration experiment has been undertaken at the Nagaoka gas and oil field, in Niigata Prefecture, Japan and we conducted time-lapse cross-well seismic tomography to detect the spread of injected CO2. When super-critical CO2 spreads into porous media saturated with brine water, the seismic velocity always decreases, which is confirmed theoretically and experimentally. Therefore, CO2 flood area can be estimated from seismic tomography records before and after CO2 injection. However, the tomography records before and after CO2 injection include not only the variation due to CO2 flood, but also differences occurred from the location and property of sources and receivers and they result analysis errors. Thus, in this study, we applied the differential analysis to cross-well seismic tomography for reducing the difference due to measurement conditions and getting more accurate monitoring results. In the normal procedure, velocity differences are calculated after applying inversion processing to each record separately, but in this differential analysis, first forward modeling is applied using the velocity distribution inverted from one referential record, second the set of the first arrival time is obtained from the modeling result and finally the inversion processing is analyzed from the data set of the first arrival time added with the difference of travel-times from the referential record. In the result, we can have an analysis result in which the distribution of CO2 flooding is clearly identified along with a caprock under the inversion analysis with the constrained condition of no velocity enhancement. © 2007 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37549054070

We searched for natural CO2 springs in cool temperate climate regions in Japan and found three springs that were suitable for studying long-term responses of plants to elevated levels of CO2: Ryuzin-numa, Yuno-kawa and Nyuu. At these CO2 springs, the surrounding air was at high CO2 concentration with no toxic gas emissions throughout the growth season, and there was natural vegetation around the springs. At each site, high-CO2 (HC) and low-CO2 (LC) plots were established, and three dominant species at the shrub layers were used for physiological analyses. Although the microenvironments were different among the springs, dicotyledonous species growing at the HC plots tended to have more starch and less nitrogen per unit dry mass in the leaves than those growing at the LC plots. In contrast, monocotyledonous species growing in the HC and LC plots had similar starch and nitrogen concentrations. Photosynthetic rates at the mean growth CO2 concentration were higher in HC plants than LC plants, but photosynthetic rates at a common CO2 concentration were lower in HC plants. Efficiency of water and nitrogen use of leaves at growth CO2 concentration was greatly increased in HC plants. These results suggest that natural plants growing in elevated CO2 levels under cool temperate climate conditions have down-regulated their photosynthetic capacity but that they increased photosynthetic rates and resource use efficiencies due to the direct effect of elevated CO2 concentration. © 2006 The Ecological Society of Japan.","Down-regulation of photosynthesis; Long-term response to elevated CO 2; Photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency; Water use efficiency; Wild plants","carbon dioxide enrichment; community response; dicotyledon; ecophysiology; long-term change; monocotyledon; nitrogen; nutrient use efficiency; photosynthesis; physiological response; riparian vegetation; starch; temperate environment; water use efficiency; wild population; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Japan; Piper methysticum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248144058

We study the internal dynamics and the radiation properties of two atoms in free space. Interesting results are obtained when the atoms are separated by less than half a wavelength of the atomic transition, where the dipole-dipole interaction gives rise to new coherent effects, such as (a) coherence between two intermediate collective states, (b) oscillations in the two-photon correlation G(2), (c) emission of two photons by one atom, and (d) the loss of directional correlation. We compare the population dynamics during the two-photon emission process with the dynamics of single-photon emission in the cases of a Λ and a V scheme. We compute the temporal correlation and angular correlation of two successively emitted photons using the G(2) for different values of atomic separation. We find antibunching when the atomic separation is a quarter wavelength λ 4. Oscillations in the temporal correlation provide a useful feature for measuring subwavelength atomic separation. Strong directional correlation between two emitted photons is found for atomic separation larger than a wavelength. We also compare the directionality of a photon spontaneously emitted by the two atoms prepared in phased-symmetric and phased-antisymmetric entangled states ± k0 = ei k0 r1 a1, b2 ± ei k0 r2 b1, a2 by a laser pulse with wave vector k0. Photon emission is directionally suppressed along k0 for the phased-antisymmetric state. The directionality ceases for interatomic distances less than λ 2. © 2007 The American Physical Society.",,"Atoms; Laser pulses; Particle interactions; Photon correlation spectroscopy; Photons; Superradiance; Wavelength; Atomic transition; Radiation properties; Spontaneously decaying atoms; Wave vector; Molecular dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34347361728

To examine the regulation of human CYP1A1 in vivo, we created a transgenic mouse strain (Tg-CYP1A1GFP) expressing a chimeric gene consisting of the entire human CYP1A1 gene (15 kb) fused with a GFP reporter gene. The treatment of Tg-CYP1A1GFP mice with a single intraperitoneal dose of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) led to the induction of CYP1A1GFP in both the liver and the lung as determined by fluorescence and Western blot analysis. The localization of induced fluorescence in liver also demonstrated the usefulness of cultured hepatocytes in examining the actions of AhR agonists toward induction of CYP1A1GFP. Other routes of B[a]P administration, such as by oral exposure at 100 mg/kg for 3 days, led to reduced induction of CYP1A1GFP in liver and lung. In liver, expression of CYP1A1GFP was a sensitive marker for oral exposure, while mouse CYP1A1 was not induced at these doses. While first pass metabolism of B[a]P in the gastrointestinal tract reduces the potential of the AhR to induce CYP1A1GFP in the liver, adequate concentrations reach the hepatic circulation as demonstrated by induction of human UGT1A proteins in transgenic mice that express the human UGT1 locus. The capability to identify fluorescently labeled CYP1A1 in vivo provides a sensitive measurement of gene response and links exposure to potential environmental toxicants and activation of the AhR. © 2007 Oxford University Press.","Ah receptor; CYPIAI; Flourescent; Gene expression; TCDD; UGT","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; benzo[a]pyrene; biological marker; cytochrome P450 1A1; fluorescent dye; green fluorescent protein; xenobiotic agent; 3 methylcholanthrene; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; beta naphthoflavone; bilirubin uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase 1A1; bilirubin uridine-diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase 1A1; biological marker; cytochrome P450 1A1; glucuronosyltransferase; hybrid protein; article; cell culture; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental exposure; enzyme induction; enzyme regulation; first pass effect; fluorescence analysis; gastrointestinal tract; gene control; gene locus; human; human cell; in vivo study; liver cell; liver circulation; liver parenchyma; lung parenchyma; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; receptor upregulation; reporter gene; sensitivity analysis; toxicity testing; transgenic mouse; Western blotting; xenobiotic metabolism; animal; biosynthesis; C57BL mouse; drug effect; environmental monitoring; enzymology; fluorescence microscopy; genetic transcription; genetic transfection; genetics; liver; lung; metabolism; methodology; pollutant; tumor cell line; Mus musculus; Animals; Benzo(a)pyrene; beta-Naphthoflavone; Biological Markers; Blotting, Western; Cell Line, Tumor; Cells, Cultured; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Enzyme Induction; Glucuronosyltransferase; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Hepatocytes; Humans; Liver; Lung; Methylcholanthrene; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin; Transcription, Genetic; Transfection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845637779

However, it is poorly understood whether secondary metabolism is altered during competition among plants. The intraspecific and interspecific coexistence of some Mediterranean potted seedlings, namely Rosmarinus officinalis, Pinus halepensis, Cistus albidus and Quercus coccifera was investigated through their terpene accumulation within leaves (except for Q. coccifera, a non-storing species) and terpene emissions (for all species). Competition had both positive and negative effects for both terpene emissions and content, depending on the species a seedling coexisted with. For R. officinalis, terpene concentrations (1.8-cineole and camphor) and terpene emissions (camphene, camphor and overall monoterpenes) were lower when the neighbour species was P. halepensis. For C. albidus, no changes were observed in its content, while the overall sesquiterpene emissions (70% of total emissions) were reduced in all competition conditions, except in intraspecific competition. In the case of P. halepensis, the highest terpene content occurred when it grew with C. albidus, and in intraspecific competition, while its emissions were reduced under these conditions.

Standard emissions (ES) of monoterpenes (ESM) and sesquiterpenes (ESS) of Rosmarinus officinalis, Pinus halepensis and Cistus albidus in siliceous and calcareous sites were examined. Their dependency on some nutrients in these soils was also analyzed. The study was carried out in the south of France at the end of March, when C. albidus exhibited a leaf growth state, while the other two species exhibited a pre-budbreak state. The results revealed that ES of all major monoterpenes released by R. officinalis and ES of α-pinene and α-humulene of P. halepensis were higher in plants growing in calcareous soils. In contrast, for C. albidus, ESM and ES of β-bourbonene and α-humulene were higher in siliceous soils. ESM of all species was mainly correlated with nitrogen (N) and available phosphorous (PA), while dependency on Ca2+ or K+ was variable. None of these nutrients was significantly correlated with ESS, suggesting that sesquiterpene synthesis pathway requires different nutrient supplies. While higher soil nutrient content stimulated ESM of R. officinalis and P. halepensis, it had a negative effect on ESM of C. albidus, probably because C. albidus exhibited a different phenological state. Considering the soil nature, and particularly N and PA as inputs in plant terpene inventories could hence contribute to obtain more accurate terpene estimates. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been dated to the first centuries A.D. An impact origin is suggested, but not confirmed. The small size combined with the properties of the target material (carbonate mud) would neither allow shock features diagnostic of impact, nor projectile vaporization. Consequently, a meteoritic component in the sediments would be very localized. At impacts of this size the projectile most likely is an iron meteorite. Any iron meteorites on the ground surface would, in Iron Age Europe, have been removed shortly after the event. However, if the depressions are of impact origin they should contain meteorites at great depth in analogy with known craters. The magnetic properties of iron meteorites differ distinctly from the very low magnetic sediments and sedimentary rocks of the Sirente area. We have used a proton precession magnetometer/gradiometer to produce magnetic anomaly maps over four of the smaller depressions (∼8 m diameter), as well as two crossing profiles over a fifth depression (∼22 m diameter). All show distinct magnetic anomalies of about 20 nT, the larger depression up to 100 nT. Magnetic modeling shows a best fit for structures with upturned strata below their rims, excluding a karstic origin but supporting an explosive formation. The 100 nT anomaly can only be explained by highly-magnetic objects at a few meters depth. All together, the magnetic data provides a strong indication for an impact origin of the crater field. © The Meteoritical Society, 2007.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847375113

Results show that hydrocarbons originate from both natural (terrestrial plant waxes and algae) and anthropogenic (petroleum use) sources and are entering the lake through direct input and atmospheric transport. The concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons range from low to undetectable. The distributions and abundances of n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and unresolved complex mixture (UCM) from petroleum are similar for all surface slick sampling sites. The estimated levels of PAH in surface slicks range from 7-9 ng/m2 which are low. Transport of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons from the lake surface has resulted in their presence in some sediments, particularly near the boat operations mooring (total petroleum HC = 1440 μg/kg, dry wt. compared to naturally derived n-alkanes, 240 μg/kg, dry wt.). The presence of biomarkers such as the tricyclic terpanes, hopanes and steranes in shallow sediments further confirms petroleum input from boat traffic. In the deep lake sediments, petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations were very low (16 μg/kg, dry wt.). Very low concentrations of PAH were detected in shallow sediments (17-40 μg/kg at 5 m depth near the boat operations) and deep sediments (3-15 μg/kg at 580 m depth). The individual PAH concentrations in sediments (μg/kg or ppb range) are at least three orders of magnitude less than reported threshold effects levels (mg/kg or ppm range, test amphipod Hyalella azteca). Therefore, no adverse effects are expected to occur in benthic biota exposed to these sediments. Boating activities are leaving a detectable level of petroleum in surface waters and lake sediments but these concentrations are very low. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Boating; Hydrocarbon contamination; PAH; Petroleum; Sediments; Surface slicks","Contamination; Crude petroleum; Gas chromatography; Hydrocarbons; Mass spectrometry; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Sediments; Deep lake sediments; Petroleum hydrocarbon contamination; Surface slicks; Unresolved complex mixture (UCM); Lake pollution; alga; aliphatic hydrocarbon; anthropogenic source; aromatic hydrocarbon; atmospheric transport; boating; crater lake; lake pollution; PAH; petroleum hydrocarbon; pollutant source; sediment analysis; wax; Crater Lake; North America; Oregon; United States; algae; Hyalella azteca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751528455

The mangrove ecosystem was subjected to massive petrol spillage from a leaking pipeline and eventual fire outbreak. Following rehabilitation activities, a recovery assessment of the impacted ecosystem was carried out. The field surveys revealed that the petrol leakage and fire outbreak resulted in a near complete destruction of the mangrove ecosystem around the Atlas Cove depot, with macrobenthic species diversity index ranging between 00.4, compared to 0.780.87 in the control stations. The dominant early arrivals or colonizers of the impacted stations areas were Clibanarius africanus and Callinectes amnicola. Early signs of recovery of the impacted area were observed within about two and a half (2 1/2) to three (3) months, based on diversity and abundance indices respectively. The period of early signs of recovery also coincide with an observed reduction in the total hydrocarbon content (THC) levels in the sediment collected from the impacted stations by about nine folds from 3.67 mg/kg to 0.42 mg/kg within 3 months.

Characterization studies applying in-situ steady-state UV/vis spectroscopy evidenced higher reduction degree of surface VOx species at 773 K in a C3H 8-N2O (C3H8/N2O = 1/1) feed than in a C3H8-O2 (C3H 8/O2 = 2/1) flow at controlled conversions of propane (&lt;5%) and oxidizing agent (&lt;10%). The in-situ UV/vis method in a transient mode enabled to distinguish the ability of O2 and N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species; N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2. This property of N2O is very essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx (mainly to CO). Additionally, the results of transient isotopic experiments in the temporal analysis of products reactor revealed that adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species are formed upon O2 activation over reduced VOx species and participate in CO 2 and CO formation. It is suggested that these nonselective species do not originate from N2O. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Catalyst activity; Characterization; Dehydrogenation; Silica; Ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; Vanadium compounds; Oxidative dehydrogenation; Oxidizing agents; Vanadia; Propane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447526662

In this approach, a quantum particle is treated as a swarm (collection) of its classical samples interacting with one another by simple rules involving the emission and absorption of associated photons. The quantum dynamics is regarded as resulting from the collective behavior of the swarm, and the eigenstates are treated as equilibrium states of the process of photon emission and absorption. Entanglement is seen as classical correlation between samples from distinct swarms; the information on this correlation is stored in a spatiotemporal section of the model inaccessible to the user. Amplitudes are invariably treated as consisting of amplitude quanta. A Coulomb field experienced by quantum particles is represented in a similar manner to the free spreading of a wave packet, by point interaction between the particle samples and the samples of scalar photons propagating by diffusion. This provides a square-root gam in computational speed against the direct method involving item-by-item examination.

We selected three metrics to assess the modules' environmental performance, which are part of an actual 33 kW installation in Ann Arbor, MI. The net energy ratio (NER), the energy pay back time (E-PBT), and the CO2 emissions are calculated using process based LCA methods. The results reveal some of the parameters, such as the level of solar radiation, the position of the modules, the modules' manufacturing energy intensity and its corresponding fuel mix, and the solar radiation conversion efficiency of the modules, which affect the final analytical results. A sensitivity analysis shows the effect of selected parameters on the final results. For the baseline scenario, the E-PBT for the PVL136 and KC120 are 3.2 and 7.5 years, respectively. When expected future conversion efficiencies are tested, the E-PBT is 1.6 and 5.7 years for the PVL136 and the KC120, respectively. Based on the US fuel mix, the CO2 emissions for the PVL136 and the KC120 are 34.3 and 72.4 g of CO2/kW h, respectively. The most effective way to improve the modules' environmental performance is to reduce the energy input in the manufacturing phase of the modules, provided that other parameters remain constant. Consequently, the use of PV as an electricity source during PV manufacturing is also assessed. The NER of the supplier PV is key for the performance of this scheme. The results show that the NER based on a PV system can be 3.7 times higher than the NER based on electricity supplied by the traditional grid mix, and the CO2 emissions can be reduced by 80%. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This conclusion was reached from the assessment of fossil pollen data from Patagonia throughout the Paleogene and Early Neogene periods and the subsequent comparison of palynological data to the global deep-sea oxygen isotope record. Four main time intervals were recognized based on the temporal distribution of selected angiosperm key taxa. (1) Paleocene to Early Eocene: presence of megatherm elements (e.g. Nypa, Pandanus), probably integrating mangrove communities in Patagonian lowlands. (2) Middle Eocene to Early Oligocene: rise to dominance of mesotherm and microtherm Nothofagus species. Megatherm taxa were well recorded at the beginning of this interval (e.g. Ilex) but were shown to disappear towards the end. (3) Late Oligocene to Middle Miocene: new increases of megatherm taxa such as palms, Cupania and Alchornea. First occurrences of mesotherm Asteraceae, represented by trailing Mutisieae, were reported. (4) Late Miocene: dispersal of meso-microtherm and arid adapted taxa (e.g. Ephedraceae and Asteraceae) across the non-Andean region of Patagonia. Microtherm Nothofagacean forests probably occurred on the higher rainfall regions of western Patagonia. The current vegetation was most likely reached during this last stage with the forest development under wetter conditions on the Andean sectors, and the steppe throughout the non-Andean region of Patagonia. © 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

The cost of achieving these reductions depends on the form and stringency of the regulation. In this research, we analyze the economic benefits and costs of the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) as characterized in the supplemental rule proposed in June 2004, and the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) as proposed in February 2004. The assessment integrates a model of the electricity sector, two models of atmospheric transport of air pollutants, and a model of environmental and public health endpoints affected by pollution. We model explicitly the emissions of SO2, NOx, mercury and carbon dioxide (CO2) and the effects of changes in emissions of SO2 and NOx on environmental and public health. The manner in which mercury emissions are regulated will have important implications not only for the cost of the regulation, but also for emission levels for SO2 and NOx and where those emissions are located. We find the economic benefits of CAIR and CAMR are far greater than the costs. Recent estimates of benefits of reductions in mercury and acidification indicate that our model captures the lion's share of quantifiable benefits.

Unfortunately for these analyses, the Protocol has proved to be a moving target in terms of its interpretation and likely implementation. In addition, the economic performance and future expectations for some parties also are changing, and with these changes come revisions in reference emissions, which have a strong influence on the projected cost of meeting Protocol requirements. Looking back across these studies, the progression of work can be divided into three broad phases. The first studies were conducted soon after the Protocol was signed in 1997, and they focused on carbon emissions from fossil fuels. Often they assumed an idealized system of harmonized carbon taxes, or cap-and-trade among all the Annex B parties, contrasting such systems with implementation without international permit trade but with an idealized trading system operating within each country (see, for example, Weyant and Hill [1999]). These studies showed a high cost of the Protocol with autarkic compliance, but huge benefits of international trading because it made Russian “hot air” (potentially tradable emission quotas in excess of their anticipated emissions) accessible to other Annex B parties. A second phase of studies followed the final negotiations in Marrakech in 2001 (Manne and Richels, 2001; Babiker et al, 2002; Bohringer, 2002). By that time, the United States had withdrawn from the Protocol, and the potential contribution of Article 3.4 carbon sinks had been defined for each party. © Cambridge University Press 2007, Cambridge University Press, 2010.",,"Aluminum alloys; Commerce; Carbon emissions; Climate policy; Economic performance; Emission quota; KYOTO protocol; Meeting protocols; Moving targets; Trading systems; Costs",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68349102723

This is mainly to be achieved by reducing the quantity of organic matter deposited, through measures such as the separate collection and recycling of the organic waste stream or pretreatment of residual wastes before landfilling. Other than incineration or other thermal processes, mechanical biological treatment is playing an increasingly important role. This study was conducted to seek the benefits of municipal solid waste (MSW) pretreatment, as well as the differences in methane production from the landfilling of untreated and mechanically/biologically treated (MBT) MSW using GasSim simulation. Results demonstrated that methane production rates vary significantly among waste fractions. Those that contribute most to methane generation (organic material and potentially reusable or recyclable material) could be targeted and treated before landfilling. The statistic relationship from the first phase of the study indicated that to match the increasingly stringent landfill waste organic content allowance, local councils should prioritize the reduction/sorting of certain targeted fractions, such as paper, card, green waste, and other putrescibles from MSW. Moreover, mechanical treatment alone produces organic-rich waste called mechanically sorted organic residues (MSORs), which can be viewed as an organic content concentration process. Mechanically and biologically pretreated waste, on the other hand, differs significantly from untreated MSW and MSORs. This work demonstrated that if efficient mechanical-biological treatment is used, considerable reductions in biological activity, land-fill gas production, and energy content/total organic carbon could be achieved. Using GasSim, reductions in methane production of >74% have been simulated if a 90% organic content reduction can be achieved during biological treatment on MSORs. A 50–60% organic content reduction by following biological treatment can turn MSOR properties only into normal MSW equivalent though considerably less volume. © 2007 Air & Waste Management Association.",,"methane; methane; air pollutant; air pollution; article; European Union; statistical model; time; United Kingdom; waste disposal; biodegradation; landfill; priority journal; solid waste; solid waste management; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; European Union; Great Britain; Methane; Models, Statistical; Refuse Disposal; Time Factors; Deposition; Incineration; Land fill; Methane; Particulate emissions; Solid wastes; Biological treatment; Methane emissions; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Organic matter deposition; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947716363

However, little information is available on health gains from clean energy usage in developing countries. In this study the expected population exposed to air pollutants was estimated under the different energy use scenarios by the year 2010, 2020 and 2030, respectively, in the urban area of Beijing, China. The concentration-response functions between air pollutants and the health endpoints were established using meta-analysis and regression models. The decreased cardiorespiratory deaths and diseases of the exposed population were predicted as the health benefits from air pollution reduction. We used daily measurements of particulate matter less than 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) and sulphate dioxide (SO2) as air pollution indicators. The percentage of population exposed to higher level of PM10 will be decreased significantly under the clean energy use scenario than that under the Baseline Scenario (i.e., business-as-usual scenario). Compared with the Baseline Scenario there will be, by 2010, 2020, and 2030, respectively, a decrease of 29-152, 30-212 and 39-287 acute excess deaths; and 340-1811, 356-2529 and 462-3424 chronic excess deaths associated with the reduction of PM10 level; also a decrease of 237-331, 285-371 and 400-554 short-term excess deaths associated with the decrease of SO2 level. Meanwhile, the number of respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions, outpatient visits to internal and paediatrics departments, total emergency room visits and asthma attacks will be remarkably reduced with the reduction of air pollution. Energy structure improvement could reduce ambient air pollution and produce substantial health benefits to the population in Beijing.

We develop a model that predicts the number density of possible target galaxies as a function of exposure time and redshift. We use this number counts model together with fitting formulae for the accuracy of the BAO measurements to determine the effectiveness of different surveys and instrument designs. We search through the available survey parameter space to find the optimal survey with respect to the dark energy equation-of-state parameters according to the Dark Energy Task Force Figure-of-Merit, including predictions of future measurements from the Planck satellite. We optimize the survey to test the Lambda cold dark matter model, assuming that galaxies are pre-selected using photometric redshifts to have a constant number density with redshift, and using a non-linear cut-off for the matter power spectrum that evolves with redshift. We find that line-emission galaxies are strongly preferred as targets over continuum emission galaxies. The optimal survey covers a redshift range, over the widest possible area (6000 deg2 from 1500 h observing time). The most efficient number of fibres for the spectrograph is 2000, and the survey performance continues to improve with the addition of extra fibres until a plateau is reached at 10 000 fibres.

Off Hudson Strait the dominant carbonate is calcite whereas at distal sites in the North Atlantic dolomite is dominant (more diagnostic?). A significant source for dolomite is its outcrop at the northern end of Baffin Bay where major ice streams from the Laurentide, Innuitian and Greenland ice sheets converged. The provenance of samples containing detrital carbonate, mainly dolomite, from a core in Baffin Bay has been confirmed using organic geochemistry to distinguish between alternative sources, based upon the thermal maturity of organic matter in carbonates of the source region. The core contained five distinct carbonate units dating between ∼ 14 and 51 cal ka BP and indicates significant ice stream instability associated with iceberg calving and significant volumes of meltwater. The exact temporal relationship to Heinrich events is not yet clear. A long mid-Wisconsin interval (∼ 38 to 22 cal ka BP) devoid of detrital carbonate suggests a major reduction in ice extent at high northern latitudes. The core samples yield thermally sensitive biomarker ratios comparable to those from Laurentian carbonates in the Canadian Arctic islands but unlike those from North Greenland, identifying the former region as their provenance. However, a Late Holocene sample from off Newfoundland shows a stronger affinity with Greenland. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The main limitation of using the MET is lack of experimental data for co-volume, b0. We have substituted b0 from hard sphere (HS) theory and zero density transport properties from the kinetic theory of gases for HS in the MET expression, because of the fact that dense fluids behave more and less like a HS fluid. As a result, a simple linear expression for the self diffusion (D) and quadratic expressions for viscosity (η) and thermal conductivity (λ) coefficients have been obtained in terms of Y at high densities (ρ &gt; ρc), where Y = (T (∂ p / ∂ T)ρ) / ρ R T - 1. To evaluate the obtained expressions, we have used experimental values of densities and the transport properties and calculated Y from the reported accurate equation of state (EOS) for argon and xenon. We have noticed that the quadratic fits for viscosity and thermal conductivity and the linear fit (when T &lt; Tc) for self diffusion hold quiet well with the correlation coefficient, R2 ≥ 0.9994, when ρ &gt; ρc. Also, we have found that the curves for different isotherms of a fluid fall onto a common curve at high densities over entire temperature range for which experimental data exist, but the curves depend on the nature of fluid. So, by using experimental data of transport properties for one isotherm and an accurate EOS for calculation of Y for a dense fluid, we may calculate the corresponding property of that fluid for any other isotherm. In this work, we have used this approach to predict the viscosity coefficient of n-alkanes from propane to n-octane and cyclohexane at different densities (ρ &gt; ρc) and temperatures. To do such predictions, we need an accurate EOS for each compound which is not generally available. For this reason, we have made use of the modified linear isotherm regularity (MLIR). Therefore, using the calculated values of density and thermal pressure coefficient from the MLIR and the coefficients of the viscosity expression for each of these fluids, their viscosities have been predicted with the average percentage error less than 1.6%. To make the approach more general, we have used the principle of corresponding states to present viscosity expression independent of fluid in terms of the reduced variables. Therefore, one may use experimental data for one isotherm of an arbitrary fluid to find the coefficients of the reduced viscosity expression. Then, these coefficients may be used for other fluids at the same reduced temperature, Tr, to calculate the reduced viscosity. Here, we have selected n-butane as a reference compound because of abundance of experimental data. We have used the coefficients of the expression for n-butane and density and Y have been calculated from the MLIR, this approach gives viscosity of hydrocarbons with the average percentage error less than 1.7%. Similar approach has been used to calculate the self diffusion coefficient and thermal conductivity of dense fluids. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Tip-sample contact stiffness is obtained through the values of the measured resonance frequencies of the cantilever contacting the sample surface, thus allowing one to obtain the value of the sample indentation modulus. The paper describes a generalization of the technique: while performing topography, the first and the second contact resonance frequencies are acquired at each point of the scanned area. Data are then properly processed and acoustic images are obtained as a bi-dimensional pattern of the indentation modulus over the imaged samples area. The technique is illustrated in two different kinds of sample: a metallographic (1 1 0) GaAs sample, prepared by incorporating GaAs single crystals into an epoxy matrix, and a diamond-like carbon film, deposited on a Mo substrate by laser ablation from a glassy carbon target. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The overall purpose of this tool is twofold: (i) a spreadsheet model for comprehensive compilation of the direct and indirect emissions from land management, residue-burning and fossil fuel consumption through on-farm and off-farm operations and (ii) a decision support tool to explore economically viable mitigation options through detailed cost-benefit analysis of different technological options. We developed TechnoGAS (technical coefficient generator for mitigation technologies of greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural sectors), which integrates analytical and expert knowledge with regional databases on bio-physical, agronomic and socio-economic features to establish input-output relationships ('Technical Coefficients') related to GHG emissions in agriculture. The approach includes emissions of methane (CH4) from rice fields, rice straw burning and cattle; carbon dioxide (CO2) from fossil fuel and soil organic carbon decline as well as nitrous oxide (N2O) from soil, rice straw burning and fertilizer use. To illustrate the approach of the spreadsheet model for comprehensive compilation of emissions, we applied TechnoGAS for an entire rice-wheat cropping cycle in the state of Haryana in northern India as a case study. Twenty technologies of rice production, which can be adopted by farmers, are analysed for their operation-specific emissions including their global warming potential (GWP). The technologies differ in terms of water regime, residue management/utilization, soil management and additives, which represent different mitigation options for GHG emissions. With the current farmers' practice in various districts in Haryana, soil-borne emissions are the major source of GHG contributing 53% of the average GWP (3288 kg CO2 equivalent ha-1) in rice followed by burning of rice straw (13% of the GWP). Cattle, farm operations, off-farm and inorganic fertilizer contributes 12%, 10%, 10% and 2% of the GWP, respectively. Emissions from wheat are relatively low (1204 kg CO2 equivalent ha-1) as there is no CH4 emission and wheat straw is not burnt. Different mitigation technologies show pronounced effects on the GWP of the rice crop and varied between 1715 kg CO2 equivalent ha-1 with continuous flooding, urea and rice straw used for building materials and 10,020 kg CO2 equivalent ha-1 with continuous flooding, and application of nutrients through organic manure. Compared to current farmers' practice, 13 technologies are found to have the potential to reduce the GWP by 8-51%, but they also reduce the net income of farmers. Upscaling of the estimates to the entire state of Haryana shows that the GWP with the current farmers' practice in rice is 2617 Gg CO2 equivalent. Modification of water management from continuous flooding to alternate flooding or application of urea alone instead of urea plus FYM will reduce the GWP by 15% and 29%, respectively, while feeding of rice straw to cattle and supplying N through urea will reduce it by 41% compared to the current practice of burning rice straw and use of FYM. The study shows that the TechnoGAS tool can be used for estimating GHG emission from various land-use types and for identifying promising mitigation options.

In a sotol grassland ecosystem in the Chihuahuan Desert at Big Bend National Park, we measured the response of leaf-level fluxes of CO2 and H2O 1 day before and up to 7 days after three supplemental precipitation pulses in the summer (June, July, and August 2004). In addition, the responses of leaf, soil, and ecosystem fluxes of CO2 and H2O to these precipitation pulses were also evaluated in September, 1 month after the final seasonal supplemental watering event. We found that plant carbon fixation responded positively to supplemental precipitation throughout the summer. Both shrubs and grasses in watered plots had increased rates of photosynthesis following pulses in June and July. In September, only grasses in watered plots had higher rates of photosynthesis than plants in the control plots. Soil respiration decreased in supplementally watered plots at the end of the summer. Due to these increased rates of photosynthesis in grasses and decreased rates of daytime soil respiration, watered ecosystems were a sink for carbon in September, assimilating on average 31 mmol CO2 m-2 s -1 ground area day-1. As a result of a 25% increase in summer precipitation, watered plots fixed eightfold more CO2 during a 24-h period than control plots. In June and July, there were greater rates of transpiration for both grasses and shrubs in the watered plots. In September, similar rates of transpiration and soil water evaporation led to no observed treatment differences in ecosystem evapotranspiration, even though grasses transpired significantly more than shrubs. In summary, greater amounts of summer precipitation may lead to short-term increased carbon uptake by this sotol grassland ecosystem. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","Bouteloua curtipendula; Chihuahuan Desert; Dasylirion leiophyllum; Ecosystem fluxes; Precipitation manipulation","carbon dioxide; rain; water; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; carbon dioxide; carbon fixation; climate modeling; evapotranspiration; grassland; photosynthesis; precipitation (climatology); soil respiration; transpiration; Agavaceae; article; ecosystem; metabolism; plant leaf; Poaceae; season; soil; United States; Agavaceae; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Plant Leaves; Poaceae; Rain; Seasons; Soil; Texas; Water; Big Bend National Park; Chihuahuan Desert; North America; Texas; United States; Bouteloua curtipendula; Dasylirion; Dasylirion leiophyllum; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947309702

It has been found that production of CO2 is in all cases accompanied by evolution of hydrogen, the production rate of which is significantly enhanced, compared with that obtained in the absence of organic additives in solution. Results are explained by considering that organic compounds act as sacrificial electron donors, which become progressively oxidized toward CO2 by consuming photogenerated holes and/or oxygen. This results in decreased rates of electron-hole recombination and oxygen-hydrogen back reaction and, concomitantly, in increased H2-production rates. The rate of photoinduced hydrogen production depends strongly on the concentration of the sacrificial agent employed and to a lesser extent on solution pH and temperature. When complete mineralization of the sacrificial agent is achieved, photogenerated oxygen can no longer be removed from the photocatalyst surface and the H2-production rate drops to steady-state values, comparable to those obtained in the absence of the organic compound in solution. The amounts of carbon dioxide and ""additional"" hydrogen produced depend on the nature of the organic additive and are directly proportional to its initial concentration in solution. Quantification of results shows that the overall process may be described as ""photoinduced reforming of organic compounds at room temperature"". It is concluded that mineralization of organic pollutants such as alcohols and organic acids, which are common waste products of biomass processing industries, can be achieved with simultaneous production of H2 fuel. The process may provide an efficient and cost effective method for cleaning up waste streams. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

For the first time, the mechanism of this reaction has been investigated experimentally and theoretically with group 10 catalysts. This investigation provides a very consistent picture of the catalytic cycle. Notably, we establish that the reaction does not proceed by stepwise cycloadditions or ring insertions involving metallacyclic intermediates, as might have been anticipated. Rather, in our proposal, the initial steps of the mechanism resemble the chain-growth process operative during the anionic polymerization of isocyanates and feature charge-separated intermediates. These steps are then followed by ring closure on the metal center of the last intermediate formed to yield a seven-membered metallacycle that reductively eliminates the cyclotrimer and re-forms the active species. In addition, we conclusively show that the (known) palladacycles that could be isolated during the experimental investigations are not catalytic intermediates but result from catalyst deactivation. Thus, with Pd(0) diimine catalysts, the actual trimerization mechanism appears to be a blend between the two types of mechanisms proposed thus far for the oligomerization of heterocumulenes with very different catalysts. In conclusion, this work contributes to a better understanding of the reactivity of arylisocyanates in the vicinity of late group 10 metal centers in low oxidation state and sheds some light on the detrimental self-poisoning processes observed during the reductive carbonylation of nitroaromatic substrates catalyzed by related catalysts in non-nucleophilic media. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Catalytic cycle; Cyclotrimerization; Deactivation; Diimines; Anionic polymerization; Aromatic compounds; Carbonylation; Catalysis; Cycloaddition; Oxidation; Palladium; Toxic materials; 1,2,5 triarylisocyanurate derivative; arylisocynate derivative; cyanuric acid; diimine derivative; imine; isocyanic acid derivative; palladium; phenyl isocyanate; unclassified drug; article; carbonylation; catalysis; chemical bond; chemical structure; density functional theory; isolation procedure; oligomerization; oxidation; polymerization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250891431

The alternative materials are produced through a process developed to make productive utilization of fly-ash from oil shale and coal combustion. Material properties were analyzed using laboratory specimens, and it was established that high-quality building components could be produced using the developed technological procedure with standard manufacturing equipment.

Climate change litigation involves legal action to seek redress for damage arising from activities said to be causing global climate change. The growth of climate change litigation has been particularly pronounced in the United States, due to perceived inaction by national political authorities to deal with issues of global warming. In Australia, frustration with the slow pace and fragmented nature of regulatory developments regarding climate change similarly appears to be encouraging environmental groups to turn to the courts as a possible saviour. This article argues that while there are positive indications in some climate change cases that the courts are prepared to embrace rigorous practices of EIA for assessing climate change impacts, climate change litigation is unlikely to be a panacea fbi delivering effective action on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

One of the samples, NiAlBEA (0.9 wt % of Ni), was prepared by conventional ion exchange, and the other, NiSiBEA (1.0 wt % Ni), was prepared by a two-step postsynthesis method involving dealuminated SiBEA zeolite. No structural changes are observed with A1BEA after ion exchange with nickel. In contrast, the incorporation of Ni into SiBEA leads to an increase of unit cell parameters of the BEA structure and to the consumption of silanol groups in vacant T-sites of the dealuminated zeolite. In the NiAlBEA sample Ni shows three TPR peaks in the region of 600-1100 K, whereas one sharp peak at 650 K with a shoulder at 750 K is observed with the NiSiBEA sample. Adsorption of CO at 100 K on NiAlBEA results in formation of Ni2+-CO species (2200 and 2214 cm-1)- The latter are partially converted, at high coverages, to Ni2+(CO) 2 dicarbonyls (2206-2204 cm-1). Reduction of the sample with CO leads to generation of Ni+ ions. The latter form, with CO, different carbonyl species that are in equilibrium: (i) Ni+-CO (2113 cm-1), (ii) Ni+(CO)2 (vs at 2138 cm -1 and vas at 2095 cm-1), and (iii) Ni +(CO)3 (2157, 2122, and 2113 cm-1). The polycarbonyl structures were proven by 12CO-13CO coadsorption. In line with these results, NO adsorption on NiAlBEA leads to formation of two kinds of nitrosyl species (1905 and 1897 cm-1). Adsorption of CO at 100 K on NiSiBEA leads to formation of several kinds of Ni2+-CO species observed in the 2196-2170 cm-1 region. The intensity of the bands was low, suggesting the majority of incorporated nickel ions are coordinatively saturated or inaccessible and thus not able to form carbonyls. Negligible amounts of Ni+ ions were present on the activated sample and formed various (poly)carbonyls. In this case the reduction hardly affected the state of the sample. Most of the nickel ions in NiSiBEA were not able to coordinate NO; the others formed nitrosyl complexes (1872-1845 cm-1) which were much less stable (up to 323 K) than those observed with NiAlBEA. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Adsorption; Carbon monoxide; Carbonylation; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Ions; Nickel; X ray diffraction; Structural changes; Temperature-programmed reduction; Zeolites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447522006

Such refinement has become necessary as the observed dataset has been significantly extended by our CW-CRDS observations in the 5900-7000 cm-1 region. In the case of the 16O13C17O isotopologue, 1151 line positions of 11 bands have been used to refine the effective Hamiltonian parameters published by Chédin [A. Chédin, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 76 (1979) 430-491]. With the obtained set of parameters, the collected line positions are reproduced with a RMS (root mean squares of the residuals) equal to 0.0013 cm-1. In the case of the 16O13C18O isotopologue, 61 parameters of the effective Hamiltonian were fitted to more than 6410 line positions. A weighted standard deviation of χ = 1.77 and a global RMS of 0.0017 cm-1, close to the experimental accuracy, were achieved. However, several rotational levels of the 31113 state (P = 10) could not be reproduced in the frame of this polyad model and were then excluded from the fit. We found that these levels are affected by an anharmonic resonance interaction with the 51106 vibrational state (P = 11) leading to energy shifts up to 0.060 cm-1 and significant intensity transfer to several extra lines which could be detected. The coupling matrix element has been estimated to 0.11 cm-1 from the detailed analysis of the experimental spectrum. This is the first evidence of an interpolyad resonance interaction in the case of the carbon dioxide molecule. In order to extend the input spectroscopic information, the weak lines left unassigned in our previous analysis of the CW-CRDS spectrum of the 13C enriched carbon dioxide [Y. Ding, P. Macko, D.

Thirteen 13C16O2 bands, one 16O13C17O band and two 16O13C18O bands could be newly assigned together with a number of transitions corresponding to high J values of previously observed bands.

The CDM is currently offered for afforestation and reforestation projects, but may apply subsequently to sequestration in agricultural soils. Additionally, markets outside of the Protocol are developing for soil C sequestration. In theory, C markets present win-win opportunities for buyers and sellers of C stocks. In practice, however, C markets are very complex. They presuppose the existence and integration of technical capacity to enhance C storage in production systems, the capacity for resource users to adopt and maintain land resource practices that sequester C, the ability for dealers or brokers to monitor C stocks at a landscape level, the institutional capacity to aggregate C credits, the financial mechanisms for incentive payments to reach farmers, and transparent and accountable governance structures that can ensure equitable distribution of benefits. Hence, while C payments may contribute to increasing rural incomes and promoting productivity enhancement practices, they may also expose resource users to additional social tensions and institutional risks. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Motor vehicles produce a majority of these emissions. This paper examines how the US Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulatory standard for light-duty vehicles has established an underlying fuel economy policy paradigm for the highly integrated North American automotive sector. While these standards pushed North American vehicle fuel efficiency higher in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the standards have not been significantly increased since 1985. The paper details the institutional, economic and political factors that have blocked higher CAFE standards. It describes difficulties with the legal efforts to shift the main venue of fuel economy regulation from the US federal government to the state of California. In light of the Canadian tradition of establishing voluntary agreements between the government and the auto manufacturers in lieu of formal regulation, it assesses the possibility that the voluntary agreement on reducing automotive greenhouse gas emissions signed between Ottawa and Canadian auto manufacturers in April 2005 will be a step toward a new style of negotiated advances in fuel economy and greenhouse gas reduction goals throughout North America.",,"carbon dioxide; economic policy; energy policy; greenhouse gas; political economy; standard (regulation); traffic emission; Canada; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751557323

Driven by the need to comply to increasingly strict emissions regulations as well as continually striving for better overall performance, the active control turbocharger is intended to provide a significant improvement over the current state of the art in turbocharging: the Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT). The technology consists of a system and method of operation, which regulate the inlet area to a turbocharger inlet, according to each period of engine exhaust gas pulse pressure fluctuation, thereby actively adapting to the characteristics of the high frequency, highly dynamic flow, thus taking advantage of the highly dynamic energy levels existent through each pulse, which the current systems do not take advantage of. In the Active (Flow) Control Turbocharger (ACT) the nozzle is able to adjust the inlet area at the throat of the turbine inlet casing through optimum amplitudes, at variable out-of-phase conditions and at the same frequency as that of the incoming exhaust stream pulses. Thus, the ACT makes better use of the exhaust gas energy of the engine than a conventional VGT. The technology addresses, therefore, for the first time the fundamental problem of the poor generic engine-turbocharger match, since all current state of the art systems in turbocharging are still passive receivers of this highly dynamic flow without being able to provide optimum turbine inlet geometry through each exhaust gas pulse period. The numerical simulation and experimental work presented in this paper concentrates on the potential gain in turbine expansion ratio and eventual power output as well as the corresponding effects on efficiency as a result of operating the turbocharger in its active control mode compared to its operation as a standard VGT.

The model takes into account the impact of technology learning and is based on the underlying assumptions of the so-called RAINS model frequently used to assess the potential and the costs for reducing air pollution in Europe. The results based on an exogenously given 15 percent reduction target for CO2 emissions show that the marginal cost for switching from a carbon-intense fuel to either a low-carbon or to a renewable energy source differs significantly among the countries. The marginal costs range from 4 to 90€ per ton CO2, and are mainly due to country differences in the availability of renewables, existing technologies and costs. The results also indicate that although it is clear that the Eastern European countries are not homogeneous in terms of CO2 abatement potential and costs, no general conclusions can be made of the region. This may have important implications for future JI/CDM activities. For instance, risk factors such as policy uncertainty and institutional obstacles may become crucial in determining the future allocation of JI/CDM projects across the region. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The model simulations are based on two transport models and two sets of surface fluxes which have been optimized in order to fit near-surface atmospheric CO2 measurements through a transport model (using an inverse procedure). In the tropics the zonal mean annual cycle and growth rate of the satellite product are consistent with those of the models. However, north-to-south gradients and spatial distributions for a given month show large differences. There are large regional patterns that can reach 7 ppm in the satellite retrievals (over regions of a few thousand kilometers wide) but are absent in the model predictions. The root-mean-square (RMS) differences between the models and the satellite product are around 1.7 ppm. One time series of the model CO2 trend is used to extrapolate to the airborne measurement periods (1991-2003) both the satellite and the model monthly products to the airborne measurement period. The RMS difference between the airborne measurements and the extrapolated model predictions is around 1 ppm, while it is 2 ppm for the satellite estimate. These comparisons suggest that the large spatial variability of TOVS retrievals reflects substantial regional biases and noise which need to be reduced before remotely sensed CO2 from TOVS will help constrain our knowledge of the carbon cycle.

All patients underwent a PET/CT consisting of a multiphase CT protocol including a low-dose non-enhanced attenuation scan and an arterial and portal-venous contrast-enhanced scan followed by a whole-body PET. PET/ CT studies were analysed by different categories to determine the added value of contrast-enhanced CT. The additional value was defined as new information provided by diagnostic CT and not available from the low-dose CT, resulting in change of PET/CT interpretation. The results were validated either by histopathology or by clinical-radiological follow up at ≥6 months. The clinical impact was evaluated with respect to changes in patient management. Diagnostic multiphase CT was of additional value in 52 out of 100 patients with 85 suspected lesions. In 40 out of 100 patients, no additional value could be detected. Eight patients were excluded due to inconclusive diagnosis in both methods including fusion. The analysis showed the greatest benefit of diagnostic CT in the categories localization of pathological fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake and precise tumour delineation, changing PET/CT interpretation in 42% and 31% of patients, respectively. The benefit of diagnostic CT was influenced by the tumour type demonstrating the highest impact in gastrointestinal, lung and neuroendocrine tumours. Diagnostic CT changed clinical management in 21 patients (21%).

To illustrate the wide spectrum of climate forcings, regional climate forcings are presented including land-use/land-cover change and the influence of aerosols on radiative and biogeochemical fluxes and cloud/precipitation processes, as well as how these effects can be teleconnected globally.

We developed a framework to describe and quantify the impacts of local climate on the mosaic of microclimates and physiological states of insects within tree canopies. This approach was applied to a leaf mining moth feeding on apple leaf tissues. Canopy geometry was explicitly considered by mapping the 3D position and orientation of more than 26 000 leaves in an apple tree. Four published models for canopy radiation interception, energy budget of leaves and mines, body temperature and developmental rate of the leaf miner were integrated. Model predictions were compared with actual microclimate temperatures. The biophysical model accurately predicted temperature within mines at different positions within the tree crown. Field temperature measurements indicated that leaf and mine temperature patterns differ according to the regional climatic conditions (cloudy or sunny) and depending on their location within the canopy. Mines in the sun can be warmer than those in the shade by several degrees and the heterogeneity of mine temperature was incremented by 120%, compared with that of leaf temperature. The integrated model was used to explore the impact of both warm and exceptionally hot climatic conditions recorded during a heat wave on the microclimate heterogeneity at canopy scale. During warm conditions, larvae in sunlight-exposed mines experienced nearly optimal growth conditions compared with those within shaded mines. The developmental rate was increased by almost 50% in the sunny microhabitat compared with the shaded location. Larvae, however, experienced optimal temperatures for their development inside shaded mines during extreme climatic conditions, whereas larvae in exposed mines were overheating, leading to major risks of mortality. Tree canopies act as both magnifiers and reducers of the climatic regime experienced in open air outside canopies. Favourable and risky spots within the canopy do change as a function of the climatic conditions at the regional scale. The shifting nature of the mosaic of suitable and risky habitats may explain the observed uniform distribution of leaf miners within tree canopies. © 2007 The Authors.

A supplementary strategy is reduction in ammonia (NH3) emissions, yet an evaluation of controls on ammonia has been limited by uncertainties in emission levels and in the cost of control technologies. We use state of the science emission inventories, an emission-based regional air quality model, and an explicit treatment of uncertainty to estimate the cost-effectiveness and uncertainty of ammonia emission reductions on inorganic particulate matter in the Eastern United States. Since a paucity of data on agricultural operations precludes a direct calculation of the costs of ammonia control, we calculate the ""ammonia savings potential"", defined as the minimum cost of applying SO2 and NOx emission controls in order to achieve the same reduction in ambientinorganic PM2.5 concentration as obtained from a 1 ton decrease in ammonia emissions. Using 250scenarios of NH3, SO 2, and NOx emission reductions, we calculate the least-cost SO2 and NOx control scenarios that achieve the same reduction in ambient inorganic PM2.5 concentration as a decrease in ammonia emissions. We find that the lower-bound ammonia savings potential in the winter is $8,000 per ton NH3; therefore, many currently available ammonia control technologies are cost-effective compared to current controls on SO2 and NOx sources. Larger reductions in winter inorganic particulate matter are available at lower cost through controls on ammonia emissions. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Ammonia; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Industrial emissions; Particles (particulate matter); Ammonia emission; Control technologies; Emission controls; Air pollution control; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; Air pollution control; Ammonia; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Industrial emissions; Particles (particulate matter); air quality; ammonia; atmospheric particle; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; emission inventory; environmental economics; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; sulfur dioxide; ammonia formation; article; concentration response; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; particulate matter; season; technology; United States; Air Pollution; Ammonia; Computer Simulation; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Models, Economic; Nitrogen Oxides; Particulate Matter; Sulfur Dioxide; Uncertainty; United States; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846216771

Recent results suggest that there is a group of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) (2003 EL61 being the biggest member), with surfaces composed of almost pure water ice and with very similar orbital elements. These objects provide exciting laboratories for the study of the processes that prevent the formation of an evolved mantle of organics on the surfaces of the bodies in the trans-Neptunian belt (TNb). Aims. We study the surface composition of another TNO that moves in a similar orbit, (145453) 2005 RR43, and compare it with the surface composition of the other members of the group. Methods. We report visible and near-infrared spectra in the 0.53-2.4 μm spectral range, obtained with the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope and the 3.58 m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo at the ""Roque de los Muchachos"" Observatory (La Palma, Spain). Scattering models are used to derive information about its surface composition. We also measure the depth D of the water ice absorption bands and compare with those of the other members of the group. Results. The spectrum of 2005 RR43 is neutral in color in the visible and dominated by very deep water ice absorption bands in the near infrared (D = 70.3 ± 2.1% and 82.8 ± 4.9% at 1.5 μm and 2.0 μm respectively). It is very similar to the spectrum of the group of TNOs already mentioned. All of them present much deeper water ice absorption bands (D &gt; 40%) than any other TNO except Charon. Scattering models show that its surface is covered by water ice, a significant fraction in crystalline state with no trace (5% upper limit) of complex organics. Possible scenarios to explain the existence of this population of TNOs are discussed: a giant collision, an originally carbon depleted composition, or a common process of continuous resurfacing. Conclusions. 2005 RR43 is member of a group, may be a population, of TNOs clustered in the space of orbital parameters that show abundant water ice and no signs of complex organics and which origin needs to be further investigated. The lack of complex organics in their surfaces suggests a significant smaller fraction of carbonaceous volatiles like CH4 in this population than in ""normal"" TNOs. A carbon depleted population of TNOs could be the origin of the population of carbon depleted Jupiter family comets already noticed by A'Hearn et al.

This package implements the adjoint and Hessian codes, generated using automatic differentiation techniques, of a cost function balancing (1) the deviation from the a priori knowledge on the model parameter values and (2) the misfit between the observed remote-sensing fluxes and the two-stream model simulations. The individual weights of these contributions are specified notably via covariance matrices of the uncertainties in the a priori knowledge on the model parameters and the measurements. The proposed procedure delivers a Gaussian approximation of the PDFs of the retrieved model parameter values. The a posteriori covariance matrix is further exploited to evaluate, in turn, the posterior probability density functions of the radiant fluxes simulated by the two-stream model, including those that are not measured, for example, the fraction of radiation absorbed in the ground. Applications are conducted using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) broadband surface albedo products. It turns out that the differences between these two albedo sets may translate into discernible signatures on some retrieved model parameters. Meanwhile, adding the Joint Research Centre (JRC)-Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) products into the measurements yields a significant reduction of uncertainties. Results from these applications indicate that the products retrieved from the two-stream inversion procedure (1) exhibit much less variability than those generated by the operational algorithms for the LAI and FAPAR, and (2) are in good agreement with the available ground-based estimates.

Scientists find it difficult to accurately quantify and communicate uncertainty; business stakeholders find it difficult to plan for the future; and policymakers are challenged to balance competing interests that frequently talk past each other. Most emissions trading programs to date have focused on absolute caps that either remain fixed or decline over time. Examples include the US SO2 trading program and NOx Budget Program, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), Southern California’s NO RECLAIM program, and a host of other regional pollutant trading schemes in the United States. Even the Kyoto Protocol, by most accounts, is viewed as a first step in capping emissions that must then lead to even lower levels in subsequent periods. Yet the uncertainty surrounding climate change suggests that such an approach to regulating greenhouse gas emissions is problematic. On the one hand, we are unsure about what atmospheric concentrations need to be in the long run to prevent dangerous interference with the climate system. And regardless of the stabilization target, considerations of the global economic system and its dependence on fossil fuels suggests that optimal global emissions trajectories will continue to grow for some time (Wigley et al., 1996; Manne and Richels, 1999). © Cambridge University Press 2007, Cambridge University Press, 2010.",,"Budget control; Commerce; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; International law; Atmospheric concentration; Costs and benefits; Emissions trading program; EU Emissions Trading Scheme; Global climate changes; Regional pollutants; Southern California; Stabilization target; Climate change",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927037827

What defines success? One way to answer this question is to view the problem through the eyes of a stylized grouping of experts and stakeholders engaged in the issue: economists, environmental advocates, and technologists. Economists would likely describe the goal as maximizing welfare; that is, setting a global policy that balances expected costs and benefits of mitigation. Environmental advocates, and indeed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), describe a goal of preventing dangerous interference with the climate system. Like the Clean Air Act in the United States, it suggests first consulting the science to establish a safe standard, then following up with a cost-effective (i.e., least-cost strategy) to achieve it. Alternatively, the goal might be described by technologists as the need to develop and deploy climate friendly technology at a global level, without a heavy emphasis on near-term emission reductions.Such stylized views typically lead to straw-man conclusions about the design of an agreement – agreements that are easily knocked down by practical critiques. Yet considering these straw men can help point us to an alternate, more practical goal. That is, the goal might be to encourage some balance of domestic mitigation and technology development across individual countries in the near term – embracing a fairly wide range of efforts driven by domestic capacity in each nation – while laying the groundwork for a more coordinated international mitigation effort in the future. © Cambridge University Press 2007.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924124781

Consequently, an increase of building energy performance can constitute an important instrument in the efforts to alleviate the EU energy import dependency and comply with the Kyoto Protocol to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. This is also in accordance to the European Directive on the energy performance of buildings (EPBD), which has come to effect on 4 January 2006. The energy performance assessment for existing dwellings (EPA-ED) is a new methodology supported by software, developed in the framework of a European project that focuses on energy related issues for existing residential buildings, in line with the EPBD. This paper presents an overview of the method and software that can be used to perform building energy audits and assess buildings in a uniform way, perform demand and savings calculations, provide owners with specific advice for measures to improve energy performance, issue an energy performance certificate for existing buildings, and include some representative results from the pilot studies performed in several European countries. Also the sister-method EPA-NR, on non-residential buildings, currently under construction, is introduced. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In general, the conductivity of molecular sieve carbon electrodes in electrolyte solutions strongly depends on their potential. While porous carbon electrodes exhibit the expected behavior, namely, a parabolic dependence of the conductivity on the potential, with a minimum at the PZC, an unusual trend is observed in the case of porous carbon electrodes in concentrated aqueous KCl solutions. That is, a monotonic dependence of the conductivity on the potential is measured. Conductivity vs. potential measurements in solutions of different pH values were conducted in order to elucidate the role of H+ in electro-adsorption processes of porous carbon electrodes, even in neutral solutions. Under these conditions (i.e., high salt concentrations), the potential region of cation electro-adsorption becomes wider (&gt;1 V). This cation electro-adsorption within a wide potential range leads to the monotonous dependence of the conductivity on the electrodes' potential. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Plants usually respond to carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment by increasing photosynthesis and reducing transpiration, but these initial responses to CO2 may not be sustained. 2. During May, July and October 2000, we measured the effects of temporarily increasing or decreasing CO2 concentration by 150-200 μmol mol-1 on daytime net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and water flux (evapotranspiration, ET) of C3-C4 grassland in central Texas, USA that had been exposed for three growing seasons to a CO2 gradient from 200 to 560 μmol mol-1. Grassland grown at subambient CO2 (&lt; 365 μmol mol-1) was exposed for 2 days to an elevated CO2 gradient (&gt; 365 μmol mol-1). Grassland grown at elevated CO2 was exposed for 2 days to a subambient gradient. Our objective was to determine whether growth CO2 affected the amount by which grassland NEE and ET responded to CO2 switching (sensitivity to CO2). 3. The NEE per unit of leaf area was greater (16-20%) and ET was smaller (9-20%), on average, at the higher CO2 concentration during CO2 switching in May and July. The amount by which NEE increased at the higher CO2 level was smaller at elevated than subambient growth concentrations on both dates, but relationships between NEE response and growth CO2 were weak. Conversely, the effect of temporary CO2 change on ET did not depend on growth CO2. 4. The ratio of NEE at high CO2 to NEE at low CO2 during CO2 change in July increased from 1.0 to 1.26 as the contribution of C3 cover to total cover increased from 26% to 96%. Conversely, in May, temporary CO2 enrichment reduced ET more in C4- than C3-dominated grassland. 5. For this mesic grassland, sensitivity of NEE and ET to brief change in CO2 depended as much on the C 3-C4 composition of vegetation as on physiological adjustments related to prior CO2 exposure. © 2006 British Ecological Society.","Acclimation; CO2 enrichment; Net ecosystem CO2 exchange; Subambient CO2","acclimation; C3 plant; C4 plant; carbon dioxide enrichment; carbon flux; ecophysiology; evapotranspiration; grassland; growth response; net ecosystem exchange; North America; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846192732

This negative correlation is most likely caused by a trade-off between carbon allocation to growth vs. allocation to defense and storage. Nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) stored in stems allow plants to overcome periods of stress and should enhance survival. In order to assess how species differ in carbohydrate storage in relation to juvenile light requirements, growth, and survival, we quantified NSC concentrations and pool sizes in sapling stems of 85 woody species in moist semi-evergreen and dry deciduous tropical forests in the rainy season in Bolivia. Moist forest species averaged higher NSC concentrations than dry forest species. Carbohydrate concentrations and pool sizes decreased with the light requirements of juveniles of the species in the moist forest but not in the dry forest. Combined, these results suggest that storage is especially important for species that regenerate in persistently shady habitats, as in the understory of moist evergreen forests. For moist forest species, sapling survival rates increased with NSC concentrations and pool sizes while growth rates declined with the NSC concentrations and pool sizes. No relationships were found for dry forest species. Carbon allocation to storage contributes to the growth-survival trade-off through its positive effect on survival. And, a continuum in carbon storage strategies contributes to a continuum in light requirements among species. The link between storage and light requirements is especially strong in moist evergreen forest where species sort out along a light gradient, but disappears in dry deciduous forest where light is a less limiting resource and species sort out along drought and fire gradients. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","Bolivia; Growth-survival trade-off; Shade tolerance; Starch; Sugar; Total nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC); Tropical forest","rain; biomass allocation; carbohydrate; dry forest; growth rate; light effect; plant community; shade tolerance; species pool; starch; survival; tropical forest; adaptation; article; Bolivia; carbohydrate metabolism; growth, development and aging; metabolism; physiology; season; seedling; species difference; sunlight; survival; tree; tropic climate; Adaptation, Physiological; Bolivia; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Rain; Seasons; Seedling; Species Specificity; Sunlight; Survival; Trees; Tropical Climate; Bolivia; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247355524

Yet there continues to be concern that public policy efforts to improve air quality may not produce actual improvement in human health. Objectives: This study retrospectively explored a natural experiment associated with a copper smelter strike from 15 July 1967 through the beginning of April 1968. Methods: In the 1960s, copper smelters accounted for approximately 90% of all sulfate emissions in the four Southwest states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada. Over the 8.5-month strike period, a regional improvement in visibility accompanied an approximately 60% decrease in concentrations of suspended sulfate particles. We collected monthly mortality counts for 1960-1975 and analyzed them using Poisson regression models. Results: The strike-related estimated percent decrease in mortality was 2.5% (95% confidence interval, 1.1-4.0%), based on a Poisson regression model that controlled for time trends, mortality counts in bordering states, and nationwide mortality counts for influenza/pneumonia, cardiovascular, and other respiratory deaths. Conclusions: These results contribute to the growing body of evidence that ambient sulfate particulate matter and related air pollutants are adversely associated with human health and that the reduction in this pollution can result in reduced mortality.","Air pollution; Copper smelter; Mortality; Natural experiment; Particulate matter; Sulfates","copper; sulfate; sulfur oxide; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; article; cardiovascular disease; confidence interval; environmental impact assessment; human; influenza; mortality; particulate matter; pneumonia; Poisson distribution; priority journal; public health; respiratory tract disease; retrospective study; smelter; suspended particulate matter; United States; Air Pollution; Copper; Environmental Monitoring; Geography; Humans; Metallurgy; Mortality; Particulate Matter; Southwestern United States; Strikes, Employee; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249003733

The energy figures are then compared with the Province's renewable energy potential. Results indicate that electric trolley buses and the automated rapid transit SkyTrain were eight times as energy efficient as private vehicles. These two modes were also 100 times as emission efficient as private vehicles in terms of greenhouse gas emitted per passenger-kilometer. Analysis of a minimal greenhouse gas emissions scenario, based on local renewable energy resources, electrolytic hydrogen production, and conversion of all private vehicles to fuel-cell technology indicates that such a strategy would utilize between 40% and 60% of the Province's renewable energy resources.

Developing countries like India depend heavily on oil import. Diesel being the main transport fuel in India, finding a suitable alternative to diesel is an urgent need. Jatropha based bio-diesel (JBD) is a non-edible, renewable fuel suitable for diesel engines and is receiving increasing attention in India because of its potential to generate large-scale employment and relatively low environmental degradation. Diesel engines running on JBD are found to emit higher oxides of nitrogen, NOx. HOT EGR, a low cost technique of exhaust gas recirculation, is effectively used in this work to overcome this environmental penalty. Practical problems faced while using a COOLED EGR system are avoided with HOT EGR. Results indicated higher nitric oxide (NO) emissions when a single cylinder diesel engine was fuelled with JBD, without EGR. NO emissions were reduced when the engine was operated under HOT EGR levels of 5-25%. However, EGR level was optimized as 15% based on adequate reduction in NO emissions, minimum possible smoke, CO, HC emissions and reasonable brake thermal efficiency. Smoke emissions of JBD in the higher load region were lower than diesel, irrespective of the EGR levels. However, smoke emission was higher in the lower load region. CO and HC emissions were found to be lower for JBD irrespective of EGR levels. Combustion parameters were found to be comparable for both fuels. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

These factors make HHG an increasingly important source of soft X-rays and an excellent resource in many emerging areas, for example, the time-resolved study of conformational changes in single biological molecules. Here, we demonstrate a novel technique that enables us to reconstruct spectral information spatially across an X-ray beam. As only a single diffraction image is required per measurement, this technique is well suited to time-resolved studies. This technique is applicable to many types of X-ray source and can be adapted for different spectral regions.

Because of this central position in plant metabolism, amino acid metabolism is tightly regulated by numerous factors to match both demand from the organs and availability of reduced carbon and inorganic nitrogen. While the amino acid biosynthesis enzymes have been shown to be regulated at the transcriptional and protein levels, the genes involved in amino acid sensing, signal transduction and regulation have not yet been identified. The overexpression of Glutamine Dumper1 leads to a large increase in the amino acid content of the plant and, as we show here, to insensitivity to externally applied amino acids. This phenorype is reminiscent of that of the pig1-1 mutant proposed to display a deregulated metabolism. These data suggest that GDU1 is involved in the regulation of amino acid metabolism and transport. As published previously, the analysis of deletion mutants proves that GDU1's VIMAG domain is important for the function of the protein. The present data show furthermore that other regions participate to this function. ©2007 Landes Bioscience.","Amino acid metabolism; Arabidopsis thaliana; Biosynthesis enzyme; Feedback regulation; Regulation; Structure-function relationships","Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39549095092

This analysis allows the extraction of information not available by standard methods. In particular, rainfall temporal aggregation patterns associated with different climates are characterized by means of exponents derived from the resulting scaling laws. The analogy with linguistic analysis is obtained using a particular coding of precipitation as a discrete variable with four states (corresponding to four standard precipitation thresholds); each weekly symbolic sequence of observed precipitation is considered as a ""word"", and each local station defines a ""language"" characterized by the observed words in a period representative of the climatology. To characterize these precipitation languages, we obtained characteristic exponents derived from the Zipf law for a set of representative stations of the main Köppen's climates and subclimates. We found different scaling behaviors for different subclimates, given by a single exponent in the range 0.6 (humid tropical climates) to 1.4 (polar climates); some humid middle-latitude subclimates exhibit a crossover with two different characteristic exponents corresponding to high and low frequency aggregation patterns (no explanation for this behavior is provided). As an application of the proposed methodology, the same analysis was applied to stochastic time series obtained from standard weather generators. We found that the language defined by a first-order Markov process agrees with the observed language of the observed series. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Already, air pollution is a major issue in an increasing number of megacities around the world, and new policies to address urban air pollution are likely to be enacted in many developing countries irrespective of the participation of these countries in any explicit future climate policies. The emissions of gases and microscopic particles (aerosols) that are important in air pollution and climate are often highly correlated because of shared generating processes. Most important among these processes is combustion of fossil fuels and biomass which produces carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), black carbon (BC) aerosols, and sulfur oxides (SOx, consisting of some sulfate aerosols, but mostly SO2 gas which subsequently forms white sulfate aerosols). In addition, the atmospheric lifecycles of common air pollutants such as CO, NOx and VOCs, and of the climatically important methane (CH4) and sulfate aerosols, both involve the fast photochemistry of the hydroxyl free radical (OH). Hydroxyl radicals are the dominant “cleansing” chemical in the atmosphere, annually removing about 3.7 gigatonnes (1 GT = 1015 g) of reactive trace gases from the atmosphere; while the environmental impact of each gas is different, this amount is similar to the total mass of carbon removed annually from the atmosphere by the land and ocean combined (Ehhalt, 1999; Prinn, 2003). © Cambridge University Press 2007, Cambridge University Press, 2010.",,"Aerosols; Air pollution; Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Climate models; Developing countries; Environmental impact; Free radicals; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Pollution control; Sulfur compounds; Sulfur dioxide; Volatile organic compounds; Black carbon aerosol; Global system models; Highly-correlated; Hydroxyl free radicals; Hydroxyl radicals; Microscopic particle; Sulfate aerosols; Urban air pollution; Air pollution control",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350707457

Ashland Avenue, Chicago, IL 60607, United States","The cydABCD operon of Bacillus subtilis encodes products required for the production of cytochrome bd oxidase. Previous work has shown that one regulatory protein, YdiH (Rex), is involved in the repression of this operon. The work reported here confirms the role of Rex in the negative regulation of the cydABCD operon. Two additional regulatory proteins for the cydABCD operon were identified, namely, ResD, a response regulator involved in the regulation of respiration genes, and CcpA, the carbon catabolite regulator protein. ResD, but not ResE, was required for full expression of the cydA promoter in vivo. ResD binding to the cydA promoter between positions -58 and -107, a region which includes ResD consensus binding sequences, was not enhanced by phosphorylation. A ccpA mutant had increased expression from the full-length cydA promoter during stationary growth compared to the wild-type strain. Maximal expression in a ccpA mutant was observed from a 3′-deleted cydA promoter fusion that lacked the Rex binding region, suggesting that the effect of the two repressors, Rex and CcpA, was cumulative. CcpA binds directly to the cydA promoter, protecting the region from positions -4 to -33, which contains sequences similar to the CcpA consensus binding sequence, the ere box. CcpA binding was enhanced upon addition of glucose-6-phosphate, a putative cofactor for CcpA. Mutation of a conserved residue in the cre box reduced CcpA binding 10-fold in vitro and increased cydA expression in vivo. Thus, CcpA and ResD, along with the previously identified cydA regulator Rex (YdiH), affect the expression of the cydABCD operon. Low-level induction of the cydA promoter was observed in vivo in the absence of its regulatory proteins, Rex, CcpA, and ResD. This complex regulation suggests that the cydA promoter is tightly regulated to allow its expression only at the appropriate time and under the appropriate conditions.

The energy surface, consisting of many stationary points with several atom connectivities like chain (linear and non linear), planar, rings, tetrahedral (Td) and three-dimensional geometries, has been analyzed in search of the minima. Comparing only the most stable isomers in the two PES it is observed that there are no common structures. It has also been observed that on the Si-PES there is only one very low lying minimum, a Td like structure and all other isomers are more than 30 kcal/mol higher in relative energy. Unlike this in the C-series there are around three low-lying minima with very little energy difference among them. These are the chain isomer (C2) and the isomers showing higher symmetry like C2v and D3h. The Td structure is of very high energy in this series. Natural bond orbital analysis (NBO) has been carried out for the most stable isomers in both series to understand the bonding nature. Here both the localization and delocalization energy has been estimated. The most stable structure in the Si-series is the one with the largest localization energy unlike in the case of carbon series where the stability of the most stable isomer compared to the Td structure is due to the delocalization energy.

Such interactions are ubiquitous, yet changes in LULC are generally made without regard to their biophysical implications. This review considers the potential for LULC to compound, confound, or even contradict changes expected from climate change alone. These properties give LULC the potential to be used as powerful tools capable of modifying local climate and contributing significantly to the net impact of climate change. Management practices based modifications of LULC patterns and processes could be applied strategically to increase the resilience of vulnerable ecological systems and facilitate climate adaptation. These interventions build on the traditional competencies of land management and land protection organizations and suggest that these institutions have a central role in determining the ecological impact of climate change and the development of strategies for adaptation. The practical limits to the use of LULC-based tools also suggest important inflection points between manageable and dangerous levels of climate change. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",,"Climate change; Ecology; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Societies and institutions; Strategic planning; Ecological impact; Ecological systems; Environmental variability; Land cover; Land use; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; ecosystem resilience; environmental management; environmental policy; land cover; land use; management practice; strategic approach",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846603121

Measurements of the auroral location, form, spatial extent and dosing conditions were applied to specify the component of auroral 4.3 μm radiance due to the slowly produced and optically thick CO2 V3 (001-000) transition. An analysis based on the Auroral Atmospheric Radiance Code (AARC) indicates: (1) the emission originates near and beyond the tangent point; (2) the optically thick CO2 23 radiation is largely self absorbed by the intervening atmosphere; and (3) the auroral enhancement is predominantly due to NO+ △v = 1 vibrational state transitions. In addition, the analysis indicates that the previously reported laboratory result for the NO+ v ≥ 1 vibrational yield from the reaction, N+ + O2 is insufficient to account for the observed 4.3 μm emission. In order to explain the current results, we propose that there is additional production from the reaction, N2+ + O, forming NO+ in vibrational levels 0, 1, and 2 with relative populations of approximately 0.25, 0.5, and 0.25, respectively. The combined production processes yield an energetic electron induced efficiency of 0.56 ±0.18 photons per auroral ion pair for NO+ △v = 1 emission at altitudes equal to or greater than 112 km.

Calculations were performed using a Particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collisions (PIC/MCC) code with the secondary emission model adjusted to include the energy dependence of the secondary electron yield at large separations as well as the enhancement of the secondary emission coefficient in microgaps. Furthemore, in the presence of the magnetic field, the breakdown voltage has been determined taking into account the effect of both the equivalent pressure and the variation of Townsend's second coefficient in a magnetic field. The obtained simulation results clearly show that a proper choice of the secondary emission model in the PIC/MCC code may lead to a gratifying agreement with the experimental results for the breakdown voltage. The results discussed in this paper indicate that PIC/MCC code with the improved secondary emission models provides a good physical description of plasma for various gap sizes, not only in the presence of the electric field, but also under the simultanious action of both electric and magnetic fields. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547230718

This modelling approach imposes additional charges on electricity generation, which reflect the costs of environmental and health damages from local pollutants (SO2, NOx) and climate change, wastes, occupational health, risk of accidents, noise and other burdens. Technologies allowing abatement of pollutants emitted from power plants are rapidly introduced into the energy system, for example, desulphurisation, NOx removal, and CO2 scrubbers. The modelling results indicate substantial changes in the electricity production system in favour of natural gas combined cycle, nuclear power and renewables induced by internalisation of external costs and also efficiency loss due to the use of scrubbers. Structural changes and fuel switching in the electricity sector result in significant reduction of emissions of both local pollution and CO2 over the modelled time period. Strong decarbonisation impact of internalising local externalities suggests that ancillary benefits can be expected from policies directly addressing other issues then CO2 mitigation. Finally, the detailed analysis of the total generation cost of different technologies points out that inclusion of external cost in the price of electricity increases competitiveness of non-fossil generation sources and fossil power plants with emission control. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Competing hypotheses have typically been evaluated with correlative models that do not explicitly incorporate the mechanisms responsible for biotic diversity gradients. Here, we employ a fundamentally different approach that uses spatially explicit Monte Carlo models of the placement of cohesive geographical ranges in an environmentally heterogeneous landscape. These models predict species richness of endemic South American birds (2248 species) measured at a continental scale. We demonstrate that the principal single-factor and composite (species-energy, water-energy and temperature-kinetics) models proposed thus far fail to predict (r2≤0.05) the richness of species with small to moderately large geographical ranges (first three range-size quartiles). These species constitute the bulk of the avifauna and are primary targets for conservation. Climate-driven models performed reasonably well only for species with the largest geographical ranges (fourth quartile) when range cohesion was enforced. Our analyses suggest that present models inadequately explain the extraordinary diversity of avian species in the montane tropics, the most species-rich region on Earth. Our findings imply that correlative climatic models substantially underestimate the importance of historical factors and small-scale niche-driven assembly processes in shaping contemporary species-richness patterns. © 2006 The Royal Society.","Climate-based models; Diversity gradients; Mid-domain effect; South American avifauna; Spatially explicit stochastic models; Species richness patterns","avifauna; bird; diversity index; endemic species; landscape; Monte Carlo analysis; range size; species conservation; species richness; stochasticity; article; bird; climate; Monte Carlo method; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; South America; species diversity; species richness; stochastic model; animal; biodiversity; bird; comparative study; demography; environmental protection; geographic information system; geography; methodology; physiology; temperature; theoretical model; Aves; Animals; Biodiversity; Birds; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Demography; Geographic Information Systems; Geography; Models, Theoretical; Monte Carlo Method; South America; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39049176557

Mycorrhizal fungi, known to enhance nutrient uptake by plants, may play a role in organic N uptake, particularly ericoid mycorrhizas. We asked the question-Can mycorrhizal fungi increase the ability of plants to take up organic N, compared to inorganic N? Here, we report on the abilities of three plant species, ericoid mycorrhizal Rhododendron macrophyllum and Vaccinium ovatum and arbuscular mycorrhizal Cupressus goveniana ssp. pigmaea, to acquire C and/or N from an organic and an inorganic N source. All three species are native to a California coastal pygmy forest growing in acidic, low-fertility, highly organic soils. In a pot study, glycine-α13C, 15N and 15N-ammonium were applied to pygmy forest soil for 17 or 44 h. Ericoid mycorrhizal species did not demonstrate a preference for either inorganic or organic sources of N while Cupressus acquired more NH4-N than glycine-N. For all species, glycine-N uptake did not increase after 17 h suggesting glycine uptake and glycine immobilization occurred rapidly. Both glycine-N and glycine-C were recovered in shoots and in roots suggesting that all species acquired some N in organic form. Regression analyses of glycine-N and glycine-C recovery in root tissue indicate that much of the glycine was taken up intact and that the minimum proportion of glycine-N recovered in organic form was 85% (Cupressus) and 70% (Rhododendron). Regressions were non-significant for Vaccinium. For all species, glycine-N remained predominantly in roots while glycine-C was transferred to shoots. In contrast, NH4-N remained in roots of ericoid plants but was transferred to shoots of arbuscular mycorrhizal Cupressus. Since net N mineralization rates in pygmy forest soils are low, our results suggest that organic N may be an important N source for plants in this temperate coniferous ecosystem regardless of mycorrhizal type. Acquisition of amino acid C by these species also may partially offset the carbon cost to plants of hosting mycorrhizal fungi. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

PL and EL spectra of 2,7-bis(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylethenyl)-9,9- diethylfluorene (OFPV) blended with &lt; 1 % by weight of OFOPV gives significant green region (g-band) emission in addition to the normal blue emission of OFPV. Monomeric OFOPV produced by adventitious oxidation is therefore identified as giving g-band emission in thermally stressed OFPV-based OLEDs, due to intermolecular energy transfer from OFPV excitons to lower energy OFOPV. The red emission in neat solid-phase OFOPV and pFOPV appear to arise from fluorenone-type excimers that do not play a direct role in g-band emission in this case. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Fluorenones; Luminescence properties; Phase photoluminescence (PL); Polymethylenes; Band structure; Block copolymers; Molecular structure; Oligomers; Phosphors; Photoluminescence; Ketones",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547314418

Mitigation and adaptation have been considered separately in the global negotiations as well as literature. There is a realization on the need to explore and promote synergy between mitigation and adaptation while addressing climate change. In this paper, an attempt is made to explore the synergy between mitigation and adaptation by considering forest sector, which on the one hand is projected to be adversely impacted under the projected climate change scenarios and on the other provide opportunities to mitigate climate change. Thus, the potential and need for incorporating adaptation strategies and practices in mitigation projects is presented with a few examples. Firstly, there is a need to ensure that mitigation programs or projects do not increase the vulnerability of forest ecosystems and plantations. Secondly, several adaptation practices could be incorporated into mitigation projects to reduce vulnerability. Further, many of the mitigation projects indeed reduce vulnerability and promote adaptation, for example; forest and biodiversity conservation, protected area management and sustainable forestry. Also, many adaptation options such as urban forestry, soil and water conservation and drought resistant varieties also contribute to mitigation of climate change. Thus, there is need for research and field demonstration of synergy between mitigation and adaptation, so that the cost of addressing climate change impacts can be reduced and co-benefits increased. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.","Forest ecosystems; Forest sector mitigation; Mitigation and adaptation synergy; Vulnerability of forests","adaptation; biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; conservation management; cost-benefit analysis; forest ecosystem; forest management; mitigation; protected area; sustainable forestry; synergism; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447098230

The North American monsoon is an annual precipitation regime that begins in early June in Mexico and progresses northward to the southwestern United States. The region includes stakeholders in large urban complexes, productive agricultural areas, and sparsely populated and and semiarid ecosystems. The political, cultural, and socioeconomic divisions between the United States and Mexico create a broad range of sensitivities to climate variability as well as capacities to use forecasts and other information to cope with climate. This paper highlights methodologies to link climate science with society and to analyze opportunities for monsoon science to benefit society in four sectors: natural hazards management, agriculture, public health, and water management. A list of stakeholder needs and a calendar of decisions is synthesized to help scientists link user needs to potential forecasts and products. To ensure usability of forecasts and other research products, iterative scientist-stakeholder interactions, through integrated assessments, are recommended. These knowledge-exchange interactions can improve the capacity for stakeholders to use forecasts thoughtfully and inform the development of research, and for the research community to obtain feedback on climate-related products and receive insights to guide research direction. It is expected that integrated assessments can capitalize on the opportunities for monsoon science to inform decision making and, in the best instances, reduce regional climate vulnerabilities and enhance regional sustainability. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climate change; Decision making; Environmental protection; Rain; Research and development management; Weather forecasting; Wind; Climate science; Climate vulnerabilities; Monsoon; Monsoon research; Monsoon science; Climatology; annual variation; climate variation; decision making; forecasting method; monsoon; precipitation assessment; regional climate; semiarid region; Mexico [North America]; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249747940

Focused on an efficient land use development a Qualitative Model to the household location decisions builds the centre part of the work. It can deliver inputs to policy and plan making and is a truly new approach to suburbanisation. The work builds on the assumption that old industrial Western urban regions and those in post-socialist contexts bear substantial similarities which is shown for Leipzig/Germany and Wirral/UK. Along four major research question following aspects have been investigated: (1) the urban/suburban population development in the last 50 years (urban life cycle model), (2) the main reasons for households to move to the urban fringes and (3) the consequences this has caused, (4) the possibilities to act against urban sprawl using the qualitative model that suggests leverage points to the dynamics between households. The dynamic model produces qualitative scenarios about the actors population in dependence of the attractivity of the residential area and the interactions of movers onto the attractivity. With respect to suggestions for policy and plan making aiming at lowering the rates of sprawl the qualitative model suggests that internal dynamics cannot halt urban sprawl in both regions. In Wirral a perpetuating development from low to high demand is projected for the suburban places leaving only a shortening of the high demand phases as intervention possibility. This is to achieve by enabling adequate housing for young couples in the inner urban areas and lower house prices in the suburbs. In Leipzig less sprawl would be achieved if single households are attracted to the fringes. They are changing the attractiveness for other households. As this is not very likely from the present perspective strong planning intervention is needed to change the internal dynamics through external (planning) actions. The model has proven to be useful to support plan making. These efforts are assumed to contribute to a higher awareness of and a joint action against climate change with lower energy consumption and lower land use change in urban regions.",,"land use change; location decision; migration; policy making; qualitative analysis; suburbanization; urban area; urban development; urban population; Central Europe; England; Eurasia; Europe; Germany; Leipzig; Liverpool [England]; Saxony; United Kingdom; Western Europe; Wirral",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548277050

Correlation and regression analyses of empirical data from the settlement structure, the traffic structure and income have found that the number of jobs per district and the share of the well-off population can best describe the CO2 emissions from traffic in Berlin. Also the number of residents, the total built area, the number of cars and the amount of traffic area are positively related to the dependent variable. Therefore, the possibilities to reduce CO2 emissions from road traffic for urban planners seem limited: a restriction of space dedicated to traffic and a change of transport means for commuting represent leverage points, according to the analysis. The other significant indicators are less able to be influenced by local and regional decision-makers - an alteration in the means of mobility to less CO2 emitting alternatives is needed if CO2 emissions from road traffic are extensively to be decreased.",,"anthropogenic effect; carbon dioxide; correlation; emission control; regression analysis; statistical analysis; traffic emission; urban planning; Berlin; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247551223

Twenty-five interviews and four focus groups with farmers were used to identify climate risks on farms, and to document farmers' responses to conditions and risks associated with climate and weather. The information collected describes a complex decision-making environment, with many forces both external and internal to the farm operation influencing management decisions. Within this environment, climate and weather are consistently referred to as a significant force influencing both farm operations and management decisions. Farmers have, however, developed a wide-range of anticipatory and reactive management strategies to manage climate risks. While these have potential to address future climate-related risks and opportunities, there are limits to adaptation, and an increase in the frequency of extreme events may exceed their adaptive capacities. Farmers are also generally unaware and/or unconcerned about future climate change, which could constrain opportunities to adopt long-term climate change adaptations. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Adaptive capacity; Agricultural adaptation; Climate change; Climate risk; Exposure; Farmers; Perception of climate; Vulnerability","adaptive management; agricultural application; climate change; climate variation; decision making; farmers attitude; farmers knowledge; local participation; risk assessment; Canada; North America; Ontario [Canada]; Perth [Ontario]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247323487

Biological and physico-chemical experiments were coupled with a view to developing a new rapid assessment method of bottom ash quality. Bottom ash had different total organic carbon contents ranging from 8.8 g kg-1 to 37.4 g kg-1. A part of this organic carbon can be leached into the environment or provide a substrate for microbial activity. Samples showed really different behaviors regarding these processes. Comparative results of leaching tests and biodegradation experiments showed a positive correlation between dissolved organic carbon and microbial activity. However, quantities of biodegraded or leached carbon are not representative of the samples' total organic carbon content. Thermal analyses in oxidizing conditions have revealed the presence of two fractions of organic components, showing different thermal behaviors. The associated mass losses were measured and compared to dissolved organic carbon. One of the two fractions can be directly linked to the leachable and easily biodegradable organic matter fraction. Calorimetric test is then presented as a novel analysis method that allows to provide rapid and global information concerning the characteristics of organic matter in bottom ash and its possible short and long-term evolution. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Building energy legislation at EU level is found in EU Directive 93/73/CEE [Directive 93/73/EEC of the Council of 13 September 1993 on the Limitation of the Carbon Dioxide Emissions through the Improvement of Energy Efficiency (SAVE) 1993], EU directive 2002/91/CE called Energy Performance of Buildings Directive EPBD [Directive 2002/91/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on the Energy Performance of Buildings] and the EU Green Paper [Commission of the European Committees, Green Paper, Towards an European Strategy for the Security of Energy Supply, Brussels, 2000]. This give a clear view of the need and priority that the EU has for reducing energy consumption in the building sector, both for furthering in compliance of international agreements (Kyoto protocol and forthcoming commitments) as well as for reducing its energy dependency, and hence for leading its development towards sustainability. The implementation of the EPBD has as its primary aim the establishment and application of energy certification programs. The aim of energy certification programs is to guarantee energy saving and to reduce CO2 emission as a consequence of the EU commitment to comply with the Kyoto protocol. Obtaining energy effectiveness labelling means the achievement of energy quality, allowing a decrease in CO2 kilograms emitted from lighting, heating and cooling buildings without any loss in terms of comfort. This work proposes a new methodology called Building Energy Analysis (BEA) that allows implementation of EPBD on energy certification of buildings. In this paper we analyse the different steps of BEA methodology (heat and cooling load, energy demand, energy consumption and CO2 emission). The program ends with energy labelling of the building. In addition, we present a practical study of a small health centre that is analyzed with BEA methodology and we compare it with other energy simulation programs like Hourly Analysis Program (HAP) and PowerDOE. The results of energy labelling are very similar for both simulation programs. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Until recently the focus of CHP system development has been primarily on medium-scale commercial applications in a limited number of market segments where clear value propositions lead to short term payback. Small-scale integrated CHP systems that show promise of achieving economic viability through significant improvements in fuel utilization have received increased attention lately. In this paper the economic potential is quantified for small-scale (microgrid) integrated CHP systems suitable for groups of buildings with aggregate electric loads in the 15-120 kW range. Technologies are evaluated for community building groups (CBGs) consisting of aggregation of pure residential entities and combined residential and light commercial entities. Emphasis is on determination of the minimum load size (i.e., the smallest electric and thermal load for a given CBG that is supplied with electric, heating, cooling power from a CHP) for which a microgrid CHP system is both technically and economically viable. In this paper, the operation of the CHP system is parallel with the public utility grid at all times, i.e., the grid is interconnected. Evaluations of CHP technology options using simulation studies in a ""three-dimensional"" space (CHP technology option, CBG load aggregation, and geographical location in the USA) were evaluated based on comparisons of net present value (NPV). The simulations indicated that as electric load increases, the viability of the CHP system (independent of the system's size) becomes more favorable. Exceeding a system runtime (utilization) of 70% was shown to pass the break-even line in the NPV analysis. Finally, geographic location was found to have a relatively weak effect on the reported trends. These results suggest that microgrid CHP systems have the potential to be economically viable with relative independence of geographic location if adequately sized to match the specific load requirements.

Screening of potential introductions is widely applied for assessing the risk of species becoming invasive. Despite advances in the understanding of the determinants of invasiveness, screening still relies heavily on assessments of the potential of species to 'fit in' to the broad environmental conditions of a target region. Most screening systems ask whether species are native to, or are known to be naturalized or invasive in, regions with 'similar' climatic/environmental conditions to the target region. The level of similarity required to make the species a high-risk introduction is generally not specified. This paper describes a protocol for making such assessments more objective, using South Africa as a test case. Using nonparametric niche-based modelling (generalized additive model; GAM) calibrated on the current distribution of each South African biome, we mapped regions of the world that are climatically similar to South African biomes. Lists were produced of countries with the largest areas climatically similar to South Africa overall, and to each biome separately. Validation of the usefulness of the approach was sought by evaluating whether the main invasive plant species in South African biomes occur naturally, or have adventive ranges, in regions mapped as analogous to South African biomes. A very large part of the world is climatically similar to South Africa, with eight countries having larger areas of land classified as climatically similar to South African biomes than the total area of South Africa. Almost all the most prominent invasive species in South African biomes occur naturally or are invasive outside their natural range in areas with similar climates to those that occur in parts of South Africa. This confirms the value of objective climate matching in screening protocols. We examined climatic conditions for a representative sample of major invasive plants from other parts of the world. The analysis identified several species that are already invasive in regions that have matched climates in South Africa but that are not yet introduced or, if already present, have not yet invaded large areas. For example, the following known invasive species should be considered high-risk species in South African grasslands: Alliaria petiolata, Cytisus scoparius, Gleditsia triacanthos, Heracleum mantegazzianum, Hieracium pilosella, Juniperus communis, Pinus contorta, P. monticola, P. ponderosa, P. sylvestris, Prunus laurcerasus, and P. serotina. Objectively matched climatic regions are also useful as a first-cut assessment when evaluating species with no invasive history. © 2007 The Authors.","Biological invasions; Climate matching; Homoclime analysis; Invasive species; Niche-based modelling; Prediction; Risk assessment","biological invasion; biome; ecosystem modeling; environmental conditions; introduced species; invasive species; niche; plant; risk assessment; spatial distribution; vegetation mapping; Africa; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Alliaria petiolata; Cytisus; Cytisus scoparius; Gleditsia; Gleditsia triacanthos; Heracleum; Heracleum mantegazzianum; Hieracium pilosella; Juniperus; Juniperus communis; Pinus contorta; Prunus; Prunus serotina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247380265

While this represents a step forward, it does not go far enough. We find that, given the uncertainty in the climate system, focusing on atmospheric concentrations is likely to convey a false sense of precision. The causal chain between human activity and impacts is laden with uncertainty. From a benefit–cost perspective, it would be desirable to minimize the sum of mitigation costs and damages. Unfortunately, our ability to quantify and value impacts is limited. For the time being, we must rely on a surrogate. Focusing on temperature rather than on concentrations provides much more information on what constitutes an ample margin of safety. Concentrations mask too many uncertainties that are crucial for policymaking. The climate debate is fraught with uncertainty. In order to better understand the link between human activities and impacts, we must first understand the causal chain between the two, i.e., the relationship between human activities, emissions, concentrations, radiative forcing, temperature, climate, and impacts. The focus of the UNFCCC is on atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Although this represents a major step forward by advancing the debate beyond emissions, it does not go far enough.

More than half of the global annual net primary production of biomass is estimated to occur in the tropics, especially tropical evergreen forest. In temperate forests, increasing temperature may extend the non-frost growing season, and thus increase the CO2 sequestration rate, but some authors have also suggested a negative impact of warming in tropical forests from decreased photosynthetic activity. Using the PL model (Ricker and del Río 2004), we forecast growth of two Mexican tree species after climate warming. The model predicts the high-mountain species Pinus hartwegii Lindl. to decrease its expected relative growth throughout its lifetime by 10.6% as a consequence of a 0.6°C temperature increase; in contrast, the tropical rainforest species Diospyros digyna Jacq. is predicted to increase its expected relative growth throughout its lifetime by 25.4%.

NYPA has in 1997 installed its first cell at the Yonkers Joint Wastewater Treatment Plant in Westchester County, New York. The 200kW phosphoric acid fuel cell was the first in the US to be powered by anaerobic digester gas. The primary motivation for the system was to reduce the emissions associated with digester gas flaring. In 2001, NYPA was experiencing power supply shortages. In order to counter that, NYPA installed ten small natural gas turbines at six sites. NYPA installed eight fuel cells totaling 1.6MW to achieve its targeted emissions reductions. Meanwhile, in 2004, the Department of Natural Resources and Parks in King County began a two-year demonstration of a 1MW molten carbonate fuel cell fueled by wastewater methane from its South Treatment Plant in Renton, Washington.

Several scattered, sector-specific measures indirectly leading to CO2 emissions have been applied or recently approved, but they were mostly implemented to reach other goals (e.g. to improve employment and regional development opportunities, to reduce foreign energy dependency or to increase the competitiveness of national industry by raising its energy efficiency). The following two are worth mentioning: RES-E Promotion. The National Plan for the Promotion of Renewable Energy Sources (NPPES) sets a 12% energy consumption target coming from renewables in 2010 (29% of renewable electricity). This Plan aims to reduce emissions by 28 Mt CO2e annually up to 2010 by substituting renewable energy for conventional energy sources with several measures (particularly the granting of feed-in tariffs to renewable generators). Energy Efficiency and Energy Savings Strategy (2004–2012) aiming at the control of energy-related CO2 emissions by partly subsidising energy-efficient technological change in industrial firms. With the Strategy, CO2 emissions would increase by 58% in 2012 compared to 1990 (instead of a 78% increase). This represents an accumulated reduction of 190 Mt CO2 in 2004–2012. These policies mainly focus on the industry and energy sectors. Measures tackling emissions from other sectors are even more limited. In general, fiscal deductions and exemptions, tax relief, direct subsidies and, to a lesser extent, voluntary agreements are applied in all sectors. © Cambridge University Press 2007 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49049120160

Annual N2O emission rates are estimated with two statistical models, MCROPS and MGRASS, which take account of the impact of changes in land use, climate, and nitrogen-fertilization rate. The models are used to simulate the temporal trend of N2O emissions between 1990 and 2050 for a 10′ latitude and longitude grid. The results are also aggregated to the regional and national scale to facilitate comparison with other studies and national inventories. Changes in climate and land use are derived from the quantitative scenarios developed by the ATEAM project based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (IPCC-SRES) storylines. The average N2O flux for Belgium was estimated to be 8.6 × 106 kgN2O-Nyr-1 (STD = 2.1 × 106 kgN2O-Nyr-1) for the period 1990-2000. Fluxes estimated for a single year (1996) give a reasonable agreement with published results at the national and regional scales for the same year. The scenario-based simulations of future N2O emissions show the strong influence of land-use change. The scenarios A1FI, B1 and B2 produce similar results between 2001 and 2050 with a national emission rate in 2050 of 11.9 × 106 kgN2O-Nyr-1. The A2 scenario, however, is very sensitive to the reduction in agricultural land areas (-14% compared with the 1990 baseline), which results in a reduced emission rate in 2050 of 8.3 × 106 kgN2O-Nyr-1. Neither the climatic change scenarios nor the reduction in nitrogen fertilization rate could explain these results leading to the conclusion that N2O emissions from Belgian agricultural soils will be more markedly affected by changes in agricultural land areas. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Agriculture; Greenhouse gas; Land use scenarios; Nitrous oxide; Regression model; Temporal analysis","agricultural soil; climate change; greenhouse gas; land use change; nitrous oxide; regression analysis; soil emission; spatial variation; temporal variation; Belgium; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Western Europe",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846221065

Most of the literature, however, focuses on assessing the capacity of existing technology to sequester carbon in soils. There is much less discussion in the literature on the social and institutional elements that need to be in place to realize the potential benefits of carbon sequestration. This paper contributes insights in this direction by analyzing a case of community-based pasture management in north-central Mali. The case study challenges common assumptions in carbon sequestration efforts, namely that land resources are devoted to a single use by resident users; have distinct boundaries and fall within identifiable territorial and administrative jurisdictions, and are subject to widely recognized claims and free of conflict. We suggest that this is not always the case. Findings indicate that carbon sequestration projects centered on rangelands need to allow for flexibility in livestock movements and resource availability and to account for the diverging interest of multiple stakeholders, including different types of pastoralists and farmers. We conclude that social capital formation and conflict management are key elements of a carbon sequestration strategy in supports of sustainable and equitable development in the Sahelian region. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In the CHP plant, the generation of heat-and-power follows a joint characteristic, which makes the determination of both the marginal power production cost (MPPC) and the feasible operating region for the plant more complicated than for the power-only generation plant. Due to the interdependence between heat and power production, the power-ramp constraints, which limit how much the power production of a CHP plant may increase or decrease between two successive periods, may also imply constraints on the heat production. In this paper, we investigate the impact of power-ramp constraints on CHP production planning and develop a robust heuristic for dealing with the power-ramp constraints based on the solution to the problem with relaxed ramp-constraints (RRC). Numerical results based on realistic production models show that the heuristic can generate high-quality solutions efficiently. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, methods based on the comparison of speed/acceleration emissions and fuel consumption maps are presented. Significant variations across the speed/acceleration surface indicated that direct emission and fuel consumption impacts were highly dependent on the journey/drive cycle employed.

This has fuelled experimentation with compensation schemes that reward people for managing ecosystems to provide environmental services, based on the premise that positive incentives can lead to changes in land-use practices. In the Americas, such experiments have concentrated on watershed management for hydrological services and on conservation of biodiversity and scenic beauty. If and when international negotiations yield a suitable framework for climate change mitigation, carbon dioxide sequestration could be added to the mix. The prevailing approach to compensation has focused on payments, rather than other possible rewards such as greater provision of local public goods or enhanced social status. In many cases, payment for environmental services (PES) schemes have been characterized by designs that seek the lowest cost possible for achieving environmental goals; concentrate on single environmental services (such as carbon sequestration), sometimes at the expense of other ecosystem services; and accord priority to simplified, largescale ecosystems, preferably controlled by a few people, so as to reduce transaction costs. This approach can have adverse — even devastating — impacts on poor and marginalized rural communities. At the same time, it misses opportunities for tapping into the crucial roles that these communities often play in ecosystem stewardship and the provision of environmental services. When poor communities hold secure rights over lands that provide environmental services, they are most likely to benefit from compensation schemes, and the goals of environmental protection and poverty reduction are mutually supporting. More often, however, community rights to natural resources are limited and insecure. © 2007 James K. Boyce, Sunita Narain, and Elizabeth A.

Geology, geomorphology, vegetation, climate, land use, and anopheline distribution were used as a basis for an ecological classification of the state of Roraima, Brazil, in the northern Amazon Basin, focused on the natural history of malaria and transmission. We used unsupervised maximum likelihood classification, principal components analysis, and weighted overlay with equal contribution analyses to fine-scale thematic maps that resulted in clustered regions. We used ecological niche modeling techniques to develop a fine-scale picture of malaria vector distributions in the state. Eight ecoregions were identified and malaria-related aspects are discussed based on this classification, including 5 types of dense tropical rain forest and 3 types of savannah. Ecoregions formed by dense tropical rain forest were named as montane (ecoregion I), submontane (II), plateau (III), lowland (IV), and alluvial (V). Ecoregions formed by savannah were divided into steppe (VI, campos de Roraima), savannah (VII, cerrado), and wetland (VIII, campinarana). Such ecoregional mappings are important tools in integrated malaria control programs that aim to identify specific characteristics of malaria transmission, classify transmission risk, and define priority areas and appropriate interventions. For some areas, extension of these approaches to still-finer resolutions will provide an improved picture of malaria transmission patterns.","Amazon; Anopheles; Brazil; Ecoregions; Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP); Malaria; Roraima",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249885632

In this paper we investigate increasing the utilization efficiency of energy resources and reducing environmental emissions to achieve more sustainable development, focusing on utility-scale cogeneration and contributions of nuclear energy. A case study is presented for Ontario using the nuclear and fossil facilities of the main provincial electrical utilities. It is observed that implementation of utility-based cogeneration in Ontario can contribute to a sustainable future by reducing significantly annual and cumulative uranium and fossil fuel use and related emissions, providing economic benefits for the province and its electrical utilities, and allowing nuclear energy to be substituted for fossil fuels.","Cogeneration; Efficiency; Environment; Nuclear energy; Sustainable development","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Fossil fuels; Sustainable development; Uranium; Environmental emissions; Utility-scale cogeneration; Utilization efficiency; Nuclear energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39149087415

Projections show that while overall global food production in the coming decades may keep pace with the food requirements of a growing world population, climate change might worsen existing regional disparities because it will reduce crop yields mostly in lands located at lower latitudes where many developing countries are situated. Strategies to enhance local adaptation capacity are therefore needed to minimize climatic impacts and to maintain regional stability of food production. At the same time, agriculture as a sector offers several opportunities to mitigate the portion of global greenhouse gas emissions that are directly dependent upon land use, land-use change, and land-management techniques. This paper reviews issues of agriculture and climate change, with special attention to adaptation and mitigation. Specifically, as adaptation and mitigation strategies in agriculture are implemented to alleviate the potential negative effects of climate change, key synergies need to be identified, as mitigation practices may compete with modifications to local agricultural practices aimed at maintaining production and income. Under future climate and socio-economic pressures, land managers and farmers will be faced with challenges in regard to selecting those mitigation and adaptation strategies that together meet food, fiber and climate policy requirements. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.","Adaptation; Agriculture; Climate change impacts; Mitigation; Regional disparities; Synergies; Tradeoffs","adaptation; agricultural policy; agriculture; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; developing world; food production; mitigation; policy strategy; synergism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447100596

Due to their high biomass, these systems contain large carbon (C) stocks. While the systems of individual farmers are of limited size, on a per area basis smallholder systems accumulate significant amounts of C, equaling the amount of C stored in some secondary forests of similar age. Their ability to simultaneously address smallholders' livelihood needs and store large amounts of C makes smallholder systems viable project types under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol, with its dual objective of emissions reduction and sustainable development. Smallholder systems have not developed in areas where enabling conditions do not exist. A CDM project that facilitates a minimum threshold of enabling conditions that make smallholder agroforestation possible should qualify for C credits. To secure smallholder confidence, the agroforestry systems promoted through a CDM project must be socially and economically viable independent of C payments. To assure system productivity and profitability, projects should provide farmers with technical and marketing assistance. Additionally, project sites should meet the following preconditions: areas of underutilized low-biomass landuse systems available for rehabilitation; smallholders interested in tree farming; accessible markets for tree products; supportive local governments; sufficient infrastructure; and transparent and equitable relationships between project partners. Questions of leakage and additionality should not be problematic and can be addressed through the project design, establishment of quantifiable baseline data and facilitating enabling conditions. However, smallholder-focused CDM projects would have high transaction costs. The subsequent challenge is thus to develop mechanisms that reduce the costs of: (a) making information (e.g., technology, markets) more accessible to multiple clients; (b) facilitating and enforcing smallholder agreements and (c) designing feasible monitoring systems. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.","Agroforestation; AR CDM; C stocks; CERs; Enabling conditions; Local livelihoods; LULUCF; Smallholder agroforestry; Smallholder CDM projects; Transaction costs","agroforestry; carbon sequestration; clean development mechanism; emission control; environmental economics; Kyoto Protocol; local government; secondary forest; smallholder; sustainable development; transaction cost; Asia; Eurasia; Southeast Asia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847184609

This reaction occurs in two stages: first, the epoxide is carbonylated to a β-lactone, and then the β-lactone is subsequently carbonylated to a succinic anhydride. This reaction is made possible by the bimetallic catalyst [(CITPP)Al(THF)2]+[Co(CO)4]- (1; CITPP = meso-tetra(4-chlorophenyl)porphyrinato; THF = tetrahydrofuran), which is highly active and selective for both epoxide and lactone carbonylation, and by the identification of a solvent that facilitates both stages. The catalysis is compatible with substituted epoxides having aliphatic, aromatic, alkene, ether, ester, alcohol, nitrile, and amide functional groups. Disubstituted and enantiomerically pure anhydrides are synthesized from epoxides with excellent retention of stereochemical purity. The mechanism of epoxide double carbonylation with 1 was investigated by in situ IR spectroscopy, which reveals that the two carbonylation stages are sequential and non-overlapping, such that epoxide carbonylation goes to completion before any of the intermediate β-lactone is consumed. The rates of both epoxide and lactone carbonylation are independent of carbon monoxide pressure and are first-order in the concentration of 1. The stages differ in that the rate of epoxide carbonylation is independent of substrate concentration and first-order in donor solvent, whereas the rate of lactone carbonylation is first-order in lactone and inversely dependent on the concentration of donor solvent. The opposite solvent effects and substrate order for these two stages are rationalized in terms of different resting states and rate-determining steps for each carbonylation reaction. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbonylation; Infrared spectroscopy; Organic solvents; Stereochemistry; Substitution reactions; Synthesis (chemical); Epoxides; Lactone; Succinic anhydrides; Catalysts; alcohol; alkene; amide; aromatic compound; carbon monoxide; epoxide; ester; ether; lactone; nitrile; porphyrin derivative; solvent; succinic anhydride; tetrahydrofuran; article; carbonylation; catalysis; catalyst; chemical modification; infrared spectroscopy; reaction analysis; reaction optimization; stereochemistry; synthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247510108

The catalyst was synthesized by solution combustion method and was characterized by XRD and XPS. The catalytic activity was investigated by performing CO oxidation, hydrocarbon oxidation and NO reduction. A reaction mechanism for CO oxidation by O2 and NO reduction by CO was proposed. The model based on CO adsorption on Pd2+ and dissociative chemisorption of O2 in the oxide-ion vacancy for CO oxidation reaction fitted the experimental for CO oxidation. For NO reduction in presence of CO, the model based on competitive adsorption of NO and CO on Pd2+, NO chemisorption and dissociation on oxide-ion vacancy fitted the experimental data. The rate parameters obtained from the model indicated that the reactions were much faster over this catalyst compared to other catalysts reported in the literature.

Here we report our results for the nearly face-on spiral galaxy M83. A subsequent paper will present our data and analysis for another substantially face-on spiral galaxy M33. The nebulae selected cover a wide range of galactocentric radii (RG). The observations were made with the infrared spectrograph in the short wavelength, high dispersion configuration. The above set of four lines is observed cospatially, thus permitting a reliable comparison of the fluxes. From the measured fluxes, we determine the ionic abundance ratios including Ne++/Ne+, S3+/S++ and S++/Ne+ and find that there is a correlation of increasingly higher ionization with larger RG. By sampling the dominant ionization states of Ne and S for H ii regions, we can approximate the Ne/S ratio by (Ne+ + Ne++)/(S++ + S3+). Our findings of ratios that significantly exceed the benchmark Orion Nebula value, as well as a decrease in this ratio with increasing RG, are more likely due to other effects than a true gradient in Ne/S. Two effects that will tend to lower these high estimates and to flatten the gradient are first, the method does not account for the presence of S+ and second, S but not Ne is incorporated into grains. Both Ne and S are primary elements produced in α-chain reactions, following C and O burning in stars, making their yields depend very little on the stellar metallicity. Thus, it is expected that Ne/S remains relatively constant throughout a galaxy. We stress that this type of observation and method of analysis does have the potential for accurate measurements of Ne/S, particularly for H ii regions that have lower metallicity and higher ionization than those here, such as those in M33. Our observations may also be used to test the predicted ionizing spectral energy distribution (SED) of various stellar atmosphere models. We compare the ratio of fractional ionizations and versus with predictions made from our photoionization models using several of the state-of-the-art stellar atmosphere model grids. The overall best fit appears to be the nebular models using the supergiant stellar atmosphere models of Pauldrach, Hoffmann & Lennon and Sternberg, Hoffmann & Pauldrach. This result is not sensitive to the electron density and temperature range expected for these M83 nebulae. Considerable computational effort has gone into the comparison between data and models, although not all parameter studies have yet been performed on an ultimate level (e.g. in the present paper the stellar atmosphere model abundances have been fixed to solar values). A future paper, with the benefit of more observational data, will continue these studies to further discriminate how the ionic ratios depend on the SED and the other nebular parameters. © 2007 RAS.","Galaxies: individual: M83; H ii regions; ISM: abundances; Stars: atmospheres",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249679186

These outlooks should also include scenarios considering active policies that address the challenge of climate change. Consequently such a CO2 emission reduction scenario was analysed as a case study within the ACROPOLIS project. This paper presents a method to derive regional emission targets that correspond to an emission trajectory that stabilises CO2 emissions by 2030, within a concentration target set at 550 ppmv. In a next step, the impact of emission reduction on the structure of the future energy system is briefly analysed using the Prospective Outlook for the Long-term Energy System (POLES) world energy model. Finally, some key indicators are compared with the results from other world energy models used in the ACROPOLIS project to analyse the same emission reduction scenario. While the emission reduction compared to the baseline is significant, the resulting necessary adaptations in terms of energy and carbon efficiencies lie within the ranges observed in the past. It is demonstrated that the defined ""soft landing"" emission reduction scenario would under the assumption of emission trading produce permit prices that are not extremely high. Though forecasted effect of CO2 emission reduction on the energy system is quite different across models, the marginal reduction costs broadly coincide across the participating models. This especially is true when taking into account the different reduction efforts caused by different levels of emissions in the baseline. © 2006.","Energy outlook; Model comparison; Post-Kyoto targets","Carbon dioxide; Energy policy; Mathematical models; Emission reduction; Emission trajectory; Energy outlook; Model comparison; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; energy efficiency; Kyoto Protocol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845460796

Mild Combustion processes employ great amounts of diluents and high inlet temperatures of reactants. The first aspect guarantees a high heat capacity of the system, hence lower working temperatures with respect to a traditional oxidation process; the latter feature comes out from the necessity to sustain the oxidation process with no-flammable mixtures working with so high dilution degree. This new kind of combustion presents several features that deserve a systematic study. Previous experimental works carried out in a jet stirred flow reactor showed a complex dynamic behavior of methane Mild Combustion. In practical applications, such instabilities do not allow to control the working temperature; thus they lower the efficiency of the combustion processes. In this paper, the effect of hydrogen addition to the methane combustion in Mild conditions was studied, with particular focus on the dynamic behavior detected in the past. The experimental results showed that the higher the inlet hydrogen content, the higher the increase of the system reactivity and a more significant reduction of the area in the Tin-C/O plane where thermo-kinetics oscillations were observed. However, hydrogen addition did not affect significantly the typology of oscillations. Furthermore, it was observed that in the Tin-C/O plane the dynamic region shifts towards lower temperatures as well as the irregular oscillation region extends as the hydrogen concentration increases. The experimental Tin-C/O maps were then compared with the numerical ones, obtained with different kinetic mechanisms available in the literature. An overall good agreement was found between experimental and numerical data. The evolution of the oscillations region and the increase of reactivity due to the hydrogen addition were predicted quite well. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

One strategy to clarify ecosystem climate-carbon interactions is to partition NEE into its component fluxes, gross ecosystem CO2 exchange (GEE) and ecosystem respiration (RE), and evaluate the responses to climate of each component flux. We separated observed NEE into optimized estimates of GEE and RE using an ecosystem process model combined with 6 years of continuous flux data from the Niwot Ridge AmeriFlux site. In order to gain further insight into the processes underlying NEE, we partitioned RE into its components: heterotrophic (RH) and autotrophic (RA) respiration. We were successful in separating GEE and RE, but less successful in accurately partitioning RE into RA and RH. Our failure in the latter was due to a lack of adequate contrasts in the assimilated data set to distinguish between RA and RH. We performed most model runs at a twice-daily time step. Optimizing on daily-aggregated data severely degraded the model's ability to separate GEE and RE. However, we gained little benefit from using a half-hourly time step. The model-data fusion showed that most of the interannual variability in NEE was due to variability in GEE, and not R E. In contrast to several previous studies in other ecosystems, we found that longer growing seasons at Niwot Ridge were correlated with less net CO2 uptake, due to a decrease of available snow-melt water during the late springtime photosynthetic period. Warmer springtime temperatures resulted in increased net CO2 uptake only if adequate moisture was available; when warmer springtime conditions led into mid-summer drought, the annual net uptake declined. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","Ecosystem respiration; Eddy covariance; Gross primary productivity; Net ecosystem exchange; Parameter estimation","carbon dioxide; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; climate modeling; coupling; eddy covariance; elevation; forest ecosystem; net ecosystem exchange; primary production; respiration; subalpine environment; altitude; article; biological model; climate; comparative study; ecosystem; metabolism; season; temperature; tree; United States; Altitude; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Colorado; Ecosystem; Models, Biological; Seasons; Temperature; Trees; Colorado; Front Range; Niwot Ridge; North America; Rocky Mountains; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846588931

Owing to the high heat input through the Midrex reformer tube wall, the endothermic nature of reforming reactions, low mass velocity of feed gas and large tube diameter, the catalyst bed is exposed to considerable axial and radial temperature gradients. These radial concentration and temperature gradients may create local areas with potential for carbon formation. To investigate this phenomenon, a rigorous two-dimensional model is developed for simulating the operation of a Midrex reformer which applies a dual catalyst loading profile. Both process side and furnace side have been included in this integrated model. Simulation results are in good agreement with available data from an actual plant. Using this model, a thermodynamic approach is applied to recognise zones in which the risk of carbon formation is high inside the reformer tubes. The results show that the first half of tubes, both in centre and near the wall, is critical from carbon forming point of view. Furthermore, the model shows that how a certain catalyst loading profile will affect the operation of the reformer. © 2007 Institute of Materials, Minerals end Mining.","Coke formation; Direct reduction; Midrex; Steam reforming; Two-dimensional model","Catalyst activity; Hydrocarbon refining; Mathematical models; Synthesis gas; Thermal gradients; Two dimensional; Velocity measurement; Coke formation; Midrex reformer tube wall; Steam reforming; Coke manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35349021523

The photoexcitation of the Supramolecular complex affords the long-lived charge-separated state. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Complexation; Nanostructured materials; Proteins; Raman spectroscopy; Supramolecular chemistry; Transmission electron microscopy; Nondestructive formation; Porphyrinic polypeptide; Single walled carbon nanotubes; Supramolecular nanohybrids; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847421330

Nowadays, the state-of-the-art air quality modelling systems such as MM5-CMAQ can handle the evaluation of air pollution concentrations in a very high detail in time and space. MM5 is a non-hydrostatic modelling system developed by PSU/NCAR (USA) during the last 20 years and continuously updated by the scientific community. CMAQ is a Community Multi-scale Air Quality Modelling System for simulating the transport and chemical concentrations in the air in 3D space and time developed by EPA (USA) in 2000. Both systems are complementary and allow a full simulation of the atmospheric flow to determine the amount of air pollution concentration exists in the 3D space and during a specific period of time. TEAP (a tool to evaluate the air quality impact of industrial plants) is an EUREKA project coordinated by UPM with the participation of INDRA S.A., Institute of Physics (Lithuania) and AB 'MAZEIKIU NAFTA' (Lithuania). This tool allows the industrial plants - and electric power plants - to have a full control in real-time and forecasting mode of the impact of the industrial emission under daily basis by using the so-called ON-OFF operational mode. The ON-OFF mode requires to run the AQMS both time in parallel by using the industrial plant emissions (ON) and excluding them (OFF). The system allows a full knowledge of the impact of industrial emissions for the next 48-72 h in full space (3D) domain, time and for every criteria pollutant (NOx, SO2, CO, O3, PM). The system requires a powerful post-processing analysis module and a clustering approach to optimize the computer capabilities. The system is mounted over a PC cluster platform under Linux operating system. Results show a full and detail analysis of the amount of air pollutant concentrations due to the industrial plant emissions in time and space and under daily operational basis. The EU Air Quality Directives mark the air concentration limits to be taken into account into the TEAP system in forecasting mode to be fulfilled. The system allows to simulate also different industrial emission reduction strategies according to the optimal economical/production balance. The system can easily be adapted for emergency use. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Ambient surface ozone and particulate matter concentrations are air quality problem in the MASP. This study examined the impact that implementing a control program for mobile emissions has on ozone concentrations, An episode of high surface ozone concentrations occurring in the MASP during the March 13-15, 2000 period was used as a case study that was modeled for photochemical oxidants using the California Institute of Technology/Carnegie Mellon University three-dimensional photochemical model. Different scenarios were analyzed in relationship to the implementation of the Programa Nacional de Controle de Poluição por Veículos Automotores (PROCONVE, National Program to Control Motor Vehicle Pollution). Scenario 1 assumed that all vehicles were operating within PROCONVE guidelines. Scenarios 2 and 3 considered hypothetical situations in which the PROCONVE was not implemented. Scenario 2 set the premise that vehicles were using pre-1989 technology, whereas scenario 3 allowed for technological advances. A base case scenario, in which the official emission inventory for the year 2000 was employed, was also analyzed. The CIT model results show agreement with most measurements collected during 13-15 March 2000 modeling episode. Mean normalized bias for ozone, CO, RHC and NOx are approximately 9.0, 6.0, -8.3, 13.0%, respectively. Tropospheric ozone concentrations predicted for scenario 2 were higher than those predicted for scenarios 1, 3 and base case. This study makes a significant contribution to the evaluation of air quality improvement and provides data for use in evaluating the economic costs of implementing a program of motor vehicle pollution control aimed at protecting human health. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2007.","Air quality; CIT model; Emission inventory; Ozone; São Paulo","Air pollution; Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric composition; Mathematical models; Ozone; air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission control; emission inventory; ozone; traffic emission; troposphere; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947408097

Carbon isotopic (13C, 14C) values were used to differentiate contributions from plants using the C3, C4, and/or CAM (crassulacean acid metabolism) carbon fixation pathways., and iodine concentrations indicated that wetland plant residues are a significant source of organic carbon in a sediment core from the Mississippi River delta region collected at a 60 m water depth.

Acta 64 (6), 989-996.] and significantly, includes unique features that had not previously been seen in the marine environment. These special features include a plutonium isotopic close-in fallout record that indicates a purely terrestrial source for these sediment particles and the elements associated with it, and a distinct iodine isotopic peak (as well as peaks for plutonium and cesium isotopes) that indicate little bioturbation in this core. Our carbon isotopic and iodine data can thus be compared to published records of changes in drainage basin land use, river hydrology, and hydrodynamic sorting of suspended particles to elucidate if these changes are reflected in nearshore sediments. This comparison suggests a significant contribution for organic carbon (OC) from C4 plants to these sediments during the 1950's to early 1960's. Relative older carbon isotopes, and episodically high iodine concentrations (up to 34 ppm) were observed during this time period that (1) indicate sediment deposition that is coincident with the times of major hydrological changes induced from dam and levee building in both the upper and lower reaches of the Mississippi River drainage basin, and (2) suggest episodic organic carbon deposition from wetland plant residues. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We analyzed woody riparian plant species and environmental data from four western Oregon watersheds distributed across a wide climate-driven productivity gradient at three scales (40-m2 sample plots [alpha diversity], 1-ha plots, and species pools from 16 1-ha plots in each watershed) to compare three hypotheses of control on species diversity: (1) local control, (2) direct climatic control, and (3) indirect climatic control. We used a process model (3-PG) to model gross primary productivity (GPP) as a functional climate index across our study area. We performed multiple linear regression to determine the best predictors of alpha (sample-plot scale) diversity, compositional change within riparian forests (beta diversity), and hectare-scale diversity and used path analysis to explore hypothesized causal linkages between climate and other factors and species diversity. We also analyzed a companion data set of gap and forest environments from a subset of the same sites to determine the influence of disturbance on species diversity across the gradient. We found evidence for strong spatial patterning in woody plant richness consistent with indirect climatic control on woody plant richness. Climate (GPP) showed negative relationships with alpha diversity and hectare richness of trees, shrubs, and woody plant species and was the most commonly selected explanatory variable in regression analyses. GPP and Rubus spectabilis cover increased from the least to most productive climates while understory light and moisture heterogeneity across the riparian area decreased. These environmental changes coincided with declines in alpha, beta, and hectare-scale diversity.

One ""golden"" day of CERES is interpreted with the mesoscale atmospheric model Meso-NH coupled on-line with the Interactions between Soil, Biosphere and Atmosphere, CO2-reactive (ISBA-A-gs) surface scheme, allowing a full interaction of CO2 between the surface and the atmosphere. The rapid diurnal cycle of carbon coupled with water and energy fluxes is parameterized including, e.g., plant assimilation, respiration, anthropogenic emissions, and sea fluxes. During the analyzed day, frequent vertical profiles and aircraft transects revealed high spatial and temporal variabilities of CO2 concentrations within the boundary layer at the regional scale: a 10-ppm gradient of CO2-mixing ratio is observed during the day by the aircraft measurements. The Meso-NH model proved able to simulate very well the CO2 concentration variability as well as the spatial and temporal evolution of the surface fluxes and the boundary layer in the domain. The model is used to explain the CO2 variability as a result of two complementary processes: (1) the regional heterogeneity of CO2 surface fluxes related to the land cover (e.g., winter crops versus a pine forest) and (2) the variability of mesoscale circulation across the boundary layer: development of the sea breeze in the western part of the domain and dominating wind flow in the eastern part of the domain.

However, a large wind power generation system has limitations in terms of location and can be installed only in the suburbs. At the same time, a city-type compact wind power generation system, designed for city needs, has more flexibility and can be installed in the residential areas of a city.

Its partitioning from the site of synthesis to different sites of storage, conversion into other storage compounds or metabolic degradation involves various steps of cell-to-cell movement and transport. Many of these steps occur within symplastic domains, i.e. sucrose moves passively cell-to-cell through plasmodesmata. Some essential steps, however, occur between symplastically isolated cells or tissues. In these cases, sucrose is transiently released into the apoplast and its cell-to-cell transport depends on the activity of plasma membrane-localized, energy dependent, H+-symporting carrier proteins.

The level of MMP-13 mRNA in non-irradiated cells was stable during the experimental period, but in gamma ray-irradiated cells it tended to increase. When localization of MMP-13 in locally irradiated experimental rats was investigated, it was found in the marginal trabeculae in both non-irradiated and gamma ray-irradiated animals. MMP-13 was detected in osteoid and neogenetic bone in the trabeculae surface. The trabeculae in carbon ion-irradiated bone remained cartilaginous. Carbon ion-irradiated rats exhibited weak expression of MMP-13 around the cartilage inside the trabeculae. We conclude that carbon ion irradiation reduced expression of MMP-13, thus suppressing both chondrocyte maturation and cartilage resorption.

The climate models are based on Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow, which are solved numerically on a grid covering the globe. These models have been successful in simulating the past climate, giving researchers confidence in their predictions.

Many tumors arise in the bronchopulmonary or gastrointestinal tract, but a neuroendocrine tumor can arise in almost any organ. The tumors have varied malignant potential depending on the site of their origin, and the clinical manifestations often are nonspecific. Metastases may be present at the time of diagnosis, which often occurs at a late stage of the disease. Imaging plays a pivotal role in the localization and staging of neuroendocrine tumors and in monitoring the treatment response. Imaging is often challenging, and a combination of anatomic and functional techniques is usually required, depending on the tumor type and location. Techniques include ultrasonography, barium studies, endoscopy, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, iobenguane scintigraphy, and, in select cases, positron emission tomography. Coregistration of structural and functional images is often of incremental value for accurate localization of the primary tumor and any metastatic disease. Radiologists must understand the contribution of each imaging modality in the assessment of different neuroendocrine tumors. In addition, knowledge of the optimal technique for each radiologic and radionuclide imaging examination is essential. Familiarity with the protean imaging appearances of both primary and metastatic disease is essential for accurate staging, treatment monitoring, and surveillance. Finally, an understanding of the wide variety of treatment options for patients with carcinoid tumors is vital for optimal management. ©RSNA, 2007.",,"carcinoid; diagnostic imaging; human; image enhancement; metastasis; methodology; practice guideline; review; Carcinoid Tumor; Diagnostic Imaging; Humans; Image Enhancement; Practice Guidelines",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247180009

These effects show considerable variability across studies and may depend on nutrient availability, the carbon/nutrient-balance in plant tissues and the secondary metabolism of plants. We studied the responses to elevated CO2 and different nutrient availability of 12 herbaceous plant species differing in their investment into secondary compounds. Caterpillars of the generalist herbivore Spodoptera littoralis were reared on the leaves produced and their consumption and growth rates analysed. Elevated CO2 resulted in a similar increase of biomass in all plant species, whereas the positive effect of fertilization varied among plant species. Specific leaf weight was influenced by elevated CO2, but the effect depended on nutrient level and identity of plant species. Elevated CO2 increased the C/N ratio of the leaves of most species. Caterpillars consumed more leaf material when plants were grown under elevated CO2 and low nutrients. This indicates compensatory feeding due to lower tissue quality. However, the effects of elevated CO2, nutrient availability and plant species identity on leaf consumption interacted. Both the effects of CO2 and nutrient availability on the relative growth rate of the herbivore depended on the plant species. The feeding rate of S. littoralis on plant species that do not produce nitrogen-containing secondary compounds (NCSC) was higher under low nutrient availability. In contrast, in plants producing NCSC nutrient availability had no effect on the feeding rate. This suggests that compensatory feeding in response to low nutrient contents may not be possible if plants produce NCSC.

Important factors in these interactions are the biochemical fluxes of CO2 and other trace gases, and the biophysical fluxes of energy and water vapor. Modeling studies, well validated with detailed observations, show that changing land-use in the past centuries influenced local, regional, and probably also global climate patterns (e.g. IPCC, 2001). Historically, land-use mediated climate change appears to be an important factor (Brovkin et al., 1999). In mid to high latitudes, for example, land-use changes influence surface-air temperature because of the large difference in surface albedo between different land covers, such as cropland and forest in snow-covered conditions (Robinson and Kukla, 1985; Bonan et al., 1995; Harding and Pomeroy, 1996; Sharrat, 1998). Emission scenarios, required to estimate future climate change, nowadays often include detailed changes in land-use patterns and the consequent changes in sources and sinks of trace gases (e.g. Strengers et al., 2004). The biophysical consequences on the climate systems are, however, often neglected. It is therefore important to examine the role of land-use changes in determining future climates (Pielke Sr et al., 2002). Future land-use change does not only include deforestation and afforestation as a consequence of expanding or contracting agriculture. Other land uses, such as plantations for carbon sequestration or energy production (to substitute fossil fuels), are likely to become more important. © Cambridge University Press 2007, Cambridge University Press, 2010.",,"Aluminum alloys; Carbon dioxide; Deforestation; Forestry; Gases; Land use; Rain; Reforestation; Solar radiation; Carbon sequestration; Climate impacts; Emission scenario; Energy productions; Global climates; Influence surfaces; Land use pattern; Land-use change; Climate change",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927038008

The ability of snowbed plants to cope with such fragmentation will, among other things, depend on their reproductive strategy. With respect to the mating system, as a key component of reproductive strategies, the environmental conditions in arctic and alpine snowbeds have been hypothesized to select for high selfing ability due to short growing seasons and unpredictable pollinator service. In this study we evaluate whether the mating system strategies of seven typical snowbed forbs of the northeastern Calcareous Alps in Austria are in line with this hypothesis. Field-pollination experiments were conducted in order to study the effects of pollinator exclusion (bagging; all study species), emasculation and manual self- and cross-pollination (subset of study species) on seed set. Additionally, data on floral traits associated with the reproductive system such as anther and ovule numbers and pollen:ovule ratios were collected. Results demonstrate that selfing is not uncommon but by no means obligatory for snowbed plants: the study species display a wide range of mating system types, from predominately outcrossing to predominately selfing. The different reproductive strategies of regional snowbed plants are discussed in relation to their ability to cope with climate warming induced habitat fragmentation. © 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The studied peptide TWD1(335-365) contained the putative membrane anchor of the protein (residues 339-357) that was previously predicted by sequence hydrophobicity analysis. The TWD1 peptide was synthesized by standard solid phase peptide synthesis and contained three uniformly 13C- and 15N-labelled residues (Phe 340, Val 350, Ala 364). The peptide was incorporated into either multilamellar vesicles or oriented planar membranes composed of an equimolar ternary phospholipid mixture (POPC, POPE, POPG), where the POPC was sn-1 chain-deuterated. 31P NMR spectra of the membrane in the absence and in the presence of the peptide showed axially symmetric powder patterns indicative of a lamellar bilayer phase. Further, the addition of peptide caused a decrease in the lipid hydrocarbon chain order as indicated by reduced quadrupolar splittings in the 2H NMR spectra of the POPC in the membrane. The conformation of TWD1(335-365) was investigated by 13C cross-polarization magic-angle spinning NMR spectroscopy. At a temperature of -30°C all peptide signals were resolved and could be fully assigned in two-dimensional proton-driven 13C spin diffusion and 13C single quantum/double quantum correlation experiments. The isotropic chemical shift values for Phe 340 and Val 350 exhibited the signature of a regular α-helix. Chemical shifts typical for a random coil conformation were observed for Ala 364 located close to the C-terminus of the peptide. Static 15N NMR spectra of TWD1(335-365) in mechanically aligned lipid bilayers demonstrated that the helical segment of TWD1(335-365) adopts an orientation perpendicular to the membrane normal. At 30°C, the peptide undergoes intermediate time scale motions. © 2006 EBSA.",,"alanine; hydrocarbon; phenylalanine; phospholipid; twisted dwarf 2 protein; unclassified drug; valine; vegetable protein; Arabidopsis; article; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; carboxy terminal sequence; conformation; controlled study; deuteron nuclear magnetic resonance; hydrophobicity; membrane; nitrogen nuclear magnetic resonance; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; peptide synthesis; phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; quantum chemistry; signal transduction; solid; temperature; Arabidopsis Proteins; Binding Sites; Cell Membrane; Glycosylphosphatidylinositols; Lipid Bilayers; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Membrane Fusion; Protein Binding; Tacrolimus Binding Proteins; Arabidopsis thaliana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247272007

In controlled feeding studies, the consumption of diets that contained Hg (as methylmercury) at environmentally realistic concentrations resulted in a range of toxic effects in fish, birds, and mammals, including behavioral, neurochemical, hormonal, and reproductive changes. Limited field-based studies, especially with certain wild piscivorous bird species, e.g., the common loon, corroborated laboratory-based results, demonstrating significant relations between methylmercury exposure and various indicators of methylmercury toxicity, including reproductive impairment. Potential population effects in fish and wildlife resulting from dietary methylmercury exposure are expected to vary as a function of species life history, as well as regional differences in fish-Hg concentrations, which, in turn, are influenced by differences in Hg deposition and environmental methylation rates. However, population modeling suggests that reductions in Hg emissions could have substantial benefits for some common loon populations that are currently experiencing elevated methylmercury exposure. Predicted benefits would be mediated primarily through improved hatching success and development of hatchlings to maturity as Hg concentrations in prey fish decline. Other piscivorous species may also benefit from decreased Hg exposure but have not been as extensively studied as the common loon. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2007.",,"methylmercury derivative; bird; fish; food intake; mammal; methylmercury; pollution effect; pollution exposure; population decline; toxicity; animal; bird; conference paper; drug effect; environmental exposure; fish; geography; immunity; mammal; reproduction; risk assessment; Animals; Birds; Environmental Exposure; Fishes; Geography; Immunity; Mammals; Methylmercury Compounds; Reproduction; Risk Assessment; Aves; Gavia immer; Mammalia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247138465

The climate in the region is semiarid with an average annual temperature of 21 °C. The approximately 40 m high dam covers an area of ca. 1 km2. The surface of the central part of the dam is water covered, but the periphery is dry. Three holes were drilled through the water unsaturated periphery down to the saturated zone at about 25 m depth. Altogether 65 solid samples were taken in 1 m intervals and geomicrobiologically and geochemically analyzed. Brown precipitates of iron(hydro)oxides were discernible throughout the entire unsaturated zone with a paste pH in the range of 3-4. The tailings had sulfur contents in the range of 2-8 wt.% (average 4%). The total sulfur consisted mainly of reduced inorganic sulfur. Pyrrhotite was the main metal sulfide, pyrite, Ni- and Co-sulfides occurred in minor amounts. Metal sulfide oxidizing Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans-like bacteria were present in high numbers (mean value of most-probable-number method: 3 × 106 cells g- 1 dw) throughout the whole unsaturated zone. Mean numbers of living bacteria (CARD-FISH) and total microorganisms (SybrGreen direct counts) were 1 × 107 cells g- 1 dw and 8 × 107 cells g- 1 dw, respectively. The average potential pyrrhotite oxidation rate measured by microcalorimetry was 1.9 × 10- 9 molpyrrhotite m- 2 s- 1. The ratio of biological to chemical pyrrhotite oxidation was ca. 50:50. For the assumed 0.1 m thickness of the oxidation zone within the 25 m unsaturated zone the potential average pyrrhotite oxidation rate was 3.4 × 10- 5 mol m- 2 s- 1 (94 kg FeS m- 2 year- 1). At this rate, all pyrrhotite in the tailings dam would be oxidized within 80 years. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Such huge datasets must be analyzed by efficient yet accurate algorithms. A supervised automatic classification method (hereafter called ""wavanglet"") is proposed to identify spectral features and classify images in spectrally homogeneous units. It uses four steps: 1) selection of a library composed of reference spectra; 2) application of a Daubechies wavelet transform to referenced spectra and determination of the wavelet subspace that best separates all referenced spectra; and 3) in this selected subspace, determination of the best threshold on the spectral angle to produce detection masks. This application is focused on the Martian polar regions that present three main types of terrains: H2O ice, CO2 ice, and dust. The wavanglet method is implemented to detect these major compounds on near-infrared hyperspectral images acquired by the OMEGA instrument onboard the Mars Express spacecraft. With an overall accuracy of 89%, wavanglet outperforms two generic methods: band ratio (57% accuracy) and spectral feature fitting (83% accuracy). The quantitative detection limits of wavanglet are also evaluated in terms of abundance for H2O and CO2 ices in order to improve the interpretation of the masks. © 2007 IEEE.","Automatic detection; Automatic supervised classification; Hyperspectral images; Mass treatment; Pattern recognition; Remote sensing; Spectral feature recognition and extraction; Wavelet filtering","Algorithms; Feature extraction; Imaging systems; Wavelength; Wavelet analysis; Automatic detection; Automatic supervised classification; Hyperspectral images; Mass treatment; Spectral feature recognition; Wavelet filtering; Space research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247492193

According to the patent, the technology will overcome problems with solar energy production, geothermal energy production, and low-cost supercritical steam for efficient secondary and tertiary hydrocarbon recovery programs. It can be used to convert depleted oil/gas fields to store solar energy. The stored heat can then be used to generate electricity through routine processes. It provides a use for oilfield brine and can be used to produce water for drier regions. SAGE uses parabolic troughs to gather radiant solar energy, concentrate it, and use it to heat oilfield brine to a supercritical level (734°F, above the 705°F critical point for brine).

This implied commonality and interrelationship are unexpected as these radicals have dissimilar chemical kinetic natures. As a result, a rigorous examination was undertaken of the behavior of each of the hydrocarbon species known to be present, C, CH, CH 2, CH3 CH4, CHO, CHOH, CH2O, CH 2OH, CH3O, CH3OH, C2, C 2H, C2H2, CHCO, CH2CO, and C 2O. This emphasized the main region where CH and C2 are observed (50-600μs) and reduced the kinetic reactions to only those that operate efficiently and are dominant. It was immediately apparent that this region of the flame reflects the nature of a hydrogen flame heavily doped with CO and CO2 and containing traces of hydrocarbons. The radical species, H, OH, O, along with H2, H2O, and O2, form an important controlling radical pool that is in partial equilibrium, and the concentrations of each of the hydrocarbon radicals are minor to this, playing secondary roles. As a result, the dominant fast reactions are those between the hydrocarbons and the basic hydrogen/oxygen radicals. Hydrocarbon-hydrocarbon reactions are unimportant here at these equivalence ratios. CH and C2 are formed and destroyed on a sub-microsecond time scale so that their flame profiles are the reflection of a complex kinetically dynamic system. This is found to be the case for all of the hydrocarbon species examined. As might be expected, these rapidly form steady-state distributions. However, with the exceptions of C, CHO, CHOH, and CH2O, which are irreversibly being oxidized, the others all form an interconnected hydrocarbon pool that is under the control of the larger hydrogen radical pool. The hydrocarbon pool can rapidly adjust, and the CH and C2 decay together as the pool is drained. This is either by continuing oxidation in less rich mixtures, or in richer flames where this is negligible by the onset of hydrocarbon-hydrocarbon reactions. The implications of such a hydrocarbon pool are significant. It introduces a buffering effect on their distribution and provides the indirect connection between CH and C2. Moreover, because they are members of this radical pool, flame studies alone cannot answer questions concerning their specific importance in combustion other than their contributing role to this pool. The presence of such a pool modifies the exactness that is needed for kinetic mechanisms, and knowledge of every species in the system no longer is necessary. Furthermore, as rate constants become refined, it will allow for the calculation of the relative concentrations of the hydrocarbon species and facilitate reduced kinetic mechanisms. It provides an explanation for previous isotopically labeled experiments and illustrates the difficulty of exactly identifying in flames the role of individual species. It resolves the fact that differing kinetic models can show similar levels of accuracy and has implications for sensitivity analyses. It finally unveils the mechanism of the flame ionization detector and has implications for the differing interpretations of diamond formation mechanisms. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Diamond formation; Hydrocarbon radicals; Partial equilibrium; Steady-state distributions; Acetylene; Concentration (process); Diamonds; Ionization; Reaction kinetics; Sensitivity analysis; Hydrocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047232614

To elucidate the function of the small plastome-encoded PsaJ subunit, we have produced knockout mutants by chloroplast transformation in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). PsaJ binds two chlorophyll-a molecules and is localized at the periphery of PSI, close to both the Lhca2- and Lhca3-docking sites and the plastocyanin-binding site. Tobacco psaJ-knockout lines do not display a visible phenotype. Despite a 25% reduction in the content of redox-active PSI, neither growth rate nor assimilation capacity are altered in the mutants. In vivo, redox equilibration of plastocyanin and PSI is as efficient as in the wild-type, indicating that PsaJ is not required for fast plastocyanin oxidation. However, PsaJ is involved in PSI excitation: altered 77 K chlorophyll-a fluorescence emission spectra and reduced accumulation of Lhca3 indicate that antenna binding and exciton transfer to the PSI reaction centre are impaired in ΔpsaJ mutants. Under limiting light intensities, growth of ΔpsaJ plants is retarded and the electron-transport chain is far more reduced than in the wild-type, indicating that PSI excitation might limit electron flux at subsaturating light intensities. In addition to defining in vivo functions of PsaJ, our data may also have implications for the interpretation of the crystal structure of PSI. © 2007 Biochemical Society.","Lhca; Photosynthesis; Photosystem I; Plastocyanin; PsaJ","Chlorophyll; Oxidation; Photosynthesis; Proteins; Lhca; Photosystem I; Plastocyanin; Tobacco; chlorophyll a; plastocyanin; protein subunit; vegetable protein; article; electron transport; fluorescence; genome; knockout gene; nonhuman; oxidation; oxidative stress; phenotype; photoactivation; photosynthesis; photosystem I; plant genetics; priority journal; protein function; protein stability; respiratory chain; tobacco; cytology; genetics; growth, development and aging; kinetics; metabolism; mutation; oxidation reduction reaction; plant leaf; plastid; tobacco; transgenic plant; Oxidation; Photosynthesis; Proteins; Tobacco; Nicotiana tabacum; Kinetics; Mutation; Oxidation-Reduction; Phenotype; Photosystem I Protein Complex; Plant Leaves; Plants, Genetically Modified; Plastids; Plastocyanin; Protein Subunits; Tobacco",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247108557

Promoting the use of natural stone has therefore a great positive impact on the environment. However, the number of occurrences of bowing and expansion of marble and limestone panels has led to increased maintenance costs, significant safety risk, and negative publicity. The lack of knowledge of a solution to the problem of bowing marble has a large negative effect on the entire stone trade. In response, short-sighted and less durable construction solutions are used as an alternative, adding to the decreasing export figures and numbers of employees within the stone sector. The TEAM (TEAM=TEsting and Assessment of Marble and limestone) project addresses a problem with marble types, from several European countries, that display bowing on facades in both cold and warm climates. There is, therefore a need to develop harmonized European standards for differentiating between marble that is susceptible to bowing and marble that is not. Resolution No. 013, in May 1999 taken by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), Technical Committee (TC) 246 Natural Stone states the urgent needs ""to develop a direct test method of the bowing risk for marble cladding products."" Thus, the project addresses the mandate for external wall coverings and the safety of panels. This paper serves to give a comprehensive overview of the main findings in the project. The main objectives were: •To understand and explain the mechanisms of the expansion and loss of strength, probably the most important phenomena leading to degradation of marble and limestone clad facades. •To prevent the use of deleterious marble and limestone by introducing drafts for European standards. •To develop a concept for assessment of facades, including a monitoring system in order to predict strength development and improve safety and reliability. •To analyze if surface coating and impregnation could prevent or diminish the degradation. •To address quality control aspects in order to optimize the production conditions. The TEAM project consortium, representing nine EU (European union) countries, comprised sixteen partners representing stone producers and trade associations, testing laboratories, standardization and certification bodies, consultants, building owners and caretakers and producers of fixing and repair systems. A state-of-the-art report has been written and is based on an extensive compilation of more than 400 papers on marble and limestone deterioration dating from the late 1800s to 2006. A survey of about 200 buildings has given a clear picture of the extent of the problem in geographical, geological, and climatological terms. Detailed case studies of six buildings have resulted in a methodology for assessment of facades including monitoring system and risk assessment. Research both in the laboratory and the field were performed on a large number of different stone types from different countries and used in different climates. This gave the explanation of degradation mechanisms and led to the determination of the critical influencing factors. Two tests methods, including precision statements: one for bowing [1] and one for thermal and moisture irreversible expansion have been prepared for submission to CEN TC 246. Repair techniques based on the use of surface coating and impregnation systems has been tested at laboratory and in the field. Positive side effects including increased durability and easier cleaning have been observed. Guidelines for production and product control have been proposed, and an instruction for stone sampling and description has been developed.

Egg deposition by the sawfly Diprion pini L. induces pine to release, three days after egg laying, locally and systemically terpenoid volatiles that attract parasitoids to kill the eggs. The elicitor of the pine's response is located in the sawfly's oviduct secretion enveloping the eggs after deposition. Application of this secretion on twigs with artificially conducted ovipositional woundings mimics the effects of egg deposition. Furthermore, jasmonic acid (JA) induces a volatile pattern similar, but not identical, to the one induced by egg deposition. To gain deeper insight into the transduction of plant signals induced by herbivore egg deposition, it was investigated whether ethylene emission from pine is affected by sawfly egg deposition. Systemically induced ethylene emission from differently treated pine twigs was monitored for a period of 3 d after treatment. Ethylene emissions from untreated control twigs were compared with those from twigs treated as follows: (i) sawfly egg secretion [= oviduct secretion (OVI)] was transferred on artificially wounded pine needles (attractive volatiles), (ii) needles were artificially wounded (non-attractive volatiles), and (iii) the twig was supplied with JA (attractive volatiles). Ethylene emission from systemically OVI-induced twigs was significantly lower than from untreated controls, whereas artificial wounding had no detectable effect. JA-treated twigs released much more ethylene and showed higher variability of ethylene emission than artificially wounded twigs and OVI-treated ones. Ethylene emissions from pine after the various treatments studied here are discussed with respect to known effects of insect feeding on ethylene release from plants. © The Author [2007].

Therefore the European Commission suggested including aviation in the EU-ETS and announced the aim of putting forward a legislative proposal by the end of 2006. In this article the legal aspects, which have to be considered for an successful inclusion of aviation into the EU-ETS, will be reviewed. This includes the legal framework for the inclusion of aviation into the EU-ETS which consists of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol and the Community Law. Important legal aspects are also possible legal obstacles like the existing traffic rights in the different Member States, bilateral air transport agreements like the Open Skies agreements and the Chicago Convention.

The breeding of dairy goats and sheep is characteristic of marginal and less favourite areas, where local breeds must adapt to local resources. Therefore, in these areas, typical products have been developed according to local resources available. The production of cheese with particular characteristics can be carried out only if genetic diversity in sheep and goat rearing is retained. In the European Community the originality of the goat and sheep milk products is protected by the legislation on the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and the Protected Geographic Indications (PGI). These designations constitute an element for the protection of the biodiversity of a territory (geological, pedological, climatical), plants, animals and microbes, practices and production systems, linked to the history and the local culture. On the other hand they assure suitable income for the rural population, protecting the products with a denomination against a competition based on low prices. International rules are opportune in order to protect the typical products, their specific characteristics and their biodiversity, encouraging the permanent residence of the population in the rural areas, especially in the less favourite areas. Milk composition, and especially proteins and fat, may vary according to genetic diversity of the animals and different feeding systems, giving peculiar features to the milk utilized to make typical cheeses. The paste rennet, usually produced by shepherds themselves from the abomasum of the lambs or kids of their flock, or the vegetable rennet from the cardoon (Cynara cardunculus) flowers locally harvested, are technological factors that strongly influence the quality of the local dairy products. Furthermore, the microbiological features and diversity in milk, starters and cheeses, with a main focus on the interaction with the environment and the exigency to preserve the microbiological diversity will be also reviewed. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

An overall assessment of the various impacts of agriculture on climate is presented. It focuses on the trade-offs among the relevant greenhouse gases (GHG), CO2, N2O and CH4, and the geochemical and biophysical interactions between agriculture and climate. Three spatial scales are examined: field, farm, and regional scale. At the field level, both GHG and energy fluxes are related to technical decisions by the farmer. At the farm level, strategic decisions on the choice of production systems are governed by economical constraints. Land use and landscape govern the biophysical factors that act on the regional climate when spatially integrated. At the regional level, national and regional policies on GHG emissions and surface forcing influence global climate. The biochemical and geophysical contribution of agriculture to climate need to be considered using new approaches in terms of global warming. The use of GCMs appears to be an adequate tool at this scale for assessing the global effect on climate, upon which smaller-scale effects will be superimposed. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Our focus is on two coal-fired technologies, pulverized coal (PC) and integrated coal gasification combined cycle technology (IGCC). The PC technology is cheapest-assuming there is no need to control carbon emissions. The IGCC technology may be cheaper if carbon must be captured. Since power plants last many years and future regulations are uncertain, a US electric utility faces a standard decision under uncertainty. A company will confront the range of possible outcomes, assigning its best estimate of the probability of each scenario, averaging the results and determining the power plant technology with the lowest possible cost inclusive of expected future carbon related costs, whether those costs be in the form of emissions charges paid or capital expenditures for retrofitting to capture carbon. If the company assigns high probability to no regulation or to less stringent regulation of carbon, then it makes sense for it to build the PC plant. But if it assigns sufficient probability to scenarios with more stringent regulation, then the IGCC technology is warranted. We provide some useful benchmarks for possible future regulation and show how these relate back to the relative costs of the two technologies and the optimal technology choice. Few of the policy proposals widely referenced in the public discussion warrant the choice of the IGCC technology. Instead, the PC technology remains the least costly. However, recent carbon prices in the European Emissions Trading System are higher than these benchmarks. If it is any guide to possible future penalties for emissions in the US, then current investment in the IGCC technology is warranted. Of course, other factors need to be factored into the decision as well. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It is, however, essential to characterize the growth cycle in order to determine what varieties are suitable for planting in different climatic and local cropping conditions. We estimated the end of the effective flowering period on the basis of the opening date of the last flower giving rise to a first-position boll on fruiting branches (LFP1), and propose a simple method for estimating this date. This study, conducted in 2002 and 2003 at Okpara, Benin, involved a comparison of six cotton varieties planted at two different dates (June and July). Plants were monitored to determine the dates when flowers opened at each position on fruiting branches. The LFP1 indicator made a clear distinction between varieties.

It outlines the current status of U.S. climate change action and explores four overlapping pathways of policy change: (1) the strategic demonstration of the feasibility of climate change action; (2) the creation and expansion of markets; (3) policy diffusion and learning; and (4) the creation and promulgation of norms about the need for more aggressive climate change action. These four pathways seek to fruitfully draw from rationalist and constructivist approaches to policy analysis, without collapsing or confusing the different logics. Building on this analysis, it predicts that future federal U.S. climate policy will include six major components: (1) A national cap on GHG emissions; (2) A national market based cap-and-trade GHG emissions trading scheme; (3) Mandatory renewable energy portfolio standards; (4) Increased national product standards for energy efficiency; (5) Increased vehicle fleet energy efficiency standards; and (6) Increased federal incentives for research and development on energy efficiency issues and renewable energy development. In addition, expanding federal climate policy may bring about significant changes in U.S. foreign policy as U.S. international re-engagement on climate change is likely to occur only after the development of more significant federal policy. © 2007 by The Policy Studies Organization.","Climate change; Institutions; Networks; Policy prediction; US environmental politics","climate change; emissions trading; energy efficiency; environmental policy; environmental politics; federal system; foreign policy; policy analysis; policy making; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846401131

However, the effect of the migration of theses gases between the liquid and solid insulation is often ignored. The migration phenomenon is temperature dependent and, if ignored, can potentially lead to erroneous condition assessment by the DGA method. This paper addresses the dynamic nature of propagation of these gases in such systems based on temperature variations. Diffusion times, and therefore diffusivity of the gases, in oil-impregnated cellulose are calculated by identifying the diffusion process as a linear system. The diffusion time-constants, and steady-state condition at the working concentrations, are estimated based on the identified model. A sensitivity study is performed to show the dependency of the diffusion time-constants to the temperature and the oil-cellulose ratio in the system. The equilibrium curves are obtained in the case of carbon dioxide by using solubility information of this gas in the oil and paper pulp, similar to the case of moisture equilibrium.

The total area of forest was decreased by 28%, whereas open cropped area increased by more than 100%. The conversion of forests into other land uses resulted in a remarkable decline in the C densities. Across the land-use cover, total mean C densities ranged from 46 Mg ha- 1 in open cropped area temperate to a high of 669 Mg ha- 1 in temperate natural dense forest. The heavily converted areas lost an estimated 55% of their total 1988 C pools, whereas the low-impacted areas lost only 0.12%. Changes in land use released 7.78 Mg C ha- 1 yr- 1, demonstrating that land-use changes significantly affected C flux. Therefore, the conversion of forest to agriculture land should be reversed. Agroforestry systems should be included in agricultural land in mountainous regions. The policy relevance of this work is immediate.

Regional and national issues include production of inhalable aerosols (PM2.5), where NH3 from agriculture is a critical precursor. This process is episodic. As a result, it is important to characterize the episodic nature of NH3 emissions. This paper addresses the fact that weather and soil conditions can focus manure landspreading into a relatively few days each year. The Versatile Soil Moisture Budget (VSMB) was used with 30 yr of weather data on 2576 soil landscape units in Canada to estimate the number of days in each month when manure spreading would be possible. In addition, a national survey of about 3100 livestock farmers was used to quantify common practice. The stochastic information from the VSMB and the survey were applied to an NH3 emissions model. The base case, invoked by most national NH3 emission inventory calculations, is that emissions are uniformly distributed throughout each month. The result of our study was that daily NH3 emission fluxes could be up to 20-fold high-er in the spring and fall months when manure landspreading is common but when weather and soil conditions limit the number of days available for field work. This has direct implications for estimating the role of agricultural NH3 on the episodic production of PM2.5, and this approach also has application to odor management.","Emission factor; Field working day; Livestock; Modeling; NH3; Odor","aerosol; ammonia; emission inventory; estimation method; livestock farming; manure; odor; soil moisture; survey; weather; Canada; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34347357559

Accurate quantification of CH4 and CO 2 concentrations in soils and wetlands is now possible using membrane inlet mass spectrometry. Below-ground production and headspace exchange of O2, CO2 and CH4 were monitored in microcosms from an upland Soil (Scotland) and three different peat bog systems (Sweden, Iceland and Scotland) by membrane inlet mass spectrometry. A comparison of cores from the different locations revealed that temperature, soil structure, plant cover and water table level are associated with the regulation of the depth of oxygen available for methanotrophic processes in the oxic zone and therefore gas emission rates. In aerobic soil cores, all the methane produced in anaerobic sites is oxidised rather than being emitted from the soil surface. In peat cores, molar CH4:CO2-ratios of around 1:10 indicate the boundary between the oxic and the anoxic zones. Changes in dissolved gas concentrations with depth and especially the molar CH4:CO 2-ratios are discussed. We also demonstrate that inconsistencies in dissolved gas profiles, along with higher localized molar CH4:CO 2-ratios, indicate bubble formation at depths greater than 10 cm; gas emission by ebullition was promoted at these sites. Increase in temperature had a particularly strong effect upon gas dynamics in soil and peat cores. Gas solubilities were reduced and elevated CO2 and CH4 emission rates were observed potentially due to increased microbial activity.","CO2; Membrane inlet mass spectrometry; Methane; Soil","carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; core analysis; dissolved gas; gas exchange; mass spectrometry; methanogenesis; microbial activity; microcosm; oxic conditions; peatland; soil emission; soil structure; temperature effect; vegetation cover; water table; Arctic; Eurasia; Europe; Iceland; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Scotland; Sweden; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249990591

Precipitation, glacial melt water and river runoff and air temperature increased continuously during the last decades, as did also the water level of inland lakes and the frequency of flood disasters. As a result, the vegetation cover is improved, number of days with sand-dust storms reduced. From the end of the 19th century to the 1970s, the climate was warm and dry, and then changed to warm and wet. The effects on northwest China can be classified into three classes by using the relation between precipitation and evaporation increase. If precipitation increases more than evaporation, runoff increases and lake water levels rise. We identify regions with: (1) notable change, (2) slight change and (3) no change. The future climate for doubled CO2 concentration is simulated in a nested approach with the regional climate model-RegCM2. The annual temperature will increase by 2.7° C and annual precipitation by 25%. The cooling effect of aerosols and natural factors will reduce this increase to 2.0°C and 19% of precipitation.

Two-color multiphoton ionization spectroscopy was applied, and the binding energies in the neutral ground state of the clusters were evaluated from the dissociation threshold measurements of the cluster cations. The experimental binding energies of the clusters (Do) were 1.4 ± 0.2 and 2.7 ± 0.2 kcal/mol, respectively. Estimated CCSD(T) interaction energies for the clusters at the basis set limit (De) were 2.2 and 2.8 kcal/mol, respectively. Calculated D0 values (1.7 and 2.4 kcal/mol, respectively) are close to the experimental values. Large electron correlation contributions (Ecorr = -3.6 and -2.8 kcal/mol, respectively) show that dispersion is the major source of the attraction in both clusters. The electrostatic interaction in the ethylene cluster is very small (-0.38 kcal/mol), as in the case of the benzene-methane cluster, whereas the electrostatic interaction in the acetylene cluster is large (-1.70 kcal/mol).

Among various reductant tested, Et2O was most effective for achieving high de-NOx activity for HC-SCR and H2-HC-SCR. For all the reductants, de-NOx activity at low temperature region was increased by H2 co-feeding. Degree of activity enhancement was higher for C3H8 than for oxygenates, which is consistent with our previous proposal that H2 enhances de-NOx activity by promoting the oxidative activation of alkane into partially oxidized hydrocarbon intermediates. Effects of reductants and H2 co-feeding on the SO2-tolerance were examined using Et2O, ETBE, and EtOH. The result showed that use of oxygenates as well as H2 co-feeding resulted in the higher SO2-tolerance. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

They result from the remobilisation and injection of sand during early stages of burial, and are commonly found in fine-grained mudrocks containing a pervasive polygonal fault network. This paper uses three-dimensional seismic data, from the Faroe-Shetland Basin, on the UK Atlantic margin, calibrated to nearby wells, to examine the relationship between an extensive system of large downward-tapering conical sandstone intrusions to the pervasive polygonal fault network present within the surrounding encasing host mudstones. The intrusions were injected upwards during the Late Miocene through Eocene/Oligocene claystones with a pre-existing polygonal fault network to form conical bodies up to 300 m high within the ∼700-m-thick claystone sequence. This study shows that polygonal faults and the discordant limbs of conical sandstone intrusions form two distinct dip populations with little overlap that have average dips of 58° and 26°, respectively. Polygonal faults display decreasing dip with increasing depth. However, conical sandstone intrusion dip is uniform throughout the Eocene-Oligocene succession. These observations lead us to conclude that the geometry of conical sandstone intrusions is not greatly affected by the presence of a pre-existing polygonal fault network, nor is it affected by increased overburden pressure with depth. Therefore, the 10-50° dip range displayed by the limbs of conical sandstone intrusions observed within the study area is a fundamental property of conical sandstone intrusions. The presence of a widespread region of conical sandstone intrusions in the Faroe-Shetland Basin has important implications for vertical fluid migration in the region. The Eocene-Oligocene claystones in the region have very low permeability, but the presence of large-scale conical sandstone intrusions and any possible feeder systems is likely to provide high-permeability fluid conduits through this sequence. In effect, the otherwise good regional caprock provided by the Eocene-Oligocene claystone sequence is breached by a network of sandstone intrusions possibly resulting in reduced hydrocarbon-trapping potential beneath the seal. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Distributed generation utilizing renewable energy resources offers opportunities for significant carbon dioxide and emissions reductions thus contributing solutions to broader climate change issues. Yet, renewable energy technologies like PV face various barriers for their widespread adoption. Aside from technical and cost issues, renewable technologies have to overcome the so-called carbon lock-in effects. This refers to the techno-institutional complex associated with the fossil-fuel based centralized generation regime that currently dominates energy production and use. Governmental interventions to address these issues usually can be seen as composed of research, development, demonstration and deployment or RD3 [PCAST, 1999. Panel on International Cooperation in Energy Research, Development, Demonstration, and Deployment]. This paper focused on comparing the deployment aspect of PV technology in Japan and the USA. While both governments promoted PV as part of their larger strategies to address various environmental and energy security issues, Japan has built a PV installation capacity three times that of the USA as of December 2003 with over 90% of PV installation in the grid-connected small residential system category. This is in marked contrast to the case in the USA in which the cumulative installation is spilt among different types of applications involving the grid and off the grid. We put forward two models to explain these differences in deployment strategies and their possible consequences. The first deployment model leverages upon PV as a manufactured technology with minimal customization to achieve massive deployment. The second deployment model leverages upon PV as an information technology-like technology focusing upon user oriented customization to achieve deployment. Different models have different implications to the system engineering aspect of solar PV. A focus upon the standard grid-connected distributed category in the residential setting avoids the heavy customized engineering associated with many off-grid and one-off type projects. Japanese PV deployment strategy of concentrating upon a dominant category or niche with mass market potential also well matches the institutional structure of production [Coase, 1991. The Institutional Structure of Production, in Essays on Economics and Economists. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago] within the local PV technology suppliers industry. Major vertical integrated firms can facilitate system-related learning easier than a fragmented industry within the PV value chain with minimal transaction cost. This highly suggests that deployment strategy of PV or other renewable energy technologies must address the issues of adopting a globally developed technology to local (national) conditions and has strong institutional underpinnings in addition to financial subsidies, learning investment thinking. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In Portugal, an Energy Audit and Energy Consumption Rationalization Plan was published in the form of law number 58/82, set out in the RGCE-regulations. The primary objective of the RGCE-regulations is to influence companies to consider energy as a cost factor. Auditing a bus operator company implies understanding where energy is consumed and how can it be more efficiently used. In this kind of company the vehicles are the main consumers of primary energy. Trying to improve the energy efficiency and consequently reduce the greenhouse gases emissions of all the fleet implies to analyze those vehicles in normal operational conditions. This is not an easy task, because it means to study all the vehicles operating in all the network lines, for different traffic conditions and different occupancy rates. TRANSTEP is the new developed methodology that intends to simplify this task.

In addition, it is facing the prospect of higher royalties in Alberta. Canada and Alberta have introduced intensity-based emissions-reduction targets, i.e., polluters must reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 12% for each unit of oil or gas they produce. However, both governments have avoided putting in place an absolute cap. This arrangement favors the producer because emissions can rise as production rises; in the case of an absolute cap, GHG cuts would increase with each incremental unit of production. Those that fail to meet the quota will either pay $13.55/ton into a fund to develop the technology needed to capture and store carbon dioxide, or buy carbon credits from Alberta companies that beat the 12% target. Companies that took steps to lower their GHG before 2006 will be rewarded with a limited one-off credit for early action, while operators of new facilities will be given a 3-yr grace period. Meanwhile, hanging over Alberta's upstream sector is the most comprehensive review ever undertaken of the province's royalty regime. There is a special emphasis on the oil sands, which benefit from a 1997 program that charges just 1% of gross revenues until project costs have been paid off. Subsequently, this rises to 25% of net revenues. With conventional oil and gas production in steady decline, the Alberta government forecasts its overall petroleum revenues will fall to $(Can)7.8 billion in fiscal year 2009-2010 from a peak of $(Can)14.35 billion in 2005-2006.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40849151045

Soil carbon stocks were higher in Entisols (0.72 Pg or 33.6% of CS on 43.6% of the land area) and Aridisols (0.70 Pg or 32.7% of CS on 28.9% of the land area) than in Inceptisols (0.61 Pg or 28.6% of CS on 24.01% of the land area), Alfisols (0.015 Pg or 0.007% of CS on 0.76% of the land area) and Verisols (0.105 Pg or 0.005% of the CS on the 3.2% of the land area). Torripsamments, Haplocambids and Haplustepts together held 80% of CS and 86.9% of soil organic carbon stock, whereas Haplocambids, Petrocalcids and Haplustepts comprised 72% inorganic carbon stock. Soil organic carbon density (SOC) ranged from 4000 to 7000 kg/km2 in Haplustalfs, Haplusterts, Haplustepts and Torripsamments, while its inorganic counterpart (SIC) was of higher range (10,000-19,000 kg/km2) in Petrocalcids, Haplocalcids, Halpogypsids and Torrifluents. Under scrub vegetation of semi-arid Rajasthan the mean SOC in the 0-25 cm and 0-100 cm depths were 170 and 203.9 kg/km2, respectively. In the arid region with similar situation the mean SOC was 5.5 and 14.0 kg/km2, respectively. Excessive tillage and intensive cultivation in semi-arid region reduced soil organic carbon density from 60 kg/km2 under single cropping to 10.5 kg/km2 under double cropping. Subsistence farming in the arid region maintained 47 kg/km2 SOC under croplands. SOC declined regularly from 1975 to 2002 in the arid region. A multiple linear regression model that includes rainfall together with tillage, silt, clay, available water capacity (AWC) and period of canopy cover accounted for 97% of the variation in soil organic carbon density for arid regions. The regression model further pointed out that a 4200-4600 kg/km2/year SOC could be sequestered in untilled soils of the arid region, which have year-round canopy cover. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It is shown that, depending on the activation energy, both the quasi-equilibrium statistic of charge carriers at the levels of quantum dots and nonequilibrium statistic at room temperature are possible. In the latter case, the position of the maximum in the emission spectrum is governed by the value of the demarcation transition: the quantum dots with the transition energy higher than this value feature the quasi-equilibrium population of charge carriers, while the quantum dots with the transition energy lower than the demarcation-transition energy feature the nonequilibrium population. A model based on kinetic equations was used in the theoretical analysis. The key parameters determining the statistic are the parameters of thermal ejection of charge carriers; these parameters depend exponentially on the activation energy. It is shown experimentally that the use of stimulated phase decomposition makes it possible to appreciably increase the activation energy. In this case, the thermal-activation time is found to be much longer than the recombination time for an electron-hole pair, which suppresses the redistribution of charge carriers between the quantum dots and gives rise to the nonequilibrium population.

Although CO2 uptake during the growing season can be substantial, losses during winter months reduce annual sequestration, potentially turning grazing lands into net carbon sources. The goal of this research was to quantify the magnitude of winter fluxes for humid-temperate pastures in the northeastern USA. The study was conducted from 2003 to 2005 on two pastures in the ridge and valley region of central Pennsylvania, one dominated by a mix of cool-season grasses and the other transitioning from an alfalfa to mixed-grass pasture. Pasture-scale CO2 fluxes were quantified using eddy covariance techniques. The alfalfa pasture was less of a CO2 source to the atmosphere during winter months (1 December to 31 March) than the grass pasture, averaging 2.68 g CO2 m-2 day-1 compared with 3.09 g CO2 m-2 day-1 for the grass pasture. Cumulative efflux for the winter months averaged 326 g CO2 m-2 (88 g C m-2) for the alfalfa and 375 g CO2 m-2 (101 g C m-2) for the grass pasture. In the absence of snow cover, eddy covariance measurements estimated that photosynthetic CO2 uptake occurred at temperatures below 0 °C. Canopy and leaf chamber measurements in the field and in controlled environments suggested minimum temperatures for photosynthetic CO2 uptake of about -4 °C. Even when daytime uptake occurred, nighttime efflux from the system was greater so that the pastures remained CO2 sources throughout the winter.","Carbon sequestration; Dormant-season; Photosynthesis; Respiration","alfalfa; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; eddy covariance; global warming; growing season; nutrient uptake; pasture; photosynthesis; respiration; North America; Pennsylvania; United States; Medicago sativa; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047100198

Low volume samples were taken with a time resolution of 160 min using a filter/sorption cartridge system extended by an ozone scrubber. Concentrations of mainly particle associated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and oxidised PAH (O-PAH) were determined by gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry. The sampling site was located in the city centre of Augsburg, Germany, near major roads with high traffic volume. The daily concentrations and profiles were mainly governed by local emissions from traffic and domestic heating, as well as by the meteorological conditions. During the winter campaign, concentrations were more than 10 fold higher than during the summer campaign. Highest concentrations were found concurrent with low boundary layer heights and low wind speeds. Significant diurnal variation of the PAH profiles was observed. Enhanced influences of traffic related PAH on the PAH profiles were evident during daytime in summer, whereas emissions from hot water generation and domestic heating were obvious during the night time of both seasons. A general idea about the global meteorological situation was acquired using back trajectory calculations (NOAA ARL HYSPLIT4).

The objective of this work is to add on towards a cleaner co-combustion of lignite-waste-biomass blends by utilizing compounds that could inhibit the formation of toxic pollutants. A series of co-combustion tests was performed in a pilot scale incinerator, and the emissions of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs) were measured. The co-combustion behaviour of lignite with olive kernels, MDF and sawdust was studied and the ability of additives such as urea, almond shells and municipal sewage sludge to reduce the PCDD/F emissions was examined. All blends were proven good fuels and reproducible combustion conditions were achieved. The addition of inhibitors prior to combustion showed in some cases, relatively high PCDD/F emissions reduction. Among the inhibitors tested, urea seems to achieve a reduction of PCDD/F emissions for all fuel blends, while an unstable behaviour was observed for the others. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerous methods have been developed that map burned and unburned surfaces. These methods are typically applied to coarse spatial resolution (1 km) data to produce regional estimates of the area burned, while higher spatial resolution (30 m) data are used to assess their accuracy with little regard to the accuracy of the higher spatial resolution reference data. In this study we aimed to investigate whether Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+)-derived reference imagery can be more accurately produced using such spectrally informed methods. The efficacy of several spectral index methods to discriminate between burned and unburned surfaces over a series of spatial scales (ground, IKONOS, Landsat ETM+ and data from the MOderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, MODIS) were evaluated. The optimal Landsat ETM+ reference image of burned area was achieved using a charcoal fraction map derived by linear spectral unmixing (k = 1.00, a = 99.5%), where pixels were defined as burnt if the charcoal fraction per pixel exceeded 50%. Comparison of coincident Landsat ETM+ and IKONOS burned area maps of a neighbouring region in Mongu (Zambia) indicated that the charcoal fraction map method overestimated the area burned by 1.6%. This method was, however, unstable, with the optimal fixed threshold occurring at &gt; 65% at the MODIS scale, presumably because of the decrease in signal-to-noise ratio as compared to the Landsat scale. At the MODIS scale the Mid-Infrared Bispectral Index (MIRBI) using a fixed threshold of 1.75 was determined to be the optimal regional burned area mapping index (slope = 0.99, r2 = 0.95, SE = 61.40, y = Landsat burned area, x = MODIS burned area). Application of MIRBI to the entire MODIS temporal series measured the burned area as 10 267 km2 during the 2001 fire season. The char fraction map and the MIRBI methodologies, which both produced reasonable burned area maps within southern African savannah environments, should also be evaluated in woodland and forested environments.",,"Fire detectors; Forestry; Mapping; Signal to noise ratio; Spectrometers; African savannah fires; Charcoal fraction map method; Enhanced Thematic Mapper; Mid-Infrared Bispectral Index; Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS); Satellite imagery; IKONOS; Landsat thematic mapper; MODIS; pixel; savanna; signal-to-noise ratio; spatial resolution; Fire Detectors; Forest Fires; Mapping; Satellites; Spectrometers; Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Zambia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249908083

The model was run for croplands occurring on mineral soils in European Russia and the Ukraine, representing 74Mha of cropland in Russia and 31Mha in the Ukraine. The model used climate data (1990-2070) from the HadCM3 climate model, forced by four Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission scenarios representing various degrees of globalization and emphasis on economic vs. environmental considerations. Three land use scenarios were examined, business as usual (BAU) management, optimal management (OPT) to maximize profit, and soil sustainability (SUS) in which profit was maximized within the constraint that soil carbon must either remain stable or increase. Our findings suggest that soil organic carbon (SOC) will be lost under all climate scenarios, but less is lost under the climate scenarios where environmental considerations are placed higher than purely economic considerations (IPCC B1 and B2 scenarios) compared with the climate associated with emissions resulting from the global free market scenario (IPCC A1FI scenario). More SOC is lost towards the end of the study period. Optimal management is able to reduce this loss of SOC, by up to 44% compared with business as usual management. The soil sustainability scenario could be run only for a limited area, but in that area was shown to increase SOC stocks under three climate scenarios, compared with a loss of SOC under business as usual management in the same area. Improved agricultural soil management will have a significant role to play in the adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change in this region. Further, our results suggest that this adaptation could be realized without damaging profitability for the farmers, a key criteria affecting whether optimal management can be achieved in reality. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Cropland; RothC model; Russia; Soil carbon; Ukraine","agricultural soil; biogeochemical cycle; climate change; globalization; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil management; Eastern Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Russian Federation; Ukraine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846907816

Scenarios of climate were derived from the Hadley Centre climate Version 3 (HadCM3) model; future yields were determined using the Soil-Climate-Yield model, and land use was determined from regional agricultural and economic data and a model of agricultural economics. The models suggest that optimal management, which entails the replacement of row crops with other crops, and the use of extra years of grass in the rotation could reduce Soil organic carbon (SOC) loss in the croplands of European Russia and the Ukraine by 30-44% compared to the business-as-usual management.

In this paper, we explore the constraints and barriers to implementation important for GHG mitigation in agriculture. We also examine how climate and non-climate policy in different regions of the world has affected agricultural GHG emissions in the recent past, and how it may affect emissions and mitigation implementation in the future. We examine the links between mitigation and adaptation and drives for sustainable development and the potential for agricultural GHG mitigation in the future. We describe how some countries have initiated climate and non-climate policies believed to have direct effects or synergistic effects on mitigating GHG emissions from agriculture. Global sharing of innovative technologies for efficient use of land resources and agricultural chemicals, to eliminate poverty and malnutrition, will significantly mitigate GHG emissions from agriculture. Previous studies have shown that as less than 30% of the total biophysical potential for agricultural GHG mitigation might be achieved by 2030, due to price- and non-price-related barriers to implementation. The challenge for successful agricultural GHG mitigation will be to remove these barriers by implementing creative policies. Identifying policies that provide benefits for climate, as well as for aspects of economic, social and environmental sustainability, will be critical for ensuring that effective GHG mitigation options are widely implemented in the future. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In case of unproductive wells, an analysis of local hydrogeology can save some money by avoiding wasted effort. At a well development location, the problem with low producing wells was known, but the effort was considered worth the shot as the rock shows extensive fracturing in three dimensions. The nature of the rock and the relative lack of deep weathering rendered the fracturing less likely to pass more water. The natural highland woodland vegetation is anchored by trees and shrubs with deep taproots extending to the water table.

Measurements from all four instruments were shown to be highly correlated (R2 = 0.83 to 0.92). Differences between absorption values measured by the PSAP and the Aethalometer were found to be dominated by differences in the filter media used by the respective instruments. Comparison of optical and thermal measurements revealed that the specific attenuation cross section (σATN) of light absorbing carbon (LAC) varied as a function of the time of the day, most notably during weekdays. Minimum σATN values were observed during morning rush hour when EC concentrations were at their greatest and maxima were seen in the late afternoon. These variations correlated with changes in the OC/EC ratio and the Angstrom exponent for absorption, which is consistent with changes in the mixing state of elemental carbon associated with secondary aerosol condensation on primary EC particles.

Piston cores were recovered from this ridge to understand carbon cycling, pore fluid gradients and authigenic mineralization above a methane-charged system. We present the chemistry of fluids and solids from three cores adjacent to seep locations. High fluxes of CH4 and alkalinity transport carbon from a deep zone of methanogenesis toward the seafloor. Methane, however, reacts with SO42 - across a shallow sulfate-methane transition (SMT), which generates additional alkalinity and HS-. A fraction of these CH4 oxidation products form authigenic carbonate and pyrite. These minerals are not readily apparent from visual inspection of split cores, because they exist as micritic coatings on microfossils or as framboidal pyrite. They are, however, readily observed in chemical analyses as peaks of ""labile"" Ca, Sr, Ba or S in sediment at or near the SMT. Carbon inputs and outputs nicely balance across the SMT in all three cores if one considers four relevant fluxes: loss of alkalinity to the seafloor, addition of methane from below, addition of alkalinity from below, and carbonate precipitation. Importantly, in all cores, the magnitude of the fluxes decreases in this order. Although some carbon rising from depth forms authigenic carbonate, most (&gt;80%) escapes to the ocean as alkalinity. Nonetheless, authigenic fronts in sediment on Umitaka Spur are a significant reservoir of inorganic carbon. Given calculated pore fluid fluxes for Ca and Sr, the fronts require tens of thousands of years to form, suggesting that the present state and loss of carbon represent long-lived processes. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In an attempt to understand the factors that regulate DOC in lakes, we assembled a large database (7,514 lakes from 6 continents) of DOC concentrations and other parameters that characterize the conditions in the lakes, the catchment, the soil, and the climate. DOC concentrations were in the range 0.1-332 mg L-1, and the median was 5.71 mg L-1. A partial least squares regression explained 48% of the variability in lake DOC and showed that altitude, mean annual runoff, and precipitation were negatively correlated with lake DOC, while conductivity, soil carbon density, and soil C:N ratio were positively related with lake DOC. A multiple linear regression using altitude, mean annual runoff, and soil carbon density as predictors explained 40% of the variability in lake DOC. While lake area and drainage ratio (catchment:lake area) were not correlated to lake DOC in the global data set, these two factors explained significant variation of the residuals of the multiple linear regression model in several regional subsets of data. These results suggest a hierarchical regulation of DOC in lakes, where climatic and topographic characteristics set the possible range of DOC concentrations of a certain region, and catchment and lake properties then regulate the DOC concentration in each individual lake. © 2007. by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.",,"catchment; concentration (composition); dissolved organic carbon; hydrogeochemistry; lake water; multiple regression; soil carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249698239

To date, few drugs have been commercialized as enzyme inhibitors; yet, prescription of SBIs has emerged as the gold standard for some cases of non-life-threatening antifungal chemotherapy and in crop protection. SBIs are not designed for their structural resemblance to the sterol molecule; they nonetheless can engender a curative effect by interfering with sterol production and homeostasis in the pathogenic organism. The increased use of SBIs in recent years, particularly the azole antifungals, has resulted in the development of resistance to those drugs, necessitating additional work to further our understanding of antifungal resistance and to explore opportunities to develop new enzyme inhibitors and uncover new enzyme targets that can regulate carbon flux in the post-lanosterol/cycloartenol pathway. This article reports general considerations for enzyme mechanism and active-site probes using inhibitors of the C-methylation reaction, including a potential new class of antifungal/antiparasitic agents of phytosterol synthesis tailored as mechanism-based inactivators. These steroid-based compounds prepared with different sterol side chain functionalities are designed to reversibly or irreversibly impair the sterol methyltransferase, an enzyme expressed in pathogenic microbes and plants but not in the human host. The salient aspects of these and related topics directed toward the enzyme recognition of sterol structure, and the inhibitory properties and catalytic competence of a series of specifically modified substrate analogs that affect sterol methyltransferase action are discussed. © AOCS 2007.",,"Mechanism based inactivators; Sterol biosynthesis inhibitors (SBI); Sterol methyltransferase; Transition state analogs; Biosynthesis; Diseases; Drug products; Enzyme inhibition; Enzymes; Fungi; Alcohols; 24 methylenelophenol c methyltransferase; alkaloid derivative; azasteroid; aziridine; berberine; carbon; cycloartenol; cycloartenol 24 methyltransferase; ergosterol; lanosterol; methyltransferase; nitrogen; palmatine; plakinamine a; plakinamine b; pyrrole derivative; sitosterol; solacongestidine; solanidine; solasodine; sterol 14alpha demethylase; sterol methyltransferase; tomatidine; triparinol; unclassified drug; verazine; zymosterol 24 methyltransferase; alkylation; antibiotic resistance; antifungal activity; catalysis; catalyst; conference paper; crop protection; drug structure; drug use; enzyme active site; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; enzyme mechanism; enzyme metabolism; enzyme substrate complex; fungus; homeostasis; methylation; mycosis; protein domain; protein expression; reaction analysis; signal transduction; stereochemistry; stereospecificity; sterol analysis; sterol synthesis; structure analysis; Enzyme Inhibitors; Ergosterol; Methyltransferases; Structure-Activity Relationship",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947682816

We analyzed geographic variation in body size and ovipositor dimensions in three subspecies (constricticollis, babai, and toyamensis) in different climatic conditions and on different host plants. In addition, the genetic differentiation among subspecies was assessed using nuclear 28S rRNA gene sequences. The body size of subspecies toyamensis is smaller than that of the other subspecies; mean body size tended to increase towards the northeast. Ovipositor length and width are smaller in subspecies toyamensis than in the other subspecies. Although these dimensions depend on body size, ovipositor length still differed significantly between toyamensis and constricticollis-babai after the effect of body size was removed. Multiple regression analyses revealed that body size and ovipositor size are significantly correlated with the depth of snow, but not temperature or rainfall; sizes were larger in places where the snowfall was greatest.

Substitution to a lower or zero-carbon fuel source can reduce the rate of increase in or displace fossil fuel emissions. There are various means to capture and concentrate CO 2 emitted from new coal based power plants. The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) conducted a study that examines the state of development and economics of several CO 2 mitigation options on new subcritical and supercritical systems.

A scale was developed to assess perceived violence climate, including items about management attention, concern, and policies designed to keep employees safe from violence. Data were collected from a sample of 198 nurses from a US Hospital. Perceived violence climate was found to correlate significantly with both physical violence and verbal aggression experienced by the nurses, injury from violence, and perceptions of workplace danger. Furthermore, regression analyses showed that climate explained additional variance in psychological strain and perceptions of danger over experienced violence.

We used a data set from a total of 11 estuarine transects, comprising measurements of bulk dissolved organic matter (dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen), dissolved nitrogen (total dissolved nitrogen, ammonium, nitrate + nitrite and dissolved organic nitrogen), optical absorbance measurements (a350, S290-350) and fluorescence excitation emission matrix measurements (fluorophores A, H, B and T intensity and A and H emission wavelength maxima). In order to investigate trends within the numerous parameters measured, multivariate statistics were employed. Principal components analyses showed 63.4% of the variability in the total data set can be explained by two sets of components and 74.9% of the variability by the spectrophotometric measurements alone. In both analyses the first component correlated to the mixing of terrestrial and marine waters and the second component was correlated to sources of pollution such as domestic sewage. Within the data set, river flow and terrestrially derived DOM were significantly correlated, and situations with high river input showed an increase in terrestrial signature in the estuary. Discriminant analyses were also carried out and indicated that 59.8% (total data set) and 53.3% (solely spectrophotometric data) of the samples can be correctly classified into their respective groups (water categories) assigned on the basis of salinity and sampling location. Overall the results clearly show the potential of spectrophotometric techniques to discriminate distinct water categories with different DOM characteristics. In particular, measurement of the fluorophore H emission maxima, the spectral slope parameter, S290-350, and fluorophores T and B intensity enabled discrimination of DOM from riverine, estuarine, marine, and sewage affected water categories. The results presented here indicate the ability of spectrophotometric data alone to distinguish between marine, anthropogenic and terrestrial DOM and distinguish terrestrial DOM from different catchments (Tyne vs. Tweed). With current advances in the in-situ deployment of absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy it is anticipated that multivariate statistics will gain importance as a cost effective, powerful and diagnostic approach to assessing the distributions of water types and their associated DOM characteristics and fluxes at the land-ocean interface. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Saplings of these same species were measured in the first year of the Duke Forest FACE experiment and at that time showed only seasonal fluctuations in acclimation of photosynthesis to elevated [CO2]. Based on observations from the Duke Forest FACE experiment, we hypothesized that after seven years of exposure to elevated [CO2] significant photosynthetic down-regulation would be observed in these tree species. To test our hypothesis, photosynthetic CO2-response and light-response curves, along with chlorophyll fluorescence, chlorophyll concentration and foliar N were measured twice during the summer of 2003. Exposure to elevated [CO2] continued to increase photosynthesis in all species measured after seven years of treatment with the greatest photosynthetic increase observed near saturating irradiances. In all species, elevated [CO2] increased electron transport efficiency but did not significantly alter carboxylation efficiency. Quantum yield estimated by light curves, chlorophyll concentration, and foliar nitrogen concentrations were unaffected by elevated [CO2].

(2) What is the water threshold for tree seedling establishment in these arid ecosystems? Location: Atacama Desert, western South America: Piura (5°10′ S, 80°37′ W), Mejia (17°00′ S, 71°59′ W), Fray Jorge (30°41′ S, 71°37′ W). Methods: We experimentally simulated a gradient of ENSO rainfall in three locations encompassing the total extent of the Atacama Desert to test the relative importance of regional climate for seedling establishment during rainy pulses. We also carried out a common garden experiment to test the role of potential interspecific differences in growth rate among two Prosopis tree species. Results: Water threshold for seedling survival increased towards the south with less than 27 mm required in Piura, 100 mm in Mejia and 450 mm in Fray Jorge. We found that seedling survival and growth rate (shoots and roots) were much higher in Piura than in the other two sites for both Prosopis species. Conclusions: Our results indicate that tree establishment during rainy pulses is more likely to be successful in regions where rain falls during warm months and stimulates fast plant growth, and where loose soil texture facilitates deep root growth and therefore access to more stable water sources. © IAVS; Opulus Press.","Afforestation; Arid; El Niño; Rainy pulse; Restoration; Seedling establishment; Semi-arid; Water threshold","Prosopis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845308114

Many of the according RES and RUE measures are not attractive for investors from an economic point of view. Therefore, governments all over the world have to spend public money to promote these technologies/measures to bring them into market. These expenditures have to be adjusted to budget concerns and should be spent most efficiently. Therefore, the spent money has to be dedicated to technologies and efficiency measures with the best yield in CO2 reduction without wasting money. The core question: 'How can public money-for promoting sustainable energy systems-be spent most efficiently to reduce GHG emissions?' has well been investigated by the European project Invert. In course of this project, a simulation tool has been designed to answer this core question. This paper describes the modelling with the Invert simulation tool and shows the key features necessary for simulating the energy system. A definition of 'Promotion Scheme Efficiency' is given, which allows estimating the most cost-effective technologies and/or efficiency measures to reduce CO2 emissions. Investigations performed with the Invert simulation tool deliver an optimum portfolio mix of technologies and efficiency measures for each selected region.

We employed a quantitative genetic framework to examine how the expression of genetic variation and covariation in fitness-related traits, and thus, the evolutionary potential of a species, is influenced by CO2. In two field experiments, genotypes of the dominant grassland perennial Bromus erectus were grown for several years in plots maintained at present-day or at elevated CO2 levels. Under noncompetitive conditions (experiment 1), elevated CO2 had little impact on plant survival, growth, and reproduction. Under competitive conditions in plots with diverse plant communities (experiment 2), performance of B. erectus was reduced by elevated CO2. This suggests that the effect of CO2 was largely indirect, intensifying competitive interactions. Elevated CO2 had significant effects on the expression of genetic variation in both the competitive and noncompetitive environment, but the effects were in opposite direction. Heritability of plant size was generally higher at elevated than at ambient CO2 in the noncompetitive environment, but lower in the competitive environment. Selection analysis revealed a positive genotypic selection differential for plant size at ambient CO2, indicating selection favoring genotypes with high growth rate. At elevated CO2, the corresponding selection differential was nonsignificant and slightly negative. This suggests that elevated CO2 is unlikely to stimulate the evolution of high biomass productivity in this species. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Adaptation; Competition; Elevated CO2; Global change; Grassland; Heritability; Quantitative genetics; Selection","adaptation; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide enrichment; competition (ecology); environmental factor; environmental stress; grass; growth response; heritability; perennial plant; prediction; Bromus; Bromus erectus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247577510

This article investigates NAFTA's outcomes in terms of energy use and the emission of atmospheric pollutants. Specifically, has entry into NAFTA led to a convergence or divergence in indicators of emissions, environmental efficiency, and emissions-specific technology in Mexico, the United States, and Canada? A battery of tests is applied to these indicators for energy use and carbon, sulfur, and NOx emissions in the three countries. The results show that the extreme predictions of the outcomes of NAFTA have not materialized. Rather, trends that were already present before the introduction of NAFTA continue and, in some cases, improve post-NAFTA, but not yet in a dramatic way. There is strong evidence of convergence across the three countries toward a lower intensity of energy use and emissions per unit of GDP. Although intensity is rising initially for some variables in Mexico, it eventually begins to fall post-NAFTA. Per capita emissions of sulfur and NOx also show convergence, but this is not the case for energy and carbon, and the latter variables also drift moderately upwards. The state of technology in energy efficiency and sulfur abatement is improving in all countries, although there is little, if any, sign of convergence and NAFTA has no effect on the rate of technology diffusion. However, total energy use and carbon emissions increase both pre- and post-NAFTA and total NOx emissions increase in Mexico. Only total sulfur emissions are stable and falling in all three NAFTA partners. © 2007 The Policy Studies Journal.",,"atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; energy use; environmental impact; Gross Domestic Product; NAFTA; technology diffusion; Canada; Mexico [North America]; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250706707

However, this may not be feasible in settings where data are limited or policy decisions are needed in the short term. Intake fraction (iF), defined as the fraction of emissions of a pollutant or its precursor that is inhaled by the population, is a metric that can be used to compare exposure assessment methods in a health benefits analysis context. To clarify the utility of rapid-assessment methods, we calculate particulate matter iFs for the Mexico City Metropolitan Area using five methods, some more resource intensive than others. First, we create two simple box models to describe dispersion of primary fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the Mexico City basin. Second, we extrapolate iFs for primary PM2.5, ammonium sulfate, and ammonium nitrate from US values using a regression model. Third, we calculate iFs by assuming a linear relationship between emissions and population-weighted concentrations of primary PM2.5, ammonium nitrate, and ammonium sulfate (a particle composition method). Finally, we estimate PM iFs from detailed atmospheric dispersion and chemistry models run for only a short period of time. Intake fractions vary by up to a factor of five, from 23 to 120 per million for primary PM2.5. Estimates of 60, 7, and 0.7 per million for primary PM, secondary ammonium sulfate, and secondary ammonium nitrate, respectively, represent credible central estimates, with an approximate factor of two uncertainty surrounding each estimate. Our results emphasize that multiple rapid-assessment methods can provide meaningful estimates of iFs in resource-limited environments, and that formal uncertainty analysis, with special attention to model biases and uncertainty, would be important for health benefits analyses. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Irradiation with charged beams in scanning electron microscopes (SEM) and focused ion beam (FIB) systems may result in the trapping of charge at irradiation induced or pre-existing defects within the implanted microvolume of the dielectric material. The significant perturbing influence on dielectric materials of both electron and (Ga+) ion beam irradiation is assessed using scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques. Kelvin Probe Microscopy (KPM) is an advanced SPM technique in which long-range Coulomb forces between a conductive atomic force probe and the silicon dioxide specimen enable the potential at the specimen surface to be characterized with high spatial resolution. KPM reveals characteristic significant localized potentials in both electron and ion implanted dielectrics. The potentials are observed despite charge mitigation strategies including prior coating of the dielectric specimen with a layer of thin grounded conductive material. Both electron- and ion-induced charging effects are influenced by a delicate balance of a number of different dynamic processes including charge-trapping and secondary electron emission. In the case of ion beam induced charging, the additional influence of ion implantation and nonstoichiometric sputtering from compounds is also important. The presence of a localized potential will result in the electromigration of mobile charged defect species within the irradiated volume of the dielectric specimen. This electromigration may result in local modification of the chemical composition of the irradiated dielectric.

The objective is to improve relative correlation and chronology over what can be achieved with either method alone. Core MD99-2269 was taken from the Húnaflóaáll Trough on the north Iceland shelf. Core MD99-2322 was collected from the Kangerlussuaq Trough on the east Greenland margin. Both cores are well dated, with 27 and 20 accelerator mass spectrometry 14C dates for cores 2269 and 2322, respectively. Paleomagnetic measurements made on u channel samples document a strong, stable, single-component magnetization. The temporal similarities of paleomagnetic inclination and declination records are shown using each core's independent calibrated radiocarbon age model. Comparison of the PSV records reveals that the relative correlation between the two cores could be further improved. Starting in the depth domain, tie points initially based on calibrated 14C dates are either adjusted or added to maximize PSV correlations. Radiocarbon dates from both cores are then combined on a common depth scale resulting from the PSV correlation. Support for the correlation comes from the consistent interweaving of dates, correct alignment of the Saksunarvatn tephra, and the improved correlation of paleoceanographic proxy data (percent carbonate). These results demonstrate that PSV correlation used in conjunction with 14C dates can improve relative correlation and also regional chronologies by allowing dates from various stratigraphic sequences to be combined into a single, higher dating density, age-to-depth model.

Peatland carbon cycling is affected by water table position which is predicted to be lowered by climate change. Therefore we compared carbon fluxes along a natural peatland microtopographic gradient (control) to an adjacent microtopographic gradient with an experimentally lowered water table (experimental) during three growing seasons to assess the impact of water table drawdown on peatland-atmosphere carbon exchange. Water table drawdown induced peat subsidence and a change in the vegetation community at the experimental site. This limited differences in carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange between the control and experimental sites resulting in no significant differences between sites after three seasons. However, there was a trend to higher respiration rates and increased productivity in low-lying zones (hollows) and this was coincident with increased vegetation cover at these plots. In general, CH4 efflux was reduced at the experimental site, although CH4 efflux from control and experimental hollows remained similar throughout the study. The differential response of carbon cycling to the water table drawdown along the microtopographic gradient resulted in local topographic high zones (hummocks) experiencing a relative increase in global warming potential (GWP) of 152%, while a 70% reduction in GWP was observed at hollows. Thus the distribution and composition of microtopographic elements, or microforms, within a peatland is important for determining how peatland carbon cycling will respond to climate change.

We present in this paper a number of future scenarios of emissions of black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) by world region, which we combine with sulfate (SO4) assessed in terms of the emissions of its precursor, SO 2. We find that aerosol emissions from the household and industrial sectors are likely to decline along almost all future pathways. Transportation emissions, however, are subject to complex interacting forces that can lead to either increases or decreases. Biomass burning declines in many scenarios, but the Amazon rainforests remain vulnerable if unsustainable economic growth persists. East Asia is the key region for primary aerosols, and trends in China will have a major bearing on the direction and magnitude of releases of BC (expected reductions in the range of 640-1290 Gg), OC (reductions of 520-1900 Gg), and SO2 (ranging from an increase of 21 Tg to a reduction of 30 Tg).

A study was executed in Kuwait's desert to develop the appropriate plant palette, to provide selected native and acclimatized plants to enhance the microclimate and periodically assess the status of native flora and fauna at the site. Approximately 2240 acclimatized native and naturalized plants and mangrove seedlings in addition to a desert-seed mix were used for planting at the project site. The growth and development of these plants were monitored routinely, and the initial results were encouraging. Soil and water samples were routinely collected and analyzed for various parameters. The results suggest that the micro-climate of the site has been improved with the agricultural activities occurring at the site, where 12 native plant species and 35 native and migratory birds were observed at the time of the project termination.","Biodiversity conservation; Desert development; Native plant restoration; Sustainable greenery development","Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847414472

The study has examined the relationships between climate variations and corn yields and, in addition, has estimated the potential predictability of corn yields in Ceará drawing on the now well-established seasonal predictability of the region's climate based on prevailing patterns of sea surface temperature (SST), especially in the tropical Atlantic and tropical Pacific Oceans. The relationships between corn yields and climate variables have been explored using observed data for the period of 1952-2001. A linear regression-based corn-yield model was evaluated by comparing the model-simulated yields with the observations using three goodness-of-fit measures: the coefficient of determination, the index of agreement, and the mean absolute error. A comparative performance analysis was carried out on several climate variables to determine the most appropriate climate index for simulating corn yields in Ceará. A weather index was defined to measure the severity of drought and flooding conditions in the growing season for corn. The analysis indicated that the weather index is the best climate parameter for simulating corn yields in Ceará. The observed weather index can explain 56.8% of the variance of the observed corn yields. High potential predictability of the weather index was revealed by the evaluation of an ensemble of 10 runs with the NCEP Regional Spectral Model nested into the ECHAM4.5 atmospheric general circulation model, driven with observed SSTs in each season for the period of 1971-2000. Whereas these runs are based on the actual observed SST pattern in each season, other studies have shown that persistence of SST over several months is sufficient for a true predictive capability. The aim here was to show that the SST-forced component of climate variation does translate into the weather features that are important for crop yields. Indeed, the results demonstrate the striking extent to which the year-to-year changes in SST force local climate characteristics that can specify the year-to-year variations in corn yields. The variance of corn yield explained by the SST-driven model was 49.5%. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Crops; Linear regression; Mathematical models; Statistics; Weather forecasting; Atmospheric general circulation model; Climate variability; Crop yield; Sea surface temperature; Climatology; climate variation; crop yield; drought; flooding; maize; sea surface temperature; semiarid region; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Tropical); Brazil; Ceara; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Tropical); South America; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947501591

The key element in AZEP is an integrated MCM-reactor, in which (a) O2 is separated from air by means of a mixed-conducting membrane (MCM), (b) combustion of natural gas occurs in an N2-free environment and (c) the heat of combustion is transferred to air by heat exchange. This paper focuses on the development and testing of the ceramic components of the MCM-reactor (air separation membrane and heat exchangers). For compactness and manufacturability, a module design based on extruded square channel monoliths has been chosen. The manifold design enables gas distribution in a checkerboard pattern. Modules with contact area of &gt;500 m2/m3 have been produced. Results from testing of the modules under close to realistic process conditions agree with model predictions. Extrapolation to AZEP process conditions gives an oxygen production rate of around 37 mol O2/(m3 s), or 15 MW/m3 power density (per net MCM volume).

The United States has responded aggressively to the risk of terrorism while doing very little about the risk of climate change. For the United States alone, the cost of the Iraq War is in excess of the anticipated cost of the Kyoto Protocol. The divergence presents a puzzle; it also raises more general questions about both risk perception and the public demand for legislation. The best explanation for the divergence emphasizes bounded rationality. Americans believe that aggressive steps to reduce the risk of terrorism promise to deliver significant benefits in the near future at acceptable cost. By contrast, they believe that aggressive steps to reduce the risk of climate change will not greatly benefit American citizens in the near future - and they are not willing to pay a great deal to reduce that risk. This intuitive form of cost-benefit analysis is greatly influenced by behavioral factors, including the availability heuristic, probability neglect, outrage, and myopia. All of these contribute, after 9/11, to a willingness to support significant steps to respond to terrorism and to relative indifference to climate change. It follows that Americans are likely to support significant steps in response to climate change only if one of two conditions is met: the costs of those steps are perceived to be acceptably low; or new information, perhaps including a salient incident, indicates that Americans have much to gain from risk reduction in the relatively near future.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947522764

This paper relates these issues to the quest for a new energy carrier – molecular hydrogen – which might take a place comparable to that of electricity. The paper focuses attention on molecular hydrogen for use in light duty vehicles. The United States has learned or is learning to deal with most of the worst environmental impacts of energy use. But there is one problem we have not learned to control – carbon dioxide (CO2) releases from combustion of fossil fuels. Internationally, the Kyoto Protocol is a response but it has been rejected in the United States. The protocol tells what commitments are expected by various countries but does nothing to make such changes economically viable. To meet the goals requires not simply institutional and economic changes, it needs technological advances. Figure 17.1 provides 2003 data on US sources of CO2 emissions (EPA, 2005). The largest two sources are coal in electricity generation and petroleum in transportation, particularly in light duty vehicles. Technologies that reduce CO2 from electricity generation or from transportation vehicles could, in principle, be very important for addressing this serious environmental problem. © Cambridge University Press 2007, Cambridge University Press, 2010.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Coal combustion; Coal transportation; Education; Electric power generation; Energy policy; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Molecular physics; Petroleum transportation; Vehicles; Economically viable; Electricity generation; Energy productions; Environmental problems; Light duty vehicles; Molecular hydrogen; Technological advances; Transportation vehicles; Environmental impact",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926953556

The highly adaptive AAPs compose more than 10% of the microbial community in some euphotic upper ocean waters and are potentially major contributors to the fixation of the greenhouse gas CO2. We present the complete genomic sequence and feature analysis of the AAP Roseobacter denitrificans, which reveal clues to its physiology. The genome lacks genes that code for known photosynthetic carbon fixation pathways, and most notably missing are genes for the Calvin cycle enzymes ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO) and phosphoribulokinase. Phylogenetic evidence implies that this absence could be due to a gene loss from a RuBisCO-containing α-proteobacterial ancestor. We describe the potential importance of mixotrophic rather than autotrophic CO2 fixation pathways in these organisms and suggest that these pathways function to fix CO2 for the formation of cellular components but do not permit autotrophic growth. While some genes that code for the redox-dependent regulation of photosynthetic machinery are present, many light sensors and transcriptional regulatory motifs found in purple photosynthetic bacteria are absent.

During the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods (206-65 million years ago, Ma) the climate was more uniformly warm and moist than at present and tropical rainforests were widespread. Grasses evolved during the Jurassic period and they expanded greatly as the climate differentiated with reduced rainfall and temperatures. C4-grasses probably arose during the Oligocene period (24-35 Ma). During the Miocene period (23.8-5.3 Ma) grasslands expanded into huge areas (e.g. prairies in the USA, steppe in Eurasia, and pampas and llanos in South America). During the Quaternary period (1.8 Ma till now) some twenty-two different ice ages with periodicities of about 100 000 years occurred. Eighteen-thousand years ago, north-western Europe had a polar climate with tundra vegetation and the Mediterranean region was covered by steppe. During that time Amazonia was so dry that it was covered in extensive areas of savanna and the Sahara expanded rapidly. Only in the last 10 000 years has a closed rainforest covered the Amazonian region again. However, 9000 years ago a brief period of global warming caused excessive rains, which caused the sea and river levels to rise in north-western Europe with tremendous loss of life. The present period of extreme dryness in the Sahara only started some 5000 years ago and then the desert expanded rapidly into the Sahel. Before that the Sahara was covered by steppe. Global warming took place between about ad 900 and about ad 1200 or 1300 just before the Little Ice Age (1550-1700 ad). The article concludes with a description of temperature and vegetation changes that are occurring in Europe at present. It is predicted that C4-grasses, which are already present in southern Europe, will further expand but that, in the short term, land abandonment will have much more deleterious effects than temperature change due to increased wild fires, loss of biodiversity and desertification. © 2007 The Author.","Climate change; Desertification; Geological time; Global warming; Grasslands","climate change; Cretaceous; desertification; geological time; global warming; grass; grassland; Jurassic; Little Ice Age; Mediterranean environment; Oligocene; Quaternary; tundra; vegetation; wildfire; Africa; Amazonia; Eurasia; North America; Sahara; South America; United States; Poaceae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249995977

The presence of molecular emission provides some clues that could help in understanding the persistence of water molecules in the envelope of K3-35.

In the agriculturally and environmentally important soils of northern Kazakhstan, which primarily support cereal cultivation, economic rewards might encourage such monoculture practices. The purpose of this study was to clarify the influence of land use on the dynamics of soil organic carbon in situ for the three different soil classes, Dark Chestnut (DC), Southern Chernozem (SC) and Ordinary Chernozem (OC), in this region. Fluctuations in CO2 emission from the soils showed a similar pattern to temperature fluctuations. Land use markedly influenced the seasonal variation of CO2 emission, in particular fluctuations in CO2 sensitivity to soil temperature. To estimate daily CO2 emission, a prediction equation of CO2 emission using stepwise multiple regression of the Arrehenius model was derived from environmental soil factors by soil type and land use type. Using soil environmental factors, 40-80% of the variation in CO2 emission could be estimated. For cereal fields, the mean annual CO2 emission was estimated to range from 0.75 (DC) to 1.14 (SC) Mg C ha-1, and carbon input as plant residues ranged from 0.75 (DC) to 1.82 (SC) Mg C ha-1. The annual carbon budget ranged from 0.10 to 0.35 Mg C ha-1. In contrast, the carbon budget of summer fallow fields was approximately -0.8 Mg C ha-1. Thus, the carbon budget of the typical 4-year crop rotation system was estimated to range from -0.42 (DC) to 0.25 (OC) Mg C ha-1. It should be noted that carbon budgets were negative at DC and SC sites. Although the carbon budget of meadow fields ranged from 0.81 to 1.26 Mg C ha-1, meadow management at all sites contributed to carbon sequestration. Therefore, to prevent depletion of soil organic carbon in northern Kazakhstan, we recommend that meadow management be introduced as part of the crop rotation system, especially at SC and DC sites. © 2007 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.","Carbon budget; Chernozem soil; Grain farming; Northern Kazakhstan; Summer fallow",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847671874

Under this approach, individual regional climate models perform simulations with all modeling parameters and parameterizations held constant over a specific period on several prescribed domains representing different climatic regions. The transferability framework goes beyond previous regional climate model intercomparisons to provide a global method for testing and improving model parameterizations by constraining the simulations within analyzed boundaries for several domains. Transferability intercomparisons expose the limits of our current regional modeling capacity by examining model accuracy on a wide range of climate conditions and realizations. Intercomparison of these individual model experiments provides a means for evaluating strengths and weaknesses of models outside their ""home domains"" (domain of development and testing). Reference sites that are conducting coordinated measurements under the continental-scale experiments under the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Hydrometeorology Panel provide data for evaluation of model abilities to simulate specific features of the water and energy cycles. A systematic intercomparison across models and domains more clearly exposes collective biases in the modeling process. By isolating particular regions and processes, regional model transferability intercomparisons can more effectively explore the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of predictability. A general improvement of model ability to simulate diverse climates will provide more confidence that models used for future climate scenarios might be able to simulate conditions on a particular domain that are beyond the range of previously observed climates. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Computer simulation; Hydrology; Energy budget; Global water cycle; Hydrometeorology; Regional climate model; Climatology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247575328

This invariably involves judging the additionality of such projects. The paper suggests a new approach to judge the additionality of such stand-alone small hydropower projects. This has been done by breaking up additionality into two components: external and local. The external additionality is project developer dependent. For determining the local additionality, the paper takes into account the probability of a village getting electrified over a period of time, which is kept equal to the possible crediting period. This is done by defining an electrification factor (EF) whose value depends on the degree of isolation, financial constraints and institutional constraints encountered while electrifying a mountainous village. Using this EF, the additionality of a CDM project can be judged in a much easier and accurate way. The paper is based on the data and inputs gathered during site visits to many isolated villages located in the eastern Indian Himalayas. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A significant fraction of the high-redshift galaxies show strong Lyα emission lines. For redshifts z &gt; 5, most known galaxies belong to this class. However, so far not much is known about the physical structure and nature of these objects. Aims. Our aim is to analyse the Lyα emission in a sample of high-redshift UV-continuum selected galaxies and to derive the physical conditions that determine the Lyα profile and the line strength. Methods. VLT/FORS spectra with a resolution of R ≈ 2000 of 16 galaxies in the redshift range of z = 2.7 to 5 are presented. The observed Lyα profiles are compared with theoretical models. Results. The Lyα lines range from pure absorption (EW = -17 Å) to strong emission (EW = 153 Å). Most Lẙ emission lines show an asymmetric profile, and three galaxies have a double-peaked profile. Both types of profiles can be explained by a uniform model consisting of an expanding shell of neutral and ionised hydrogen around a compact starburst region. The broad, blueshifted, low-ionisation interstellar absorption lines indicate a galaxy-scale outflow of the ISM. The strengths of these lines are found to be determined in part by the velocity dispersion of the outflowing medium. We find star-formation rates of these galaxies ranging from SFRUV = 1.2 to 63.2 M⊙yr-1 uncorrected for dust absorption. Conclusions. The Lyα emission strength of our target galaxies is found to be determined by the amount of dust and the kinematics of the outflowing material. © ESO 2007.","Galaxies: emission lines; Galaxies: high-redshift; Galaxies: ISM","Astrophysics; Ionization; Mathematical models; Spectral resolution; Emission lines; High redshift; Interstellar absorption lines; Velocity dispersion; Galaxies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249293723

Sustainable waste management requires a good integrated waste management system and government policies that encourage waste prevention, reuse and both materials and thermal recycling. Eventually, landfills will only be used for stabilised materials. Suitable legislation is necessary with incentives and raise public awareness, to maximise the valorisation of waste materials. Municipal solid waste incineration represents a considerable potential for reduction in reactivity of any residual landfilled material on one side and potential energy source on another. Therefore, incineration as a way of municipal solid waste valorisation has a high importance in resources recovery within the integrated waste management. Power generation from waste could be a significant contribution to the reduction in overall emissions and an alternative to displace energy produced from fossil fuels. Therefore, a demand for increasing amounts of MSW to incinerate is expectable. Heat recovery, efficient flue gas cleaning systems and significant greenhouse gas abatement capacity makes municipal solid waste incineration an attractive environmentally sound option. In the present paper the authors focus on the potential of MSW incineration and its implementation to energy systems for isolated communities such as islands. Islands have several particular characteristics that considerably influence their energy and sustainable waste management options, which will be addressed. Based on a selected case, it will he demonstrated what are the possible ways of implementation and perspectives for municipal solid waste treatment and exploitation. © 2007 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

However, there is little research of the relationship between the stringency of environmental regulation and productivity growth at the plant level; and the results of the few existing studies are ambiguous. Moreover, the measures of productivity growth applied in previous studies do not credit plants for emission reductions, and this may result in understatement of productivity growth. We perform regression analyses of productivity growth on regulatory stringency using plant level data. To credit a plant for emission reductions, we include emissions as inputs when calculating an environmental Malmquist productivity index (EMI); and do not include emissions when calculation the traditional Malmquist productivity index (MI). The regression analyses show that the overall effect of the regulatory stringency faced by plants on plants' productivity growth is statistically insignificant when MI is applied to measure productivity growth. However, when we apply EMI, the effect is positive and statistically significant. This indicates that not accounting for emission reductions when measuring productivity growth can result in too pessimistic conclusions regarding the effect of regulatory stringency on productivity growth. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We present the deepest spectra taken to date with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on the Spitzer Space Telescope. We targeted two faint (f24 ∼ 0.15 mJy) sources in the Southern GOODS field at z = 1.09 and z = 2.69. Spectra of the lower redshift target were taken in the observed-frame 8-21 μm range, while the spectrum of the higher redshift target covered 21-37 μm. We also present the spectra of two secondary sources within the slit. We detect strong PAH emission in all four targets, and compare the spectra to those of local galaxies observed by the IRS. The z = 1.09 source appears to be a typical, star-formation-dominated IR-luminous galaxy, while the z = 2.69 source is a composite source with strong star formation and a prominent AGN. The IRAC colors of this source show no evidence of rest-frame near-IR stellar photospheric emission. We demonstrate that an AGN that contributes only a small (∼10%) fraction of the bolometric luminosity can produce enough hot dust emission to overwhelm the near-IR photospheric emission from stars. Such sources would be excluded from photometric surveys that rely on the near-IR bump to identify starbursts, leading to an underestimate of the star formation rate density. © 2007.

These models include a chemical model, where the numerous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) species are lumped together in classes. On the other hand, emission inventories usually report only total non-methane VOC (NMVOC), but not a subdivision into these classes. Thus, VOC species profiles are needed that resolve total NMVOC emission data. The objective of this publication is to present the results of a compilation of VOC species profiles that dissolve total VOC into single-species profiles for all relevant anthropogenic emission source categories and the European situation. As in atmospheric dispersion models usually modules for generating biogenic emissions are directly included, only anthropogenic emissions are addressed. VOC species profiles for 87 emission source categories have been developed. The underlying data base can be used to generate the data for all chemical mechanisms. The species profiles have been generated using recent measurements and studies on VOC species resolution and thus represent the current state of knowledge in this area. The results can be used to create input data for atmospheric dispersion models in Europe. The profiles, especially those for solvent use, still show large uncertainties. There is still an enormous need for further measurements to achieve an improved species resolution. In addition, the solvent use directive and the DECOPAINT directive of the European Commission will result in a change of the composition of paints; more water-based and high-solid paints will be used; thus the species resolution will change drastically in the next years. Of course, the species resolution for combustion and production processes also requires further improvement. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The Alberta clipper (hereafter simply clipper) occurs most frequently during December and January and substantially less frequently during October and March. These cyclones generally move southeastward from the lee of the Canadian Rockies toward or just north of Lake Superior before progressing eastward into southeastern Canada or the northeastern United States, with less than 10% of the cases in the climatology tracking south of the Great Lakes. Characteristics of the structure and evolution of clippers during a 36-h period leading up to departure of the cyclone from the lee of the Canadian Rockies and a 60-h period after departure as the cyclone traverses central and eastern North America are examined through composite analyses. Over the course of the predeparture period, a cyclone over the Gulf of Alaska approaches the west coast of North America, and through its interaction with the mountainous terrain of western North America spawns a surface lee trough, characterized by a thermal ridge at 850 hPa, to the east of the Canadian Rockies. This thermal ridge dampens considerably as the composite clipper moves into central North America away from the immediate lee of the Canadian Rockies. The composite clipper system evolves from a lee cyclone with its nonclassical thermal structure to a more classically structured midlatitude cyclone as it moves through central and eastern North America largely as a result of rotation of the low-level thermal gradient and the increasing westward tilt with height of the composite clipper over the last 36 h of the postdeparture period. The thermal gradient rotation is dynamically linked to convergence of the along-isentrope component of the Q vector and thus to the ascent that sustains the clipper and creates some of its characteristic sensible weather elements. Such dynamical forcing is a direct consequence of the persistent westward displacement of the 500-hPa vorticity maximum with respect to the composite clipper sea level pressure minimum that characterizes the postdeparture period. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Flow interactions; Sea level; Storms; Thermal gradients; Composite analysis; Composite clipper system; Thermal ridge; Climatology; climatology; cyclone; lee cyclogenesis; synoptic meteorology; Alberta; Canada; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249034631

This variability is consistent both with the occurrence of reduced (methane-bearing) or oxidized (CO2/carbonate-bearing) fluids. Invariably, direct sampling of reduced deep fluids is not possible as they are unquenchable and re-equilibrate with either the surrounding mantle or are affected by degassing. Key information about the nature of such fluids might be found in diamond if it were possible to study a population related to a single source. Usually, diamonds within a kimberlite pipe have different parageneses and can be shown to have formed at different times and depths. We studied 59 diamonds extracted from a single diamondiferous peridotite xenolith (with a volume of only 27 cm3), from the Cullinan mine (formerly called the Premier mine) in South Africa. Diamond sizes range from 0.0005 to 0.169 carats (0.1 to 33.8 mg). A correlation between the nitrogen contents of the diamonds (range 40 to 1430 ppm) and their nitrogen aggregation state (varying from 10 to 85% of IaB defects) is compatible with a single growth event. δ13C-values range from - 4.2‰ to - 0.1‰, with slight internal variability measured in the largest diamonds. Nitrogen isotope measurements show δ15N ranging from - 1.2‰ to + 7.2‰. On the centimeter scale of this upper mantle rock, the variations for nitrogen content, nitrogen aggregation state, carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions, respectively, cover 64%, 75%, 15% and 23% of the ranges known for peridotitic diamonds. In spite of such large ranges, N-content, δ13C and δ15N within this diamond population are distinctly coupled. These relationships do not support a mixing of carbon sources, but are best explained by a Rayleigh distillation within the sub-continental mantle at depths &gt; 150 km and T &gt; 1200 °C, which precipitates diamonds from methane-bearing fluid(s). The involvement of this reduced metasomatic agent also suggests that the heterogeneous redox state of Archean cratons may mostly result from the heterogeneous nature of percolating fluids. The striking variability of the four determined parameters at cm scale may also account for the difficulty in interpreting these parameters in larger productions, such as those from a mine, because in these cases, the diamonds are mixed and sub-populations cannot be disentangled. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This study, involving five modelling teams and focused on four European cities, has been conducted within the CityDelta project (http://aqm.jrc.it/citydelta). The CityDelta models generally agree, on the O3 changes expected from scenarios representative of the current legislation on air pollution in 2010, named CLE. They also agree about less scope for further improvements from emission controls beyond CLE. For PM10, more significant differences between the models are observed, especially between models with different spatial resolutions. However, these differences are city-dependent and are larger in complex geographical areas such as Milan in the Pô Valley than in the Paris area. Fine scale models generally capture important urban scale effects, which are not represented by regional scale models. For instance, they improve the simulation of potential O3 increase caused by NOx emissions reduction in NMVOC-limited regime situations. Large scale models generally underpredict PM mean concentrations in city areas. A series of emission scenarios to address the question of the efficiency of local emission controls designed independently from regional measures is analyzed. The analysis of the CityDelta results contributes to the quantification of the impact of grid resolution in air quality modelling, and its application to emission control scenarios. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A study was conducted in montane Ecuador to test a hypothesis that bamboo results in greater soil carbon levels than pasture ecosystems. We sampled soil at three depths (0-5, 5-15, and 15-30 cm) and measured standing biomass in six pasture-bamboo paired sites at elevations from 1000 to 1500 m a.s.l. in Nanegal, northwestern Ecuador. Compared with pasture, soils under bamboo at the above three depths had greater total C and N concentrations, and lower bulk densities. Because of the difference in soil bulk density between pasture and bamboo systems, C and N stock was calculated based on 30-cm soil depth in bamboo and corrected soil depth in pasture (22.6 cm) that provided soil mass equal to that under bamboo. The soil C stock at ""equivalent 0-30"" cm depth was greater under bamboo (60.8-123 Mg ha) than that under pasture (33.4-75.3 Mg ha). The carbon stock of bamboo standing biomass (51.8-95.6 Mg ha) was remarkably greater than that of pasture standing biomass (3.53-8.14 Mg ha). Higher soil N stock and lower C/N ratio were observed under bamboo than under pasture. Our results suggest that more C would be stored in terrestrial ecosystems with the planting of bamboo to degraded (pasture) soils in the Andes. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Andes; Bamboo; Carbon sequestration; Land use change; Pasture; Soil","bamboo; bulk density; carbon sequestration; Neotropical Region; pasture; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; Ecuador; Nanegal; Pichincha; South America; Guadua angustifolia; Phyllostachys acuta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250776597

Sustainable land use under climate change requires detailed knowledge of the system dynamics. This applies particularly for the management of domestic livestock in semi-arid and arid grazing systems, where the risk of degradation is high and likely climate change may have a strong impact. A suitable way to assess potential future trends of these complex systems is through the application of simulation models. 2. We reviewed 41 models published between 1995 and 2005 simulating semi-arid and arid livestock grazing systems. The models were categorized according to the model aim and type, their temporal and spatial scale, and several indicators of model complexity. Additionally, we developed a list of model requirements for adequately simulating the effects of climate change. Based on these requirements, we evaluated the potential of current models to simulate impacts of climate change and determine important shortcomings. 3. Three general model types could be distinguished, namely state and transition, difference and differential equation, and rule-based models. Over time, we found that the number of models aiming to improve management strategies increased, while there were fewer models that aimed to understand system dynamics. This was accompanied by a trend to simplify model descriptions of hydrological relationships. 4. Important shortcomings of current models included the impact of increased CO2 levels on plant productivity and the ability to resolve changes in intra-annual precipitation patterns. The consideration of both external drivers is crucial under climate change, hence sustainable long-term decision making is currently lacking important information. 5. Synthesis and applications. Sustainable livestock management in semi-arid and arid systems requires knowledge about effects of future climate change to adjust livestock density adequately. Producers' experiences from current weather conditions are not necessarily transferable to future conditions, thus models could help to support management. However, an analysis of current models has shown that few existing models are able to assess the impacts of the predicted climate change. Therefore, we call for the development of new dynamic grazing models that provide land managers with the necessary tools to face the threat of future climate changes. © 2007 The Authors.","CO2 level increase; Domestic livestock; Herbivory; Land use; Model; Precipitation changes; Rangeland management; Simulation model","carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; ecological modeling; grazing management; herbivory; land use; livestock farming; precipitation (climatology); rangeland; semiarid region; stocking density",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947309211

This 4.6 year laboratory study tracked Cr and Mn redox transformations in soils contaminated with Cr(VI), which were then treated with different amounts of organic carbon (OC). Changes in Cr and Mn oxidation states within soils were directly and nondestructively measured using micro-X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy. Chromate reduction was roughly first-order, and the extent of reduction was enhanced with higher OC additions. However, significant Cr(III) re-oxidation occurred in soils exposed to the highest Cr(VI) concentrations (2560 mg kg-1). Transient Cr(III) re-oxidation up to 420 mg kg-1 was measured at 1.1 years after OC treatment, followed by further reduction. Chromate concentrations increased by 220 mg kg-1 at the end of the study (4.6 years) in one soil. The causal role that the Mn oxidation state had in re-oxidizing Cr was supported by trends in Mn K-edge energies. These results provide strong evidence for long-term dependence of soil Cr oxidation states on balances between OC availability and Mn redox status. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Concentration (process); Organic carbon; Oxidation; Redox reactions; Edge energies; Micro-X-ray absorption; Soil pollution; chromic acid; manganese; manganese oxide; organic carbon; Concentration (process); Organic carbon; Oxidation; Redox reactions; Soil pollution; chromate; manganese; organic carbon; redox conditions; reduction; soil pollution; soil remediation; toxicity; addition reaction; article; oxidation reduction state; pH; reduction; soil pollution; spectroscopy; X ray microanalysis; Carbon; Chromates; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Remediation; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Manganese; Oxidation-Reduction; Soil Pollutants; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250794476

Results indicate that daily flow can vary by 35%. Besides, the LMR watershed has an overabundance of phosphorus. It is likely that eutrophication will be exacerbated in future climatic conditions; hence strategies to control non-point source pollution by only reducing nitrogen may not be adequate.

In this study, we examined alterations of phosphomonoesterase activity (PA; both alkaline and acid) in a submersed marine angiosperm, Zostera marina, grown in Pi non-limiting conditions under elevated temperature and/or nitrate enrichment. Control plants (ambient water-column NO3- &lt; 2.5 μM, with weekly mean water temperatures between 26.5-27.0 °C based on a 20-yr data set in a local embayment) were compared to treated plants that were exposed to increased water-column nitrate (8 μM NO3- above ambient, pulsed daily at 0900 h), and/or increased temperature (ca. 3 °C above weekly means) over eight weeks in late summer-fall. Under both nitrate regimes, increased temperature resulted in periodic increased leaf and root-rhizome tissue carbon content, and increased acid and alkaline PA activities (AcPAs and AlPAs, respectively). There was a positive correlation between AlPA and AcPA activities and sucrose synthase activities in belowground structures, and a negative correlation between AlPA activities and sucrose concentrations. There were also periodic changes in PA partitioning between carbon source and sink tissues. In high-temperature and high-nitrate treatments, AcPAs significantly increased in leaves relative to activities in root-rhizome tissues (up to 12-fold higher in aboveground than belowground tissues in as little as 3 weeks after initiation of treatments). These responses were not observed in control plants, which maintained comparable AcPA activities in above- and belowground tissues. In addition, AlPA activity was significantly higher in leaf than in root-rhizome tissues of plants in high-temperature (weeks 3 and 6) and high temperature combined with high nitrate treatments (week 8), relative to AlPA activities in control plants. The observed changes in PAs were not related to Pi growth limitation, and may allow Z. marina to alter its carbon metabolism during periods of increased carbon demand/mobilization. This response would make it possible for Z. marina to meet short-term P requirements to maximize carbon production/allocation. Such a mechanism could help to explain the variability in PA activities that has been observed for many plant species during periods when environmental Pi exceeds requirements for optimal growth. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

One of the solutions to the reduction of the emission is to store those gases permanently in underground reservoirs. Sequestration of CO2 and/or flue gas is not cheap, however, the injection of those gases into oil or gas reservoirs to enhance production may offset some of the associated costs of doing this. The use of CO2 for purely enhanced oil recovery purpose versus injection of CO2 primarily for sequestration are technically two different problems. In conventional CO2 EOR projects, the main purpose is to increase the amount of oil produced per amount of CO2 injected. In this particular case, i. e., injection of CO2 for sequestration, the optimization problem turns out to be »produce maximum oil with the highest amount of CO2 storage«. In this paper we investigated the optimality of CO2 storage process into oil fields using field scale numerical modeling. The amount of greenhouse gas sequestered during tertiary oil recovery for a West Texas reservoir using a commercial compositional simulator (CMC-GEM) was studied. Different injection strategies such us (1) miscible flooding, (2) immiscible flooding, 3) water altering gas (WAG) flood and 4) flue gas injection were considered.

Aerosol organic composition was used to estimate sources of a series of alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) using chemical indices, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and a chemical mass balance receptor model (CMB). Aerosols were collected on quartz fiber filters (QFF) using a PM2.5 high volume sampler and on aluminum foil discs using a Micro-Orifice Uniform Deposit Impactor (MOUDI, 50% aerodynamic cut diameters were 18, 10, 5.6, 3.2, 1.8, 1.0, 0.56, 0.315 and 0.171 μm). Target compounds included alkanes and PAHs and were solvent extracted using a mixture of dichloromethane, acetone and hexane, concentrated and then analyzed using a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS). The target compounds in PM2.5 were dominated by six sources during the study period: mobile sources (39±5%), coal burning (33±5%), biogenic primary emission (20±2%), oil combustion (5±2%), biomass burning (1.0±0.3%) and an unidentified source (3±2%). Results obtained from the chemical indices, HCA and CMB were in very good agreement with each other. PAH size distributions are presented for days dominated by a same source. Seventy-five percent and 50% of the PAH were found below 1.8 and 0.56 μm, respectively (monthly PAH geometric diameters averaged 0.43 μm). Coarse size PAHs were observed on 1 day (15 May) and were correlated with nitrate and sodium size distribution. It is hypothesized that the PAHs, sodium and nitrate were internally mixed and that the PAHs deposited onto a pre-existing marine aerosol. This transfer process has significant implications for PAH deposition and lifetime and warrants further study. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Above the seafloor, the mats can form tall reef-like structures composed of porous carbonate and microbial biomass. Here, we investigated the spatial patterns of CH4 and CO2 assimilation in relation to the distribution of ANME groups and their associated bacteria in mat samples obtained from the surface of a large reef structure. A combination of different methods, including radiotracer incubation, beta microimaging, secondary ion mass spectrometry, and catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization, was applied to sections of mat obtained from the large reef structure to locate hot spots of methanotrophy and to identify the responsible microbial consortia. In addition, CO2 reduction to methane was investigated in the presence or absence of methane, sulfate, and hydrogen. The mat had an average δ13C carbon isotopic signature of -67.1‰, indicating that methane was the main carbon source. Eegions dominated by ANME-1 had isotope signatures that were significantly heavier (-66.4‰ ± 3.9 ‰ [mean ± standard deviation; n = 7]) than those of the more central regions dominated by ANME-2 (-72.9‰ ± 2.2‰ n = 7). Incorporation of 14C from radiolabeled CH4 or CO2 revealed one hot spot for methanotrophy and CO2 fixation close to the surface of the mat and a low assimilation efficiency (1 to 2% of methane oxidized). Replicate incubations of the mat with 14CH4 or 14CO2 revealed that there was interconversion of CH4 and CO2. The level of CO 2 reduction was about 10% of the level of anaerobic oxidation of methane. However, since considerable methane formation was observed only in the presence of methane and sulfate, the process appeared to be a rereaction of anaerobic oxidation of methane rather than net methanogenesis.

The diagnostic model CALMET is driven by the dynamic model MM5, which is nested into ECMWF's re-analysis ERA-40. Near surface winds are downscaled via multiple nesting from ∼120 km to 200 m grid spacing without ingestion of any further observational data for the test period between 7 September to 15 November 1999 within a mountainous study area (140 km × 70 km) located in the eastern Alps (Hohe Tauern). Two MM5 grid spacings for driving the diagnostic model were evaluated, 5 km and 10 km, respectively. Detailed error statistics based on observations from surface stations show drastic improvements of modelled air flows compared to the grossly deviating driving data (ERA-40). The overall bias relative to the station-averaged observed mean wind speed of 5.8 m/s is systematically reduced from -4.1 m/s to -0.7 m/s. In general, low wind speeds are slightly overestimated, while higher wind speeds are increasingly underestimated. A reduction of the finest horizontal grid resolution of the dynamic model from 5 km to 10 km, which would be computationally favourable, induces additional errors with respect to unresolved air flows, which the diagnostic model is unable to correct in most cases. Important wind climatologic characteristics (e.g., bimodal frequency distributions) disappear, which accentuates the importance of high-quality, high-resolution initial wind fields for diagnostic models operating in complex terrains. © Gebrüder Borntraeger, Berlin, Stuttgart 2007.",,"Computer simulation; Dynamic models; Errors; Mathematical models; Meteorology; Statistics; Wind; airflow; modeling; observational method; terrain; wind field; wind velocity; Alps; Austria; Central Europe; Eastern Alps; Eurasia; Europe; Hohe Tauern",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249803280

To date, most of the experience with such market-regulated mechanisms comes from water and forest projects in Latin America. Preliminary evidence suggests that participation of, and benefits to, small-scale land users are highly unequal and that the synergistic goals of poverty reduction and resource conservation through these emerging market mechanisms might be overly ambitious. This paper assesses the possibility of pro-poor environmental service provision through carbon sequestration among smallholders in the Sahel. It focuses on a case study in the small-scale, rain-fed agricultural systems of the Old Peanut Basin of Senegal. Based on a conceptual framework including economic, institutional, policy and livelihood factors, it assesses to the extent to which specific groups of farmers are able or willing to participate in and benefit from potential carbon offset programs. Finally, the paper stresses the need for adequate and equitable financial support and a careful rethinking of the institutional structures necessary to enhance rural livelihoods and natural resource management in drylands, with or without market-based environmental service programs. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A study with an indigenous community in eastern Panama revealed a considerable biophysical potential for carbon offsets in small-scale slash-and-burn agriculture through longer fallow periods, improved fallow management, secondary forest development, and agricultural intensification. Based on soil and biomass carbon measurements, estimated annual sequestration rates amount to 0.3-3.7 t C ha- 1 yr- 1. Despite such potential, the economic benefits of initiatives aimed at sequestration of carbon in the community are likely to be rather unequally distributed within the community. Heterogeneity in livelihood strategies and uneven asset endowments among households - factors often overlooked in the ongoing carbon and sustainable development debate - are expected to strongly affect household participation. Indeed, only the better-endowed households that have also managed to diversify into more lucrative farm and non-farm activities are likely to be able to participate in and thus benefit from improved crop-fallow systems that capture carbon.

In this paper, a simplified emission estimation model (SEEM) is evaluated. The model is based on a top-down approach and gives annual global hot emission. Particular attention is paid to the quality of the input traffic data. The quality of results is assessed by application of the SEEM model in the Chilean Gran Concepción urban area and by comparison with a bottom-up approach that has been led for the year 2000. The SEEM model estimates emissions with an accuracy of about 20 % and is related to important resource savings. The results of the SEEM model are then distributed in space with a disaggregation approach and using GIS techniques. The relevancy of the disaggregation approach is evaluated among several possibilities through statistical methods. A spatial disaggregation using principal roads density gives the best results in terms of emissions repartition and gives a globally accurate image of the distribution of hot emissions in a mid-sized city. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The necessity of finding out a balance between the costs of achieving a lower level of environmental and health injury and the benefits of providing electricity at a reasonable cost have lead to the process of estimating the external costs derived from these impacts and not included in the electricity prices as a quantitative measure of it that, even when there are large uncertainties involved, can be used by decision makers in the process of achieving a global sustainable development. The external costs of the electricity generation in three Cuban power plants that use fossil fuel oils with high sulfur content have been assessed. With that purpose a specific implementation of the Impact Pathways Methodology for atmospheric emissions was developed. Dispersion of atmospheric pollutants is modeled at local and regional scales in a detailed way. Health impacts include mortality and those morbidity effects that showed relation with the increment of selected pollutant concentration in national studies. The external cost assessed for the three plants was 40,588,309 USD yr-1 (min./max.: 10,194,833/169,013,252), representing 1.06 USD Cent kWh-1.

In Norway large carnivores are effectively removed from extensive areas to protect livestock, leaving human harvesting as the only significant top-down force on ungulate populations. We examined the relative role of top-down and bottom-up processes for 58 semi-domesticated reindeer populations in Norway subjected to contrasting climatic regimes over the period 1981-2005. Intensive herding and international agreement have resulted in a situation where some populations are unable to undertake seasonal migration to the interior to escape the unfavourable climatic conditions that rule the coastal region in the winter, a critical season for northern ungulates. We used this natural manipulation to contrast between populations with 'poor' and 'good' winter conditions. For populations with good winter conditions, average body size increased with harvesting, suggesting that some top-down process was necessary to avoid food limitation. Time-series analyses revealed that direct regulation of population size was only evident in populations subjected to intensive harvesting. The lack of direct regulation in populations subjected to low harvesting resulted in high vulnerability to harsh winter weather. The body size and climate vulnerability of populations with poor winter conditions was unaffected of harvesting, but average densities was positively related to overall vegetation productivity as indexed by satellite images (NDVI). Top-down processes appeared to be necessary to dampen the effect of harsh winters in populations with generally good winter conditions. Conversely, populations subjected to generally poor winter conditions appeared to be more influenced by bottom-up processes and buffered climatic perturbations by increasing body size. © Oikos.",,"bottom-up control; carnivore; climate conditions; deer; ecosystem management; food web; harvesting; population migration; population regulation; population size; top-down control; vulnerability; winter; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia; Rangifer tarandus; Ungulata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047128686

The three main exhaust gas pollutants are hydrocarbons (including partially oxidised organic compounds), carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. Engine modifications alone were not sufficient to control them, and catalytic systems were introduced to do this. This catalytic chemistry involves activation of small pollutant molecules that is achieved particularly effectively over platinum group metal catalysts. Catalytic emissions control was introduced first in the form of platinum-based oxidation catalysts that lowered hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. Reduction of nitrogen oxides to nitrogen was initially done over a platinum/rhodium catalyst prior to oxidation, and subsequently simultaneous conversion of all three pollutants over a single three-way catalyst to harmless products became possible when the composition of the exhaust gas could be maintained close to the stoichiometric point. Today modern cars with three-way catalysts can achieve almost complete removal of all three exhaust pollutants over the life of the vehicle. There is now a high level of interest, especially in Europe, in improved fuel-efficient vehicles with reduced carbon dioxide emissions, and ""lean-burn"" engines, particularly diesels that can provide better fuel economy. Here oxidation of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide is fairly straightforward, but direct reduction of NOx under lean conditions is practically impossible. Two very different approaches are being developed for lean-NOx control; these are NOx-trapping with periodic reductive regeneration, and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) with ammonia or hydrocarbon. Good progress has been made in developing these technologies and they are gradually being introduced into production. Because of the nature of the diesel engine combustion process they produce more particulate matter (PM) or soot than gasoline engines, and this gives rise to health concerns. The exhaust temperature of heavy-duty diesels is high enough (250-400 °C) for nitric oxide to be converted to nitrogen dioxide over an upstream platinum catalyst, and this smoothly oxidises retained soot in the filter. The exhaust temperature of passenger car diesels is too low for this to take place all the time, so trapped soot is periodically burnt in oxygen above 550 °C. Here a platinum catalyst is used to oxidise higher than normal amounts of hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide upstream of the filter to give sufficient temperature for soot combustion to take place with oxygen. Diesel PM control is discussed in terms of a range of vehicle applications, including very recent results from actual on-road measurements involving a mobile laboratory, and the technical challenges associated with developing ultra-clean diesel-powered cars are discussed. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Regional and local (downscaled) climate projections included scenarios that can potentially influence foraging conditions for reindeer. None of the projections were without precedent; several climate change events in Finnmark during the last 100 years were at least as great as those projected in the next 20-30 years. Herders' traditional responses to changes in both the natural and the socio-economic environments have depended on a flexibility in herding practice that is currently being eroded by several non-climate factors. The reduced of freedom of action resulting from loss of habitat, predation and aspects of governance (especially economic and legal constraints) potentially dwarves the putative effects of projected climate change on reindeer pastoralism. It may, however, also lead to situations in which new climatic conditions threaten the system in unprecedented ways. Developing appropriate methodologies for assessing the adaptive capacity, the vulnerability and the resilience of social-ecological systems to global changes remains a challenge. Recognition of the knowledge systems of Arctic cultures and the full engagement of local people throughout the process are key elements of the solution. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In samples from two of the plants, methane-oxidizing bacteria (type I methanotrophs) were indicated, while samples from one of the other plants showed biomarkers indicating actinomycetes.

However, the acetic acid content in municipal sewage is low, and the main organic compounds in such sewage are particulate organic matters (POM) that are converted to endogenous substrates (E(ntrapped) POM, i.e., EPOM) in AS processes. Thus, the question arises whether it is really acetate or POM, which is important for the removal of phosphate in full-scale AS plants. AS was harvested from a full-scale anaerobic/aerobic AS plant. The amount of phosphate released after the addition of acetic acid depends on the AS conditions, particularly the influent sewage quality. However, the amount of phosphate released by EPOM was not affected by the AS conditions, and the amount of phosphate released per AS concentration and per unit of time was calculated to be about 0.86 mg PO4-P/g MLSS/hour. When the AS concentration is 2.5 g/L and the mixed-liquor retention time is 2 hours in the anaerobic zone, about 4 mg/ L PO4-P is released from EPOM. Under these conditions, phosphate in such sewage is removed by full-scale AS plants without using acetic acid. In the case of carbon deficiency, the introduction of primary sludge to the anaerobic zone promoted the release of phosphate. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Eleven different impeller schemes were tested over a range of operating conditions typically associated with the ""after large cavity"" region (ALC) of a Rushton-type turbine (D/T = 0.35). It is found that the dual Rushton-type impeller scheme exhibits the highest volumetric mass transfer rates for all operating conditions; however, it also displays the lowest mass transfer performance (defined as the volumetric mass transfer coefficient per unit power input) for all conditions due to its high power consumption. Dual impeller schemes with an axial flow impeller as the top impeller show improved mass transfer rates without dramatic increases in power draw. At high gas flow rates, dual impeller schemes with a lower concave impeller have kLα values similar to those of the Rushton-type dual impeller schemes but show improved mass transfer performance. It is believed that the mass transfer performance can be further enhanced for the bottom concave impeller schemes by operating at conditions beyond the ALC region defined for Rushton-type impellers because the concave impeller can handle higher gas flow rates prior to flooding. © 2007 American Chemical Society and American Institute of Chemical Engineers.",,"Carbon monoxide; Chemical reactors; Fermentation; Flow rate; Mass transfer; Carbon monoxide-water system; Dual impeller configurations]; Stirred tank reactor (STR); Synthesis gas; carbon monoxide; water; article; bioreactor; chemistry; fermentation; metabolism; Bioreactors; Carbon Monoxide; Fermentation; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250309656

These studies explore the spatial distributions of C and groupings of C-H and C{double bond, long}O compounds at multiple soil depths, on surfaces and within multiple sized soil aggregates. Measurements were conducted on soil aggregates, sampled from three horizons in a silty loam Anthrosol under long term grassland pastures and short term conservation tillage wheat and in a silty loam Luvisol subjected to long term conventional tillage of maize. Soil aggregates were fractionated into seven size classes by dry sieving and single aggregates were mechanically separated into external, transitional and interior regions by soil aggregate erosion (SAE) chambers. Soil materials from different aggregate-size classes and aggregate layers were evaluated for total C and nitrogen (N) contents. Functional hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups in each of these soils were identified by DRIFT spectrometry. Water repellency was identified on the surfaces of different size-class aggregates and each of their interior regions by the ethanol/water sorptivity method. Total organic C contents within individual aggregates and size classes varied considerably and were influenced by soil depths and management practices. Whole microaggregates had greater C contents than macroaggregates. Total organic C content was highly correlated to hydrophobic (C-H) groups (R2 = 0.78), but not hydrophilic groups. External surfaces of aggregates from no tilled soils of wheat and grass exhibited the largest gradients of hydrophobic C-H groups when compared to their interiors. More hydrophilic C{double bond, long}O groups were observed in maize and grassland biomes where plant biomass was greater. Although highly variable, the largest gradients of C{double bond, long}O groups were measured in the Ap and Ah horizons of maize and grasslands. Water repellency indices were greater in aggregate sizes ranging from 8 to 5 mm for agricultural soil management systems and were similar for most aggregate sizes measured for grasslands. Soil aggregate water repellency appears to be controlled by the uniform distribution of these compounds at surfaces of all soil aggregate-size fractions and possibly by the concentrations of hydrophobic compounds on surfaces of aggregates at multiple soil depths. Further inquires into the mechanisms controlling soil wetting require more than a quantification of total organic C. These studies demonstrated spatial interactions between the locations and quantities of hydrophobic and hydrophobic compounds distributed among soil aggregate-size fractions located within the soil profile. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Apart from their common practical goal and the frequent need for simultaneous removal of air pollutants, these reactions share a similar redox mechanism, in which the formulation of more effective catalysts requires an enhancement of oxygen transfer. For NO reduction, supported catalysts were prepared by adding a metal (Cu, Co, K) using ion exchange (IE) and incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) to chars obtained from pyrolysis of a subbituminous coal. The effects of pyrolysis temperature, between 550 and 1000 °C, on selected catalyst characteristics (e.g., BET surface area, XRD spectrum, support reactivity in O2) are reported. For IE catalysts, the surface area increased in the presence of the metals while the opposite occurred for IWI catalysts. For the Co-IE catalysts, the highest surface area was obtained at 700 °C. The XRD results showed that, except for Cu (which exhibited sharp Cu0 peaks), the catalysts may be highly dispersed (or amorphous) on the carbon surface. For the C-O2 reaction the order of (re)activity was K ≫ Co &gt; Cu for IE catalysts and K &gt; Cu &gt; Co for IWI catalysts. For NO reduction the orders were K &gt; Co &gt; Cu (IE catalysts) and Cu &gt; Co &gt; K (IWI catalysts). In all cases the catalytic (re)activity for NO reduction was lower than that exhibited for the C-O2 reaction. The K-IE and Cu-IWI catalysts appeared to be the most promising ones, although further improvements in catalytic activity will be desirable. Some surprising results regarding CO and CO2 selectivity are also reported, especially for Co catalysts. In VOC combustion, the effect of the nature of ion B (Fe and Ni) on the partial substitution of ion A (Ca for La) in ABO3 perovskites (e.g., LaFeO3 and LaNiO3) and on their catalytic activity was studied. The perovskite-type oxides were characterized by means of surface area measurements, XRD, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). The effect of partial substitution of La3+ by Ca2+ was more significant for the La1-xCaxFeO3 perovskites. In this case, the electronic perturbation is compensated by an oxidation state increase of part of Fe3+ to Fe4+. The TPD results revealed that, at higher substitution levels, oxygen vacancies are also formed to preserve electroneutrality. For the La1-xCaxNiO3 perovskites, the characterization results showed no evidence of large differences in electronic properties as calcium substitution increases. The La1-xCaxNiO3 perovskites exhibited lower activity than the simple LaNiO3 perovskite, whereas for the La1-xCaxFeO3 substituted perovskites the most active catalyst (exhibiting the lowest ignition temperature) was obtained at the highest substitution level, La0.6Ca0.4FeO3. The performance of both groups of catalysts is briefly discussed in terms of redox processes, in which the interplay between oxygen transfer and electron transfer requires further elucidation for the improvement of catalytic activity. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

A set of indicators for sustainable forest management (SFM) is arranged according to the DPSIR framework in order to cover the causal chain of environmental and socio-economic drivers and pressures, to detect changes in the state of the system and to identify impacts on ecosystems and society. Responses may alter the pressure, but may also influence the socio-economic drivers. The approach allows enhancement of the systems-analysis view of the DPSIR framework by combining a set of criteria and indicators, multi-criteria decision-making techniques and a modelling approach. To account for the interconnectedness of indicators, the analytic network process is used to evaluate four forest management plans by modelling priorities of indicators and strategies resulting from their relationships within the network.

Many additional measures have thus been proposed to 'level the playing field' and to protect the competitiveness of European energy-intensive industries within the larger effort of reducing Europe's greenhouse gas emissions and of meeting its obligations under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. This article evaluates a range of proposed measures based on a set of political and legal criteria, including environmental effectiveness; the need to consider differentiated commitments, responsibilities and capabilities; conformity with world trade law and European Union law; and Europe's overall political interests. We discuss measures that could be adopted by the European Union and its member states, such as direct support for energy-intensive industries, restrictions of energy-intensive imports into the European Union through border cost adjustments, quotas or technical regulations, and cost reimbursement for affected developing countries. We also analyse measures available to multilateral institutions such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol and the World Trade Organisation.

In a case study for 15 and 16 July 1996, when Lloyd et al. (2001) conducted a convective boundary layer budget experiment in the area, we show that advection of these gradients disturbs the relation between diurnal concentration changes in the boundary layer and the surface fluxes. This demonstrates that mesoscale atmospheric heterogeneity may have severe impact on the applicability of methods to derive the regional-scale fluxes from CO2 concentrations measurements, such as the convective boundary layer budget method or inverse modeling. It is shown that similar mesoscale gradients are likely to occur at many long-term observation stations and tall towers. We use the modeled concentration fields to quantify the horizontal and vertical variability of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In future observation campaigns, mesoscale processes may be best accounted for by measuring horizontal variability over a few hundred kilometers and by attempting to quantify the representation errors as a function of mesoscale conditions.

Land-use changes and conservation measures in temperate regions have led to a dramatic expansion of arctic-breeding geese, making them important herbivores of high-latitude systems. In field experiments conducted in high-Arctic Spitsbergen, Svalbard, we demonstrate that a brief period of early season belowground foraging by pink-footed geese is sufficient to strongly reduce C sink strength and soil C stocks of arctic tundra. Mechanisms are suggested whereby vegetation disruption due to repeated use of grubbed areas opens the soil organic layer to erosion and will thus lead to progressive C loss.

Prevalence varies widely from 3% in certain areas of Great Britain to 60% in certain parts of Australia. Objectives: To describe the influence of environmental factors on the prevalence of IBH in Shetland ponies and Friesian horses in the Netherlands. Methods: Data on 3284 Shetland and 2824 Friesian mares (n = 6108) were collected in the Netherlands, based on 90 regions, according to postal codes. The climate components, amount of rainfall, number of warm days, number of cold days, and habitat components of soil type and type of vegetation were collected for each region. Results: Prevalence of IBH varied widely from 0-71.4% per region. The results showed that the environment with low IBH-prevalence had high rainfall, many cold days and few warm days per year. Habitats with a low IBH-prevalence were based along the coast line. Habitats with increasing prevalence of IBH had soils of clay with heather and woody vegetation. Friesian mares had a higher IBH prevalence than Shetland mares, which could indicate an effect of genetic background or an effect of year. Conclusions: There is an environmental effect on IBH prevalence within the Netherlands, which is caused by climate and habitat factors. Potential relevance: The results provide a more accurate description of environmental factors and their impact on development of IBH; and should help better to understand habitat and climate effects, and to distinguish these from other effects, such as animal factors (genetics, age or sex).","Climate; Culicoides; Habitat; Horse; Insect bite hypersensitivity","rain; animal; animal disease; article; Ceratopogonidae; cold; female; horse; horse disease; hypersensitivity; immunology; insect bite; Netherlands; prevalence; season; skin disease; Animals; Ceratopogonidae; Cold; Female; Horse Diseases; Horses; Hypersensitivity; Insect Bites and Stings; Netherlands; Prevalence; Rain; Seasons; Skin Diseases; Animalia; Calluna; Equidae; Equus caballus; Friesia; Insecta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845987391

Modelled ozone concentrations for the year 2001 are evaluated. The models reproduce the main features of the ozone diurnal cycle, but generally overestimate daytime ozone. LOTOS-EUROS and RCG have a more pronounced diurnal cycle variation than observations, while the reverse occurs for TM5. CHIMERE has a large positive bias, which can be explained by a systematic bias in boundary conditions. The other models and the ""ensemble model"", whose concentrations are by definition averaged over all models, represent accurately the diurnal cycle. The ability of the models to simulate day-to-day daily ozone average or maxima variability is examined by means of percentiles, root mean square errors and correlations. In general, daily maxima are better simulated than daily averages, and summertime concentrations are better simulated than wintertime concentrations. Summertime correlations range between 0.5 and 0.7 for daily averages and 0.6 and 0.8 for daily maxima. Two health-related indicators are used, the number of days of exceedance of the 120 μ g m- 3 threshold for the daily maximal 8-h ozone concentration and the SOMO35. Both are well reproduced in terms of frequency, but the simultaneity of occurrence of exceedance days between observations and simulations is not well captured. The advantage of using an ensemble of models instead of a single model for the assessment of air quality is demonstrated. The ensemble average concentrations almost always exhibit a closer proximity to observations than any of the models. We also show that the spread of the model ensemble is fairly representative of the uncertainty in the simulations. © 2006.","Air quality; EuroDelta; Model intercomparison; Modelling; Ozone","Boundary conditions; Computer simulation; Correlation methods; Environmental engineering; Mathematical models; Ozone; EuroDelta; Model intercomparison; Ozone concentration; Air quality; ozone; accuracy assessment; air quality; comparative study; diurnal variation; emission; ozone; pollution monitoring; simulation; air quality; article; circadian rhythm; correlation analysis; exhaust gas; intermethod comparison; mathematical analysis; priority journal; simulation; summer; winter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846900688

Carbon monoxide (CO) poisonings during this period were investigated to identify ways to prevent future poisoning. Methods: Medical records from ten hospitals (two with hyperbaric oxygen chambers) were reviewed to identify individuals diagnosed with unintentional CO poisoning between August 13 and October 15, 2004. Multiple attempts were made to interview one person from each nonfatal incident. Medical examiner records and reports of investigations conducted by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission of six fatal poisonings from five additional incidents were also reviewed. Results: A total of 167 people treated for nonfatal CO poisoning were identified, representing 51 incidents. A portable, gasoline-powered generator was implicated in nearly all nonfatal incidents and in all fatal poisonings. Generators were most often located outdoors, followed by inside the garage, and inside the home. Telephone interviews with representatives of 35 (69%) incidents revealed that concerns about theft or exhaust most often influenced the choice of location. Twenty-six (74%) households did not own a generator before the hurricanes, and 86% did not have a CO detector at the time of the poisoning. Twenty-one (67%) households reported reading or hearing CO education messages before the incident. Conclusions: Although exposure to public education messages may have encouraged more appropriate use of generators, a substantial number of people were poisoned even when the devices were operated outdoors. Additional educational efforts and engineering solutions that reduce CO emission from generators should be the focus of public health activities. © 2007 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.",,"adolescent; adult; aged; analytic method; article; carbon monoxide intoxication; child; controlled study; exhaust gas; female; generator; health education; human; hurricane; hyperbaric oxygen; infant; interview; major clinical study; male; medical record review; public health; telephone; United States; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Carbon Monoxide Poisoning; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Florida; Humans; Infant; Interviews; Male; Medical Audit; Middle Aged; Natural Disasters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947303203

The analysis takes into account a large number of reduction options, such as reductions of non-CO2 gases, carbon plantations and measures in the energy system. The study shows stabilization as low as 450 ppm CO 2-eq. to be technically feasible, even given relatively high baseline scenarios. To achieve these lower concentration levels, global emissions need to peak within the first two decades. The net present value of abatement costs for the B2 baseline scenario (a medium scenario) increases from 0.2% of cumulative GDP to 1.1% as the shift is made from 650 to 450 ppm. On the other hand, the probability of meeting a two-degree target increases from 0%-10% to 20%-70%. The mitigation scenarios lead to lower emissions of regional air pollutants but also to increased land use. The uncertainty in the cost estimates is at least in the order of 50%, with the most important uncertainties including land-use emissions, the potential for bio-energy and the contribution of energy efficiency. Furthermore, creating the right socio-economic and political conditions for mitigation is more important than any of the technical constraints. © 2007 Springer Science + Business Media B.V.",,"Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Climatology; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Particulate emissions; Bioenergy; Carbon plantations; Energy systems; Land-use emissions; Greenhouse effect; abatement cost; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); emission control; global warming; greenhouse gas; land use change; mitigation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847394962

Within this framework, the Flemish government aims at reaching a share of 6% of renewable electricity in the total electricity production by 2010. In this work, the biomass production of birch, maple, poplar and willow in a short-rotation forestry (SRF) plantation after a 4-year growth period served as the base to calculate the amount of (electrical) energy that could be produced by this type of bioenergy crop in Flanders. The maximum amount of electricity that could be provided by SRF biomass was estimated at 72.9 GWhe year-1, which only accounts for 0.16% of the total electricity production in this region. Although the energy output was rather low, the bioenergy production process under consideration appeared to be more energy efficient than energy production processes based on fossil fuels. The high efficiency of birch compared to the other species was mainly due to the high calorific value of the birch wood. The maximum CO2 emission reduction potential of SRF plantations in Flanders was estimated at only 0.09% of the total annual CO2 emission. The most interesting application of SRF in Flanders seemed to be the establishment of small-scale plantations, linked to a local combined heat and power plant. These plantations could be established on marginal arable soils or on polluted sites, and they could be of importance in the densely populated area of Flanders because of other environmental benefits, among which their function as (temporary) habitat for many species. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Variability in timing and strength of winter storms among years led to different timing, intensity, and extent of plumes among years. TSM concentrations in the core of plumes varied between 15 and 30 mg L-1, and photic depth was reduced to ∼1 to 2 m, thus potentially seriously limiting phytoplankton growth in plume areas. Total P concentration was highly correlated with TSM and river influence. Chlorophyll concentrations were lower in plume regions than in adjacent areas, in contrast to the relatively constant chlorophyll concentration across the plume predicted by a coupled hydrodynamic and nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton model. Contrary to expectation, protozoan microzooplankton (MZ) biomass was not more abundant in the plume than adjacent waters, but was highest in nearshore areas receiving river inflow. Storms affected horizontal distribution of zooplankton. Because of the lower concentrations of phytoplankton in the plume, the plume over the short term had a negative impact on zooplankton during this food-limiting season. Our results combined with those of other EEGLE studies lead us to conclude that storms and storm-driven plumes had a negative effect on the planktonic food web.

CityDelta: a model intercomparison study to explore the impact of emission reductions in European cities in 2010. Atmospheric Environment] is designed to evaluate the air quality response of several emission abatement scenarios for 2010 at the scale of the European continent, and specifically in the areas where most people live: the cities. Before evaluating this response, the model simulations in a control case must be evaluated against observations in order to understand their main strengths and weaknesses. In this article six different models are used to simulate a full year (1999) of air quality pollutant concentrations over domains encompassing a large area around four major European cities: Berlin, Milan, Paris and Prague. Three models are used both at large-scale (typically 50 km) and small-scale resolution (5 km). The intercomparison of the simulation results for ozone and particles smaller than 10 microns (PM10) leads to the following conclusions:(i)Models capture fairly well the mean, daily maxima and variability of ozone concentrations, as well as the time and intercity variability. However, a significant overestimation of ozone in city centres is found especially for large-scale models.(ii)PM10 simulation skill is generally poor, and large-scale models underestimate their mass. The difference between Milan (highly polluted) and the other cities is not reproduced. All models have difficulties in capturing the observed seasonal variations.(iii)The fine scale models show higher PM10 and lower ozone concentrations in urban areas, which are closer to the observations than are the large-scale models. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The results based on a case study - nitrate removal at a treated water production rate of 30 L m-2 h-1 - showed that in both bioreactors the desired water quality in terms of nitrate and nitrite can be achieved. The pressure-driven membrane bioreactor allows for possibly higher water production rates and uses relatively cheaper membranes, however, the water quality control in terms of TOC requires on-line monitoring and a strict regulation of the carbon source addition. This configuration also requires an initial start-up period before achieving a steady state operation because the water and microbial culture are in direct contact. The ion exchange membrane bioreactor offers the advantage of selectively removing the target anion and producing TOC-free water with practically no initial start-up period. Due to the physical separation of the microbial culture from the water stream, the very low diffusion coefficient of ethanol through the Neosepta ACS membrane used, and the membrane-attached biofilm acting as an additional reactive barrier to ethanol penetration, secondary pollution of the treated water was avoided. The development of cheaper anion exchange membrane (possibly in a hollow fibre form) would make the IEMB process economically competitive.",,"Biofilms; Bioreactors; Ethanol; Ion exchange membranes; Nitrates; Potable water; Removal; Water quality; Water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846294736

'Phytocapping' has been considered as an effective, economical and environment-friendly technique for landfill remediation. In this technique, trees are established on a layer of soil cap placed over the refuse. Soil cover acts as a 'storage' and trees act as 'bio-pump and filters'. For effective functioning of this technique, it is critical that an 'optimum' depth of soil is placed over the refuse, and 'suitable' plant species are used as plant cover. Preliminary results of a phytocapping trial (using 21 tree species and two depths of soil layers) show that the established trees can remove more water than that received via rainfall and rainfall interception can reduce up to 20% of the rain reaching the soil in a 1.5 year old plantation. The study is also trialling an US numeric model 'STOMP' (Subsurface Transport over Multiple Phases), to calculate daily water balance, to identify suitable plant species and to optimise thickness of the soil cover to be used in phytocapping. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Leachate; Leaf area index; Methane; Native specie; Phytocapping; Rainfall interception; Sap flow; Soil moisture","landfill; leachate; methane; numerical model; percolation; phytoremediation; pollution control; refuse; soil depth; soil moisture; water budget; interception; leaf area index; native species; sap flow; soil cover; vegetation cover",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250751799

The growth of food demand in Africa and South America will cause substantial increase in GHG emissions by the agri-food sector, unless improved management systems are adopted. The higher food consumption rate (kJ person-1 day-1) around the world is primarily a result of improved crop production and higher percentage of animal products in diet. The latter will, however, result in more CH4 emissions. The growing use of N fertilizers is also a concern. The part not taken up by crops (more than 50%) is either lost through leaching or released to the atmosphere as N gases including nitrous oxide. Between 2000 and 2030, the total GHG emissions are expected to increase by about 50%, with further impact on weather and climate. Mitigation techniques such as improved feed quality for a better digestibility, improved manure management, greater N use efficiency, better water management of rice paddies and/or by increasing the role of agro-forestry in agriculture, have to be considered in order to minimize the impact of agriculture on climate. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

On the basis of Benthic Foraminiferal Oxygen Index (BFOI), the studied sediments were deposited under a range of anoxic to oxic bottom water conditions. The amount of Corg mineralised during early burial was calculated in two steps. First, carbon mineralised by sulphate reduction was calculated from the amount of sedimentary sulphur, corrected for escaped/oxidised H2S by taking into account the isotopic composition of sulphur. Then, on analogy of recent sediments which are deposited with a similar rate of sedimentation and beneath bottom waters of similar O2 content, carbon loss by aerobic respiration was estimated. A good stratigraphic control and knowledge of variation of mineralogical composition along the section permitted to estimate past variation of local organic carbon flux (Cflux) from calculated original Corg contents. During deposition of the studied strata, Cflux first decreased from 1.16 to 0.41 g Corg/m2/y, then it progressively increased to 1.81 g Corg/m2/y. Changes in local Cflux are explained by changes in water depth, flux of terrestrial organic components and availability of nutrients liberated by alteration of products of the coeval pyroclastic activity. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The chemical composition of the PM10 aerosol was markedly different in the two regions, even at similar PM10 levels. The chemical composition of PM2.5 showed more similarities. The contribution of mineral matter was higher in Barcelona (on average 12% of the PM2.5 mass), whereas the contribution from sea salt was higher in Ghent (4% of PM2.5). Volatilisation of NH4+ from the filters (negative artefact) was observed in both regions, although the extent of this artefact showed regional differences (0-4% and 22-38% of the NH4+ mass in Ghent and Barcelona, respectively) and had no impact on the compliance with EU limit values. The number of exceedances of the PM10 limit value and an arbitrary PM2.5 limit of 25 μg m-3 was calculated by subtracting the mineral fraction (natural or anthropogenic in origin) from the bulk PM load, and this resulted in the elimination of the PM10 exceedances in Barcelona, and a reduction of one out of three exceedances in Ghent. The subtraction of sea-salt aerosol had no effect in Barcelona, and it removed one exceedance in each size fraction in Ghent. Exceedances of the PM10 daily limit value in Ghent coincided with back-trajectories originating from Eastern and Southern European regions. The origin of the exceedances in Barcelona during the campaigns was mostly local. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The final objective is the inclusion of this model as a component in an Earth System model for climate studies. The pelagic model is based on a functional stoichiometric representation of marine biogeochemical cycles and allows simulating the dynamics of C, N, P, Si, O and Fe taking into account the variation of their elemental ratios in the functional groups. The model also includes a parameterization of variable chlorophyll/carbon ratio in phytoplankton, carrying chl as a prognostic variable. The first part of the paper analyzes the contribution of non-local advective-diffusive terms and local vertical processes to the simulated chl distributions. The comparison of the three experiments shows that the mean chl distribution at higher latitudes is largely determined by mixing processes, while vertical advection controls the distribution in the equatorial upwelling regions. Horizontal advective and diffusive processes are necessary mechanisms for the shape of chl distribution in the sub-tropical Pacific. In the second part, the results have been compared with existing datasets of satellite-derived chlorophyll, surface nutrients, estimates of phytoplankton community composition and primary production data. The agreement is reasonable both in terms of the spatial distribution of annual means and of the seasonal variability in different dynamical oceanographic regions. Results indicate that some of the model biases in chl and surface nutrients distributions can be related to deficiencies in the simulation of physical processes such as advection and mixing. Other discrepancies are attributed to inadequate parameterizations of phytoplankton functional groups. The model has skill in reproducing the overall distribution of large and small phytoplankton but tends to underestimate diatoms in the northern higher latitudes and overestimate nanophytoplankton with respect to picoautotrophs in oligotrophic regions. The performance of the model is discussed in the context of its use in climate studies and an approach for improving the parameterization of functional groups in deterministic models is outlined. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

While the Kyoto Protocol has several achievements to its credit – in particular, it has played a role in sustaining political attention on the need for policies to control emissions of the gases that cause global warming – in many respects the Protocol is in deep trouble. In Australia, Canada, and the United States – three countries where the Kyoto commitments would have been most demanding – governments have largely abandoned the treaty. In Japan and Europe governments are implementing some limits on emissions, but much effort is now focused on a shell game of accounting that will probably yield formal legal compliance with the treaty's strictures through the trading of credits that do not reflect actual reductions in emissions. The Russian government nearly abandoned the treaty for fear that it would actually require changes in behavior. The integrated international market for emissions envisioned under the Protocol has not yet materialized; instead, at least six different carbon markets have emerged – each with their own rules and prices. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), a scheme intended to engage developing countries by subsidizing projects that would allow them to build less-carbon-intensive energy systems, is tied in red tape that will be familiar to any student of the US Environmental Protection Agency's limited emission trading programs – notably the offsets program – of the 1970s (Hahn and Hester 1989). © Cambridge University Press 2007.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924163406

In spring 2005 the blazar 3C 454.3 was observed in an unprecedented bright state from the near-IR to the hard X-ray frequencies. A mm outburst peaked in June-July 2005, and it was followed by a flux increase at high radio frequencies. Aims. In this paper we report on multifrequency monitoring by the WEBT aimed at following the further evolution of the outburst in detail. In particular, we investigate the expected correlation and time delays between the optical and radio emissions in order to derive information on the variability mechanisms and jet structure. Methods. A comparison among the light curves at different frequencies is performed by means of visual inspection and discrete correlation function, and the results are interpreted with a simple model taking into account Doppler factor variations of geometric origin. Results. The high-frequency radio light curves show a huge outburst starting during the dimming phase of the optical one and lasting more than 1 year. The first phase is characterized by a slow flux increase, while in early 2006 a major flare is observed. The lower-frequency radio light curves show a progressively delayed and fainter event, which disappears below 8 GHz. We suggest that the radio major peak is not physically connected with the spring 2005 optical one, but it is actually correlated with a minor optical flare observed in October-November 2005. This interpretation involves both an intrinsic and a geometric mechanism. The former is represented by disturbances travelling down the emitting jet, the latter being due to the curved-jet motion, with the consequent differential changes of viewing angles of the different emitting regions. © ESO 2007.","Galaxies: active; Galaxies: jets; Galaxies: quasars: general; Galaxies: quasars: individual: 3C 454.3","Astrophysics; Function evaluation; Jets; Mathematical models; X ray analysis; Curved jet motion; Radio light curves; Visual inspection; Space research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947216085

Here we use a novel isotope-based technique to investigate the relative importance of three mechanisms for explaining landscape-scale variations in soil methane emissions: (1) consumption of methane by methanotrophic bacteria, (2) quantity of carbon mineralization, or (3) relative amounts of carbon flow through nonmethanogenic versus methanogenic mineralization pathways. Application of a new, nondisruptive, 13CH4 isotope pool dilution technique permitted us to evaluate these mechanisms by distinguishing gross methane fluxes through both productive and consumptive pathways. We quantified each of these pathways in surface soils across broad moisture gradients in tropical montane environments in the Hawaiian Islands and temperate ecosystems in the northeastern United States. We found only limited support for the consumption control hypothesis because consumption was only important in dry soils. We also failed to find support for the carbon supply hypothesis, in that rates of carbon mineralization did not explain the observed variability in net fluxes across landscapes. Rather, dramatic differences in methane production, and thus emission, depended on surprisingly small diversions of soil carbon flow from nonmethanogenic to methanogenic pathways: on average, soils were a net source of methane to the atmosphere if more than 0.04% of total carbon mineralization passed through methanogenic pathways. We infer that fine-scale heterogeneity of soil redox status is critical for regulating soil methane fluxes.

Using the innovation journey concept to track the process in which 'emissions trading' emerges as a novel configuration in environmental governance shows how the policy instrument develops dynamics of its own, partly independently of policy problems and goals. These dynamics cut across governance domains, from air pollution policy in the USA to climate policy in the European Union. Interactions across science, policy development and the governance domains in which the instrument is applied prove to be critical for the transition between phases: from options to first developments; to experiments with a prototype; further diffusion; and, finally, the formation of a transnational policy regime. Key factors are openings in existing governance structures, establishment of linkages with contexts of implementation and the generation of momentum through the 'carbon industry' as an emerging service economy. © Beech Tree Publishing 2007.",,"emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental policy; innovation; policy development; trade-environment relations; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548674213

The thermodynamics of such a mesoporous reservoir with a pore diameter fixed at 2 mm are equivalent to the previously proposed surface ocean. This work shows that if such a porous hydrocarbon/nitrogen reservoir contains a significant volume within pores of nanometer dimension, then the modification of methane thermodynamics through the Kelvin effect significantly changes the reservoir-atmosphere interaction on Titan. We measure the capillary uptake of pure methane liquid into well-characterized ice grown at temperatures and partial pressures simulating Titan at present. From these results, a model of a nanoporous reservoir housing the methane/ ethane/nitrogen solution is constructed. Modifying a previously published analytical climate model for Titan to incorporate such a reservoir, we report calculations of the coupled reservoir-atmosphere system. This modification leads to a very sensitive dependence of the state of the atmosphere on the total reservoir volume. In particular, assuming a nanoporous volume distribution reported here, calculations show that such a reservoir must comprise at least 1.5% of a 10 km deep ice regolith in order to yield a climate consistent with that currently observed on Titan. In contrast to the mesoporous model, it reduces the sensitivity of the system to temperature, mitigating the runaway greenhouse effect observed in the previous model. Furthermore, the model indicates that in a past epoch a surface ocean subsided into the reservoir as the total surface liquid volume reduced with time.

In order to improve our understanding of the present and future carbon dynamics in high latitudes, we studied the methane concentration, the quantity and quality of organic matter, and the activity and biomass of the methanogenic community in permafrost deposits. For these investigations a permafrost core of Holocene age was drilled in the Lena Delta (72°22′N, 126°28′E). The organic carbon of the permafrost sediments varied between 0.6% and 4.9%; and was characterized by an increasing humification index with permafrost depth. A high CH4 concentration was found in the upper 4 m of the deposits, which correlates well with the methanogenic activity and archaeal biomass (expressed as PLEL concentration). Even the incubation of core material at -3 and -6°C with and without substrates showed a significant CH4 production (range: 0.04-0.78nmol CH4h-1g-1). The results indicated that the methane in Holocene permafrost deposits of the Lena Delta originated from modern methanogenesis by cold-adapted methanogenic archaea.

The pollutant levels of the two temples during peak period were shown to be significantly higher than those during non-peak period. The highest average CO level was obtained at Temple 1 during peak period, which exceeded IAQO 8-h Good Class criteria. In general, the average PM2.5/PM10 ratios were approximately 82%. The results revealed that the fine particulates (PM2.5) constituted the majority of suspended particulates at both temples. It was noted that formaldehyde was the most abundant carbonyl compounds, followed by acetaldehyde.

Disruption of the sNHE gene in mice resulted in absolute male infertility associated with a complete loss of sperm motility. Here, we show that the sNHE-null spermatozoa fail to develop the cAMP-dependent protein tyrosine phosphorylation that coincides with the functional maturation occurring upon incubation in capacitating conditions in vitro. Both the sperm motility defect and the lack of induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation are rescued by the addition of cell-permeable cAMP analogs, suggesting that cAMP metabolism is impaired in spermatozoa lacking sNHE. Our analyses of the bicarbonate-dependent soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) signaling pathway in sNHE-null sperm cells reveal that sNHE is required for the expression of full-length sAC, and that it is important for the bicarbonate stimulation of sAC activity in spermatozoa. Furthermore, both codependent expression and coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that sNHE and sAC associate with each other. Thus, these two proteins appear to be components of a signaling complex at the sperm flagellar plasma membrane. We propose that the formation of this complex efficiently modulates intracellular pH and bicarbonate levels through the rapid and effective control of sAC and sNHE activities to facilitate sperm motility regulation. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","cAMP; Sperm motility","adenylate cyclase; bicarbonate; cyclic AMP; sodium proton exchange protein; adenylate cyclase; cell extract; cyclic AMP; phosphotyrosine; sodium proton exchange protein; animal cell; article; cell membrane; cell pH; controlled study; enzyme activity; flagellum; gene disruption; human; human cell; immunoprecipitation; male infertility; mouse; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; protein phosphorylation; regulatory mechanism; signal transduction; spermatozoon capacitation; spermatozoon motility; animal; cell line; cytology; enzyme activation; gene expression regulation; genetics; male; metabolism; protein binding; sensitivity and specificity; spermatozoon; Mus; Adenylate Cyclase; Animals; Bicarbonates; Cell Extracts; Cell Line; Cyclic AMP; Enzyme Activation; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Male; Mice; Phosphotyrosine; Protein Binding; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sodium-Hydrogen Antiporter; Sperm Motility; Spermatozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547231222

These findings indicate that a diverse and stable C3 flora with a limited number of C4 grass species prevailed during this interval, and suggest that the maximum growing-season temperatures were relatively stable, but minimum growing-season temperatures varied considerably. Two general patterns characterize the relationships between the δ13C and δ18O values obtained from the 1-cm samples. In some cases, low δ13C values correspond to low δ18O values and high δ13C values correspond to high δ18O values, suggesting that cooler growing-season temperatures favored C3 and warmer growing-season temperatures favored C4 plants. In other cases, low δ13C values correspond to high δ18O values, likely suggesting that wetter growing-season conditions were favorable to C3 plants. The high density of well-preserved CRs in this paleosol provides a unique opportunity to study detailed ecological responses to high-resolution variability in growing-season climate. © 2006 University of Washington.","C3 and C4 plants; Carbonate rhizoliths; Southern Illinois; Stable isotope ratios; Wisconsin interstadial 2","carbonate; climate change; decadal variation; growing season; isotopic analysis; paleoclimate; plant; Pleistocene; rhizolith; stable isotope; Illinois; North America; United States; Wisconsin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846279831

C-type xenoliths have high Mg in olivine (Fo = 90-91) and a range in Cr# [Cr/ (Cr + Al) = 0.17-0.34] in spinel. Two C-type samples contain websterite veinlets and solidified patches of melt that is now composed of minute quenched grains of plagioclase + Cr-spinel + clinopyroxene + olivine. These patches of quenched melts are formed by decompression melting of pargasitic amphibole. High Ti contents and common occurrence of relic Cr-spinel in the quenched melts indicate that the amphibole is formed from spinel by interaction with the Ti-rich parental magma of the websterite veinlets. Thef O2 values of these two C-type xenoliths range from ΔFMQ -0.2 to -0.4, which is consistent with their metasomatism by an asthenospheric mantle-derived melt. The rest of the C-type samples are free of ""melt,"" but show cryptic metasomatism by slab-derived aqueous fluids, which produced high concentrations of fluid-mobile elements in clinopyroxenes, and higher fO2 ranging from ΔFMQ +0.1 to +0.3. F-type lherzolites are intensely metasomatized to form spinel with low Cr# (∼0.13) and silicate minerals with low MgO, olivine (Fo = ∼84), orthpyroxene [Mg# = Mg/(Mg + ΣFe) = ∼0.86] and clinopyroxene (Mg# = ∼0.88). Patches of ""melt"" are common in all F-type samples and their compositions are similar to pargasitic amphibole with low TiO2 (&lt;0.56 wt%), Cr2O3 (&lt;0.55 wt%) and MgO (&lt;16.3 wt%). Low Mg# values of silicate minerals, including the amphibole, suggest that the metasomatic agent is most likely a slab melt. This is supported by high ratios of Sr/Y and light rare earth elements (REE)/heavy REE in clinopyroxenes. F-type xenoliths show relatively low fO2 (ΔFMQ -0.9 to -1.1) compared to C-type xenoliths and this is explained by the fusion of organic-rich sediments overlying the slab during the slab melt. Trench-fill sediments in the area are high in organic matter. The fusion of such wet sediments likely produced CH4-rich fluids and reduced melts that mixed with the slab melt. High U and Th in bulk rocks and clinopyroxene in F-type xenoliths support the proposed interpretation. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Adakites; Mantle oxidation state; Mantle wedges; Subduction zone","adakite; amphibole; basalt; harzburgite; lherzolite; mantle; melting; metasomatism; oxidation; peridotite; Quaternary; silicate mineral; spinel; subduction zone; xenolith; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947719628

This paper reviews recent developments in biomass fuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, in China. Ethanol-gasoline mixture (E10) for vehicles is currently distributed in nine provinces while biodiesel is under development. One way to extend the application of ethanol is to burn it in diesel engines to lower soot emissions. The effects of the different methods blending ethanol with fossil diesel, and blending biodiesel with fossil diesel and ethanol-diesel on the combustion and emissions are investigated. The test results show that ethanol and biodiesel can be mixed with fossil diesel to greatly reduce particulate matter and soot emissions from diesel engines. But the application of ethanol blending with fossil diesel is more difficult than that of ethanol blending with gasoline, and biodiesel blending with fossil diesel. The dual-fuel injection of ethanol and diesel systems has the highest smoke reduction effect for a high ethanol fraction. © 2007 Tsinghua University Press.","biodiesel; biomass fuel; blending; diesel; emissions; ethanol","Biomass fuels; Soot emissions; Biodiesel; Biomass; Blending; Diesel engines; Emission control; Ethanol; Greenhouse gases; Motor transportation; Soot; Alternative fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447523951

In this study, we chose a front that passed the WLEF tower site on 16 August 2001, which had the most significant CO2 concentration variation in our case pool. The CO2 concentration, or [CO2], at the WLEF site had a strong dip and an increasing trend before the front arrived and a decreasing trend afterward. The concentration at 396 in above the ground varied by more than 40 ppm within 36 hours. We investigated the CO2 variations associated with this frontal case using a fully coupled model of land surface physics and carbon exchange (SiB 2.5) and the atmosphere (RAMS 5.04), in which CO2 was treated as a free variable and used to determine photosynthesis rate. Our simulation showed that high-[CO2] air mass was built up in the southern Great Plains on 14 and.15 August 2001 because of the slow photosynthesis rate caused by hot and dry air over Oklahoma and Texas and the relatively strong nighttime respiration in the southeast United States. The low-[CO2] air to the southwest of Wisconsin and the high-[CO2] air over Kansas and Oklahoma traveled north and was responsible for part of the [CO2] variations at the WLEF site from 15 to 16 August 2001. Surface weather station confirmed the hot and dry weather in Oklahoma and Texas in this event, and the tower observations corroborated the existence of southwest-northeast concentration gradient. Weak daytime photosynthesis on 15 August 2001 and stronger nighttime respiration on 16 August 2001 under overcast sky condition were also partially responsible for the quick C02 accumulation at the lower levels at the WLEF site before the front's arrival. This case study confirmed the existence of mixing signals from at least two different scales: large-scale horizontal advection and local ecosystem response to the changing weather. SiB-RAMS showed its strength in simulating the coherent anomalies in biospheric CO2 flux and in the regional weather pattern. Further refinement of the model is needed to better capture the timing and location of synoptic events and CO2 signals that travel across North America. Exploitation of continuous tower data in data assimilation and inverse modeling to determine regional sources and sinks will require careful error attribution to either transport or surface flux estimates.

Analysis of the potential for sector-based emissions reduction and relevant mitigation options will provide the necessary background information for the debate. In order to assess the CO2 abatement potential of China's steel industry, a model was developed using LEAP software to generate 3 different CO2 emission scenarios for the industry from 2000 to 2030. The abatement potentials of different scenarios were compared, and their respective feasibilities were assessed according to the cost information. High priority abatement measures were then identified. The results show that the average CO2 abatement per year in the Recent Policy scenario and in the New Policy scenario, compared with the reference scenario, are 51 and 107 million tons, respectively. The corresponding total incremental costs are 9.34 and 80.95 billion dollars. It is concluded that there is great potential for CO2 abatement in China's steel industry. Adjusting the structure of the industry and technological advancement will play an important role in emissions reduction. Successful implementation of current sustainable development policies and measures will result in CO2 abatement at a low cost. However, to achieve higher levels of abatement, the cost will increase dramatically. In the near future, specific energy conservation technologies such as dry coke quenching, exhaust gas and heat recovery equipment will be of great significance. However, taking a long term perspective, emissions reduction will rely more on the adjustment of production processes and the application of more modern large scale plants. Advanced blast furnace technology will inevitably play an important role. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This program has a number of unique features, including its focus on a limited group of ozone precursors and its provisions for trading emissions based on atmospheric reactivity. This series of papers examines the potential air quality impacts of this new emission trading program through photochemical modeling of potential trading scenarios; this first paper in the series describes the air quality modeling methods used to assess potential trades, the potential for localized increases in ozone concentrations (ozone ""hot spots"") due to HRVOC emission trading, and the use of reactivity scales in the trading. When HRVOC emissions are traded on a mass basis, the simulations indicate that trading of HRVOC allowances between facilities resulted in less than 0.15 ppb (<0.13%) and 0.06 ppb (<0.06%) increases in predicted maximum, area-wide 1-h averaged and 8-h averaged ozone concentrations, respectively. Maximum decreases in ozone concentrations associated with trading, as opposed to across-the-board reductions, were larger than the increases. All of these changes are small compared to the maximum changes in ozone concentrations due to the VOC emissions from these sources (up to 5-10 ppb for 8 h averages; up to 30 ppb for 1-h averages). When emissions of HRVOCs are traded for other, less reactive emissions, on a reactivity weighted basis, air quality simulations indicate that daily maximum ozone concentrations increased by less than 0.3%. Because these relatively small changes (<1%) are for unlikely trading scenarios designed to produce a maximum change in ozone concentrations (all emissions traded into localized regions), the simulations indicate that the implementation of the trading program, as currently configured and possibly expanded, is unlikely to cause localized increases in ozone concentrations (""hot spots"" © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Concentration (process); Mathematical models; Ozone; Volatile organic compounds; Air quality simulations; Atmospheric reactivity; Photochemical modeling; Particulate emissions; ozone; volatile organic compound; Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Concentration (process); Mathematical models; Ozone; Particulate emissions; Volatile organic compounds; air quality; atmospheric modeling; emission control; emissions trading; industrial emission; ozone; photochemistry; point source pollution; volatile organic compound; air quality; atmospheric dispersion; concentration (parameters); environmental planning; mass; model; photochemistry; review; simulation; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Atmosphere; Cities; Commerce; Computer Simulation; Models, Theoretical; Organic Chemicals; Ozone; Photochemistry; Texas; Volatilization; Brazoria County; Galveston; Houston; North America; Texas; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247147303

The synthesis route involves facile solid-phase mechanochemical activation of a physical mixture of simple copper/zinc salts and oxalic acid, followed by calcination of the as-ground oxalate precursors at 350 °C. For comparison, their conventional analogues obtained by aqueous coprecipitation techniques were also examined. Structural characterization of the samples was performed by means of N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), thermal gravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), N2O titration, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results show that the grinding-derived Cu/ZnO catalysts exhibit superior SRM performance to their conventional counterparts obtained by wet-chemical methods. The enhanced performance of the grinding-derived catalysts can be attributed to a higher copper dispersion as well as the beneficial generation of highly strained Cu nanocrystals in the working catalyst. It is proposed that the present soft reactive grinding route based on dry oxalate-precursor synthesis can allow the generation of a new type of Cu/ZnO materials with favorable surface and structural properties, providing an attractive alternative for preparation of improved heterogeneous catalysts. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Cultivation experiments were performed with various media at temperatures ranging from 30 to 50°C. The results indicate that fermenters and heterotrophic sulfate reducers, using complex organic carbon, were ubiquitously present in most samples. Acetate-utilizing and H2-utilizing sulfate reducers were restricted to shallower intervals along the depth profile. Iron reducers and methanogens were only cultivated in a few shallow samples. Twelve pure strains including 8 fermenters, 3 iron reducers and 1 sulfate reducer originally enriched at 30 or 40°C were isolated and identified with 16S rDNA sequence analyses. They were phylogenetically affiliated with Firmicutes, Bactetiodes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria in various degrees of similarity. The presence of metabolism was not correlated with lithology, depth, temperature and the appearance of fracture throughout the core. The ubiquitous appearance of fermentation and organotrophic sulfate reduction suggests that organic carbon sources were readily accessible in this deep terrestrial subsurface environment. These results infer that the foreland sedimentary strata disturbed by tectonic activities over a geological time scale might support a heterotrophy-dominated deep terrestrial subsurface microbial ecosystem.","Cultivation; Metabolism; Microbial community; Taiwan Chelungpu Drilling Project","arc-continent collision; community structure; drilling; fault zone; geomicrobiology; metabolism; microbial community; Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary; sedimentary rock; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Taiwan; Actinobacteria; Firmicutes; Proteobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547589311

The CO TPR studies provide further evidence that the location of the Rh species is different in catalysts prepared by different methods. The CO TPR results and the correlation between the dispersion of the Rh species and the catalytic performance support the speculation that the dual sites containing Rh III and FeIII connected by phosphate groups are responsible for the conversion of methane to methyl acetate. The CO TPR studies also provide insight into the probable oxidation states of Rh and Fe during the catalytic reaction. We found that the RhIII and FeIII sites undergo simultaneous reductions during the reaction on the Rh-FePO 4 sample prepared from a mixed aqueous solution and the MCM-41-supported Rh-FePO4 sample prepared by a co-impregnation method, which can catalyze the conversion of methane to methyl acetate efficiently. On the other hand, the sample over which only RhIII species alone is reduced to Rh0 can catalyze only the undesirable consumption of N2O via the reduction by CO. FTIR studies of CO chemisorbed on the MCM-41-supported Rh-FePO4 sample prepared by the co-impregnation method showed the formation of a RhI geminal dicarbonyl species, i.e., RhI(CO)2, at proper temperatures similar to those for the catalytic formation of methyl acetate. A reaction mechanism via the RhI(CO)2 intermediate with the Fe II functioning for the activation of N2O to generate an active oxygen species for methane conversion is prcoposed. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Catalysts; Chemisorption; Dispersions; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Impregnation; Iron compounds; Methane; Catalytic formation; Catalytic reaction; Methyl acetate; Oxidative carbonylation; Rhodium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847386274

Abundant lipids molecules were recognized, including n-alkanes, n-alkenones, and long-chain branched alkanes. We find the predominance of main peaks of long-chain n-alkanes (nC29, nC31, nC33) and short-chain ones (nC16, nC17, nC18) records information of soil generation in warm-humid and cold-dry regions. The proportion of n-alkanes (nC16+nC17 +nC18) to (nC29+nC31+nC33) varies in good agreement with moisture-heat conditions and thus probably can serve as a new index for climate change. The ratios of C21-/nC22+, nC17/nC31 and (nC15+nC17+nC19)/(nC27 + nC29 + nC31) of n-alkanes, indicating respectively input ratios of lower bacterial alga, aquatic organisms, and higher plants and terraneous organisms, co-vary well in different climate regions from forest to grassland and desert, suggesting that they have also reflected the difference of climates between monsoon region and inland one. The C21-/ C22+ ratio of n-alkan-2-one records largely the discrepancy of temperature from north to south of China bordered by the Qinling Mountains, but less humidity. The C21-/ C22+ ratio of n-alkan-3-ones changes well with climatic factors, such as temperature and humidity. The biogenic source of series A-D long-chain branched alkanes may be derived from some kinds of special epiphyte that most likely live in weak oxic-anoxic and moisture-heat environments, suggesting their distribution record as well some information on climatic change. All these researches demonstrate that the distributions of lipids molecules in modern soils in China record well signals of climates from quite different climatic regions, and can serve as important climatic proxies to reveal climatic change over China. © Science in China Press 2007.","China; Climate index; Climate(moisture-heat) continuously changing regions; Lipids molecule; Modern soil","Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric temperature; China; Climate change; Gas chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Moisture; Paraffins; Plants (botany); Climate index; Lipids molecule; Modern soil; Soil mechanics; alkane; climate change; climate effect; lipid; soil organic matter; temperate environment; tropical environment; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Qinling Mountains; algae; Bacteria (microorganisms); Embryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247467394

These compounds exhibit bright-violet to blue photoluminescence (PL) (λmaxPL = 353-419 nm) with excellent PL quantum efficiencies (ΦPL= 83-100%) in solution and show high thermal stabilities (Td = 267-474 °C). The variation of the optical properties of these molecules in the solid state depends on the different stacking modes of these compounds containing different substituents, which are revealed by crystallographic analysis. CH⋯π hydrogen bonds instead of intermolecular π-π interactions act as the driving force between adjacent fluorenes, even though a very small dialkyl group (cyclopropane) is introduced at the C-9 position of fluorene. The crosslike molecular stacking efficiently reduces the energy transfer between the herring-like aggregates and therefore results in the absence of a ""green-light"" emission tail. In order to determine the cause of the ""green-light"" emission tails, the fluorescence spectra of the films annealed in N2 or in air are recorded. Broad green-light emission tails were observed for the films annealed in air, which might be caused by fluorenone defects generated during processing or during the course of the photophysical analysis by reaction with residual oxygen. © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

The primary objectives of the field demonstration were to assess the potential of the BAZE process to remediate the RDX-contaminated groundwater, and to quantify the capital and operation/maintenance costs associated with the use of the BAZE process for in situ treatment of RDX contamination in groundwater. The study also delineated the effects of the BAZE process on subsurface biomass, and water quality parameters (metals mobilization, total organic compound, etc.). The results of this 20-month field study demonstrated that acetate is an excellent source of carbon capable of creating reduced conditions conducive for reductive transformation of RDX in groundwater. Over the period of demonstration, the background RDX concentration of about 256μg/L was reduced to below the U.S. EPA's health advisory level of 2μg/L. Besides significant reduction in RDX background concentrations, other chemical (low Eh and nitrate denitrification) and biological (biomass buildup and enrichment) changes in the subsurface validated the development of a biologically active zone after the amendment addition. A total of 2,250 kg runway deicer (∼1,493 kg acetate) was injected into the subsurface over the period of the demonstration, which translates to a stoichiometric consumption of approximately 161 g acetate/g RDX.

Considerable strides have been made to improve large-area LULC datasets, but little emphasis has been placed on thematically detailed crop mapping, despite the considerable influence of management activities in the cropland sector on various environmental processes and the economy. Time-series MODIS 250 m Vegetation Index (VI) datasets hold considerable promise for large-area crop mapping in an agriculturally intensive region such as the U.S. Central Great Plains, given their global coverage, intermediate spatial resolution, high temporal resolution (16-day composite period), and cost-free status. However, the specific spectral-temporal information contained in these data has yet to be thoroughly explored and their applicability for large-area crop-related LULC classification is relatively unknown. The objective of this research was to investigate the general applicability of the time-series MODIS 250 m Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets for crop-related LULC classification in this region. A combination of graphical and statistical analyses were performed on a 12-month time-series of MODIS EVI and NDVI data from more than 2000 cropped field sites across the U.S. state of Kansas. Both MODIS VI datasets were found to have sufficient spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions to detect unique multi-temporal signatures for each of the region's major crop types (alfalfa, corn, sorghum, soybeans, and winter wheat) and management practices (double crop, fallow, and irrigation). Each crop's multi-temporal VI signature was consistent with its general phenological characteristics and most crop classes were spectrally separable at some point during the growing season. Regional intra-class VI signature variations were found for some crops across Kansas that reflected the state's climate and planting time differences. The multi-temporal EVI and NDVI data tracked similar seasonal responses for all crops and were highly correlated across the growing season. However, differences between EVI and NDVI responses were most pronounced during the senescence phase of the growing season. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

RESULTS: Employee perceptions of organizational climate (indicators of the organizational culture) were strongly related to overall satisfaction and measures of system performance. Overall, change in perceptions of organizational climate by 1 standard deviation (SD) was potentially associated with changes of 2% to 35% in selected outcomes.

The paper comprises an assessment of GHG emissions and economic returns under different mitigation technologies in three rice growing regions in Asia, i.e., Ilocos Norte province (Philippines), Zhejiang province (China) and Haryana state (India). Site-specific data on soil, climate and socio-economics were integrated in the previously developed spreadsheet model TechnoGAS (Technical Coefficient Generator for Mitigation Technologies of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Agricultural Sectors). Three baseline technologies that differed in terms of inorganic/organic N supply have been compared to different mitigation technologies in form of Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACCs). For the baseline technology of inorganic N (urea) fertilization, amendment with phosphogypsum and nitrification inhibitors are the most promising mitigation options resulting in shadow prices of less than US$10 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CE). Assuming a mix of urea and farm yard manure for the baseline, we have tested several options including different irrigation patterns and husk used as fossil fuel. Mid-season drainage had a better cost-benefit ratio (ca. US$20 per t CE) than alternate flooding, but was less profitable than husk utilization (ca. US$4 per t CE). Assuming high organic inputs, biogas technology is, in most cases, the preferable option (ca. US$10 per t CE). Finally, we compiled regional abatement cost curves for selected administrative units using the outcome from regional optimization models. Implementing the three most promising technologies required US$6000 for Dingras municipality, Ilocos Norte, in the Philippines (ca. 103 ha of rice land potentially providing emission savings of ca. 3000 t CE), US$50,000 for Pujiang county in China (ca. 104 ha providing ca. 27,000 t CE), and US$1.2 million for Karnal district in India (ca. 105 ha providing ca. 220,000 t CE). © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Location: North Tropical Africa. Methods: The geographical ranges of selected African plants were extracted from the literature and geo-referenced. These plant ranges were compared with the pollen percentages obtained from a network of surface sediments. Climate-response surfaces were graphed for each pollen taxon and each corresponding plant species. Results: Several patterns can be identified, including taxa for which the pollen and plant distributions coincide, and others where the range limits diverge. Some pollen types display a reduced climate range compared with that of the corresponding plant species, due to low pollen production and/or dispersal. For other taxa, corresponding to high pollen producers such as pioneer taxa, pollen types display a larger climatic envelope than that of the corresponding plants. The number of species contained in a pollen taxon is an important factor, as the botanical species included in a taxon may have different geographical and climate distributions. Main conclusions: The comparison between pollen and plant distributions is an essential step towards more precise vegetation and climate reconstructions in Africa, as it identifies taxa that have a high correspondence between pollen and plant distribution patterns. Our method is a useful tool to reassess biome reconstructions in Africa and to characterize accurately the vegetation and climate conditions at a regional scale, from pollen data. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Africa; Botanical species; Climate-response surface; Geographical distribution; Pollen; Taxonomy","bioclimatology; climate effect; geographical distribution; paleoclimate; pollen; proxy climate record; reconstruction; taxonomy; Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846906908

The reverse current can be assigned to minority carrier tunnelling through the space charge region within the backward bias voltage from 0 to about -10 V. With decreasing negative applied voltage from -10 V to around -22 V, the reverse current can be attributed to the tunnelling-assisted Poole-Frenkel emission. With further reduction of the reverse bias voltage from -22 V to about -38 V under 100 K, the reverse current staircases can be allocated to sequential resonant tunnelling; otherwise it can be due to the thermic effect at higher temperature.

In this experiment the three-dimensional wind vector and the turbulent fluxes of momentum, sensible and latent heat and CO2 were measured for one and a half years. Simultaneously the CO2 partial pressure pCO2 in surface water was measured by a submersible autonomous moored instrument for CO2 at the platform in 7-m depth. The high-resolution eddy correlation measurements of the atmospheric CO2 flux FCO2, together with the measurements of the CO2 partial pressure differences between air and sea ΔpCO2 led to a long-term data set which provided the possibility to investigate the parameterization of the CO2 transfer velocity k as a function of 10-m wind speed u in a statistical manner. From half-hour mean CO2 fluxes and CO2 partial pressure differences, k was calculated using k = FCO2 / (K0ΔpCO2), with K0 the CO2 solubility. The half-hour mean data points, used for the determination of the k-u parameterization, show large scatter. However, assuming a linear, quadratic dependency the analysis yields: k660 = 0.365u2 + 0.46u (k at 20 °C and salinity 35 psu) with a correlation coefficient of r2 = 0.81. The large scatter indicates that the kinetics of the air-sea CO2 transfer velocity is not only a function of the wind speed alone, but might also be controlled by other environmental parameters and mechanisms, such as sea state and surface coverage with surfactants. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Development of methods to estimate CO2 leakage rates is essential to assure that storage objectives are being met at sequestration facilities. Perfluorocarbon tracers (PFTs) were added as three 12 h slugs at about one week intervals during the injection of 2090 tons of CO2 into the West Pearl Queen (WPQ) depleted oil formation, sequestration pilot study site located in SE New Mexico. The CO2 was injected into the Permian Queen Formation. Leakage was monitored in soil-gas using a matrix of 40 capillary adsorbent tubes (CATs) left in the soil for periods ranging from days to months. The tracers, perfluoro-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane (PDCH), perfluorotrimethylcyclohexane (PTCH) and perfluorodimethylcyclobutane (PDCB), were analyzed using thermal desorption, and gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Monitoring was designed to look for immediate leakage, such as at the injection well bore and at nearby wells, and to develop the technology to estimate overall CO2 leak rates based on the use of PFTs. Tracers were detected in soil-gas at the monitoring sites 50 m from the injection well within days of injection. Tracers continued to escape over the following years. Leakage appears to have emanated from the vicinity of the injection well in a radial pattern to about 100 m and in directional patterns to 300 m. Leakage rates were estimated for the 3 tracers from each of the 4 sets of CATs in place following the start of CO2 injection. Leakage was fairly uniform during this period. As a first approximation, the CO2 leak rate was estimated at about 0.0085% of the total CO2 sequestered per annum.",,"Capillarity; Carbon dioxide; Fluorocarbons; Greenhouse gases; Leak detection; Petroleum reservoirs; Capillary adsorbent tubes (CAT); Perfluorocarbon tracers (PFT); Slugs; Radioactive tracers; carbon sequestration; enhanced oil recovery; fluorocarbon; hydrocarbon reservoir; leakage; monitoring system; offshore engineering; oil well; tracer; underground storage; well technology; New Mexico; North America; United States; Gastropoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247565148

The approach of developing a single model formulation allowed quantitative comparisons across various locations and time periods. Building on a common foundation enabled the linkages between lower trophic levels to the higher trophic (fish) components to proceed systematically. NEMURO was extended to NEMURO.FISH by using the lower trophic level output of NEMURO as input to a bioenergetic-based model of fish growth and population dynamics. This paper summarizes the contributions of individual papers that comprise this issue of Ecological Modelling and that all used the NEMURO family of models. Contributions represent a rich set of case-studies and in-depth modeling studies focused on the North Pacific that addressed: oceanic biogeochemistry, regional and seasonal variability of phytoplankton and zooplankton, reconstruction of 40-50 years of plankton dynamics, effects of climate on herring and saury growth and population dynamics, the feasibility of automatic calibration methods, the sensitivity of the model to parameter values, and projections of future states of the ecosystem under global warming. Next steps in the evolution of NEMURO are suggested and include increased resolution of the physical model underlying NEMURO, the addition of new biological state variables at the lower trophic levels to better represent the diversity of oceanic species and their potential for different responses under changing environmental conditions, and the addition of more higher trophic level species to allow for inter-specific (competition and predation) interactions. The NEMURO effort involved a diverse group of researchers working jointly on a common problem for several years. Consequently, the resulting contributions, even at the level of the individual papers, provide a broader perspective and integration of the results than would have occurred by working in isolation. The benefits of a large-scale collaborative effort to develop a common model formulation are clearly illustrated by the papers in this issue. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

With the guideline 2000/76/EC recent European legislation has set stringent limits not only for the mono-combustion of waste in specialized incineration plants but also for co-combustion in coal-fired power plants. With increased awareness of environmental issues and stepwise decrease of emission limits and inclusion of more and more substances into the network of regulations a multitude of emission abatement methods and technologies have been developed over the last decades. The result is the state-of-the-art waste incinerator with a number of specialized process steps for the individual components in the flue gas. The present work highlights some new developments which can be summarized under the common goal of reducing the costs of flue gas treatment by applying systems which combine the treatment of several noxious substances in one reactor or by taking new, simpler routes instead of the previously used complicated ones or - in the case of flue gas desulphurisation - by reducing the amount of limestone consumption. Cost reduction is also the driving force for new processes of conditioning of nonhomogenous waste before combustion. Pyrolysis or gasification is used for chemical conditioning whereas physical conditioning means comminution, classification and sorting processes. Conditioning yields a fuel which can be used in power plants either as a co-fuel or a mono-fuel and which will burn there under much better controlled conditions and therefore with less emissions than the nonhomogeneous waste in a conventional waste incinerator. Also for cost reasons, co-combustion of wastes in coal-fired power stations is strongly pressing into the market. Recent investigations reveal that the co-firing of waste can also have beneficial effects on the operating behavior of the boiler and on the gaseous emissions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Both natural and human-mediated changes in plant cover influence abiotic sediment properties and thus have cascading impacts on the biotic community. Using clipping (structural) and light (shading) manipulations in two salt marsh vegetation zones (one dominated by Spartina foliosa and one by Salicornia virginica), we tested whether these plant species exert influence on abiotic environmental factors and examined the mechanisms by which these changes regulate the biotic community. In an unshaded (plant and shade removal) treatment, marsh soils exhibited harsher physical properties, a microalgal community composition shift toward increased diatom dominance, and altered macrofaunal community composition with lower species richness, a larger proportion of insect larvae, and a smaller proportion of annelids, crustaceans, and oligochaetes compared to shaded (plant removal, shade mimic) and control treatment plots. Overall, the shaded treatment plots were similar to the controls. Plant cover removal also resulted in parallel shifts in microalgal and macrofaunal isotopic signatures of the most dynamic species. This suggests that animal responses are seen mainly among microalgae grazers and may be mediated by plant modification of microalgae. Results of these experiments demonstrate how light reduction by the vascular plant canopy can control salt marsh sediment communities in an arid climate.

Few unaltered floodplains remain where we may examine their dynamics over decadal time scales. Our study provides a detailed examination of landscape change over a 60-year period (1945-2004) on the Nyack floodplain of the Middle Fork of the Flathead River, a free-flowing, gravel-bed river in northwest Montana, USA. We used historical aerial photographs and airborne and satellite imagery to delineate habitats (i.e., mature forest, regenerative forest, water, cobble) within the floodplain. We related changes in the distribution and size of these habitats to hydrologic disturbance and regional climate. Results show a relationship between changes in floodplain habitats and annual flood magnitude, as well as between hydrology and the cooling and warming phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Large magnitude floods and greater frequency of moderate floods were associated with the cooling phases of the PDO, resulting in a floodplain environment dominated by extensive restructuring and regeneration of floodplain habitats. Conversely, warming phases of the PDO corresponded with decreases in magnitude, duration, and frequency of critical flows, creating a floodplain environment dominated by late successional vegetation and low levels of physical restructuring. Over the 60-year time series, habitat change was widespread throughout the floodplain, though the relative abundances of the habitats did not change greatly. We conclude that the long- and short-term interactions of climate, floods, and plant succession produce a shifting habitat mosaic that is a fundamental attribute of natural floodplain ecosystems. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","Climate; Floodplain; Hydrologic disturbance; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; PDO; Spatial pattern; Succession","environmental disturbance; floodplain; habitat mosaic; hydrology; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; regional climate; relative abundance; spatial variation; succession; article; climate; ecosystem; environment; environmental protection; growth, development and aging; plant; population dynamics; river; tree; United States; water flow; water supply; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environment; Montana; Plants; Population Dynamics; Rivers; Trees; Water Movements; Water Supply; Flathead River; Montana; North America; Nyack Floodplain; United States; Kathetostoma giganteum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247362865

More than one-third of amphibian species are globally threatened, and over 120 species have likely suffered global extinction since 1980. Most alarmingly, many rapid declines and extinctions are occurring in pristine sites lacking obvious adverse effects of human activities. The causes of these ""enigmatic"" declines remain highly contested. Still, lack of long-term data on amphibian populations severely limits our understanding of the distribution of amphibian declines, and therefore the ultimate causes of these declines. Here, we identify a systematic community-wide decline in populations of terrestrial amphibians at La Selva Biological Station, a protected old-growth lowland rainforest in lower Central America. We use data collected over 35 years to show that population density of all species of terrestrial amphibians has declined by ≈75% since 1970, and we show identical trends for all species of common reptiles. The trends we identify are neither consistent with recent emergence of chytridiomycosis nor the climate-linked epidemic hypothesis, two leading putative causes of enigmatic amphibian declines. Instead, our data suggest that declines are due to climate-driven reductions in the quantity of standing leaf litter, a critical microhabitat for amphibians and reptiles in this assemblage. Our results raise further concerns about the global persistence of amphibian populations by identifying widespread declines in species and habitats that are not currently recognized as susceptible to such risks. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Conservation; Long-term studies; Tropical wet forest","Amphibia; article; Chytridiomycetes; climate change; Costa Rica; epidemic; hypothesis; mycosis; nonhuman; population density; population research; population size; priority journal; reptile; species extinction; species habitat; Amphibia; animal; climate; physiology; plant leaf; reptile; Amphibia; Reptilia; Amphibia; Animals; Climate; Costa Rica; Extinction, Biological; Plant Leaves; Reptiles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249878643

Modelled concentrations of SIA (secondary inorganic aerosol) are compared against data from the UK's Nitric Acid and Aerosol Network and SOA (secondary organic aerosol) against measurements made at the Bush Estate, Edinburgh. These data indicate that the HARM/ELMO modelling approach comes close to achieving mass closure. Comparison with national maps of total PM10 indicate that the models underestimate particulate matter concentrations around large conurbations, probably due to the localised nature of emissions of primary particulates in these areas and model scale. The models are used to attribute particulate matter to different source and size categories, assessing the relative importance of primaries, SIA and SOA; the contributions of anthropogenic and biogenic precursors of SOA; the relative importance of PMcoarse (PM10-PM2.5) and PMfine (PM2.5) and UK vs. other EMEP area sources. The implications of these attributions for emissions control policies are discussed. The impact of uncertainties in emissions of the sources of primaries, SIA and SOA are explored. For primary PM10 and SOA this has been achieved through emissions scaling and for SIA using the GLUE (Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation) approach. The selection of acceptable model parameter sets has been based on the need to retain the capability to model deposition of S and N species. The impact of uncertainty on estimates of present day SIA concentrations is illustrated for sites in the Nitric Acid and Aerosol Network. A more limited assessment for 2010 has been carried out at the national scale, illustrating that inclusion of uncertainty can change modelled concentrations from no exceedance of current air quality objectives, to one of exceedance over large areas of south and east England. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Findings of the study showed that tea cultivations at low and mid elevations are more vulnerable to adverse impacts of climate change than those at high elevations. The optimum temperature for tea cultivation was found to be about 22°C. The study also indicated that reduction of monthly rainfall by 100 mm could reduce the productivity by 30 - 80 kg of 'made' tea ha-1. In different tea growing regions, the optimum rainfall for tea cultivation varied from 223 to 417 mm per month. Increase in ambient CO2 concentration from the present ambient level (around 370 ppm) to 600 ppm, increased the tea yield by about 33-37 % depending on the elevation. Based on these estimated parameters, a simple crop model was developed for predicting tea yield under future climate scenarios. The model was incorporated into a special software package developed to assess impact of climate change on productivity of tea plantations. Yield projections by the crop model showed that rising temperatures and diminishing rainfall reduce tea yield in many tea growing regions except Wet zone Up country (WU). The results also predicted that tea yields are likely to increase at high elevations while the yields at low elevations are likely to reduce due to climate change. Hence, sustainable adaptation measures are proposed to minimize such adverse effects.","Climate change; CO2; Crop model; Productivity; Tea",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447647675

The plots were established adjacent to the Rock Cut parking lot at ∼3658 m elevation along Trail Ridge Road in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. Due to limitations in the original study design, the lack of true replication required that the plots be treated individually when subject to indirect ordination analysis to follow trends in overall plant composition and cover. The three most abundant species in the study plots were Artemisia scopulorum, Acomastylis rossii, and Kobresia myosuroides. At the beginning of the study in 1959, total cover ranged from 20 to 55% in the four plots. By 1961, three of the four plots achieved total canopy cover values of at least 100%. Vascular plant species richness (number of taxa per plot) averaged 20 in 1959, but by 1967 had nearly doubled to 37. During the first several years, rates of seedling emergence were high among most taxa with the notable exceptions of K. myosuroides and A. rossii. However, likely due to desiccation and needle ice, seedling mortality was high. K. myosuroides spread exclusively from remnant tufts, as did three species of cushion plants which survived the trampling. The overall decline in plant cover during the last two decades of this study, particularly for K. myosuroides, indicates that long-term unassisted regeneration of severely degraded alpine tundra sites will take more than a century. While there have been periods of plant colonization and spread, climate factors such as a series of heavy snow years, and unchecked soil erosion from trails, can limit plant establishment and stop the recovery process, or push the recovery back by several decades. The negative influence of soil erosion, and quite possibly additional trampling, over a significant portion of the study plot points to the critical importance of using extreme care when establishing long-term monitoring plots, particularly in high-use areas. © 2007 Regents of the University of Colorado.",,"alpine environment; community response; data set; ecosystem resilience; human activity; plant community; regeneration; secondary succession; seedling emergence; soil erosion; species richness; trampling; tundra; vegetation dynamics; Colorado; North America; Rocky Mountain National Park; United States; Acomastylis rossii; Artemisia; Artemisia scopulorum; Kobresia myosuroides; Tracheophyta",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947612582

It is generally accepted that sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) play an important role in modulating rainfall variability. Consequently, SSTs can be prescribed in global and regional climate modelling in order to study the physical mechanisms behind rainfall and its extremes. Using a satellite-based daily rainfall historical data set, this paper describes the main patterns of rainfall variability over southern Africa, identifies the dates when extreme rainfall occurs within these patterns, and shows the effect of resolution in trying to identify the location and intensity of SST anomalies associated with these extremes in the Atlantic and southwest Indian Ocean. Derived from a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the results also suggest that, for the spatial pattern accounting for the highest amount of variability, extremes extracted at a higher spatial resolution do give a clearer indication regarding the location and intensity of anomalous SST regions. As the amount of variability explained by each spatial pattern defined by the PCA decreases, it would appear that extremes extracted at a lower resolution give a clearer indication of anomalous SST regions.

A fundamental characteristic of the hydrothermal alteration is the removal of graphite, a process which is associated with bleaching and the development of bedding-parallel bands of coarse biotite augen. Gold is found only in quartz veins and only where they cut decarbonized chloritic rock with abundant biotite augen and no sulfide minerals. Auriferous quartz veins differ from barren quartz veins by the presence of ilmenite, apatite, xenotime, and gold and the absence of sulfide minerals. The assemblage of goldi-lmenite-apatite-xenotime indicates a linked genesis and mobility of Ti, P, and Y in the mineralizing fluids. Geochemical analysis of samples throughout the deposit shows that gold only occurs in sedimentary rocks with high FeO/(FeO+Fe2O3) and low C/(C+CO2) ratios (&gt;0.8 and &lt;0.2, respectively). This association can be explained by reactions that convert C from reduced graphitic host rocks into CO2 and reduce ferric iron in the host rocks to ferrous iron in biotite and chlorite. These reactions would increase the CO2 content of the fluid, facilitating the transport of Ti, P, and Y from the host rocks into the veins. Both CO2 and CH4 produced by reaction of H2O with graphite, effervesced under the lower confining pressures in the veins. This would have partitioned H2S into the vapor phase, destabilizing Au-bisulfide complexes; the loss of CO2 and H2S from the aqueous phase caused precipitation of gold, ilmenite, apatite, and xenotime. It is proposed that this process was the main control on gold precipitation. Oxidization of iron in the very reduced wall rocks, resulting in reduction of the fluid, provided a second mechanism of gold precipitation in previously decarbonized rocks, contributing to the high grades in some samples. Although sulfide minerals, especially arsenopyrite, did form during the hydrothermal event, host rock sulfidation reactions did not play a role in gold precipitation because gold is absent near rocks or veins containing sulfide minerals. Sulfide minerals likely formed by different mechanisms from those associated with gold deposition. Both the fold architecture and subsequent spatially coincident sinistral semibrittle shearing ensured that the ore fluids were strongly focused into the hinges of the anticlines. Within the anticlines, a reactive cap of fine-grained, graphitic, reduced Fe-rich turbidites above more permeable siltstones and fine sandstones impeded fluid flow ensuring efficient removal of graphite, and the associated effervescence of CO2 from the fluid caused the precipitation of gold. Exploration for similar deposits should focus on the intersection of east-west shear zones with folds and Fe-rich graphitic host rocks. © Government of Australia 2006.","Geochemistry; Gold deposits; Graphite; Quartz veins; Tanami Region","facies; geochemistry; gold; hydrothermal alteration; ore body; ore deposit; oxidation; quartz vein; Australasia; Australia; Northern Territory; Tanami Desert",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846034439

Traditionally, there has been an extremely limited use of long-term ecological records (greater than 50 years) in biodiversity conservation. There are a number of reasons why such records tend to be discounted, including a perception of poor scale of resolution in both time and space, and the lack of accessibility of long temporal records to non-specialists. Probably more important, however, is the perception that even if suitable temporal records are available, their roles are purely descriptive, simply demonstrating what has occurred before in Earth's history, and are of little use in the actual practice of conservation. This paper asks why this is the case and whether there is a place for the temporal record in conservation management. Key conservation initiatives related to extinctions, identification of regions of greatest diversity/threat, climate change and biological invasions are addressed. Examples of how a temporal record can add information that is of direct practicable applicability to these issues are highlighted. These include (i) the identification of species at the end of their evolutionary lifespan and therefore most at risk from extinction, (ii) the setting of realistic goals and targets for conservation 'hotspots', and (iii) the identification of various management tools for the maintenance/restoration of a desired biological state. For climate change conservation strategies, the use of long-term ecological records in testing the predictive power of species envelope models is highlighted, along with the potential of fossil records to examine the impact of sea-level rise. It is also argued that a long-term perspective is essential for the management of biological invasions, not least in determining when an invasive is not an invasive. The paper concludes that often inclusion of a long-term ecological perspective can provide a more scientifically defensible basis for conservation decisions than the one based only on contemporary records. The pivotal issue of this paper is not whether long-term records are of interest to conservation biologists, but how they can actually be utilized in conservation practice and policy. © 2007 The Royal Society.","Biodiversity hotspots; Climate change; Conservation practice and policy; Extinctions; Long-term ecology; Red data list","biodiversity; biological invasion; climate change; conservation management; conservation planning; ecological approach; extinction; fossil record; long-term change; policy strategy; Red List; biodiversity; climate; ecology; environmental protection; methodology; population dynamics; review; species extinction; theoretical model; time; Biodiversity; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecology; Extinction, Biological; Models, Theoretical; Population Dynamics; Time Factors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847736672

Our objective is to develop a modeling framework for assessment of the community health risk implications of land use policy. The modeling framework is not intended to be a regulatory tool for small-scale land use decisions, but a long-range planning tool to assess the community health risk implications of alternative land use scenarios at a regional or subregional scale. This paper describes the development and application of an air toxic source model for generating aggregate emission factors for industrial and commercial zoning districts as a function of permitted uses. To address the uncertainty of estimating air toxics emission rates for planned general land use or zoning districts, the source model uses an emissions probability mass function that weights each incremental permitted land use activity by the likelihood of occurrence. We thus reduce the uncertainty involved in planning for development with no prior knowledge of the specific industries that may locate within the land use district. These air toxics emission factors can then be used to estimate pollutant atmospheric mass flux from land use zoning districts, which can then be input to air dispersion and human health risk assessment models to simulate the spatial pattern of air toxics exposure risk. The model database was constructed using the California Air Toxics Inventory, 1997 US Economic Census, and land assessment records from several California counties. The database contains information on more than 200 air toxics at the 2-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) level. We present a case study to illustrate application of the model.

Cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) expression is induced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and planar halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as the non-ortho and mono-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). CYP1A induction has been used extensively as a biomarker of exposure to such compounds in vertebrates. We measured PCB concentrations and CYP1A1 expression in integument biopsies from bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) resident in Sarasota Bay, FL. This population of dolphins has been the subject of long-term population and health assessment, affording the opportunity to evaluate the influence of age, sex, and reproductive status on CYP1A1 expression. CYP1A1 expression was seen in endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle, and nerve cells in the dermis, similar to what has been observed in other cetacean species. Endothelial CYP1A1 expression varied along the length of the biopsy, which could be related to differences in the structure and functionality of the blubber in different parts of the integument. Neither age nor sex was related to CYP1A1 expression in these biopsies, and reproductive status did not relate to levels of CYP1A1 in females. Total PCB and toxic equivalent quotient concentrations in blubber were positively correlated with dermal endothelial CYP1A1 expression, although mono-ortho PCBs concentrations did not show this relationship. Contaminant concentrations appear to be stronger determinants of CYP1A1 expression in integument of these dolphins, than are age, sex, or reproductive status. © The Author 2007.

This paper's detailed analysis is made possible by combining two specialized models developed at Battelle: the Battelle CO2-GIS to determine the regional capacity and cost of CO2 transport and geologic storage; and the Battelle Carbon Management Electricity Model, an electric system optimal capacity expansion and dispatch model, to examine the investment and operation of electric power technologies with CCS against the background of other options. A key feature of this paper's analysis is an attempt to explicitly model the inherent heterogeneities that exist in both the nation's current and future electricity generation infrastructure and in its candidate deep geologic CO2 storage formations. Overall, between 180 and 580 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired integrated gasification combined cycle with CCS (IGCC + CCS) capacity is built by 2045 in these four scenarios, requiring between 12 and 41 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) storage in regional deep geologic reservoirs across the U.S. Nearly all of this CO2 is from new IGCC + CCS systems, which start to deploy after 2025. Relatively little IGCC + CCS capacity is built before that time, primarily under unique niche opportunities. For the most part, CO2 emissions prices will likely need to be sustained at over $20/tonne CO2 before CCS begins to deploy on a large scale within the electric power sector. Within these broad national trends, a highly nuanced picture of CCS deployment across the U.S. emerges. Across the four scenarios studied here, power plant builders and operators within some North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) regions do not employ any CCS while other regions build more than 100 GW of CCS-enabled generation capacity. One region sees as much as 50% of its geologic CO2 storage reservoirs' total theoretical capacity consumed by 2045, while most of the regions still have more than 90% of their potential storage capacity available to meet storage needs in the second half of the century and beyond. A detailed presentation of the results for power plant builds and operation in two key regions: ECAR in the Midwest and ERCOT in Texas, provides further insight into the diverse set of economic decisions that generate the national and aggregate regional results. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Higher plant Rubisco possesses an L8S8 structure, with the large subunit (LS) encoded in the chloroplast by rbcL and the small subunit encoded by the nuclear RBCS gene family. Because its components accumulate stoichiometrically but are encoded in two genetic compartments, rbcL and RBCS expression must be tightly coordinated. Although this coordination has been observed, the underlying mechanisms have not been defined. Here, we use tobacco to understand how LS translation is related to its assembly status. To do so, two transgenic lines deficient in LS biogenesis were created: a chloroplast transformant expressing a truncated and unstable LS polypeptide, and a line where a homolog of the maize Rubisco-specif ic chaperone, BSD2, was repressed by RNAi. We found that in both lines, LS translation is no longer regulated by the availability of small subunit (SS), indicating that LS translation is not activated by the presence of its assembly partner but, rather, undergoes an autoregulation of translation.

They regulate global climate and surroundings in many ways at different levels such as molecular, cellular, organ, individual, community, regional, ecosystem and global ecosystem levels. This article will focus on the abiotic aspect of the environment. Readers interested in the biotic aspect can read recent publications by Garcia-Brugger et al. [Early signalling events induced by eliators of plant defenses, Mol. Plant Microbe In. 19 (2006) 711-724], Lecourieux et al. [Calcium in plant defence-signalling pathways, New Phytol. 171 (2006) 249-269], and Conrath et al. [Priming: Getting ready for battle, Mol. Plant Microbe In. 19 (2006) 1062-1071], for related progress. Plant behavior and character expression are controlled at the molecular level by gene expression and environmental cues. In a persistently changing environment there are many abiotic adverse stress conditions such as cold, drought, salinity and UV-B, which influence plant growth and crop production. Unlike animals, higher plants, which are sessile, cannot escape from their surroundings, but adapt themselves to changing environments by inducing a series of molecular responses to cope with these problems. The physiological processing basis for these molecular responses is the integration of many transduced events into a comprehensive network of signaling pathways. Here, higher plant hormones occupy a central place in this transduction network, frequently acting in conjunction with other signals, to regulate cellular processes such as division, elongation and differentiation, which are the fundamental basis for higher plant development and related character expression. Stress factors are also major ecological factors influencing the environment, which are general environmental stimuli and cues to higher plants. Molecular responses to environmental stresses have been studied intensively over the last few years. The findings show an intricate network of signaling pathways controlling perception of environmental signals, the generation of second messengers and signal transduction. In this review, up-to-date progresses are introduced in terms of functional analysis of signaling components and issues with respect to the agricultural environment and sustainable development. These advances mainly include identification of the abiotic stress-responsive genes, extensive realization of the mutual concerted relationship between plants and the environment on different scales, molecular mechanisms of stress signal transduction and pathways, and so on. Here, a general network of stress-responsive gene expression-control model is proposed, with an emphasis on the integration between stress signal transduction pathways and the agricultural environment. © INRA, EDP Sciences, 2007.","Agricultural sustainable development; Biological measures; Eco-environment; Environmental stresses; Global climate change; Higher plants; Network of signaling transduction; Plant biology","alternative agriculture; climate change; environmental cue; environmental stress; gene expression; global climate; growth regulator; hormone; physiological response; signal; tolerance; Animalia; Embryophyta",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947309884

For arid climates, or those with a distinct dry season where zero values are common, the SPI at short time scales is lower bounded, referring to non-normally distributed in this study. In these cases, the SPI is always greater than a certain value and fails to indicate a drought occurrence. The nationwide statistics based on our study suggest that the non-normality rates are closely related to local precipitation climates. In the eastern United States, SPI values at short time scales can be used in drought/flood monitoring and research in any season, while in the western United States, because of its distinct seasonal precipitation distribution, the appropriate usage and interpretation of this index becomes complicated. This would also be the case for all arid climates. From a mathematical point of view, the non-normally distributed SPI is caused by a high probability of no-rain cases represented in the mixed distribution that is employed in the SPI construction. From a statistical point of view, the 2-parameter gamma model used to estimate the precipitation probability density function and the limited sample size in dry areas and times would also reduce the confidence of the SPI values. On the basis of the results identified within this study, we recommend that the SPI user be cautious when applying short-time-scale SPIs in arid climatic regimes, and interpret the SPI values appropriately. In dry climates, the user should focus on the duration of the drought rather than on just its severity. It is also worth noting that the SPI results from a statistical product of the input data. This character makes it difficult to link the SPI data to the physical functioning of the Earth system.

However, different hydrologic response to varied climatic conditions might affect model calibration and validation. A case study was conducted for a 901 km2 watershed of northern Michigan to compare the effects of calibrating the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) watershed model with different climatic datasets representing drought (1948-1949) versus average (1969-1970) conditions. The effects of the different climatic conditions on parameter response and sensitivity were evaluated, and performance of the two calibration versions was compared using a common validation period, 1950-1965. For the drought- and average-calibration periods, models were well calibrated, as indicated by high Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients (E = 0.8 and 0.9), and low deviation of discharge values (D = 2.9% and 3.4%). Evapotranspiration parameters differed under the two sets of climatic conditions. The plant water uptake compensation factor (EPCO), appropriately reflected plant water uptake patterns in varied climatic conditions. Snow melting parameters differed between the two scenarios. A comparison of baseflow values simulated by SWAT versus those computed by a hydrograph separation method showed that the SWAT method treated most snowmelt as surface runoff, whereas the latter method treated much of it as baseflow. The drought-calibrated version of the model performed much better during the validation period (1950-1965) (E = 0.8, D = 2.6%) than did the average-calibrated version (E = 0.4, D = 41.4%). © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Comparison between two sets of 20-yr (1979-98) integration using the NCAR Community Climate Model version 3 (CCM3) illustrates that the inclusion of CMT in the convection scheme systematically modifies the climate mean state over the equatorial region. The convective momentum tendencies slow down the equatorward flow at higher latitudes near the surface and weaken the equatorial convergence and convection. This reduces the convective heating and drying around the equator and produces an improved meridional distribution within the upward branch of the Hadley circulation. The major heating peak during the boreal winter is moved to south of the equator at about 10°S, which is closer to the heat budget residuals of the ECMWF reanalysis data. The responses of meridional wind to the reduced heating result in the secondary meridional circulation within the intertropical convergence zone. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric turbulence; Computer simulation; Heating; Wind; Convective heating; Convective momentum transport (CMT); Equatorward flow; Intertropical convergence zone; Meridional circulation; Climatology; Atmospheric turbulence; Climatology; Computer simulation; Heating; Wind; climate modeling; convective system; global climate; heat budget; intertropical convergence zone; meridional circulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247621828

The models address all the seven major marine basins and the entire drainage basin of the Baltic Sea. A series of future scenarios have been developed, in close collaboration with the Helsinki Commission, to see the possible effects of improved wastewater treatment and manure handling, phosphorus-free detergents, and less intensive land use and live stocks. Improved wastewater treatment and the use of phosphorus-free detergents in the entire region would drastically decrease phosphorus loads and improve the marine environment, particularly the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms. However, the Baltic Sea will remain eutrophic, and to reduce other effects, a substantial reduction of nitrogen emissions must be implemented. This can only be obtained in these scenarios by drastically changing land use. In a final scenario, we have turned 50% of all agricultural lands into grasslands, together with efficient wastewater treatments and a ban of phosphorus in detergents. This scenario will substantially reduce primary production and the extension of hypoxic bottoms, increase water transparency in the most eutrophied basins, and virtually eliminate extensive cyanobacterial blooms. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2007.",,"decision support system; ecosystem modeling; emission control; environmental assessment; environmental management; eutrophic environment; marine ecosystem; wastewater; water treatment; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Cyanobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250029272

EPA, a highly important case regarding greenhouse gases. The case centered on the Court's review of EPA's denial of a petition to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. The Court required EPA to reconsider its denial. The Court found that. 1) the petitioners have standing to challenge EPA's denial of their petition; 2) the Court has the authority to review the denial of the petition; and 3) the Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. This article looks specifically at the Court's analysis of standing and jurisdiction by Justice Stevens, who wrote the Court's majority opinion, and two dissenting opinions by Justices Roberts and Scalia. Most interesting is how the closely divided Justices (5 to 4 decision) viewed, very differently, the issues regarding standing, the evidence that emissions from new motor vehicles are causing global warming and harm to Massachusetts, and the agency's judgment in denying the petition. Lastly, the article speculates on the impact of the decision and the current activities taking place at the state and regulated community level involving future regulation, litigation, and opportunities by various companies and coalitions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

This study examined the effect impervious surfaces (IS) spatial patterns have on LST in Beijing. China. A classification and regression tree model (CART) was adopted to estimate IS as a continuous variable using Landsat images from two seasons combined with QuickBird. LST was retrieved from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image to examine the relationships between IS and LST. The results revealed that CART was capable of consistently predicting LST with acceptable accuracy (correlation coefficient of 0.94 and the average error of 8.59%). Spatial patterns of IS exhibited changing gradients across the various urban-rural transects, with LST values showing a concentric shape that increased as you moved from the outskirts towards the downtown areas. Transect analysis also indicated that the changes in both IS and LST patterns were similar at various resolution levels, which suggests a distinct linear relationship between them.

The simulation of its climate remains a challenge for global coupled ocean-atmosphere models, which suffer large biases especially in reproducing the observed meridional asymmetry across the equator in sea surface temperature (SST) and rainfall. A basin ocean general circulation model is coupled with a full-physics regional atmospheric model to study eastern Pacific climate processes. The regional ocean atmosphere model (ROAM) reproduces salient features of eastern Pacific climate, including a northward displaced intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) collocated with a zonal band of high SST, a low-cloud deck in the southeastern tropical Pacific, the equatorial cold tongue, and its annual cycle. The simulated low cloud deck experiences significant seasonal variations in vertical structure and cloudiness; cloud becomes decoupled and separated from the surface mixed layer by a stable layer in March when the ocean warms up, leading to a reduction in cloudiness. The interaction of low cloud and SST is an important internal feedback for the climatic asymmetry between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In an experiment where the cloud radiative effect is turned off, this climatic asymmetry weakens substantially, with the ITCZ migrating back and forth across the equator following the sun. In another experiment where tropical North Atlantic SST is lowered by 2°C - say, in response to a slow-down of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation as during the Younger Dryas - the equatorial Pacific SST decreases by up to 3°C in January-April but changes much less in other seasons, resulting in a weakened equatorial annual cycle. The relatively high resolution (0.5°) of the ROAM enables it to capture mesoscale features, such as tropical instability waves, Central American gap winds, and a thermocline dome off Costa Rica. The implications for tropical biases and paleoclimate research are discussed. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric structure; Atmospheric temperature; Atmospheric turbulence; Ocean currents; Wind; Global coupled ocean-atmosphere models; Intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ); Regional ocean atmosphere model (ROAM); Sea surface temperature (SST); Tropical Pacific Ocean; Climatology; atmosphere-ocean coupling; atmospheric modeling; climate feedback; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; intertropical convergence zone; Northern Hemisphere; rainfall; regional climate; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; Southern Hemisphere; thermohaline circulation; Central America; Costa Rica; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Tropical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847360807

We use the A2 (medium-high GHG emission pathway) and B2 (medium-low) climate change scenarios produced by the Regional Climate Model PRECIS, the crop model - CERES, and socio-economic scenarios described by IPCC SRES, to simulate the average yield changes per hectare of three main grain crops (rice, wheat, and maize) at 50 km × 50 km scale. The threshold of food production to temperature increases was analyzed based on the relationship between yield changes and temperature rise, and then food security was discussed corresponding to each IPCC SRES scenario. The results show that without the CO2 fertilization effect in the analysis, the yield per hectare for the three crops would fall consistently as temperature rises beyond 2.5 °C; when the CO2 fertilization effect was included in the simulation, there were no adverse impacts on China's food production under the projected range of temperature rise (0.9-3.9 °C). A critical threshold of temperature increase was not found for food production. When the socio-economic scenarios, agricultural technology development and international trade were incorporated in the analysis, China's internal food production would meet a critical threshold of basic demand (300 kg/capita) while it would not under A2 (no CO2 fertilization); whereas basic food demand would be satisfied under both A2 and B2, and would even meet a higher food demand threshold required to sustain economic growth (400 kg/capita) under B2, when CO2 fertilization was considered. © 2007 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.",,"Agriculture; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Industrial emissions; Thermal effects; Food production; Food security; Food products; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate effect; crop production; crop yield; food production; food security; greenhouse gas; nature-society relations; socioeconomic conditions; temperature effect; threshold; Agriculture; Emission; Fertilization; Food; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847386674

The shorter monolith showed much better catalytic combustion performance than longer one and the temperature at the exit of the shorter monolith was relatively lower. On the contrary, the temperature was higher in the longer monolith and the lethal NOx emission was slightly increased.

Method and Materials: Clinical PET imaging is known to be limited by its low spatial resolution of approximately 4–10 mm. However, if the geometry of the source is known, the position of the sources can be determined with sub‐millimeter accuracy. We propose to apply this concept for real‐time tumor position tracking during radiotherapy. For pulmonary and abdominal tumors, delivering accurate radiation therapy is limited by the motion of the tumor as the patient breathes. By implanting positron emission markers into tumor, and using pairs of position‐sensitive detectors to track the resulting annihilation gamma rays, the position of the tumor can be tracked in real‐time with high accuracy. Positron emission based technique will deliver a lower radiation dose to normal tissue than x‐ray fluoroscopy, and the smaller size of the positron emission markers reduces risk to the patient during implantation. The concept and simulation study has been previously published (T. Xu et.al, Med. Phys. 33(7) p2598). In this feasibility study, the technique was evaluated using a clinical PET system (CTI ECAT). A Ge‐68 Linear source was used to simulate a point source in 2D slices during conventional 2D acquisition. The Ge‐68 source was put at 3 locations and the data were combined to simulate multiple (3) markers. Results: Three point sources were successfully localized using proposed technique. The localization precision ranges from 4 mm down to 0.2 mm when the number of coincident events used increases from 100 to 4100. The precession reaches 0.77 mm with only about 200 events from three point sources. Conclusion: The study has shown that multiple positron emission markers can be localized with sub‐millimeter precision, which is sufficient for tumor localization during radiotherapy. © 2007, American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

The deposit mainly occurs in the Jinding dome structure as tabular orebodies within breccia-bearing sandstones of the Palaeocene Yunlong Formation (autochthonous) and in the overlying sandstones of the Early Cretaceous Jingxing Formation (allochthonous). The deposit is not stratiform and no exhalative sedimentary rocks have been observed. The occurrence of the orebodies, presence of hangingwall alteration, and replacement and open-space filling textures all indicate an epigenetic origin. Formation of the Jinding Zn-Pb deposit is related to a period of major continental crust movement during the collision of the Indian and Eurasian Plates. The westward thrusts and dome structure were successively developed in the Palaeocene sedimentary rocks in the ore district, and Zn-Pb mineralisation appears to have taken place in the early stage of the doming processes. The study of fluid inclusions in sphalerite and associated gangue minerals (quartz, celestine, calcite and gypsum) shows that homogenisation temperatures ranged from 54 to 309 °C and cluster around 110 to 150 °C, with salinities of 1.6 to 18.0 wt.% NaCl equiv. Inert gas isotope studies from inclusions in ore- and gangue-minerals reveal 2.0 to 15.6% mantle He, 53% mantle Ne and a considerable amount of mantle Xe in the ore-forming fluids. The Pb-isotope composition of ores shows that the metal is mainly of mantle origin, mixed with a lesser amount of crustal lead. The widely variable and negative δ34S values of Jinding sulphides suggest that thermo-chemical or bacterial sulphate reduction produced reduced sulphur for deposition of the Zn-Pb sulphides. The mixing of a mantle-sourced fluid enriched in metals and CO2 with reduced sulphide-bearing saline formation water in a structural-lithologic trap may have been the key mechanism for the formation of the Jinding deposit. The Jinding deposit differs from known major types of sediment-hosted Zn-Pb deposits in the world, including sandstone-type (SST), Mississippi Valley type (MVT) and sedimentary-exhalative (SEDEX). Although the fine-grained ore texture and high Zn/Pb ratios are similar to those in SEDEX deposits, the Jinding deposit lacks any exhalative sedimentary rocks. Like MVT deposits, Jinding is characterised by simple mineralogy, epigenetic features and involvement of basinal brines in mineralisation, but its host rocks are mainly sandstones and breccia-bearing sandstones. The Jinding deposit is also different from SST deposits with its high Zn/Pb ratios, among other characteristics. Most importantly, the Jinding deposit was formed in an intracontinental terrestrial basin with an active tectonic history in relation to plate collision, and mantle-sourced fluids and metals played a major role in ore formation, which is not the case for SEDEX, MVT, and SST. We propose that Jinding represents a new type of sediment-hosted Zn-Pb deposit, named the 'Jinding type'. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We postulate the hypotheses that local governments have incentives to internalize the local external diseconomies caused by SO2 emissions, but not the global external diseconomies caused by CO2 emissions. To substantiate our hypotheses, we decompose emissions of SO2 and CO2 into two factors: the emission factor (i.e. emission per energy use) and energy consumption. The results show that the prefectures where past energy consumption was high tend to reduce the emission factor of SO2 significantly in Japan, while we do not find such a tendency in China. There is also evidence that neither per capita income nor past energy consumption affects the CO2 emission factor and energy consumption significantly in both Japan and China, implying that an individual country has few incentives to reduce CO2 emissions. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250766190

The physiologically active prokaryotic assemblage in this extreme environment showed a great genetic diversity. Most members of the microbial community appeared to be affiliated to yet uncultured organisms from similar ecosystems, i.e., deep-sea hypersaline basins and hydrothermal vents. The bacterial clone library was dominated by phylotypes affiliated with the epsilon-Proteobacteria subdivision recognized as an ecologically significant group of bacteria inhabiting deep-sea hydrothermal environments. Almost 18% of all bacterial clones were related to delta-Proteobacteria, suggesting that sulfate reduction is one of the dominant metabolic processes occurring in warm mud fluids. The remaining bacterial phylotypes were related to alpha- and beta-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroides, Deinococcus-Thermus, KB1 and OP-11 candidate divisions. Moreover, a novel monophyletic clade, deeply branched with unaffiliated 16S rDNA clones was also retrieved from deep-sea sediments and halocline of Urania Basin. Archaeal diversity was much lower and detected phylotypes included organisms affiliated exclusively with the Euryarchaeota. More than 96% of the archaeal clones belonged to the MSBL-1 candidate order recently found in hypersaline anoxic environments, such as endoevaporitic microbial mats, Mediterranean deep-sea mud volcanoes and anoxic basins. Two phylotypes, represented by single clones were related to uncultured groups DHVE-1 and ANME-1. Thus, the hydrothermal mud of hypersaline Urania Basin seems to contain new microbial diversity. The prokaryotic community was significantly different from that occurring in the upper layers of the Urania Basin since 60% of all bacterial and 40% of all archaeal phylotypes were obtained only from mud fluids. The uniqueness of the composition of the active prokaryotic community could be explained by the complex environmental conditions at the site. The interaction of oxygenated warm mud fluids with the cold hypersaline brine of the Urania Basin seems to simultaneously select for various metabolic processes, such as aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophy, sulfide- and methane-dependent chemotrophy along with anaerobic oxidation of methane, sulfate- and metal-reduction. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","16S rRNA; Deep-sea hypersaline anoxic basins; Hydrothermal mud fluids; Microbial community structure and function","archaeal DNA; archaeal RNA; ribosome RNA; RNA 16S; anoxic conditions; chemoautotrophy; cladistics; clone; deep-sea benthos; extremophile; heterotrophy; hydrothermal vent community; microbial community; oxidation; prokaryote; reduction; saline lake; sulfate; anoxia; article; chemistry; ecosystem; genetics; Mediterranean Sea; metabolism; microbiology; molecular cloning; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; Thermus; Anoxia; Cloning, Molecular; DNA, Archaeal; Ecosystem; Mediterranean Sea; Microbiology; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Archaeal; RNA, Ribosomal; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Thermus; Water Microbiology; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; South America; Urania; Actinobacteria; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroides; Bacteroides (class); Betaproteobacteria; Deinococcus; Deinococcus-Thermus; Deltaproteobacteria; Epsilonproteobacteria; Euryarchaeota; Prokaryota; Thermus; Urania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947156852

Various concepts exist for managing the energy use and CO2 emission. These concepts can be categorized into advancement in technologies, dissemination of energy saving measures in buildings, optimization of local energy generation and distribution systems, spatial building stock pattern management, and improvement in CO2 emission factor of the grid electricity. In this paper, we propose a modeling approach for energy use in the commercial sector in order to evaluate the options involved in the abovementioned energy management concepts in an integrated manner. In this modeling approach, a district is dealt with as a basic unit. Districts are first classified into several categories according to the spatial building stock pattern, or urban form. The end-use energy consumption per unit floor area is then calculated for each district category using a simulation of energy use in buildings in a representative district; this is used for quantifying the total end-use energy consumption at the municipal level. We carried out a case study in order to demonstrate the simulation capabilities and features of the suggested modeling approach in contrast with the conventional modeling approaches. In this case study, certain scenarios of CO2 abatement integrating the energy management concepts are applied in the commercial sector of Osaka city, Japan, in order to investigate alternative avenues toward which policy efforts must be directed. © 2007.","Commercial sector; Community energy management; Energy saving measure; Simulation model; Technology implementation scenario; Urban energy system","Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Energy conservation; Energy management; Gas emissions; Commercial sector; Community energy management; Energy saving measures; Technology implementation scenario; Urban energy system; Urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847744616

A simulation model based on the bottom-up approach - a fundamental part of the evaluation framework of technology implementation scenarios - provides insights into the changes required in all the components of urban energy systems from the equipment level to the entire building and systems level and finally to the neighborhood and city levels. This model is applied to the Yodoyabashi district, a central business district in Osaka, Japan, in order to predict the end-use energy consumption and CO2 emission under various scenarios.

The source-receptor relationships of the Lagrangian ""puff"" model of long-range transportation, ATMOS-N, were used to calculate the wet/dry deposition of the nitrogen (N) in Asia. Critical loads of N deposition in Asia were calculated from the relationships between the critical load of sulfur (S) and balance of N in and out using the data of S critical load of RAINS-ASIA. The cost functions of N reduction of Asian countries were derived by the regression analysis with the data of cost functions of European countries used in RAINS. In order to assess the environmental impact, the gaps between N deposition and critical load of N were calculated. The emission of NO x was reduced in some cases of this model, and the changes of gaps between N deposition and critical load were observed as well as the changes of the reduction cost. It is shown that a uniform reduction of NO x emissions by countries in Asia is not cost-effective strategy. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Acid deposition; Asia; Cost function; Critical load; Integrated assessment model; Nitrogen oxides; RAINS-ASIA","acid deposition; cost-benefit analysis; critical load; dry deposition; emission control; environmental assessment; environmental impact; integrated approach; long range transport; nitrogen oxides; wet deposition; Asia; Eurasia; Neptunia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247646470

For valence states, the width of the nonbonding states of N atoms increases when the concentration of N atoms is high, indicating that an inhomogeneous interface is formed. Thus, the excessive incorporation of nitrogen atoms at the SiO2/Si(100) interface decreases CBM and induces the formation of a more inhomogeneous interface, which decreases carrier mobility in the channel region. © 2007 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.","Interface; Oxynitride; Si(100); X-ray absorption; X-ray emission","Carrier mobility; Electronic structure; Silicon; X rays; Conduction band minimum (CBM); Metal-oxide-silicon devices; Nonbonding states; Silicon oxynitride; Soft X-ray absorption; Interfaces (materials)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547868152

Methods: Mortality data for five years (January 1990 to December 1994) were obtained from the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan. Data were used only if the deceased was 65 years old or older at the time of death, if death was attributed to intracerebral haemorrhage or ischaemic stroke, and if the deceased lived in one of 13 major urban areas. Hourly mean concentrations of PM7, NO2, and photochemical oxidants were measured at monitoring stations in the 13 areas. Time stratified case-crossover analysis was used to examine the data for evidence of triggering stroke mortality. Results: The 1-hour mean concentration of PM7 measured about 2 hours before death was associated with the risk of death due to intracerebral haemorrhage from April to September (odds ratio = 2.40, 95% CI 1.48 to 3.89, for exposure to PM7 of more than 200 μg/m3 (threshold)). The higher risk was independent of the 24-hour mean concentration of PM7. PM7 was not associated with death due to ischaemic stroke. Conclusions: Transiently high concentrations of PM7 are associated with death due to intracerebral haemorrhage. Air quality standards or guidelines for particulate matter should be based not only on 24-hour mean concentrations, but also on hourly data.",,"nitric oxide; air pollution; ambient air; article; brain hemorrhage; cerebrovascular accident; human; incidence; Japan; mortality; particulate matter; photochemical smog; pollution monitoring; priority journal; risk factor; seasonal variation; time of death; urban area; Aged; Air Pollutants; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Cerebrovascular Accident; Environmental Monitoring; Epidemiologic Methods; Humans; Japan; Seasons; Temperature; Time Factors; Urban Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846198100

Analyses in marine ecology found that the earth ecosystem could be able to complement nutrient silicon for keeping sustainable development of marine ecosystem, and decreasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere; as a result, the area of desertification would be enlarged. Modern human being activities have resulted in constant changes in the amount of silicon transport from land into sea, leading to oversupply of nitrogen and phosphorus but silicon in seawater. The proportion of nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon was seriously imbalanced and the limitation of silicon for phytoplankton growth has become more serious. The silicon deficiency has damaged the marine ecosystem in coastal regions and slowed down the carbon sedimentation in the atmosphere of the world. The authors believe that the continual discharge of CO2 into the atmosphere is the cause for the global warming including marine water temperature rise. Consequently, the earth ecosystem would have to trigger its complementary action to resume to the silicon balance by algae bloom in seawater for reducing air and water temperatures. In order to complement nutrient silicon into the sea, the ecosystem would transport silicon via the atmosphere; therefore, the desertification in the inner land is a natural reaction. As marine phytoplankton booming can reduce the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and further ease the green-house effect, during this process, a large amount of silicon are demanded by the ecosystem, which human being are unable to stop desertification from happening but slow down the progress and ease the risk. Therefore, as an important role in earth ecosystem, people should reduce the CO2 discharge into the atmosphere first; then, the normal function of river transporting silicon must be restored. In this way, the CO2 in the atmosphere can be kept in balance, the global warming slowed down, marine ecosystem development sustained, the drought in inner land eased, and the desert gradually under-controlled. © 2007 Science Press.","desertification; dust/sandstorm (DSS); earth ecosystem; marine ecosystem; silicon","algae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955431172

In order to investigate the interactive effects of [CO2] and N supply on rice quality, we conducted a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment at Wuxi, Jiangsu, China, in 2001-2003. A long-duration rice japonica with large panicle (cv. Wuxiangging 14) was grown at ambient or elevated (ca. 200 μmol mol-1 above ambient) [CO2] under three levels of N: low (LN, 15 g N m2), medium (MN, 25 g N m2) and high N (HN, 35 g N m2 (2002, 2003)). The MN level was similar to that recommended to local farmers. FACE significant increased rough (+12.8%), brown (+13.2%) and milled rice yield (+10.7%), while markedly reducing head rice yield (-13.3%); FACE caused serious deterioration of processing suitability (milled rice percentage -2.0%; head rice percentage -23.5%) and appearance quality (chalky grain percentage +16.9%; chalkiness degree +28.3%) drastically; the nutritive value of grains was also negatively influenced by FACE due to a reduction in protein (-6.0%) and Cu content (-20.0%) in milled rice. By contrast, FACE resulted in better eating/cooking quality (amylose content -3.8%; peak viscosity +4.5%, breakdown +2.9%, setback -27.5%). These changes in grain quality revealed that hardness of grain decreased with elevated [CO2] while cohesiveness and resilience increased when cooked. Overall, N supply had significant influence on rice yield with maximum value occurring at MN, whereas grain quality was less responsive to the N supply, showing trends of better appearance and eating/cooking quality for LN or MN-crops as compared with HN-crops. For most cases, no [CO2] × N interaction was detected for yield and quality parameters. These data suggested that the current recommended rates of N fertilization for rice production should not be modified under projected future [CO2] levels, at least for the similar conditions of this experiment. © 2007.","Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE); Global change; Quality; Rice grain; Yield","Crops; Growth kinetics; Nitrogen fixation; Photosynthesis; Global changes; Rice grains; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide enrichment; crop production; crop yield; fertilizer application; growth response; nitrogen; nutrient availability; photosynthesis; rice; Carbon Dioxide; Farm Crops; Nitrogen; Photosynthesis; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Jiangsu; Wuxi [Jiangsu]; Japonica; Oryza sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247389728

In this paper, mathematical modelling methods have been employed to simulate the operation of a 38 MWe straw-burning power plant to obtain detailed information on the flow and combustion characteristics in the furnace and to predict the effect on plant performance of variation in operating conditions. The predicted data are compared to measurements in terms of burning time, furnace temperature, flue gas emissions (including NOx), carbon content in the ash and overall combustion efficiency. It is concluded that straw burning on the grate is locally sub-stoichiometric and most of the NO is formed in the downstream combustion chamber and radiation shaft; auxiliary gas burners are responsible for the uneven distribution of temperature and gas flow at the furnace exit; and fuel moisture content is limited to below 25% to prevent excessive CO emission without compromising the plant performance.

High ground-level concentrations of ozone continue to be a serious problem in several US cities, and Atlanta is one of the most serious of these cases. In contrast to the ""trial and error"" approach utilized by state government decision-makers, our DMF searches for dynamic and focused control strategies that require a lower total reduction of emissions than current control strategies. Our DMF utilizes a rigorous stochastic dynamic programming formulation and includes an Atmospheric Chemistry Module to represent how ozone concentrations change over time. This paper focuses on the procedures within the Atmospheric Chemistry Module. Using the US EPA's Urban Airshed Model for Atlanta, we use mining and metamodeling tools to develop a computationally efficient representation of the relevant ozone air chemistry. The proposed approach is able to effectively model changes in ozone concentrations over a 24-hour period.","Data mining; Decision-making; Metamodeling; Ozone pollution; Stochastic dynamic programming; Urban airshed model","Computational efficiency; Decision trees; Dynamic programming; Emission control; Mathematical models; Ozone; Stochastic programming; Decision-making framework; Metamodeling; Data mining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947627075

A long-term experiment established in 1922 on an Aquic Eutrocryepts in South-eastern Norway was chosen to investigate the effects of long-term fertilization on S fractions in bulk soil and those associated with aggregates. Chloroform fumigation-extraction was used to determine Microbial biomass S (MBS) and the wet chemical analysis method was used to fractionate soil S into ester S (hydriodic acid reducible S), carbon-bonded S (Raney nickel reducible S) and residual S (Raney nickel non-reducible S). High farmyard manure (FYM) application resulted in higher MBS in bulk soil than nitrogen + potassium (NK) application, but it did not differ significantly from the control. Application of FYM at 60 Mg ha-1 resulted into accumulation of total S, total organic S and carbon-bonded S in bulk soils, while mineral fertilizer (nitrogen+phosphorus+potassium+sulfur [NPKS] and NK) and the medium rate of FYM did not increase the accumulation of total S and organic S fractions. The macroaggregate sizes (&gt;2 and 1-2 mm) and the finest aggregate size (&lt;0.106 mm) showed significantly greater total S concentration than other aggregate sizes. Ester S and residual S were predominant organic S fractions and they accounted for 39 to 52% and 38 to 51% of the organic S, respectively. The macroaggregate sizes (&gt;2 and 1-2 mm) contained the highest ester S, but microaggregates (&lt;0.106 mm) exhibited higher carbon-bonded S and residual S than other aggregates. In conclusion, the accumulation of S was dependent on fertilizer type, the rate of FYM application and aggregate sizes. © Soil Science Society of America.",,"Extraction; Fertilizers; Fractionation; Sulfur; Aggregate sizes; Macroaggregate sizes; Sulfur fractions; Soils; Extraction; Fertilizers; Fractionation; Soils; Sulfur; accumulation; biomass; experimental study; fertilizer application; macroaggregate; manure; microbial community; nutrient budget; silty loam; soil aggregate; sulfate (ester); sulfur cycle; Extraction; Fertilizers; Fractionation; Soil; Sulfur; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846818391

The goal is to investigate the impact of this catalytic system on emission characteristics and BSFC (break specific fuel consumption) across a broad engine speed and load operating region under diverse arrangement schemes of the new catalyst converter. It can be indicated from experimental results that the upstream placement of three way catalyst ahead of the NOx adsorber catalyst is the best solution, which gives rise to the highest converting efficiency to reduce the NOx emission level of the lean burn gasoline engine. The role of engine speed on exhaust emissions and fuel economy is also reflected by the periodic operating time of lean burn and rich burn as well as the time ratio between the two. Engine load has served as a major factor in affecting exhaust emission characteristics and fuel economy of the lean burn gasoline engine. The heavier the engine load, the higher the NOx emission level, the less the NOx converting efficiency and the lower the BSFC. This technology also has the potential to be applied to all other types of lean burn engines.","Adsorber-reduction catalyst; BSFC; Gasoline engine; Lean burn; NOX emission","catalysis; design; engine; exhaust emission; fuel; nitric oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42249088623

The spatial distribution and abundance of nematode species in forests reflect soil type, soil fertility, climate, canopy and understorey plant species, litter depth, forest age, and management. Nematodes may be important in forest nurseries; they occur throughout the rooting depth of forest trees; hyphal-feeding species may influence mycorrhizae; and insect-vectored Bursaphelenchus species are a quarantine risk. Nematode populations interact with those of other soil animals (e.g., mites, tardigrades, enchytraeids, and protozoa). The diversity and abundance of the nematode assemblage make nematodes a useful indicator of soil condition and soil processes. Information available from forest systems suggests that, as long as physical disturbance is minimized and remaining trees or herb layer moderate the microclimate, logging and other forestry operations have only transitory effects on nematode populations. Extreme disturbance, such as bulldozing and slash-and-burn management, can significantly reduce nematode abundance and diversity. In contrast, management that enhances growth of understorey or herb layer can stimulate nematode populations. Each of these changes can be related to changes in food resource availability and environmental conditions, such as soil temperature and moisture. Although details of soil nematode contributions to nutrient processes in forest soils are sparse, that their populations are maintained through cycles of moderate management practices suggest that their beneficial contributions will also be maintained. © 2007 NRC.",,"Forestry; Microbiology; Soils; Hyphal-feeding species; Microbial-feeding nematodes; Nematode populations; Biodiversity; abundance; forest management; forest soil; human activity; nematode; physical disturbance; resilience; soil biota; spatial distribution; species diversity; trophic level; Biodiversity; Forestry; Microbiology; Soil; Acari; Animalia; Bursaphelenchus; Enchytraeidae; Hexapoda; Nematoda; Protozoa; Tardigrada",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547423996

Data on mean daily temperature, daily maximum-minimum temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, rainfall and sky condition were obtained over a 10-month period, from August (2003) to June (2004). From the data analyzed, it was attempted to determine if there are any differences between the areas and what factors may influence the differences. For the mean temperature, urban area was found to be 1.7 and 0.7 °C warmer than rural and urban forest areas, respectively while urban forest is 1.0 °C warmer than rural. For relative humidity, urban area is drier 3.4% and 3.2% than rural and urban forest areas, respectively, whereas there is a difference of 0.2% between rural and urban forest areas in favor of rural area. Rural area is 0.9 and 0.8 m/s. windier than urban and urban forest areas, respectively while urban area is 0.1 m/s. windier than urban forest area.

Thus, efficient use of energy and sustainability has become a key issue for the most energy policies. Sustainability and energy saving terms take place in building construction industry too since buildings are one of the most significant energy consumers. It is known that heating energy demand of a building has a great rate in building total energy consumption. In addition to that, the most of the heating energy has been lost from building envelope. TS 825, Heating Energy Conservation Standard for Buildings in Turkey, aims the reducing of heat loss in buildings through the envelope. But within buildings, one of the fastest growing sources of new energy demand is cooling and especially in hot-humid and hot-dry climatic parts of Turkey cooling season is much longer than the heating season. Moreover in hot-dry climate heat storage capacity of the envelope becomes more important issue than heat insulation for energy efficiency of the building. Since the Turkish standard is considering only heating energy conservation by using degree-day concept, Istanbul and Mardin are considered in the same zone, however those are in temperate-humid and hot-dry climatic zones, respectively. In this study energy efficient design strategies for these climatic zones have been explained and thermal performance of two buildings, which are constructed according to the TS 825 in Mardin and Istanbul cities were evaluated to show the importance of thermal mass in hot-dry climates. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Even though that photoluminescence experiments indicated that 95% of the photogenerated excitions were dissociated in the blend, the external quantum efficiency reached only 31%. Thus more than 2/3 of the dissociated excitons were lost for the energy conversion. In order to identify the processes which limit the photovoltaic efficiency of polymer-blend solar cells, studies on the steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence of the individual polymer and polymer blend were performed. In the polymer-blend layer, we observed a considerable long-wavelength emission due to exciplex formation. The exciplex emission can be reduced by thermal annealing. At the same time the IPCE of the blend-based device increased, indicating a more efficient generation of free-charge carriers.

In their own ways, all of these researchers have begun the search for robust strategies that are designed to take advantage of new understanding of the climate systems as it evolves – an approach that is easily motivated by concerns about the possibility of abrupt climate change summarized by, among others, Alley et al. (2002). These concerns take on increased importance when read in the light of recent surveys which suggest that the magnitude of climate impacts (see, for example, Smith and Hitz [2003]) and/or the likelihood of abrupt change (IPCC, 2001; Schneider, 2003; Schlesinger et al., 2005) could increase dramatically if global mean temperatures rose more than 2 or 3 °C above pre-industrial levels. Neither of these suggestions can be advanced with high confidence, of course, but that is the point.

Carbon credits are gained from reforestation and afforestation activities in developing countries. Bangladesh, a densely populated tropical country in South Asia, has a huge degraded forestland which can be reforested by CDM projects. To realize the potential of the forestry sector in developing countries for full-scale emission mitigation, the carbon sequestration potential of different species in different types of plantations should be integrated with the carbon trading system under the CDM of the Kyoto Protocol. This paper discusses the prospects and problems of carbon trading in Bangladesh, in relation to the CDM, in the context of global warming and the potential associated consequences. The paper analyzes the effects of reforestation projects on carbon sequestration in Bangladesh, in general, and in the hilly Chittagong region, in particular, and concludes by demonstrating the carbon trading opportunities. Results showed that tree tissue in the forests of Bangladesh stored 92 tons of carbon per hectare (tC/ha), on average. The results also revealed a gross stock of 190 tC/ha in the plantations of 13 tree species, ranging in age from 6 to 23 years. The paper confirms the huge atmospheric CO2 offset by the forests if the degraded forestlands are reforested by CDM projects, indicating the potential of Bangladesh to participate in carbon trading for both its economic and environmental benefit. Within the forestry sector itself, some constraints are identified; nevertheless, the results of the study can expedite policy decisions regarding Bangladesh's participation in carbon trading through the CDM. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, further expansion is under consideration in line with meeting the Kyoto Protocol target of carbon sequestration. In this paper, we conducted evaluation analyses of carbon sequestration and subsidy effects within the optimization framework for the forest stand management. The optimal forest stand management model called Dynamic Programming model for Kyushu Stand Simulator (DP-KYSS) was utilized for the analysis of the target sugi (Cryptomeria japonia) forest stand in the Kyushu region, Japan. Our results showed that the thinning subsidy was effective to stimulate thinning activities at the eligible age class for the subsidy, and that 20% of the current or proposed payment was appropriate to give an incentive to forest owners for conducting the same optimal thinning regime. The amount of carbon sequestered in remaining trees at final harvest was not always shown to increase over time. Depending upon the subsidy condition, it could decrease. The average annual amount of carbon sequestered under no subsidy showed its maximum at age 35, while under the other subsidy conditions, it was shortened to age 25. The net present value of cost per unit carbon loss associated with subsidy became the highest for the rotation age of 35 years for all subsidy policies considered here. © Springer-Verlag 2007.",,"carbon sequestration; forest management; harvesting; optimization; thinning; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Japan; Kyushu; Cryptomeria; Cryptomeria japonica; Japonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947659464

Virtual amorphous SiO2 membranes were prepared by the melt-quench method utilizing modified Born-Mayer-Huggins (BMH) pair potential and Stillinger-Weber (SW) three-body interactions. A dual control plane non-equilibrium MD (DCP-NEMD) technique was employed to simulate gas permeation phenomena under a constant upstream pressure, in which the permeating molecules were modeled as Lennard-Jones particles. The dependencies of the permeance of helium and CO2 molecules on temperature and pore size were examined. For cylindrical pores about 8 and 6 Å in diameter, the calculated temperature dependencies for the permeance of helium molecules were similar to the tendencies predicted by the normal Knudsen permeation mechanism, while in the case of CO2 permeation, a temperature dependency larger than helium and a significant deviation from the Knudsen mechanism were observed. The deviation was more obvious for the smaller 6 Å pore model. A simple gas permeation model that takes the effect of the pore wall potential field into consideration satisfactorily explained the permeation properties of CO2 in the high temperature region. The permeation mechanism was also examined from the viewpoint of the lateral potential and density distribution in a micropore. The values for the potential within micropores, predicted from the observed temperature dependencies of the gas permeation rate and using the simple gas permeation model, were in good agreement with the depth of the potential field resulting from the given potential parameters. The findings also indicate that the density (pressure) difference in a micropore between the pore entrance and exit, which could be enhanced by an attractive pore wall potential, might be the true driving force for permeation, particularly in the high temperature region. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

These decisions have important ramifications, as recent research indicates that soil sequestration of carbon may have the potential to reduce the need for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The EU ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2002, but chose not to use soil sequestration of carbon in its strategy to address climate change, and has excluded it from the EU's new carbon market. The EU's strategy can be explained by uncertainties surrounding soil sequestration and by the importance of its international leadership on climate change. In contrast, the United States has not ratified the KP, but is encouraging the use of soil carbon sequestration on a modest level, through its agricultural policy and research. There is some trading taking place using soil sequestration in the weak US market for carbon, partially due to US freedom from international protocols on this method of greenhouse gas reduction. As both the science and international protocols for carbon sequestration advance, the EU may reconsider the use of agricultural sequestration of carbon as a means for achieving its Kyoto Protocol commitments. © The Agricultural Ecomomics Society and the European Association of Agricultural Economists 2007.",,"agricultural policy; agricultural soil; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; European Union; greenhouse gas; Kyoto Protocol; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248140723

This system can provide insights for policymakers into where and the extent of the potentials, for lawmakers into whether the current legal incentives are sufficient to encourage private investment, and for investors into whether investments in exploiting local renewable energy sources are economically feasible. Under the current incentive framework in Taiwan, the amortization periods of investment on renewable energy are generally longer than the period over which the investment is to be recovered. This presents an unfavorable condition for attracting investments to and for developing renewable energy.

In order to examine the effect of one of the most influencing variables, the water table depth, on NEE the general ecosystem model GUESS-ROMUL was modified to predict mire daily CO2 exchange rates. A simulation was conducted for a lawn, the most common microtopographical feature of boreal oligotrophic minerotrophic mires. The results were validated against eddy covariance CO2 flux measurements from Degerö Stormyr, northern Sweden, obtained during the period 2001-2003. Both measurements and model simulations revealed that CO2 uptake was clearly controlled by interactions between water table depth and temperature. Maximum uptake occurred when the water table level was between 10 and 20 cm and the air temperature was above 15°C. When the water table was higher, the CO2 uptake rate was lower, owing to reduced rates of photosynthetic carbon fixation. When the water table was lower, NEE decreased owing to the increased rate of decomposition of organic matter. When the water table level was between 10 and 20 cm, the NEE was quite stable and relatively insensitive to both changes within this range and any air temperature changes above +15°C. The optimal water table level range for NEE corresponds to that characteristic of mire lawn plant communities, indicating that the annual NEE will not change dramatically if climatic conditions remain within the optimal range for the current plant community.

The Moon-forming impact left Earth enveloped in a hot silicate atmosphere that cooled and condensed over 1,000 yrs. As it cooled the Earth degassed its volatiles into the atmosphere. It took another ∼2 Myrs for the magma ocean to freeze at the surface. The cooling rate was determined by atmospheric thermal blanketing. Tidal heating by the new Moon was a major energy source to the magma ocean. After the mantle solidified geothermal heat became climatologically insignificant, which allowed the steam atmosphere to condense, and left behind a ∼100 bar, ∼500 K CO2 atmosphere. Thereafter cooling was governed by how quickly CO2 was removed from the atmosphere. If subduction were efficient this could have taken as little as 10 million years. In this case the faint young Sun suggests that a lifeless Earth should have been cold and its oceans white with ice. But if carbonate subduction were inefficient the CO2 would have mostly stayed in the atmosphere, which would have kept the surface near ∼500 K for many tens of millions of years. Hydrous minerals are harder to subduct than carbonates and there is a good chance that the Hadean mantle was dry. Hadean heat flow was locally high enough to ensure that any ice cover would have been thin (&lt;5 m) in places. Moreover hundreds or thousands of asteroid impacts would have been big enough to melt the ice triggering brief impact summers. We suggest that plate tectonics as it works now was inadequate to handle typical Hadean heat flows of 0.2-0.5 W/m 2. In its place we hypothesize a convecting mantle capped by a ∼100 km deep basaltic mush that was relatively permeable to heat flow. Recycling and distillation of hydrous basalts produced granitic rocks very early, which is consistent with preserved &gt;4 Ga detrital zircons. If carbonates in oceanic crust subducted as quickly as they formed, Earth could have been habitable as early as 10-20 Myrs after the Moon-forming impact. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Hadean Earth; Late heavy bombardment; Magma oceans; Moon-forming impact; Origin of Earth; Planetary atmospheres","Carbon dioxide; Earth atmosphere; Geothermal heating; Moon; Hadean Earth; Late heavy bombardment; Magma oceans; Moon forming impact; Origin of Earth; Planetary atmospheres; Planets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548073865

Fuel cells promise to provide clean and renewable source of energy, which can operate on many fuels. They are promising candidates for transportation and portable power source applications. These applications include battery replacement for potable telephones and computers, power sources in remote areas, etc. Fuel cells can also work using other fuels such as hydrocarbons including methanol either directly or indirectly. Since there is plenty of hydrocarbons resources available in the Gulf region such as gasoline, naphtha, and methane/natural gas etc., they can be utilized in the fuel cell to produce clean power without combustion. There has been tremendous research effort in other parts of the world, especially the Western world for the development of fuel cells. Research at KFUPM is focused on two different aspects, fuel for fuel cells (reformat feed) and PEM fuel cell system. Our research group at KFUPM is actively involved in fuel cell research since 1980s. Current focus is to develop PEM fuel cell system emphasizing three different aspects: (A) developing novel low cost proton conducting membranes, (B) developing multifunctional catalyst system and (C) development of hydrocarbon based fuel processing systems.

K1A 1M1, Canada","The widespread use of fossil fuels within the current energy infrastructure is considered as the largest source of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide, which is largely blamed for global warming and climate change. At the current state of development, the risks and costs of non-fossil energy alternatives, such as nuclear, biomass, solar, and wind energy, are so high that they cannot replace the entire share of fossil fuels in the near future timeframe. Additionally, any rapid change towards non-fossil energy sources, even if possible, would result in large disruptions to the existing energy supply infrastructure. As an alternative, the existing and new fossil fuel-based plants can be modified or designed to be either ""capture"" or ""capture-ready"" plants in order to reduce their emission intensity through the capture and permanent storage of carbon dioxide in geological formations. This would give the coal-fired power generation units the option to sustain their operations for longer time, while meeting the stringent environmental regulations on air pollutants and carbon emissions in years to come. Currently, there are three main approaches to capturing CO2 from the combustion of fossil fuels, namely, pre-combustion capture, post-combustion capture, and oxy-fuel combustion. Among these technology options, oxy-fuel combustion provides an elegant approach to CO2 capture. In this approach, by replacing air with oxygen in the combustion process, a CO2-rich flue gas stream is produced that can be readily compressed for pipeline transport and storage. In this paper, we propose a new approach that allows air to be partially used in the oxy-fired coal power plants. In this novel approach, the air can be used to carry the coal from the mills to the boiler (similar to the conventional air-fired coal power plants), while O2 is added to the secondary recycle flow as well as directly to the combustion zone (if needed). From a practical point of view, this approach eliminates problems with the primary recycle and also lessens concerns about the air leakage into the system. At the same time, it allows the boiler and its back-end piping to operate under slight suction; this avoids the potential danger to the plant operators and equipment due to possible exposure to hot combustion gases, CO2 and particulates. As well, by integrating oxy-fuel system components and optimizing the overall process over a wide range of operating conditions, an optimum or near-optimum design can be achieved that is both cost-effective and practical for large-scale implementation of oxy-fired coal power plants. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It is the first continent-wide cap-and-trade scheme that has been put in place and several aspects of the implementation of the scheme created a formidable challenge for authorities at European and national level. Never before has an EU environmental policy created an economic asset whose annual value runs into the tens of billions of Euros and has set up a process of shared tasks among the European and national levels to organise the distribution of these valuable assets to private economic actors. In this chapter we look at the first allocation round from the European perspective. We do this by outlining the allocation process and rules (Section 2), discussing the challenges faced in developing the first allocation plans (Section 3), describing the role of Commission guidance (Section 4) and reviewing the Commission's assessment of plans (Section 5). In Section 6 we describe the key factors that influenced and shaped the first round allocation process, followed by conclusions in the final section. The allocation process and rules in Directive 2003/87/EC Allocation is governed by Articles 9 to 11 and Annex III of Directive 2003/87/EC (European Community 2003). Article 9(1) provides that each Member State has to draw up a National Allocation Plan in advance of each trading period. This provision implies a wide delegation of tasks to fix the details of allocation arrangements to the national level. © Cambridge University Press 2007 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928298643

We review the most significant properties of planetary radio emissions (auroral as well as satellite induced) and show that their primary engine is the interaction of a plasma flow with an obstacle in the presence of a strong magnetic field (of the flow or of the obstacle). Scaling laws have been derived from solar system planetary radio emissions that relate the emitted radio power to the power dissipated in the various corresponding flow-obstacle interactions. We generalize these scaling laws into a ""radio-magnetic"" scaling law that seems to relate output radio power to the magnetic energy flux convected on the obstacle, this obstacle being magnetized or unmagnetized. Extrapolating this scaling law to the case of exoplanets, we find that hot Jupiters may produce very intense radio emissions due to either magnetospheric interaction with a strong stellar wind or to unipolar interaction between the planet and a magnetic star (or strongly magnetized regions of the stellar surface). In the former case, similar to the magnetosphere-solar wind interactions in our solar system or to the Ganymede-Jupiter interaction, a hecto-decameter emission is expected in the vicinity of the planet with an intensity possibly 103-105 times that of Jupiter's low frequency radio emissions. In the latter case, which is a giant analogy of the Io-Jupiter system, emission in the decameter-to-meter wavelength range near the footprints of the star's magnetic field lines interacting with the planet may reach 106 times that of Jupiter (unless some ""saturation"" mechanism occurs). The system of HD179949, where a hot spot has been tentatively detected in visible light near the sub-planetary point, is discussed in some details. Radio detectability is addressed with present and future low-frequency radiotelescopes. Finally, we discuss the interests of direct radio detection, among which access to exoplanetary magnetic field measurements and comparative magnetospheric physics. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

As part of an ongoing effort to improve heavy-ion transport codes that will be used in designing future spacecraft and habitats, fragmentation cross sections of 28Si have been measured using beams with extracted energies from 290 A to 1200 A  MeV, spanning most of the peak region of the energy distribution of silicon ions in the GCR. Results were obtained for six elemental targets: hydrogen, carbon, aluminum, copper, tin, and lead. The charge-changing cross sections are found to be energy-independent within the experimental uncertainties, except for those on the hydrogen target. Cross sections for the production of the heaviest fragments are found to decrease slightly with increasing energy for lighter targets, but increase with energy for tin and lead targets. The cross sections are compared to previous measurements at similar energies, and to predictions of the NUCFRG2 model used by NASA to evaluate radiation exposures in flight. For charge-changing cross sections, reasonable agreement is found between the present experiment and those of Webber et al. and Flesch et al., and NUCFRG2 agrees with the data to within 3% in most cases. Fragment cross sections show less agreement between experiments, and there are substantial differences between NUCFRG2 predictions and the data. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of O 3 depend on the maturity-related physiological state of the plant, therefore adult and young forest trees might react differently. To test the applicability of young beech plants for studying the effects of O3 on forest trees and forest stands, beech seedlings were planted in containers and exposed for two years in the Kranzberg forest FACOS experiment (Free-Air Canopy O3 Exposure System, http://www. casiroz.de) to enhanced ozone concentration regime (ambient [control] and double ambient concentration, not exceeding 150 ppb) under different light conditions (sun and shade). After two growing seasons the biomass of the above- and below-ground parts, beech roots (using WinRhizo programme), anatomical and molecular (ITS-RFLP and sequencing) identification of ectomycorrhizal types and nutrient concentrations were assessed. The mycorrhization of beech seedlings was very low (ca. 5% in shade, 10% in sun-grown plants), no trends were observed in mycorrhization (%) due to ozone treatment. The number of Cenococcum geophilum type of ectomycorrhiza, as an indicator of stress in the forest stands, was not significantly different under different ozone treatments. It was predominantly occurring in sun-exposed plants, while its majority share was replaced by Genea hispidula in shade-grown plants. Different light regimes significantly influenced all parameters except shoot/ root ratio and number of ectomycorrhizal types. In the ozone fumigated plants the number of types, number of root tips per length of 1 to 2 mm root diameter, root length density per volume of soil and concentration of Mg were significantly lower than in control plants. Trends to a decrease were found in root, shoot, leaf, and total dry weights, total number of root tips, number of vital mycorrhizal root tips, fine root (mass) density, root tip density per surface, root area index, concentration of Zn, and Ca/Al ratio. Due to the general reduction in root growth indices and nutrient cycling in ozone-fumigated plants, alterations in soil carbon pools could be predicted. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.","Beech; Biomass; Ectomycorrhizal types; Fine root growth; Light exposure; Nutrient concentration; Ozone fumigation","ozone; air exposure; bioindicator; biomass allocation; deciduous tree; ectomycorrhiza; fine root; growth response; light effect; magnesium; molecular analysis; nutrient cycling; ozone; physiological response; soil carbon; symbiont; article; beech; biodiversity; biomass; drug effect; growth, development and aging; infection control; light; microbiology; mycorrhiza; radiation exposure; Biodiversity; Biomass; Fagus; Fumigation; Light; Mycorrhizae; Ozone; Bavaria; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Germany; Kranzberg Forest; Cenococcum geophilum; Fagus; Genea; Hispidula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047161883

In the present study, CCSRA of the combustion-derived polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) present in the atmosphere of the countries of the former republic of Yugoslavia was performed. The carbon stable isotope composition (δ13C) of PAHs varied between -27.68 and -27.19%, whereas Δ4C values ranged from -568%o for PAHs sampled in Kosovo to -288% for PAHs sampled in the Sarajevo area. The application of an isotopic mass balance model to these Δ4C data revealed a significant contribution (35-65%) from the combustion of non-fossil material to the atmospheric PAH pollution, even in urban and industrialized areas. Furthermore, consistency was observed between the isotopic composition of PAHs obtained by high-volume sampling and those collected by passive sampling. This encourages the use of passive samplers for CCSRA applications.

Cruises were conducted along a transect crossing the frontal area during spring and late summer. Biomass and production of autotrophs were measured by size fractionation and heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates were also studied. Copepod biomass, production and grazing impact on the phytoplankton and ciliate populations were estimated. The copepod community was sampled with a 45 μm net to include the smallest species and their developmental stages. The size, structure and distribution of the phytoplankton imply that most carbon was fixed by picoplankton during both seasons and throughout the study area. The partitioning of carbon among the different plankton compartments was not a broad-based pyramid and the biomass of heterotrophs was higher than that of autotrophs, except in the non-frontal region during spring. Copepod biomass was substantially higher in the frontal area. Our results showed that the small-sized copepods (calanoids and cyclopoids) dominated in terms of biomass and production, but also had a greater influence on the efficiency of the trophic coupling between the primary producers and the protozooplankton than the larger species, stressing their importance in the northern Aegean Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean in general. © The Author 2007.

The annual concentration of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm (PM10), ranging from 141 to 166 μg m- 3 in 2000-2004, could be very harmful to human health. In this paper, we presented the mortality and morbidity effects of PM10 pollution based on statistical data and the epidemiological exposure-response function. The economic costs to health during the 5 years were estimated to lie between US$1670 and $3655 million annually, accounting for about 6.55% of Beijing's gross domestic product each year. The total costs were apportioned into two parts caused by: the local emissions and long-range transported pollution. The contribution from local emissions dominated the total costs, accounting on average for 3.60% of GDP. However, the contributions from transported pollution cannot be neglected, and the relative percentage to the total costs from the other regions could account for about 45%. An energy policy and effective measures should be proposed to reduce particulate matter, especially PM2.5 pollution in Beijing to protect public health.

This study illustrates an upscaling approach to studying the spatiotemporal pattern of ecosystem processes in the Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve in northeastern China by integrating simulation modeling, GIS, remote sensing data, and field-based observations. The ecosystem model incorporated processes of energy transfer, plant physiology, carbon dynamics, and water cycling. Using a direct extrapolation scheme, the patch-level ecosystem model was scaled up to quantify the landscape-level pattern of primary productivity and the carbon source-sink relationship. The simulated net primary productivity (NPP) for the entire landscape, consisting of several ecosystem types, was 0.680 kg C m-2 yr-1. The most widely distributed ecosystem type in this region was the mixed broad-leaved and Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) forest, which had the highest NPP (1.084 kg C m-2 yr-1). The total annual NPP for all ecosystem types combined was estimated to be 1.332 Mt C yr-1. These results suggest that the Changbai Mountain landscape as a whole was a carbon sink, with a net carbon sequestration rate of about 0.884 Mt C yr-1 for the study period. The simulated NPP agreed reasonably well with available field measurements at a number of locations within the study landscape. Our study provides new insight into the relationship between landscape pattern and ecosystem processes, and useful information for improving management practices in the Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve, which is one of the most important forested landscapes in China. Several research needs are discussed to further refine the modeling approach and reduce prediction uncertainties. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Biogeochemical cycles; Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve; Ecosystem modeling; Extrapolation; Landscape pattern; Net primary productivity; Scaling","biogeochemical cycle; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; climate change; ecological impact; ecosystem modeling; GIS; integrated approach; land use; landscape structure; net primary production; remote sensing; upscaling; Asia; Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve; China; Eurasia; Far East; Jilin; Pinus koraiensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846634925

The evolution is marked by the changes of regional aridity/humidity contrasts. The contrasts occur between the south and the north part of China in the Eocene, and then between East China and Central Asia near the Oligocene/Miocene boundary, indicating the onset of monsoon-dominant climate in China. The impacts of the Himalaya-Tibetan plateau uplift and/or the Paratethys Sea retreat on the Asian monsoon have been well demonstrated. However, whether or not other factors have affected the above reorganization of paleoclimatic patterns remains a question to be addressed. Additional factors that should be addressed at least include the Indian Peninsular drift, the South China Sea expansion and the East China Sea transgression. Here we use the IAP-AGCM to explore their roles in the above paleoclimatic evolution. Our experiments demonstrate that the South China Sea expansion is another major forcing, in addition to the important roles of the Paratethys retreat and the Himalaya-Tibetan plateau uplift. On the contrary the impacts of the Indian Peninsular drift and the East China Sea transgression are relatively subordinate. The Himalaya-Tibetan plateau uplift plays a crucial role in the magnification of the aridity/humidity contrasts between the south and the north part of China. The Paratethys retreat, the Himalaya-Tibetan plateau uplift and the South China Sea expansion coact to cause the formation of the aridity/humidity contrasts between East China and Central Asia. The retreat and the uplift favor the dynamic condition, and the expansion provides the water vapor condition for the monsoon-dominant climate in China. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Changes in land-use are likely to alter such balance, resulting in different carbon stores under different land-use types in addition to the impacts of global climate change. In an agro-pastoral ecotone of Inner Mongolia, northern China, we investigated productivity and belowground carbon and nitrogen stores under six different types of land-uses, namely free grazing (FG), grazing exclusion (GE), mowing (MW), corn plantation (CP), fallow (FL), and alfalfa pasture (AP), and their impacts on litter and fine roots in semiarid grassland ecosystems. We found that there were great variations in aboveground net primary production (ANPP) across the six land-use types, with CP having markedly high ANPP; the FG had significantly reduced soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen stores (SON) to 100 cm depth compared with all other types of land uses, while very little litter accumulation was found on sites of the FG and CP. The top 20 cm of soils accounted for about 80% of the root carbon and nitrogen, with very little roots being found below 50 cm. About 60% of SOC and SON were stored in the top 30 cm layer. Land-use change altered the inputs of organic matters, thus affecting SOC and SON stores accordingly; the MW and GE sites had 59 and 56% more SOC and 61% more SON than the FG. Our estimation suggested that restoring severely degraded and overgrazed grasslands could potentially increase SOC and SON stores by more than 55%; conversion from the native grasses to alfalfa could potentially double the aboveground biomass production, and further increase SOC and SON stores by more than 20%. Our study demonstrated significant carbon and nitrogen storage potential of the agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China through land-use changes and improved management in the context of mitigating global climate change. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Agro-pastoral ecotone; Grassland; Land-use; Productivity; SOC; SON","carbon sequestration; ecotone; global climate; grassland; land type; land use change; net primary production; semiarid region; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; soil organic matter; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Nei Monggol; Medicago sativa; Poaceae; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846418049

In this paper, the flow field and the emission field of VOCs from the surface of building materials in a Field and Laboratory Emission Cell (FLEC) cavity are examined by 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis. The flow field within the FLEC cavity is laminar. With a total flow of 250 ml/min, the air velocity near the test material surface ranges from 0.1 to 4.5 cm/s. Three types of emission from building materials are studied here: (i) emission phenomena controlled by internal diffusion, (ii) emission phenomena controlled by external diffusion, and (iii) emission phenomena controlled by mixed diffusion (internal + external diffusion). In the case of internal diffusion material, with respect to the concentration distribution in the cavity, the local VOC emission rate becomes uniform and the FLEC works well. However, in the case of evaporation type (external diffusion) material, or mixed type materials (internal + external diffusion) when the resistance to transporting VOCs in the material is small, the FLEC is not suitable for emission testing because of the thin FLEC cavity. In this case, the mean emission rate is restricted to a small value, since the VOC concentration in the cavity rises to the same value as the surface concentration through molecular diffusion within the thin cavity, and the concentration gradient normal to the surface becomes small. The diffusion field and emission rate depend on the cavity concentration and on the Loading Factor. That is, when the testing material surface in the cavity is partially sealed to decrease the Loading Factor, the emission rate become higher with the decrease in the exposed area of the testing material. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard.","Air change rate; Emission rate; Flow field; Loading Factor; Mass transfer; VOCs","organic compound; air; air pollutant; article; building material; diffusion; indoor air pollution; theoretical model; volatilization; Air Movements; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Construction Materials; Diffusion; Models, Theoretical; Organic Chemicals; Volatilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249717312

Time series gene expression analyses of Lactococcus lactis MG1363 and L. lactis MG1363ΔccpA using DNA microarrays were used to define the CcpA regulon of L. lactis. Based on a comparison of the transcriptome data with putative CcpA binding motifs (cre sites) in promoter sequences in the genome of L. lactis, 82 direct targets of CcpA were predicted. The main differences in time-dependent expression of CcpA-regulated genes were differences between the exponential and transition growth phases. Large effects were observed for carbon and nitrogen metabolic genes in the exponential growth phase. Effects on nucleotide metabolism genes were observed primarily in the transition phase. Analysis of the positions of putative cre sites revealed that there is a link between either repression or activation and the location of the cre site within the promoter region. Activation was observed when putative cre sites were located upstream of the hexameric -35 sequence at an average position of -56.5 or further upstream with decrements of 10.5 bp. Repression was observed when the cre site was located in or downstream of putative -35 and -10 sequences. The highest level of repression was observed when the cre site was present at a defined side of the DNA helix relative to the canonical -10 sequence. Gel retardation experiments, Northern blotting, and enzyme assays showed that CcpA represses its own expression and activates the expression of the divergently oriented prolidase-encoding pepQ gene, which constitutes a link between regulation of carbon metabolism and regulation of nitrogen metabolism.

Fine particulate matter - particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) - concentrations were measured in the central plaza of the community and in three microenvironments in the home (next to the stove, in the kitchen away from the stove, and outdoor patio). Forty-eight hour mean PM2.5 concentrations in homes that burned wood in open fires were 693 μg/m3 (95% CI: 246-1338) near the stove, 658 μg/m3 (95% CI: 67-1448) in the kitchen away from the stove, and 94 μg/m3 (95% CI: 36-236) on the patio. Mean ambient 24-h concentrations in the main plaza of the community were 59 μg/m3 (95% CI: 29-92). Paired measurements before and after the installation of the Patsari improved wood-burning stove indicate a median 71% reduction in PM2.5 concentrations near the stove and 58% reductions in kitchen concentrations, whereas patio and main plaza concentrations remain unaffected. Only 44% of participants reported to use their Patsari stoves exclusively during the transition period.

Launched on 12 August 2005, the orbiter successfully entered Mars orbit on 10 March 2006 and finished aerobraking on 30 August 2006. Now in its near-polar, near-circular, low-altitude (∼300 km), 3 p.m. orbit, the spacecraft is operating its payload of six scientific instruments throughout a one-Mars-year Primary Science Phase (PSP) of global mapping, regional survey, and targeted observations. Eight scientific investigations were chosen for MRO, two of which use either the spacecraft accelerometers or tracking of the spacecraft telecom signal to acquire data needed for analysis. Six instruments, including three imaging systems, a visible-near infrared spectrometer, a shallow-probing subsurface radar, and a thermal-infrared profiler, were selected to complement and extend the capabilities of current working spacecraft at Mars. Whether observing the atmosphere, surface, or subsurface, the MRO instruments are designed to achieve significantly higher resolution while maintaining coverage comparable to the current best observations. The requirements to return higher-resolution data, to target routinely from a low-altitude orbit, and to operate a complex suite of instruments were major challenges successfully met in the design and build of the spacecraft, as well as by the mission design. Calibration activities during the seven-month cruise to Mars and limited payload operations during a three-day checkout prior to the start of aerobraking demonstrated, where possible, that the spacecraft and payload still had the functions critical to the science mission. Two critical events, the deployment of the SHARAD radar antenna and the opening of the CRISM telescope cover, were successfully accomplished in September 2006. Normal data collection began 7 November 2006 after solar conjunction. As part of its science mission, MRO will also aid identification and characterization of the most promising sites for future landed missions, both in terms of safety and in terms of the scientific potential for future discovery. Ultimately, MRO data will advance our understanding of how Mars has evolved and by which processes that change occurs, all within a framework of identifying the presence, extent, and role of water in shaping the planet's climate over time.

Mr. Harper called it dream that could truly change the world. Mr. Stelmach has set up a committee to look at the advantage, disadvantages, and costs of expanding the process to a large scale. According to Mr. Renner, the committee will also look at who would foot the bill for the pipeline, noting that if governments impose additional costs upon industry, those costs eventually will float down and be borne by the consumer. The carbon pipeline is one of a number of initiatives the province is considering to reduce greenhouse gases, with the help of a $156-million grant announced in March by Mr. Harper.

Targeting emissions' intensity rather than emissions themselves has also been criticized. Emissions' intensity is the ratio of greenhouse gas per unit of output, and means that while emissions will not be able to grow as much as they have in the past, the total level will not necessarily decrease.

But to realize this potential, a number of policy steps must be taken. This report puts forward concrete policy proposals for the EU to encourage the development of a KBBE. Of primary importance is the need to develop policy coherently across the EU and to coordinate its implementation. There are many policy strands and activities which relate to biotechnology (e.g., biofuels, research and innovation, climate change, sustainable development, Common Agricultural Policy [CAP] reform, Environmental Technologies Action Plan [ETAP]); these must be harmonized for consistency and efficiency. Appointment of a KBBE coordinator by the Commission to bring together activities in the various Directorates General (DGs) is essential. At the same time, a KBBE task force is needed to coordinate EU member state programs. It is equally important that the policy be based on sound evidence. Data gathering, collation, and analysis underpin the whole process: Good policy cannot be formulated without good data. At the other end of the policy-making process, a comprehensive roadmap is needed to chart the way towards the biobased economy and allow both coherent implementation and good impact evaluation. With the enabling policy framework in place, full support then has to be given to innovation in biotechnology in general, and white biotechnology in particular. This is a research-driven activity, and Europe must build upon its strengths in the area. This means, in particular, ensuring that the various relevant Strategic Research Agendas (SRAs) from the KBBE-related Technology Platforms (particularly Sustainable Chemistry, Plants for the Future, Forestry, and Biofuels) are properly planned, funded, and implemented within the Framework 7 program and at member state level through, for instance, the European Research Area Network (ERA-Net). Within this context, it is important to foster the synergies among the various participating sectors, for example, by stimulating publicprivate partnership and industry participation in general, promoting interdisciplinary research, and striving to avoid fragmentation and duplication of programs. This cooperation must also extend downstream to demonstration projects, in particular, to enable the development of flexible, research-oriented pilot plants to validate the concept of integrated and diversified biorefineries. Appropriate funding schemes will be needed to allow multicompany consortia to collaborate in such precompetitive activities (first-of-kind biorefmeries). Moving beyond the research phase, there are practical steps which can be taken to facilitate the move towards bioprocessing in manufacturing. A necessary prerequisite is the assurance of a secure and affordable supply of biomass, for which a combination of policy, innovation, and financial incentives will be needed. With the supply of feedstock assured, conversion of existing industrial processes to biobased ones can be encouraged through streamlined regulatory processes (akin to the Fast Track system used by the US Environmental Protection Agency), assessing the opportunities for biobased processes and products to contribute and benefit from the EU's Climate Change Policy and providing market-based mechanisms to overcome investment hurdles. This manufacturing push can be further enhanced through market-pull effects. Demand can be raised in a number of ways: for example by setting appropriate public-sector procurement standards, short-term positive price discrimination, or promotional labeling of products (e.g., ""biobased"") . While all these actions will have a positive effect, they will be more effective if supported by a coherent communications plan to raise awareness of the potential of industrial biotechnology, the use of renewable resources, and the benefits the KBBE will bring. The plan should take account of all major stakeholders, including industry, policy makers, consumers, farmers, and the investment community, but early-stage (upstream) open engagement with the general public is particularly important. Smaller companies make up an important part of this relatively young biotechnology sector, and it is they who will provide much of the necessary innovation. Because of their early stage of development, there are a number of hurdles they find more difficult to overcome than larger companies do. Small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) need help, in particular, to reduce the cost of intellectual property protection. Ultimately, a single European Community patent will provide the answer, but in the meantime, a specific SME application process is needed at the European Patent Office (EPO). Early-stage search costs could also be reduced by introducing a searchable database flagged for industrial biotechnology applications. While intellectual property forms the basis of innovation, finance is needed to derive value from it. Proof-of-concept work is often funded by grants for start-up companies, and SMEs could benefit from a similar grant system for work on environment-friendly technologies. More generally, greater awareness of the potential of the industrial biotechnology sector is needed among the investment community in order for funds to be made available more easily. The necessary communications program is a vital part of the overall stakeholder outreach effort. But this in itself will not be sufficient. Because of the particular difficulties of raising capital for SMEs, a new investment model will be needed which sits between loans and conventional private equity, to provide finance along with equitable risk sharing. As the industrial biotechnology sector becomes increasingly successful, venture capital will become more available. In conclusion, to establish a sustainable KBBE in Europe, efforts are needed: To establish a coherent European Policy Agenda for industrial biotechnology and the KBBE To stimulate and support innovation in plant science and industrial biotechnology To promote production and use of biobased products and processes To create awareness among all stakeholders To improve investment in KBBE-related SMEs.",,"Biotechnology; Climate change; Innovation; Project management; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; Biotechnology policy; Policy-making; Publicprivate partnership; Industrial management; Biotechnology; Climate change; Industrial management; Innovation; Project management; Strategic planning; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047236125

As it turns out, methane leakage from urban landfills that lack methane collection remediation often is problematic for neighbors of the plant and/or the landfill. Using compressors made of exotic alloys solved that problem but ruined project economics. Larger landfill gas power plants, such as the 48-Mw Puente Hills project operated by the Los Angeles County Sanitation District (LACSD), have succeeded by taking a low-risk approach to reducing methane leakage.

They suggest that elevated CO2, by altering microbial communities, may turn the soil from a potential carbon sink into a carbon source. This could offset some of the gains in carbon storage in plant biomass due to increased growth at elevated CO2.
