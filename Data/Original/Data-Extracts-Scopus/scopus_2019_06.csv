To recognise the extent to which green infrastructure and nature-based solutions (NbS) are present in the urban policy, we conducted a review of planning, strategic and programming documents of Poznań City as a Case Study. The study is aimed at 1) diagnosing of current position NbS in the tasks and directions of planning, strategic and programming documents; 2) characteristic of activities related to NbS according to the form of human-nature interaction; 3) determining the potential of including NbS in the local policy; 4) identifying the role of NbS in facing 4 main challenges in urban policy: resilience and climate change adaptation, health and well-being, social cohesion, economic development potential. The results show that a significant number of actions focus on GI changes towards its multifunctionality and better quality, while there are not many actions towards supporting citizens in using it. Also, despite urban pressure, new green spaces are still planned to be created. The role of NbS within GI in urban resilience is well recognised. Yet, the adaptation to climate change has gained a low priority so far. Linkages between GI and the wellbeing of inhabitants are well understood. However, the possibility to build and strengthen social cohesion based on GI is rather marginally noticed. The least recognised is the influence of NbS on the economic development potential. It is an area that still needs to be investigated to bring evidence in this field. We conclude that to support large-scale, nature-based solution implementation in cities, the crucial step is to bring them into the local urban agenda. An evaluation of urban policy documents based on the presented approach can serve as a guideline for identifying gaps and potentials for NbS inclusion. As a result, it can help the better organisation of urban policy and harmonisation of different sectors through NbS. © 2019 The Authors","Ecosystem services; Green infrastructure; NbS; Urban planning; Urban transformation","adaptive management; climate change; ecosystem service; infrastructure planning; policy implementation; urban planning; urban policy; Poland [Central Europe]; Poznan [Wielkopolskie]; Wielkopolskie",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063968962

They are among the first communities to observe climate and environmental changes first-hand, and are applying traditional knowledge and skills in order to adapt to these changes. We used participatory action research in which a series of group discussions and debates were conducted in community workshops at the village level. Using this input, we analysed the perceptions of the local people about climate variability, impacts, and adaptation practices. The majority of the local people perceived climate change patterns in the CDZ with the increase of temperature and erratic rainfall patterns perceived as the most critical changes. The majority of the people also perceived that the impacts of climate change have already been affecting agriculture and its related sectors, including land and water resources and their livelihood strategies. Most of the local people also perceived that migration of young people away from the communities has gradually increased due to the consequences of climate change impacts. Farmers have already been attempting to cope with those climate change impacts by using locally relevant adaptation measures such as mixed and multiple cropping systems, changing to drought-resistant plant varieties, and using soil conservation measures to cope with water scarcity. In addition, most of the local people perceived that getting information from traditional weather prediction was helpful to cope with drought and erratic rainfall patterns. However, the results suggest the adaptive capacity of the local people in responding to the impacts of climate change can be improved. In this regard, effective adaptation planning relies on the best available knowledge base, and the urgent need to respond to the pressures of climate change has put a premium on the generation, interpretation and use of information to improve adaptive capacity, including improved access to scaling up the traditional best practices of local people. © 2019, Faculty of Environment and Resource Studies,Mahidol University.

Possible adaptations of institutional settings are explored, aiming at increased effectiveness of policies and governance in delivering multiple ecosystem benefits along with reduced nutrient emissions and flood management. Factors of success synthesized from existing examples of innovative policy instruments in the EU and further afield are used to identify barriers and opportunities for the implementation of policy innovations in different institutional settings across the Baltic Sea Region (BSR). Key factors of success include close and trusting cooperation in scheme development, utilization of intermediaries in trust building, an active role of civil society and private sector, spatial targeting and coordination of measures, and result-based and long-term approaches. It is concluded that the effectiveness of measures can be increased by (i) adopting a less prescriptive approach to implementation, (ii) strengthening bottom-up participatory stakeholder learning processes, (iii) fostering cross-sectoral planning and funding initiatives, (iv) creating incentives for local collaborative actions, (v) developing cooperative nutrient management initiatives in the BSR and (vi) developing a systematic and coordinated approach to pilot-testing of new concepts and measures. © IWA Publishing 2019.","Agricultural and environmental policies; Multiple ecosystem benefits; Nutrient management; Policy innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067475638

To lower GHG emissions intensity, appropriate production management systems should be identified. Since the 1980s, grassland livestock husbandry in China has transformed gradually from pastoralism into individual household management under the Grassland Household Contract System Policy. However, little is known about how this transition influences GHG emissions. We selected two case study sites representing two different forms of rangeland management systems in Ruoergai county of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, viz. 1) household-based all year continuous grazing under the individual use of rangeland with fences demarcating boundaries; 2) community-based seasonal grazing under the common use of the whole rangeland. The objective was to examine the differences in greenhouse gas emission intensity between the two systems using life cycle assessment (LCA). The results showed that the transition from community-based seasonal grazing into household-based continuous grazing increased the GHG emissions intensity from -0.62 kgCO 2 -eq/kg meat to 10.51 kgCO 2 -eq/kg meat. The increase was primarily attributed to changes in soil carbon storage. Findings suggest that to minimize GHG emissions and environmental degradation, community-based seasonal grazing in the pastoral area of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau should be maintained. Enhancing soil carbon sequestration by adopting appropriate practices would further reduce the GHG emissions intensity arising from the livestock system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle assessment; Pastoralism; Rangeland management system; Soil carbon","carbon emission; grazing management; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; livestock farming; pastoralism; rangeland; soil carbon; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Ruoergai Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063893255

This optically thin assumption seems to be supported by recent Disk Substructures at High Angular Resolution Project (DSHARP) observations where the measured optical depths are mostly less than one. However, we point out that dust scattering can considerably reduce the emission from an optically thick region. If that scattering is ignored, an optically thick disk with scattering can be misidentified as an optically thin disk. Dust scattering in more inclined disks can reduce the intensity even further, making the disk look even fainter. The measured optical depth of ∼0.6 in several DSHARP disks can be naturally explained by optically thick dust with an albedo of ∼0.9 at 1.25 mm. Using the DSHARP opacity, this albedo corresponds to a dust population with the maximum grain size (s max) of 0.1-1 mm. For optically thick scattering disks, the measured spectral index α can be either larger or smaller than 2 depending on whether the dust albedo increases or decreases with wavelength. We describe how this optically thick scattering scenario could explain the observed scaling between submm continuum sizes and luminosities, and might help ease the tension between the dust size constraints from polarization and dust continuum measurements. We suggest that a significant amount of disk mass can be hidden from ALMA observations and longer wavelength observations (e.g., Very Large Array or Square Kilometre Array) are desired to probe the dust mass in disks. © 2019.

Comparing their distribution patterns can provide information on mechanisms governing SOC preservation and dynamics. However, the large-scale distribution pattern and stability of lignin versus plant-derived lipids are still poorly constrained. Here we investigated the distribution of lignin phenols versus plant-derived lipids in the surface soils across the alpine versus temperate grasslands of China and Mongolia. Methods: Lignin phenols were isolated by cupric oxide oxidation method and compared with the previously analyzed plant-derived lipids (cutin and suberin). A comprehensive list of environmental variables was compiled to disentangle the climatic, edaphic and vegetation influences on lignin phenols’ distribution in the soil. Results: Lignin phenols showed similar SOC-normalized concentrations in the alpine and temperate grassland soils despite a higher plant input to the latter, suggesting better lignin preservation in the cold region. However, compared with plant-derived lipids (cutin and suberin), lignin seems to be less stabilized. The variation of lipid versus lignin components is mainly related to climate (particularly aridity) in the alpine grassland soils, while the relative abundance of plant lipids and lignin phenols is more related to reactive mineral contents in the temperate grassland soils. Conclusions: Lignin contributes differentially to SOC accumulation in the alpine and temperate soils: while lignin seems to be better preserved in the cold region, lignin phenols decrease relative to other carbon components with SOC accrual in the temperate region. Overall, lignin distribution and fate may be more sensitive to carbon source variations than temperature shifts in the grasslands. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Biomarker; Mongolian plateau; Qinghai-Tibetan plateau; Soil organic carbon; Stability","alpine environment; biomarker; comparative study; grassland soil; lignin; lipid; phenol; soil carbon; soil chemistry; soil organic matter; soil survey; spatial distribution; temperate environment; China; Mongolia; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Embryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064271481

This study selected four plantation forests composed of poplar, black locust, Chinese pine and mixture of poplar and black locust, located in an urban forest park on a well-drained fluvial plain with same land-use history. The diurnal and seasonal changes in soil respiration (Rs) and biophysical factors were measured from April 2015 to March 2016. At the diurnal scale, Rs varied out of phase with soil temperature (Ts) and the time-lag occurred in May and July when Ts was relatively high and soil moisture (Ms) was low. Strong seasonal variations in Rs were mainly determined by Ts, while the growing-season mean Rs positively correlated with the fine root biomass (FRB), soil organic carbon content (SOC), and total nitrogen content (TN) for all the forests. FRB alone could explain 75% of the among-stand variability. This study concluded that urban forest plantations have similar soil respiration dynamics to forest ecosystems in non-urban settings. © 2019 by the authors.","Soil moisture; Soil respiration; Soil temperature; Temporal variation; Urban plantation forest","Climate change; Ecosystems; Land use; Organic carbon; Soil moisture; Temperature; Biophysical factors; Mitigation strategy; Plantation forests; Soil organic carbon content; Soil respiration; Soil temperature; Temporal variation; Total nitrogen content; Forestry; diurnal variation; plantation forestry; seasonal variation; soil moisture; soil respiration; soil temperature; temporal variation; Chinese; Ecosystems; Forestry; Forests; Land Use; Respiration; Soil; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068861476

However, emission of by-product gases during acidogenic fermentation is one of the key reasons for reduced product recovery whereas high gas pressure in the acidogenic headspace could pose an inhibitory effect on the production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs). This study presents a novel electro-fermentation (EF) system for enhancing VFAs production by in situ reuse of anodic off-gases (mainly CO 2 and H 2 ) in the cathode. A total VFAs production of 0.57 g-VFAs/g-VS was achieved through reuse of acidogenic off-gases in EF system, corresponding to 48.70% increase in comparison with the treatment without off-gases reuse. Consequently, the conversion efficiency of carbon to VFAs was improved significantly by 13.92%. Acidogenic metabolic pathway in the anode shifted to mixed -acid fermentation with the succession of dominant microbes from genus of Escherichia in the seeding inocula to Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio in the anode and cathode chambers, respectively. This would provide a way to enhance VFAs recovery from organic wastes, which also contributes to reduced carbon footprint and increased environmental sustainability. © 2019","Acidogenic off-gas; Gas reuse; Metabolic pathway; Microbial community; Volatile fatty acids","Anodes; Carbon footprint; Cathodes; Fermentation; Gases; Metabolism; Microorganisms; Recovery; Sustainable development; Wastes; Acidogenic; Acidogenic fermentation; Environmental sustainability; High gas pressures; Metabolic pathways; Microbial communities; Mixed acid fermentation; Volatile fatty acids (VFAs); Volatile fatty acids; carbon dioxide; hydrogen; RNA 16S; volatile fatty acid; comparative study; fatty acid; fermentation; metabolism; microbial community; Article; Bacteroides; comparative study; controlled study; Desulfovibrio; Escherichia; fermentation; metabolism; microbial community; nonhuman; priority journal; pyrosequencing; recycling; RNA sequence; waste water; Bacteroides; Desulfovibrio; Escherichia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062477568

We conducted a rainfall manipulation field experiment to address the question: how does drought-induced vegetation change, specifically shrub encroachment into grasslands, regulate impacts of subsequent drought on soil CO2 efflux (Rs) and its components (autotrophic and heterotrophic, Ra and Rh)? Methods: We conducted a two-year experiment in Inner Mongolia plateau, China, using constructed steppe communities including graminoids, shrubs and their mixture (graminoid + shrub) to test the effects of extreme-duration drought (60-yr return time) on Rs, Rh and Ra. Results: Our results indicated that extreme-duration drought reduced net primary production, with subsequent effects on Rs, Rh and Ra in all three vegetation communities. There was a larger relative decline in Ra (35–54%) than Rs (30–37%) and Rh (28–35%). Interestingly, we found Rs in graminoids is higher than in shrubs under extreme drought. Meanwhile, Rh declines were largest in the shrub community. Although Ra and Rh both decreased rapidly during drought treatment, Rh recovered quickly after the drought, while Ra did not, limiting the Rs recovery. Conclusions: This study suggests that plant species composition regulates several aspects of soil CO2 efflux response to climate extremes. This regulation may be limited by above- and below-ground net primary production depending on soil water availability. The results of this experiment address a critical knowledge gap in the relationship between soil respiration and plant species composition. With shrub encroachment into grasslands, total soil respiration is reduced and can partly offset the effect of reduction in productivity under drought stress. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Autotrophic; Extreme drought; Heterotrophic; Net primary production; Plant species composition; Soil CO2 efflux","autotrophy; carbon cycle; carbon flux; climate effect; drought; drought stress; experimental study; extreme event; heterotrophy; net primary production; plant community; soil carbon; soil respiration; soil water; steppe; water availability; China; Nei Monggol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064251551

Real-time monitoring of the safety and integrity of carbon storage reservoirs is a critical aspect of any commercial-scale CCS deployment. Pressure-based sensing is cost effective, suitable for real-time monitoring, and scalable to large monitoring networks. However, questions remain on how to best harness intelligent information from the high-frequency pressure monitoring sensors to support real-time decisions. This work presents a deep-learning-based framework for analyzing and detecting anomalies in pressure data streams by using a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) neural network model, which allows for the fusion of both static and dynamic reservoir data. In ConvLSTM, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for spatial pattern mining and the LSTM is used for temporal pattern recognition. The performance of the ConvLSTM model for real-time anomaly detection is demonstrated using a set of pressure monitoring data collected from Cranfield, Mississippi, an active enhanced-oil-recovery field. The anomaly detection model is trained using bottom-hole pressure data acquired from the base experiment (without leak event) and then tested on pressure data collected during a series of controlled CO2 release experiments (with artificially created leak events). Results show that the ConvLSTM neural network model successfully detected anomalies in the pressure time series obtained from the controlled release experiments. Inclusion of static information into the model further improves the robustness of ConvLSTM. © 2019","Anomaly detection; Convolutional long short-term memory neural network; Deep learning; Pressure tests","Anomaly detection; Bottom hole pressure; Brain; Carbon capture; Convolution; Cost effectiveness; Deep learning; Digital storage; Enhanced recovery; Forestry; Pattern recognition; Pressure measurement; Anomaly detection models; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Convolutional neural network; Intelligent information; Pressure tests; Real-time anomaly detections; Spatial pattern minings; Temporal pattern recognition; Long short-term memory; algorithm; anthropogenic source; artificial neural network; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; detection method; emission control; reservoir; testing method; Central Bedfordshire; Cranfield; England; Mississippi; United Kingdom; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064268478

The high-density cross-linking bonds can address the thermal instability of SBR, and then endow it with rigid macromolecular framework and carbonizability. Therefore, the obtained carbon foam well inherits the micromorphology from SBR and incorporates the structural characteristics of light weight, honeycomb-like pore structure and tunable surface morphology. Owing to these structural advantages, the obtained carbon foam presents superior oil-water separation performance and Na + storage property. For example, the carbon foam has high adsorption capacities of pump oil and other solvents (300–500%), and it can be recovered to the original state by combustion.

We estimated emissions from two of the major source types in the valley (vehicles and brick kilns) and analyzed the corresponding impacts on regional air quality. First, we estimated the on-road vehicle emissions in the valley using the International Vehicle Emissions (IVE) model with local emissions factors and the latest available data for vehicle registration. We also identified the locations of the brick kilns in the Kathmandu Valley and developed an emissions inventory for these kilns using emissions factors measured during the Nepal Ambient Monitoring and Source Testing Experiment (NAMaSTE) field campaign in April 2015. Our results indicate that the commonly used global emissions inventory, the Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (HTAP_v2.2), underestimates particulate matter emissions from vehicles in the Kathmandu Valley by a factor greater than 100. HTAP_v2.2 does not include the brick sector and we found that our sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions estimates from brick kilns are comparable to 70 % of the total SO2 emissions considered in HTAP_v2.2. Next, we simulated air quality using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) for April 2015 based on three different emissions scenarios: HTAP only, HTAP with updated vehicle emissions, and HTAP with both updated vehicle and brick kilns emissions. Comparisons between simulated results and observations indicate that the model underestimates observed surface elemental carbon (EC) and SO2 concentrations under all emissions scenarios. However, our updated estimates of vehicle emissions significantly reduced model bias for EC, while updated emissions from brick kilns improved model performance in simulating SO2. These results highlight the importance of improving local emissions estimates for air quality modeling. We further find that model overestimation of surface wind leads to underestimated air pollutant concentrations in the Kathmandu Valley. Future work should focus on improving local emissions estimates for other major and underrepresented sources (e.g., crop residue burning and garbage burning) with a high spatial resolution, as well as the model's boundary layer representation, to capture strong spatial gradients of air pollutant concentrations. © 2019 Author(s).",,"air quality; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollution monitoring; sulfur dioxide; traffic emission; Kathmandu Valley; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068105925

This study proposed a GIS-based approach to combine climate modeling, building energy simulation, and inventory of building characteristics to quantify climate change's effect on building energy demand in Los Angeles, California. The impact was assessed by comparing building energy demands under current and future climate conditions through two metrics: relative change (RC) and absolute difference (AD), in annual, monthly, and diurnal scales under A1F1 and A2 emission scenarios. A spatial analysis was performed to assess neighborhoods vulnerable to climate change. Results suggest that most building types showed an apparent increase of energy demands under both scenarios. The increase of cooling energy demand resulted in great changes in RC and AD. Larger changes were observed at finer time scales. The energy demand for buildings increased from April to October, but decreased from November to March. The largest positive AD of total energy for all building types occurred in August, ranging 1.8–30.9 MJ/sqm, but the characteristics of diurnal AD varied with building types. Areas with dense tall commercial buildings would foresee the largest increase in energy demand.

The results show that China's carbon emissions have plateaued since 2012 mainly because of energy efficiency gains and structural upgrades (i.e., industrial structure, energy mix and regional structure). Regional structure, measured by provincial economic growth shares, has drastically reduced CO 2 emissions since 2012. The effects of these drivers on emissions changes varied across regions due to their different regional development patterns. Industrial structure and energy mix resulted in emissions growth in some regions, but these two drivers led to emissions reduction at the national level. For example, industrial structure reduced China's CO 2 emissions by 1.0% from 2013 to 2016; however, it increased CO 2 emissions in the Northeast and Northwest regions by 1.7% and 0.9%, respectively. Studying China's plateauing CO 2 emissions in the new normal stage at the regional level yields a strong recommendation that China's regions cooperate to improve development patterns. © 2019 The Authors","China; CO 2 emissions; LMDI; New normal; Regional development; Structural changes","Carbon; Climate change; Economics; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Regional planning; China; CO2 emissions; LMDI; New normal; Regional development; Structural changes; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental economics; regional development; structural change; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063395346

The Qinling subspecies of giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca qinlingensis) is highly endangered; fewer than 350 individuals still inhabit the Qinling Mountains. Last year, China announced the establishment of the first Giant Panda National Park (GPNP) with a goal of restoring and connecting fragmented habitats; the proposal ignored the environmental pollution caused by economic development in panda habitats. The spatial distribution of heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Hg, Cu, Zn, Mn, Cr, Ni and As) was analyzed in giant panda feces, soil, bamboo, and water in four of GPNP's functional areas at different altitudes and latitudes. Heavy metal pollution decreased with anthropogenic influences, from outside the park through the buffer and into the core area. Cu, Mn, Ni and Zn accumulated from natural sources; As, Hg and Cr were associated with fuel combustion; and Pb and Cd were associated with traffic and agriculture sources. The presence of heavy metals at high altitudes and latitudes in the proposed GPNP is due to emissions from Xi'an and other upwind industrial cities. We conclude that reducing emissions and heavy metal input should be included in the design of the GPNP. Policy interventions should consider functional zones planning, wind direction, reducing mining, and the abandonment of existing roads and farmland within the GPNP to reduce other direct human impacts on the Qinling panda. © 2019","Ecological protection; Environment policy; Environmental pollution; Giant panda; Heavy metals","Conservation; Ecosystems; Fuels; Industrial emissions; Manganese removal (water treatment); Pollution; Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Anthropogenic influence; Ecological protection; Economic development; Environment policies; Environmental pollutions; Giant panda; Heavy metal pollution; Heavy metals; arsenic; cadmium; chromium; copper; lead; manganese; mercury; nickel; zinc; anthropogenic effect; endangered species; environmental policy; environmental protection; heavy metal; national park; pollution effect; species conservation; sustainability; agricultural land; air pollution; altitude; Article; bamboo; China; combustion; concentration (parameter); controlled study; economic development; ecosystem restoration; endangered species; environment; environmental planning; environmental policy; environmental sustainability; feces analysis; fuel combustion; giant panda; habitat fragmentation; human impact (environment); latitude; mining; national park; nonhuman; pollution control; pollution transport; priority journal; Qinling Mountains; soil analysis; soil pollution; species conservation; water analysis; water pollution; wind; wind direction; China; Qinling Mountains; Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062726041

However, the influence of retarding the fuel injection timing on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and persistent organic pollutant (POP) emissions has not yet been investigated. In this study, the diesel engine was tested using four of the existing thirteen European steady state cycle (ESC) modes. The fuel injection timing was retarded from –8° to –6° and the diesel exhaust gas samples were analyzed for PAH and POP emissions. The NOx emission factor reduced by ~25% when the fuel injection timing was retarded. However, the strategy had a negative effect on combustion efficiency. The carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM) emissions were 1.4 and 1.2 times higher for the –6° scenario, respectively. The emission factors of all the toxic organic pollutants increased drastically when the fuel injection timing was retarded. For instance, the emission factors of PAH and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin/dibenzofuran (PCDD/F) for the –6° scenario, based on BaPeq and WHO-TEQ, were 22 and 10 times higher than for the –8° scenario. The retardation had more influence on these pollutants in the particle-phase than in gas-phase. The resultant negative impact on combustion increased the emissions of products of incomplete combustion, enhancing the potential of POP formation via de novo synthesis. The study concludes that although retarding the fuel injection timing leads to a decrease in NOx emissions from diesel engines, it also results in an increase in PAH and POP emissions. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Diesel engine; PAHs; POPs; Retarding injection timing","Carbon monoxide; Combustion; Diesel engines; Fuel injection; Fuels; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Timing circuits; Combustion efficiencies; Incomplete combustion; Injection timing; Particulate matter emissions; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Polychlorinated dibenzo- p - dioxins; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH); POPs; Organic pollutants; diesel engine; emission; exhaust emission; fuel; nitrous oxide; organic pollutant; PAH; persistent organic pollutant; toxic substance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068758760

To investigate the changes of the characteristics of PM2.5 and its major chemical components, formation mechanisms, and sources apportionment during 2013–2017 in urban Handan, which was one of the top polluted cities in China, we analyzed the chemical compositions of PM2.5 samples for the entire year of 2013 and 2017, as well as a comprehensive dataset including continuous online hourly observations of the meteorological parameters and major air pollutants, i.e., SO2, NO2, and O3 in this study. Potential Source Contribution function (PSCF) analysis was applied to investigate the potential source regions contributing to high PM2.5 pollution episodes. The results showed that the concentration of major air pollutants except ozone decreased, and the proportion of PM2.5 decline in Handan (37.0%) had reached the requirements (25%) of the National Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan. The major chemical compositions of PM2.5 decreased significantly, but the percentage of secondary organic aerosols increased from 37.0% in 2013 to 40.0% in 2017. The higher proportion of secondary components implied more severe secondary pollution. The PSCF analysis indicated that the significant local contribution and short-range transport in the surrounding areas were the major sources of heavy pollution episodes in Handan.

This paper investigates the climate suitability of spring maize, based on daily data from 50 meteorological stations, and statistics on maize yield and area at the county level in Jilin Province, China, between 1986 and 2015. Based on a significant correlation between the cultivation patterns indicator ≥10 °C accumulated temperature (AAT10) and the average yield (R2 = 0.503), the yield data are used to determine suitable thresholds for meteorological factors under the dynamic cultivation pattern, and a fuzzy fitness approach is used to evaluate the climate suitability. The results showed a good agreement between suitability estimates and scaled observed yields (average d = 0.705). Moreover, good consistency between cultivation patterns, climate suitability and yield show that the late-maturing varieties of maize have gradually moved northward and eastward, and the areas of high suitability and high yield have gradually expanded eastward. In addition, drought and chilling hazard factors limit the suitability of climate resources, especially in the eastern and western regions. © 2019 by the authors.","Agroclimatic indices; Climate change; Climate suitability; Cultivation pattern; Spring maize","Cultivation; Decision making; Accumulated temperatures; Agroclimatic indices; Climate suitability; Dynamic evaluation; Meteorological factors; Meteorological station; Spring maize; Strategic decision making; Climate change; climate change; climate variation; cultivation; decision making; future prospect; maize; China; Jilin; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068876396

However, this parameter cannot be directly measured by onboard sensors. Most of observers and tracking controllers for the ammonia coverage ratio in the existing literature were designed separately and lacked an overall robustness analysis. In this paper, an observing and tracking controller (AOTC), along with its overall design and stability analysis, is proposed under inputto-state stability (ISS) theory. The proposed AOTC strategy consists of a sliding mode observer based on NH3 concentration dynamics and a tracking controller based on the observer dynamics. The stability is discussed considering the uncertainties about the conversion of urea to NH3 and the cross-sensitivity of the NOx sensor, and the principle for adjusting the control parameters is provided. A few transient simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed AOTC strategy. © 2019, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","diesel emission control; input-tostate stability; nonlinear control; sliding mode observer; urea-SCR system","Ammonia; Emission control; Metabolism; Selective catalytic reduction; Sliding mode control; Stability; Urea; Diesel emission control; Emission regulation; Input-to-state stability; Non linear control; Sliding mode observers; Transient simulation; Urea scr; Urea-selective catalytic reduction; Controllers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064931939

While previous studies have shown that GHG reductions could synergistically decrease air pollutant emissions and protect public health, limited research has been conducted to compare the health cobenefits of different technology pathways toward deep decarbonization. Using an integrated approach that combines energy and emission technology modeling, high-resolution chemical transport simulation, and health impact assessment, we find that achievement of the 80% GHG reduction target would bring substantial air quality and health cobenefits. The cobenefits, however, highly depend on the selected technology pathway largely because of California's relatively clean energy structure. Compared with the business-as-usual levels, a decarbonization pathway that focuses on electrification and clean renewable energy is estimated to reduce concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) by 18-37% in major metropolitan areas of California and subsequently avoid about 12 100 (9600-14 600) premature deaths. In contrast, only a quarter of such health cobenefits, i.e., 2800 (2300-3400) avoided deaths, can be achieved through a pathway focusing more on combustible renewable fuels. After subtracting the cost, the net monetized benefit of the electrification-focused pathway still exceeds that of the renewable fuel-focused pathway, indicating that a cleaner but more expensive decarbonization pathway may be more preferable in California. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Air quality; Decarbonization; Electric utilities; Gas emissions; Health; Air pollutant emission; Chemical transport; Energy and emissions; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Health co-benefits; Health impact assessment; Integrated approach; Renewable energies; Greenhouse gases; air quality; alternative energy; concentration (composition); electrification; emission control; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse gas; health impact; health monitoring; particulate matter; public health; achievement; air quality; article; California; controlled study; death; greenhouse gas; health impact assessment; particulate matter; renewable energy; simulation; air pollutant; air pollution; California; greenhouse gas; California; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; California; Greenhouse Gases; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066431758

Corresponding mechanisms are currently recognized to be from physical properties of biochar, providing a favorable growth environment for aerobic methanotrophs which perform aerobic methane (CH4) oxidation. However, our study shows that the chemical reactivity of biochar can also stimulate anaerobic oxidation of CH4 (AOM) by anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) of ANME-2d, which proposes another plausible mechanism for CH4 mitigation by biochar amendment in anaerobic environments. It was found that, by adding biochar as the sole electron acceptor in an anaerobic environment, CH4 was biologically oxidized, with CO2 production of 106.3 ± 5.1 μmol g-1 biochar. In contrast, limited CO2 production was observed with chemically reduced biochar amendment. This biological nature of the process was confirmed by mcr gene transcript abundance as well as sustained dominance of ANME-2d in the microbial community during microbial incubations with active biochar amendment. Combined FTIR and XPS analyses demonstrated that the redox activity of biochar is related to its oxygen-based functional groups. On the basis of microbial community evolution as well as intermediate production during incubation, different pathways in terms of direct or indirect interactions between ANME-2d and biochar were proposed for biochar-mediated AOM. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Methane; Microorganisms; Redox reactions; Soils; Anaerobic environment; Anaerobic oxidation; Anaerobic oxidation of methanes; Biochar amendments; Indirect interactions; Microbial communities; Plausible mechanisms; Sole electron acceptors; Oxidation; biochar; carbon dioxide; charcoal; methane; unclassified drug; biochar; charcoal; anaerobic digestion; biochar; methane; methanotrophy; microbial community; oxidation; physical property; prokaryote; soil amendment; anaerobic metabolism; archaeon; Article; carbon footprint; chemical interaction; controlled study; electrochemical analysis; electron transport; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; genetic transcription; mcr gene; Methanoperedens nitroreducens; methanotroph; microbial community; microbial gene; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; soil amendment; X ray powder diffraction; anaerobic growth; Anaerobiosis; Archaea; Charcoal; Methane; Oxidation-Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067446293

By using the southern North Sea as an exemplary area we present a modeling attempt to quantify the budget of total organic carbon (TOC) reworked by macrobenthos in seafloor surface sediments. Vertical profiles in sediments collected in the field indicate a significant but nonlinear correlation between TOC and macrobenthic biomass. A mechanistic model is used to resolve the bidirectional interaction between TOC and macrobenthos. A novelty of this model is that bioturbation is resolved dynamically depending on variations in local food resource and macrobenthic biomass. The model is coupled to 3-D hydrodynamic-biogeochemical simulations to hindcast the mutual dependence between sedimentary TOC and macrobenthos from 1948 to 2015. Agreement with field data reveals a satisfactory model performance. Our simulations show that the preservation of TOC in the North Sea sediments is determined not only by pelagic conditions (hydrodynamic regime and primary production) but also by the vertical distribution of TOC, bioturbation intensity, and the vertical positioning of macrobenthos. Macrobenthos annually ingest 20–35% and in addition vertically diffuse 11–22% of the total budget of TOC in the uppermost 30-cm sediments in the southern North Sea. This result indicates a central role of benthic animals in modulating the organic carbon cycling at the sediment-water interface of continental margins. ©2019.

Yet, little is known about the effects of Pi limitation on plant metabolism, particularly in dioecious woody plants. To identify potential gender-specific metabolites appearing in response to Pi limitation in poplars, we studied the metabolic and ionomic responses in the roots and leaves of Populus cathayana Rehd males and females exposed to a 60-day period of Pi deficiency. Besides significant decreases in phosphorus contents in both Pi-deficient roots and leaves, the calcium level decreased significantly and the sulfur content increased significantly in Pi-deficient male roots, while the zinc and ferrum contents increased significantly in Pi-deficient female roots. Inorganic P deficiency caused a smaller change in the abscisic acid content, but a significant increase in the jasmonic acid content was detected in both leaves and roots. Salicylic acid significantly decreased under Pi deficiency in male leaves and female roots. Changes were found in phospholipids and phosphorylated metabolites (e.g., fructose-6-phosphate, glycerol-3-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, phosphoric acid and inositol-1-phosphate) in roots and leaves. Both P. cathayana males and females relied on inorganic pyrophosphate-dependent but not on Pi-dependent glycolysis under Pi-deficient conditions. Sex-specific metabolites in leaves were primarily in the category of primary metabolites (e.g., amino acids), while in roots primarily in the category of secondary metabolites (e.g., organic acids) and sugars. The metabolome analysis revealed that sexually different pathways occurred mainly in amino acid metabolism, and the tissue-related differences were in the shikimate pathway and glycolysis. We observed changes in carbon flow, reduced root biomass and increased amino acid contents in P. cathayana males but not in females, which indicated that males have adopted an energy-saving strategy to adapt to Pi deficiency. Thus, this study provides new insights into sex-specific metabolic responses to Pi deficiency. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

Nevertheless, in previous studies, regional classification methods are always based on geographical location or single factor which lack of comprehensive indicators for measurement. In this paper, 30 provinces are divided into three areas (advantageous area, potential area and backward area) from 1996 to 2015 by factor analysis and cluster analysis according to the different social development which is measured by urbanization, economy, energy utilization, industry and technology. An extented STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology) model containing with panel regression models are utilized to evaluate the influence of factors on CO2 emissions in China at national and diverse regional levels. The results indicate that the R&amp;D investment and energy cleanliness play important roles in reducing CO2 emissions at advantageous area. Besides, the impact of demographic factor in potential area is higher than the other two areas. Meanwhile, improving the tertiary industry level is more essential in backward area than others. On the whole, the effect of economic growth has a greatest positive influence among three regions. Nevertheless, there exists EKC curve for three regions which shows a downward trend of CO2 emissions with increasing GDP per capita in the future.

As a result, several cities have introduced tolling schemes to discourage vehicles from entering the inner city. However, little research has been done to examine the impact of tolling schemes on the routing of commercial fleets, especially on the resulting costs and emissions. In this study, we investigate a vehicle routing problem considering different congestion charge schemes for several city types. We design comprehensive computational experiments to investigate whether different types of tolling schemes work in the way municipalities expect and what factors affect the performance of the congestion charge schemes. We compare the impact on a company's total costs, fuel usage (which drives emissions), and delivery tour plans. Our experimental results demonstrate that some congestion pricing schemes may even increase the emissions in the city center, and higher congestion charges may not necessarily lead to lower emissions. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","congestion zones; driver costs; emissions; green logistics; urban logistics; vehicle routing","Costs; Logistics; Particulate emissions; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Computational experiment; Congestion charges; Congestion pricing; Congestion zone; Green logistics; Lower emissions; Urban logistics; Vehicle Routing Problems; Traffic congestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061911970

However, due to differences in natural environment, economic and technological levels, industrial structure, and other aspects in provinces and cities, their water environment management effects are also different across time and space. Under economic development and environmental regulation policies, it can be seen that the change in industrial GDP is not completely consistent with that of industrial wastewater discharge. How to improve desirable outputs and reduce undesirable outputs under the limited investment in water pollution control are key issues when investigating the efficiency of industrial water pollution control. This study uses the Dynamic SBM (Slacks-Based Measure) model to assess wastewater resources for research samples covering the 30 regions of China. There are two output variables, two input variables, and one carry-over variable. The output variables are industrial wastewater treatment and industrial output, the two input variables are industrial water consumption and facility operation cost, and the carry-over variable is industrial waste. This study concludes with implications for theory research, as these variables may lead to a better understanding and merging with the input variables, output variables, and carry-over variable of recent studies. The empirical results show that from the efficiency rank changes of the 30 regions for 2011-2015, regions with higher industrial output do not appear to have improved versus other regions, such as for Shandong, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Qinghai, and Zhejiang. The 30 regions' efficiency scores show some volatility, with 13 regions' efficiency score volatility clustering close to 0, like Beijing, Chongqing, Shandong, Guangdong, and Sichuan. In contrast, for Anhui, Inner Mongolia, Zhejiang, and Xinjiang, their efficiency scores fell more than other regions in this period and thus should adjust their input/output variables to increase their efficiency scores. This study further presents that many lower-/middle-/high-industrial output regions do not achieve a balance between industrial output and industrial wastewater treatment. How to find a balance between these two factors for any region is a vitally important issue for industrial wastewater treatment policy makers. Under such a circumstance, an industrial output region may not actually be highly efficient at doing this. © 2019 by the authors.","DynamicDEA(Data EnvelopmentAnalysis); Efficiency; Environment; SBM; Water pollution","data envelopment analysis; economic development; efficiency measurement; emission control; environmental assessment; environmental management; environmental policy; Gross Domestic Product; industrial emission; industrial structure; policy making; regulatory approach; water pollution; Anhui; Beijing [China]; China; Chongqing; Guangdong; Jiangsu; Nei Monggol; Qinghai; Shandong; Sichuan; Zhejiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067234404

In China, the incidence of esophageal cancer was reported to be ~478,000 in 2015. In the same year, the incidence of esophageal cancer in the United States was ~16,910. Radiotherapy serves as an important tool in the treatment of oesophageal cancer, and although radiation therapy has progressed over time, the prognosis of the majority of patients with oesophageal cancer remains poor. Additionally, the sensitivity of patients with oesophageal cancer to radiotherapy and chemotherapy is not yet clear. Although there are a number of studies on the radiosensitivity of oesophageal cancer cell lines, the vastly different results from different cell lines make them unreliable to use as a guide in clinical practice. Therefore, a common radiosensitive gene signature may provide more reliable results, and using different combinations of common gene signatures to predict the outcome of patients with oesophageal cancer may generate a unique gene signature in oesophageal cancer. In the present study, the radiosensitive index and prognostic index were calculated to predict clinical outcomes. The prognostic index of a 41-gene signature combination is the largest combination of gene signatures used for classifying oesophageal cancer patients into radiosensitive (RS) and radioresistance (RR) groups, to the best of our knowledge, and this gene signature was more effective in patients classified as having Stage III oesophageal cancer. Furthermore, four genes (carbonyl reduc‑ tase 1, serine/threonine kinase PAK2, ras‑related protein Rab 13 and twinfilin‑1) may be sufficient to classify patients into either RS or RR. Subsequent to gene enrichment analysis, the cell communication pathway was significantly different between RS and RR groups in oesophageal cancer. These results may provide useful insights in improving radiotherapy strategies in clinical decisions. © 2019, Spandidos Publications.

Accurate and reasonable prediction on aforementioned information is important for eco-environment construction and vital infrastructures development. To model the current and future states of permafrost, it is a key challenge to effectively determine the upper hydro-thermal boundary conditions for permafrost models under changing climate and different underlying surfaces at proper spatial and temporal scales. An approach, combined regional climate downscaling method with model output statistics method, was developed to produce a time series of air temperature, surface temperatures, and surface unfrozen water contents for different underlying surfaces. It provided various climate and surface parameters at a spatial scale on the order of 10 2 m 2 for engineering designs, which was used to predict boundary conditions under possible climate scenarios.

There is a growing global appeal to improve building energy efficiency due to the pursuit of sustainable development. Reducing building energy consumption and improving building energy efficiency are the main tasks of energy conservation work in China and the United States. We chose Beijing and New York City to highlight the current building energy efficiency policies in two cities. We then examine the differences between them. In New York City, there are more financial incentives, funding channels, participants, and public data available than in Beijing. Using the lesson learned from our investigation of New York City, we make recommendations for the development of Beijing's policies. To overcome barriers to creating energy-efficient buildings, Beijing should increase energy efficiency awareness, innovate with flexible and feasible incentive policies, and improve data disclosure policies. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Historic preservation; Intelligent buildings; Site selection; Building energy consumption; Building energy efficiency; Carbon emissions; Disclosure policies; Energy efficient building; Energy-saving strategies; Financial incentives; Incentive policies; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067691478

However, passive optical remote sensing, which is the most widely used remote sensing data for retrieving vegetation parameters, is constrained by spectral saturation problems and cloud cover. On the other hand, LiDAR data, which have been extensively used to estimate forest structure attributes, cannot provide suffcient spectral information of vegetation canopies. Thus, this study aimed to develop a novel synergistic approach to estimating biomass by integrating LiDAR data with Landsat 8 imagery through a deep learning-based workflow. First the relationships between biomass and spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) and LiDAR metrics were separately investigated. Next, two groups of combined optical and LiDAR indices (i.e., COLI1 and COLI2) were designed and explored to identify their performances in biomass estimation. Finally, five prediction models, including K-nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, the deep learning model, i.e., Stacked Sparse Autoencoder network (SSAE), and multiple stepwise linear regressions, were individually used to estimate biomass with input variables of different scenarios, i.e., (i) all the COLI1 (ACOLI1), (ii) all the COLI2 (ACOLI2), (iii) ACOLI1 and all the optical (AO) and LiDAR variables (AL), and (iv) ACOLI2, AO and AL. Results showed that univariate models with the combined optical and LiDAR indices as explanatory variables presented better modeling performance than those with either optical or LiDAR data alone, regardless of the combination mode. The SSAE model obtained the best performance compared to the other tested prediction algorithms for the forest biomass estimation. The best predictive accuracy was achieved by the SSAE model with inputs of combined optical and LiDAR variables (i.e., ACOLI1, AO and AL) that yielded an R2 of 0.935, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 15.67 Mg/ha, and relative root mean squared error (RMSEr) of 11.407%. It was concluded that the presented combined indices were simple and effective by integrating LiDAR-derived structure information with Landsat 8 spectral data for estimating forest biomass. Overall, the SSAE model with inputs of Landsat 8 and LiDAR integrated information resulted in accurate estimation of forest biomass. The presented modeling workflow will greatly facilitate future forest biomass estimation and carbon stock assessments. © 2019 by the authors.","Combined optical and LiDAR indices; Forest aboveground biomass (AGB); Landsat 8 OLI; LiDAR; Stacked sparse autoencoder network (SSAE); Synergy","Biomass; Carbon; Data integration; Decision trees; Deep learning; Forecasting; Forestry; Mean square error; Nearest neighbor search; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Aboveground biomass; Auto encoders; Combined optical and LiDAR indices; LANDSAT; Synergy; Optical radar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068172326

The aim of this study is to measure and compare the sectoral CO 2 emission linkages and their structures in the construction sectors of 41 countries over 1995–2009 by combing a hybrid multi-regional input–output (MRIO) model and the hypothesis extraction method. The backward and forward CO 2 emission linkages indicate that the international construction sector plays a significant role in importing CO 2 emissions from upstream industries, while the export of CO 2 emissions to downstream industries is relatively minimal. Four fundamental linkage elements show that the net backward CO 2 emission linkages account for the largest proportion, followed by the mixed and net forward CO 2 emission linkages, while the mixed backward CO 2 emission linkages are relatively small. The leading CO 2 emission inflows are from the energy, resource and raw-material sectors. The outflows from the construction sector are mainly to the real estate and public utilities sectors. Based on these findings, the paper puts forward countermeasures for the global construction sector to improve energy efficiency, promote industrial structure upgrading and improve the policy system for greenhouse gas emission reduction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO 2 emissions; Construction sector; Hypothetical extraction method; Linkage analysis; Multi-regional input–output analysis","Construction industry; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Extraction; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Public utilities; CO2 emissions; Construction sectors; Extraction method; Linkage analysis; Output analysis; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063114113

In this study, a temporal decomposition analysis model, i.e., Logistic Mean Division Index (LMDI), is developed to analyze the influencing factors of CO2 emissions in China’s transport sector during 2000–2015. Then, a multi-regional spatial decomposition model is employed to identify the key factors to induce the differences in CO2 emissions of China’s 30 regional transport sectors in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. Based on the empirical results, we find that both in the temporal and spatial perspectives, the main factors that affect CO2 emissions in the transport sector are the same ones. From the temporal perspective, the income effect is the dominant factor increasing CO2 emissions of transport sector, while energy intensity effect and transportation structure effect are the key influencing factors that curb the CO2 emissions of China’s transport sector, during the whole study period. From the spatial perspective, the income effect, energy intensity effect, and transportation structure effect are the key influencing factors that enlarge the gap of CO2 emissions of various transport sectors in the key study years. More importantly, the less-developed regions and high energy intensity regions (i.e., the lower energy efficiency regions) are identified to have the great potential to reduce CO2 emissions of transport sector. Therefore, differentiated mitigation measures and interregional collaborations are encouraged to reduce transport sector’s CO2 emissions in China. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","China’s transport sector; CO2 emissions; Driving factors; Spatial decomposition analysis; Temporal decomposition analysis","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; energy efficiency; energy intensity; identification method; industrial emission; spatial analysis; traffic emission; China; carbon dioxide; air pollutant; analysis; China; economic development; environmental monitoring; industry; traffic and transport; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development; Environmental Monitoring; Industry; Transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064841415

However, it remains unclear what the resulting precipitation change in terms of regional extremes would be in response to the INDC scenarios. Here, we analyzed China's extreme precipitation response of the next few decades to the updated INDC scenarios within the framework of the Paris Agreement. Our results indicate increases in the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation (compared with the current level) in most regions in China. The maximum consecutive five-day precipitation over China is projected to increase ~16%, and the number of heavy precipitation days will increase as much as ~20% in some areas. The probability distributions of extreme precipitation events become wider, resulting in the occurrence of more record-breaking heavy precipitation in the future. We further considered the impacts of precipitation-related extremes and found that the projected population exposure to heavy precipitation events will significantly increase in almost all Chinese regions. For example, for heavy precipitation events that exceed the 20 year baseline return value, the population exposure over China increases from 5.7% (5.1-6.0%) to 15.9% (14.2-16.4%) in the INDC-pledge scenario compared with the present-day level. Limiting the warming to lower levels (e.g., 1.5 °C or 2.0 °C) would reduce the population exposure to heavy precipitation, thereby avoiding impacts associated with more intense precipitation events. These results contribute to an improved understanding of the future risk of climate extremes, which is paramount for the design of mitigation and adaptation policies in China. © 2019 by the authors.","Extreme events; Extreme precipitation exposure; INDC pledge; Precipitation","Climate change; Emission control; Precipitation (chemical); Probability distributions; Adaptation policies; Extreme events; Extreme precipitation; Extreme precipitation events; Heavy precipitation; INDC pledge; Intense precipitation; Precipitation change; Precipitation (meteorology); emission control; environmental planning; environmental policy; extreme event; future prospect; international agreement; precipitation assessment; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068833789

To further understand the role of the marginal seas for marine CO emission, we investigated sea-to-air flux and spatial distribution as well as biological consumption of CO using the Yellow and Bohai Seas as research objects. In the surface water, CO concentrations varied largely between 0.109 and 6.26 nmol/L. Strong vertical and diurnal variabilities were also observed, which could be attributed to the sunlight-induced photochemical production of CO at different sampling time and depth. The atmospheric CO mixing ratios generally decreased from the coast to the open ocean, possibly due to the influence of anthropogenic activity. Relative to atmospheric CO, the concentrations of CO were mostly supersaturated in the surface water, suggesting that both the Bohai and the Yellow Seas were significant CO source in the atmosphere. Average sea-to-air flux of CO was about 1.76 μmol · m-2 · day-1, which largely depended on the saturation factor and wind speed. As an important removal pathway, microbial consumption of CO exhibited the first order kinetics. The rapid turnover of CO (3.2−9.6 hr) indicated that microbial metabolism was the major CO consumer in the surface waters that could significantly regulate the emission of CO to the atmosphere.

This study focused on the Jinggang Mountain National Nature Reserve as an example of a mid-subtropical forest and evaluated soil and vegetation carbon storage by field sampling combined with GIS, RS and GPS technology. We classified the forest into nine forest types using ALOS high-resolution remote sensing images. The evergreen broad-leaved forest has the largest area, occupying 26.5% of the total area, followed by coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forests and warm temperate coniferous forest, occupying 24.2 and 22.9%, respectively.

Currently, its wavelength can be accurately tuned in organic fluorophores by regulating their conjugation length. However, emission efficiency is still an experiential parameter. In this work, we investigate the photophysical properties of two stilbene-based isomerides. The different positions of one methyl group make di-o-methyl substituted 2,4,6-TMe-DPE more twisted than mono-o-methyl substituted 2,4,5-TMe-DPE. Experimental results show that the twisted structure is nonluminescent in solution and exhibits a typical aggregation-induced emission effect. However, the other planar isomer shows strong emission both in solution and in aggregate states. Steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy, and quantum mechanical calculation suggest that nonradiative decay is predominant in 2,4,6-TMe-DPE and that excited-state double-bond torsion contributes a lot to the nonradiative decay channel. This work draws a clear photophysical picture for the aggregation-induced emission process and enables the luminescent behavior to become predictable and controllable. © 2019 the Partner Organisations.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066602608

Since manufactures are taking various strategies to achieve carbon abatement, models are also built under different circumstances. After solving the single phase equilibrium solution, a multi-period dynamic game model is further built. The complex characteristics, such as bifurcation, chaos and sensitivity are analyzed through 3-D stable state diagrams, parameter basin diagrams, and bifurcation diagrams. The results show that the system stability range, which is kept by the manufacturer's recovery price and its adjustment speed, reduces with the increase of carbon tax. Compared with manufacturer 1 who sells new products and recycles waste ones at the same time, the manufacturer 2 who only sells but not recycles has slighter influence on carbon emissions, and the sensitivity of consumers to price on the stability of the system is quite lower. © 2019","Carbon emission tax; Complex analysis; Dual-oligopoly game model; Recycling-supply chain","Bifurcation (mathematics); Competition; Emission control; Recycling; Supply chains; System stability; Bifurcation diagram; Carbon abatement; Carbon emissions; Complex analysis; Complex characteristics; Game models; Production cost; Recycle wastes; Taxation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063345716

The PM2.5 and PM10 samples were analyzed for organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), char, and soot using the thermal/optical reflectance (TOR) method following the IMPROVE_A protocol. PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations ranged from 29.37 to 501.43 μg m−3 and from 50.42 to 330.07 μg m−3, with average levels of 104.90 and 151.23 μg m−3, respectively. The 24-h average level of PM2.5 was about three times the US EPA standard of 35 μg m−3, and significantly exceeds the Class II National Air Quality Standard of China of 75 μg m−3. The seasonal cycles of PM mass and OC concentrations were higher during winter than in summer. EC and char concentrations were generally highest during winter but lowest in spring, while higher soot concentrations occurred in summer. This seasonal variation could be attributed to different seasonal meteorological conditions and changes in source contributions. Strong correlations between OC and EC were found for both PM2.5 and PM10 in winter and fall, while char and soot showed a moderate correlation in summer and winter. The average OC/EC ratios were 5.11 and 4.46 for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively, with individual OC/EC ratios nearly always exceeding 2.0. Higher char/soot ratios during the four seasons indicated that coal combustion and biomass burning were the major sources for carbonaceous aerosol in Huangshi. Contrary to expectations, secondary organic carbon (SOC) which is estimated using the EC tracer method exhibited spring maximum and summer minimum, suggesting that photochemical activity is not a leading factor in the formation of secondary organic aerosols in the study area. The contribution of SOC to OC concentration for PM2.5 and PM10 were 47.33 and 45.38%, respectively, implying that SOC was an important component of OC mass. The serious air pollution in haze-fog episode was strongly correlated with the emissions of pollutants from biomass burning and the meteorological conditions. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Elemental carbon (EC); Organic carbon (OC); PM10; PM2.5; Source","aerosol; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; coal combustion; concentration (composition); elemental carbon; industrial emission; organic carbon; particulate matter; pollutant source; China; Huangshi; Hubei; carbon; coal; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; biomass; China; city; environmental monitoring; particle size; particulate matter; season; soot; statistics and numerical data; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Biomass; Carbon; China; Cities; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Soot",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031719051

The study constructed an evaluation framework of the direct and indirect CO2 emissions from tourism industry, and included the CO2 emission factor in the efficiency evaluation framework based on SBM-Undesirable model, on the basis of which, the study assessed the CO2 emissions from the tourism industry, taking the cities of Hubei province in China as case studies, and then measured and analyzed the development efficiency of low-carbon tourism economy in the cities and its dynamic fluctuations in the cities from 2007 to 2013. The results show that the total carbon dioxide emissions from tourism in Hubei soared from 6,340,302 tons in year 2007 to 23,939,851 tons in year 2013, with the transportation being the biggest contributor accounting for 50.35% of the total emissions, followed by the food, accommodation, shopping, other services, entertainment, post &amp; telecommunications. While the direct CO2 emission far exceeds that of the indirect in the transportation, the opposite is true in other secondary sectors. Results of efficiency measurement indicate the overall efficiency of low-carbon tourism economy is on a rather low level and varies significantly among the cities, and there are untapped potentials with internal productive factors in the economic system of urban tourism. From the perspective of dynamic shifts, however, the overall efficiency within the analyzed period was on an upward trend, driven primarily by the technological advancements induced by the scale factor, whereas the purely technological efficiency changes undermined the growth of productivity. Finally, the calculation results of slack variables in inputs and outputs based on the efficiency evaluation framework achieved in this study will provide reference for development efficiency modification of low-carbon tourism economy in inefficient cities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide emission; Cities; Efficiency; Low-carbon tourism","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; ecotourism; growth rate; tourism development; tourism economics; urban area; China; Hubei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050344563

Recycling can save a large amount greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in the case of aluminum. The parameter on the innovative technique on the direct recycling was investigated by employing design of experiments, via hot press forging process (DR-HPF). Thus, reutilizing of aluminum chips AA6061 with full factorial 32 design of experiment comprising a variety of working temperature and holding time were employed. Central composite design (CCD) was applied to outline the experiments towards evaluating the influences of the hot press forging parameters to the three responses; ultimate tensile strength (UTS), elongation to failure (ETF), and global warming potential (GWP). In conjunction with this, the environmental impacts associated with DR-HPF process are evaluated alongside the resultant conventional recycling (CR) by using re-melting route as indication. Experimental measurements, literature analysis and industrial data were merged to acquire the analysis of aluminum recycling life cycle. Clear conclusions were successfully drawn through the attained results on the outlook proposed by solid state direct recycling for the purpose of reducing the environmental effects by taking material and energy conservation as one of the most essential impacting factor. The global warming potential of a DR-HPF route gives a significant environmental impact where it is reduced up to 69.2% in comparison to the conventional (melting) routes. © 2019 by the authors.","Aluminum AA6061; Direct metal recycling; Hot press forging (HPF); Life cycle assessment (LCA); Response surface methodology (RSM); Sustainable manufacturing","Aluminum; Aluminum alloys; Design of experiments; Forging; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Melting; Presses (machine tools); Recycling; Tensile strength; Central composite designs; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Metal recycling; Multiresponse optimization; Response surface methodology; Sustainable manufacturing; Ultimate tensile strength; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067980863

Herein, the evolution of atomically dispersed Cu species supported by mesoporous TiO2 (mTiO2) during the in situ photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O to valuable solar fuels has been reported. The results unveil that the initial atomically dispersed Cu(II) undergoes reduction to Cu(I) and ultimately to Cu(0); the Cu(I)/Cu(0) mixture is proposed to be more effective for CH4 formation. In addition, the enhanced CO2 adsorption ability benefited from the structural advantage of mTiO2 and the elevated charge carrier transfer synergistically contributes to the CO2 photoreduction. It is anticipated that this work would guide the rational design of Cu-based light-harvesting catalysts for artificial CO2 reduction to value-added feedstocks and inspire further interest in using in situ techniques to study the structure-activity interplay of photocatalysts under operating reaction conditions. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","atomically dispersed; CO2 reduction; Cu species; dynamic evolution; photocatalysis","Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Fuels; Photocatalysis; Photocatalysts; Titanium dioxide; atomically dispersed; Charge carrier transfer; CO2 reduction; Cu species; Dynamic evolution; Operating condition; Photocatalytic reduction; Structural advantage; Copper compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065591842

Results showed that a low level (5%) of inoculation with mature compost significantly improved the biodrying index (4.96), while adding greater amounts decreased the biodrying performance by increasing the volatile solid degradation rate. Covering the pile with inoculation material resulted in the highest water removal (72.7%) and greatest water content reduction (from 60.2% to 17.7%). Meanwhile, first covering and then incorporating the inoculation material into the biodrying pile did not improve biodrying performance. Clearly, addition of varying amounts of inoculation material via different application methods enhanced cellulose degradation rates by 2.3–14.2%. Using 10% inoculation material reduced the NH3 emissions by 39.1–54.3% regardless of inoculation method, inoculation amount had a greater effect on NH3 emissions than that of inoculation method. The covering inoculation material could reduce 65.08% H2S emission, the inoculation method had a greater effect on H2S emissions than that of inoculation amount. Given the comprehensive considerations of emission reduction and biodrying performance, a covering of 10% inoculating material is a suitable approach to improve biodrying performance and mitigate odorous gases emissions. © 2019","Ammonia; Biodrying; Hydrogen sulfide; Inoculation; Moisture content; Municipal solid waste (MSW)","Ammonia; Composting; Degradation; Emission control; Hydrogen sulfide; Moisture; Odor control; Piles; Sulfur compounds; Application method; Bio-drying; Cellulose degradation; Content reduction; Emission reduction; Inoculation; Inoculation method; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Municipal solid waste; ammonia; biogas; cellulose; nitrogen; sulfur; fragrance; water; ammonia; cellulose; compost; degradation; hydrogen sulfide; inoculation; moisture content; municipal solid waste; odor; Article; biochemical composition; biodegradation; biodrying; concentration (parameter); controlled study; dry weight; inoculation; moisture; municipal solid waste; priority journal; waste water management; solid waste; waste disposal; Ammonia; Composting; Degradation; Hydrogen Sulfide; Moisture; Odor Control; Odorants; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065902486

This study presents distinct teleconnections between the SC precipitation in the two periods and the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical oceans. In the early rainy season when the major monsoon rain belt is located in SC, the increased local precipitation is related to the tropical Indian Ocean Basin warming. The basin warming induces an anomalous anticyclone in the South China Sea-western North Pacific (SCS-WNP). The related southwesterly anomalies transport more moisture to SC and lead to more moisture convergence and precipitation there. In the late rainy season when the major monsoon rain belt migrates northward to the Yangtze River valley, the precipitation increase in SC can be caused by the dipole SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific with the cold anomalies near the Maritime Continent and warm ones near the date line. The dipole SST anomalies generate an anomalous cyclone in the WNP with its center more northward than that of the anomalous anticyclone in the early rainy season. The related northeasterly anomalies along its northwestern flank reduce the climatological northward transport of moisture flux out of SC, and increase the moisture convergence and precipitation there. The distinct teleconnections between the SC precipitation and the tropical SSTs in the early and late rainy seasons can be well reproduced in the sensitivity experiments by an atmospheric general circulation model. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.","Atmosphere-ocean interaction; Atmospheric circulation; Interannual variability; Precipitation","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climatology; Moisture; Precipitation (chemical); Rain; Storms; Surface waters; Tropics; Atmosphere-ocean interactions; Atmospheric circulation; Atmospheric general circulation models; East Asian summer monsoon; Interannual variability; Interannual variation; Sea surface temperatures; Tropical Indian ocean; Oceanography; air-sea interaction; annual variation; atmospheric circulation; atmospheric general circulation model; atmospheric transport; moisture transfer; monsoon; precipitation (climatology); sea surface temperature; summer; teleconnection; China; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean (Tropical); Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Pacific Ocean (Tropical); South China Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066426975

These generally contain large numbers of species making it difficult to disentangle how the effects of different interactions scale with diversity. Here, we show that changing diversity affects measures of community function in relatively simple communities but that increasing richness beyond a threshold has little detectable effect. We generated self-assembled communities with a wide range of diversity by growth of cells from serially diluted seawater on brown algal leachate. We subsequently isolated the most abundant taxa from these communities via dilution-to-extinction in order to compare productivity functions of the entire community to those of individual taxa. To parse the effect of different types of organismal interactions, we defined relative total function (RTF) as an index for positive or negative effects of diversity on community function. Our analysis identified three overall regimes with increasing diversity. At low richness (<12 taxa), positive and negative effects of interactions were both weak, while at moderate richness (12–26 taxa), community resource uptake increased but the carbon use efficiency decreased. Finally, beyond 26 taxa, the effect of interactions on community function saturated and further diversity increases did not affect community function. Although more diverse communities had overall greater access to resources, on average individual taxa within these communities had lower resource availability and reduced carbon use efficiency. Our results thus suggest competition and complementation simultaneously increase with diversity but both saturate at a threshold. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"growth; microbial community; resource availability; species diversity; species richness; algae; sea water; bacterial phenomena and functions; bacterium; biodiversity; classification; ecology; genetics; isolation and purification; microbiology; microflora; Bacteria; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Biodiversity; Ecology; Microbiota; Seawater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062153799

This severely limits the predictive ability for both the potential enhancement of soil fertility and greenhouse gas mitigation. In this study, we utilized shotgun metagenomics in order to decipher changes in the microbial community in soil microcosms after 14 days of incubation at 23°C, which contained soils from biochar-amended and control plots cultivated with Napier grass. Our analyses revealed that biochar-amended soil microbiomes exhibited significant shifts in both community composition and predicted metabolism. Key metabolic pathways related to carbon turnover, such as the utilization of plant-derived carbohydrates as well as denitrification, were enriched under biochar amendment. These community shifts were in part associated with increased soil carbon, such as labile and aromatic carbon compounds, which was likely stimulated by the increased available nutrients associated with biochar amendment. These findings indicate that the soil microbiome response to the combination of biochar addition and to incubation conditions confers enhanced nutrient cycling and a small decrease in CO2 emissions and potentially mitigates nitrous oxide emissions. © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.","Biochar; Shotgun metagenomics; Soil microbiome","Greenhouse gases; Metabolism; Microorganisms; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Tropics; Bio chars; Carbonaceous compounds; Community composition; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Metagenomics; Microbial communities; Microbiome; Nitrous oxide emissions; Nutrients; agricultural soil; biochar; community composition; genomics; greenhouse gas; microbial community; nitrous oxide; nutrient cycling; Oxisol; soil ecosystem; soil fertility; soil microorganism; Pennisetum purpureum; biochar; carbon; carbon dioxide; charcoal; nitrous oxide; agriculture; biodiversity; chemistry; denitrification; drug effect; metabolism; metagenomics; microbiology; microflora; phylogeny; physiology; soil; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Charcoal; Denitrification; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Metagenomics; Microbiota; Nitrous Oxide; Nutrients; Phylogeny; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066443360

In order to increase public awareness and understanding of the damage caused by PM2.5 in the air and gain the attention of relevant management departments, Changsha City is used as the research object, and the environmental quality data and public health data of Changsha City from 2013 to 2017 are used. All-cause death, respiratory death, cardiovascular death, chronic bronchitis, and asthma were selected as the endpoints of PM2.5 pollution health effects, according to an exposure–response coefficient, Poisson regression model, and health-impact-assessment-related methods (the Human Capital Approach, the Willingness to Pay Approach, and the Cost of Illness Approach), assessing the health loss and economic loss associated with PM2.5. The results show that the pollution of PM2.5 in Changsha City is serious, which has resulted in extensive health hazards and economic losses to local residents. From 2013 to 2017, when annual average PM2.5 concentrations fell to 10 µg/m3, the total annual losses from the five health-effect endpoints were $2788.41 million, $2123.18 million, $1657.29 million, $1402.90 million, and $1419.92 million, respectively. The proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the current year was 2.69%, 1.87%, 1.34%, 1.04% and 0.93%, respectively. Furthermore, when the concentration of PM2.5 in Changsha City drops to the safety threshold of 10 µg/m3, the number of affected populations and health economic losses can far exceed the situation when it falls to 35 µg/m3, as stipulated by the national secondary standard. From 2013 to 2017, the total loss under the former situation was 1.48 times, 1.54 times, 1.86 times, 2.25 times, and 2.33 times that of the latter, respectively. Among them, all-cause death and cardiovascular death are the main sources of health loss. Taking 2017 as an example, when the annual average concentration dropped to 10 µg/m3, the health loss caused by deaths from all-cause death and cardiovascular disease was 49.16% of the total loss and 35.73%, respectively. Additionally, deaths as a result of respiratory disease, asthma, and chronic bronchitis contributed to 7.31%, 7.29%, and 0.51% of the total loss, respectively. The research results can provide a reference for the formulation of air pollution control policies based on health effects, which is of great significance for controlling air pollution and protecting people’s health. © 2019 by the authors.

However, luminescence self-quenching of CDs in an aggregated state limits the development of their applications necessarily demanding solid-state phosphors. Here, we report the origin of luminescence quenching of CDs in terms of the sp2 domain content, and we realized the solid-state luminescent CDs by controlling the degree of crystallinity. We compared self-quenched CDs and self-quenching-resistant CDs with structural analysis and figured out that a high mass ratio of urea regulated the amount of the sp2 domain in CDs, exhibiting yellow emission at 530 nm in a solid state. We also confirmed that through the carbonization time control, reducing the degree of crystallinity in CDs enabled initially nonluminescent CDs to show a quantum yield of 7.8% at 518 nm in the solid state, providing antiself-quenching property. This research would open the way to the development of solid-state CDs and their applications. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon; Carbonization; Crystallinity; Luminescence; Optoelectronic devices; Quenching; Urea; Carbon dots; Critical issues; Degree of crystallinity; Luminescence quenching; Mass ratio; Self-quenching; Time control; Yellow emissions; Quantum theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074426742

Recently, we have discovered ultrastable layered lead halide photoemitters overcoming the stability problems of perovskites, despite in need of deep-UV irradiation to achieve photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of over 10%. Herein, we have employed a robust, nonconjugated dicarboxylate ligand to pillar the cationic 1D [PbBr]+ chains. The unique corrugated stacking of [PbBr]+ chains facilitates the structural deformation to form self-trapped excitons, thus enabling an eightfold enhancement of PLQE over our previous reported bilayer bromoplumbate structures. The PLQE of 17.2% is not only among the highest in all of the layered lead halide white-light emitters, but overcoming the problem of our previous photoemitters requires deep-UV LED excitation. In addition, by tuning the stacking mode of the pillaring molecules, the chloride analog successfully incorporates a second photoluminescence center to the broadband emission from self-trapped excitons. The two-component emission strategy in [Pb2Cl2][O2C (C6H10)CO2] offers the intrinsic photoemitter to exhibit tunable cold-to-warm white light upon different excitation lights. The materials demonstrate high chemical robustness over a wide pH range (3-9) and undiminished photoluminescence in air upon UV irradiation for 30 days. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the broadband emission of both materials are induced by the structural deformation of [Pb2X2]2+ (X = Cl/Br) inorganic connectivity, which offers self-trapped electrons from Pb-Pb dimerization and self-trapped holes from Cl-Cl pairing in the excited states. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Binary alloys; Carboxylation; Chlorine compounds; Deformation; Density functional theory; Electron traps; Excitons; Irradiation; Perovskite; Photoluminescence; Broadband emission; Chemical robustness; Halide perovskites; Photoluminescence quantum efficiency; Self trapped electron; Self trapped excitons; Structural deformation; White light emission; Lead compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066882832

It is therefore important to review current knowledge and identify further directions in China, the largest developing country in the world. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine the relationship between climate variability and infectious disease transmission in China in the new millennium. Literature was identified using the following MeSH terms and keywords: climatic variables [temperature, precipitation, rainfall, humidity, etc.] and infectious disease [viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases]. Results: Fifty-eight articles published from January 1, 2000 to May 30, 2018 were included in the final analysis, including bacterial diarrhea, dengue, malaria, Japanese encephalitis, HFRS, HFMD, Schistosomiasis. Each 1 °C rise may lead to 3.6%–14.8% increase in the incidence of bacillary dysentery disease in south China. A 1 °C rise was corresponded to an increase of 1.8%–5.9% in the weekly notified HFMD cases in west China. Each 1 °C rise of temperature, 1％ rise in relative humidity and one hour rise in sunshine led to an increase of 0.90%, 3.99% and 0.68% in the monthly malaria cases, respectively. Climate change with the increased temperature and irregular patterns of rainfall may affect the pathogen reproduction rate, their spread and geographical distribution, change human behavior and influence the ecology of vectors, and increase the rate of disease transmission in different regions of China. Conclusion: Exploring relevant adaptation strategies and the health burden of climate change will assist public health authorities to develop an early warning system and protect China's population health, especially in the new 1.5 °C scenario of the newly released IPCC special report. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","China; Climate change; Health burden; Infectious disease","rain; bacterial disease; climate change; developing world; disease transmission; disease vector; dysentery; early warning system; future prospect; health care; human behavior; infectious disease; knowledge; pathogen; public health; rainfall; relative humidity; Article; behavior change; China; climate change; dengue; diarrhea; disease transmission; environmental impact; environmental temperature; geographic distribution; hand foot and mouth disease; hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome; human; humidity; Japanese encephalitis; knowledge; malaria; Medical Subject Headings; precipitation; priority journal; schistosomiasis; shigellosis; communicable disease; dengue; environmental exposure; incidence; temperature; China; Bacteria (microorganisms); Japanese encephalitis virus; China; Climate Change; Communicable Diseases; Dengue; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Humidity; Incidence; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063451987

A generalized additive model (GAM) and a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) were employed to assess the nonlinearity and the hysteresis of associations. We further explored the breakpoints to evaluate the existence of the threshold. The correlation between mortality and PM2.5 was nonlinear. The impact of average PM2.5 on non-accidental mortality (RR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.06, 1.16), cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality (RR = 1.17; 95% CI = 1.10, 1.24), and respiratory disease (RD) mortality (RR = 1.17; 95% CI = 1.10, 1.24) reached the highest in the current day (lag 0). The excess risks of PM2.5 at secondary standard level to non-accidental, CVD, and RD mortality are 8.79% (95% CI = 3.84, 13.98), 14.41% (95% CI = 7.79, 21.43), 15.35% (95% CI = 1.76, 30.74), respectively. The saturation points exist in highly polluted areas. Above the saturation points of 247 μg/m3 for non-accidental mortality, 245 μg/m3 for CVD mortality, and 250 μg/m3 for RD mortality, the model of all three relationships presented a harvesting effect. This study underscores the necessity of the ongoing efforts of reducing particulate air pollution and the adjustment of the standards in seriously polluted areas to adapt to regional conditions. At the same time, for highly polluted areas, it is advocated to strengthen personal protection to decrease the saturation point and control the concentration of pollutants as much as possible, which will substantially save more cost that benefits the public. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cardiovascular diseases; Particulate matter; Public health; Respiratory tract diseases","atmospheric pollution; cardiovascular disease; correlation; mortality risk; nonlinearity; particulate matter; pollution exposure; public health; respiratory disease; standard (regulation); China; Jinan [Shandong]; Shandong; air pollutant; analysis; cardiovascular disease; China; epidemiology; human; meteorological phenomena; mortality; particle size; particulate matter; respiratory tract disease; trends; Air Pollutants; Cardiovascular Diseases; China; Humans; Meteorological Concepts; Mortality; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Respiratory Tract Diseases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065535138

Among them, carbon-based perovskite solar cells seem to be one of the most promising candidates for addressing the stability issue while suffering from inferior efficiency or high processing temperature. Herein, we introduce low-temperature processed Zn-doped SnO 2 (below 200 °C) as an effective electron transport layer in perovskite solar cells for the first time, and demonstrate a low-temperature carbon-based device with Cu-phthalocyanine as hole transport layer. We find that Zn doping contributes to a more suitable energy level alignment and an improved conductivity for SnO 2 films. As a result, the electron transfer and extraction are enhanced and the charge recombination is suppressed. In addition, devices with Zn-doped SnO 2 have a wider depletion region, leading to an enhanced photovoltaic performance. An optimal efficiency of 17.78% can be obtained after 2 mM Zn doping. Furthermore, these devices, introducing highly stable and hydrophobic Cu-phthalocyanine and carbon, maintain almost 100% of their initial efficiencies over 1200 h in ambient air.

However, the current allocation method dominated by the grandfathering approach does not reflect this original intention well. Integrating the 3E goals with the quota allocation issue, this paper established a dual-objective programming model that considered both the economic and energy goals, while the environmental goal was reflected in constraints. Evidence from Guangdong Province revealed that the 3E approach was superior to the grandfathering approach in some respects. When the weight given to the energy goal was within a certain interval, the 3E approach could simultaneously optimize the total abatement cost and emission efficiency, which not only reflected the “polluter pays” principle but also avoided the possibility of windfall profits from the redundant quota. In other cases, the 3E approach could unilaterally improve the energy or economic goal to reflect decision preferences. Finally, the findings of this paper have important implications for policy makers seeking to develop new regulations for the national ETS. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide emission quotas; Dual-objective programming model; Emissions trading scheme; Energy-economy-environment system","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Emission control; Environmental management; Global warming; Allocation methods; Carbon dioxide emissions; Emission efficiencies; Emissions Trading Scheme; Environment systems; Environmental control; Initial allocations; Objective programming model; Sustainable development; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emissions trading; environmental economics; quota system; regulatory framework; sustainable development; article; carbon footprint; human; male; profit; China; Guangdong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063043660

However, to realize sustainable development, the photon energies utilized must be lower than the absorption edge of the materials including the metal complex for CO2 reduction, the electrodes for water splitting, because of the huge amount of lower energy than the visible region received from the sun. In the previous works, we had demonstrated that optical near-fields (ONFs) could realize chemical reactions, by utilizing photon energies much lower than the absorption edge because of the spatial non-uniformity of the electric field. In this paper, we demonstrate that an ONF can realize the red shift of the absorption spectra of the metal-complex material for photocatalytic reduction. By attaching the metal complex to ZnO nano-crystalline aggregates with nano-scale protrusions, the absorption spectra by using diffuse reflection of the metal complex can be shifted to a longer wavelength by 10.6 nm. The results of computational studies based on a first-principles computational program including the ONF effect provide proof of the increase in the absorption of the metal complex at lower photon energies. Since the near-field assisted field increase improves the carrier excitation in the metal-complex materials, this effect may be universal and it could applicable to CO2 reduction using the other metal-complex materials, as well as to the other photo excitation process including water splitting. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","CO2 reduction; metal complex; optical near-field","Absorption spectra; Carbon dioxide; Doppler effect; Electric fields; II-VI semiconductors; Image enhancement; Metal complexes; Metals; Nanotechnology; Photons; Red Shift; Water absorption; Zinc oxide; Carrier excitation; CO2 reduction; Computational program; Computational studies; High energy photons; Optical near field; Photo-excitation process; Photocatalytic reduction; Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069485340

While studies have shown that surface-based, geophysical monitoring methods may be sensitive enough to detect CO2 leakage, these methods are an indirect indicator of leakage. A drawback to relying on direct geochemical monitoring is that by the time a significant leak is confirmed, it may be too late to mitigate or remediate the environmental impacts. In this study, we combine information from geophysical and geochemical monitoring methods to provide an integrated diagnosis of leakage events. The detectability for various monitoring parameters (pH, TDS, alkalinity, Ca, Cl, Na, and pressure) collected from monitoring wells are evaluated by leakage detection probability, using simulated wellbore-leakage/plume-migration events and monitoring scenarios for a hypothetical GCS operation at the Kimberlina site in California, USA. The NUFT code is used to model these events, by coupling wellbore-leakage simulations to 3-dimensional reactive, multi-phase, flow and transport simulations of brine and CO2 leakage-plume migration in aquifers overlying the GCS reservoir. Wellbore leakage in legacy wells located 1.4, 3.4 and 6.8 km from the CO2 injector is evaluated for a range of (1) wellbore bottom-hole pressure and CO2 saturation determined by GCS simulations, (2) regional groundwater gradient in the aquifers, and (3) wellbore permeability. Simulated leakage-induced changes in seven monitoring parameters at different depths are used to calculate the corresponding detection probabilities, based on the background distribution data and selected monitoring-technology detection thresholds. The responses for these monitoring parameters are tested and combined to enhance the overall detectability. The results indicate the leakage signals are more easily detected at shallower depths where buoyant CO2 has migrated and flashed from supercritical to gas phase, causing a large increase in CO2 volume. While the results suggest pH monitoring is more responsive to the simulated leakage events than TDS monitoring at shallower depths, TDS changes may be more readily observed at greater depths. The addition of carbonate alkalinity can confirm CO2 leakage detection and help distinguish CO2 leakage from other contamination sources. Direct pressure change measurements are very sensitive to leakage, but the rapid and broad propagation of the pressure response hinders using such measurements to easily locate the origin of leakage. Combining measurements could greatly improve the confidence of leakage diagnosis. High bottom-hole CO2 saturation, such as that for a leaky well close to the injector (˜1.4 km), high regional groundwater gradient, and high wellbore permeabilities all increase the leakage plume size, and thus the leakage detectability. Our analysis suggests pressure monitoring is a valuable indicator of leakage events at early stages, while pH, TDS and carbonate alkalinity monitoring can directly diagnose leakage impacts by providing more detailed information in the groundwater receptor.

A diagnostic equation for estimating the daily maximum UHII (UHII max ), which is based on routine meteorological data and basic urban properties, was extensively tested with the long-term observations from the metropolis of Nanjing, China. The field measurement has been carried out based on the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) scheme, which is a standardized classification protocol for urban temperature studies. The temperature data set of 658 days collected from six different LCZ classes was used for testing. The results show that the diagnostic equation produced a robust and satisfactory estimation of the daily UHII max under various weather conditions. The overall performance of the equation for Nanjing, that has a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.95 °C and a median absolute error (MEAE) of 0.60 °C, closely approximates its performance for the 14 cities in northwestern Europe (RMSE = 0.91 °C, MEAE = 0.58 °C). The results also imply that the equation has the potential to be applicable to other cities. Another attempt in this study was to develop a method to apply the diagnostic equation to building energy simulations (BES). The hourly heat island intensities were derived from the estimated UHII max based on the typical diurnal pattern of UHII evolution. An apartment was modeled with the BES program EnergyPlus to examine the validity of the proposed method. Using the modeled and measured temperature data as the inputs in the EnergyPlus simulations, the annual, monthly, and hourly energy demands for cooling and heating were investigated and compared. For all the six LCZ sites except the large low-rise case (LCZ 8), the impacts of the heat island effects at the neighborhood scale on building energy performance were reasonably evaluated with the method. The limitations and perspectives of the equation and its application to BES have also been discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Building energy simulation; Diagnostic equation; Field observation; Local climate zone; Urban heat island","Buildings; Energy efficiency; Mean square error; Meteorology; Statistical tests; Thermal pollution; Building energy simulations; Diagnostic equation; Field observations; Local climate; Urban heat island; Atmospheric temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063744123

This unique DFDT is assembled from two Au-NP-attached central strands (C1 and C2) and an arm strand (A) dually ended by fluorophores Cy3 and Cy5, which are spatially separated from Au NP in the originally opened state. Through the competitive affinity interaction between targets and their complementary and aptamer sequences tethered in two recognition strands (R1 and R2), miRNA 21 and MUC1 are respectively converted into two dependently displaced fuel strands (F1 and F2). The next hybridization with two pairs of unpaired segments overhung in open DFDT leads to its conformational closure, resulting in the approach of Cy3 and Cy5 to Au NP. On the basis of the nanometal surface energy transfer scheme, the fluorescence emission of Cy3 or Cy5 is cooperatively quenched by Au NPs attached in C1 and C2. The significant variation of fluorescence intensity enables one-step, cost-effective, and specific quantization of miRNA 21 and MUC1 with high sensitivity down to 32 fM and 2.6 fg·mL-1 (8.5 pM), respectively.

A thorough understanding of various CH4 biogeochemical processes occurring in the ponds is essential for the prediction and management of CH4 emissions arising from aquaculture. However, the variations in pond CH4 biogeochemical processes among estuaries and aquaculture stages remain poorly understood. In this study, we assessed the net sediment release, oxidation, and dissolved concentrations of CH4 in aquaculture ponds in two subtropical estuaries among three shrimp growth stages in Southeast China. Overall, porewater CH4 concentrations and sediment CH4 release rates varied greatly among different stages in the order: middle stage &gt; final stage &gt; initial stage. Water column CH4 concentrations and overlying water CH4 oxidation rates showed an increasing trend over the study period. Sediment CH4 release rates and dissolved CH4 concentrations also varied considerably between the two estuaries. In the more saline Jiulong River Estuary, sediment CH4 release rate was lower while the shrimp survival rate and yield were higher as compared to the Min River Estuary with a lower water salinity. Our results suggest that both high water salinity and feed utilization efficiency can effectively mitigate CH4 emissions from the coastal shrimp ponds. Overall, the large magnitude of net CH4 emissions observed in our shrimp ponds highlights the urgency of formulating appropriate policies and building sustainable institutions that can strike a balance between land-based aquaculture development and greenhouse gas mitigation in the subtropical coastal regions. ©2019.

Climate variability can be caused by natural climate variability or human-caused climate variability. The analysis of Jinghe River Basin (JRB) may not be comprehensive because few studies have concentrated on natural climate variability. Therefore, the primary goal is to explore the impact of natural climate variability on runoff. A modified Mann–Kendall test method was adopted to analyze the aberrance point to determine the natural condition period during which runoff was only influenced by natural climate variability. Then, the Monte Carlo method was employed to extract segments of monthly runoff in the natural condition period and combine them to construct a long series to reduce the instability. Results indicate that the percentage of runoff variability affected by natural climate variability is 30.52% at a confidence level of 95%. Next, a topography-based hydrological model and climate elasticity method were used to simulate runoff after the aberrance point without considering the impact caused by local interference. Through a comparison of the measured and simulated runoff, we discovered that local interference has the greatest impact on runoff in the JRB. © IWA Publishing 2019.","Climate elasticity method; Monte Carlo method; Natural climate variability; Topography-based hydrological model","Climatology; Elasticity; Hydrology; Monte Carlo methods; Runoff; Testing; Topography; Climate elasticity method; Climate variability; Confidence levels; Global climates; Hydrological modeling; Jinghe rivers; Natural climate variabilities; Natural conditions; Climate models; climate change; climate effect; climate variation; comparative study; computer simulation; hydrological modeling; Monte Carlo analysis; numerical model; runoff; topographic effect; China; Jing Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052004520

The microstructure as a function of heat treatment temperature was characterized by means of XRD, HRTEM and Raman spectra. It is found that the amorphous carbon content decreases with increasing heat treatment temperature and that the densities of the carbon fibers increase is due to the removal of the impurity elements and the shrinking of the graphite planes. The amorphous carbon parallel to the graphite planes transforms into graphite planes and stacks on the graphite crystallites, leading to the increase in the graphite crystallite thickness. And the graphite crystallite length is increased through the amorphous-to-crystallite transition which occurs at the edges of graphite planes and the coalescence between two adjacent graphite crystallites. It is found that the tensile behavior of PAN-based carbon fibers mainly depends on the microstructure evolution of amorphous carbon. The reactions between sp2 carbon clusters and graphite planes improve the cross-linking among graphite crystallites, which has a positive effect on the tensile strength of the carbon fibers. However, a large number of structural defects and residual stresses, introduced by the rearrangement of graphite planes, are the main reasons for the degradation of the tensile strength. The tensile strains of the carbon fibers decrease and the tensile modulus increase with the decrease in the amorphous carbon content, which are mainly due to the amorphous-to-crystallite transition in the skin region. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"Carbon fibers; Crosslinking; Crystallites; Graphite; Heat treatment; Microstructure; Removal; Shrinkage; Tensile strength; Graphite crystallites; Heat treatment temperature; Impurity element; Micro-structure evolutions; PAN based carbon fiber; Polyacrylonitrile (PAN); Structural defect; Tensile behaviors; Amorphous carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062675632

With this initiative, low-income and emerging economies in these regions that have substantial dependencies on primary economic activities are likely to experience massive urbanization and associated environmental impacts such as unwanted immigration, regional air/water pollution, and carbon emissions. In the long term, negative unforeseen consequences to local and global environments can severely undermine the credibility of the OBOR and its participating countries. In the paper, we focus specifically on the energy sector, using the Port of Baku in Azerbaijan as a case study, to demonstrate the impact of greening infrastructure investments in the OBOR. After presenting the business as usual scenario for future energy consumption in the Port of Baku, namely using fossil fuel to power the Port, we present a port-greening scenario, namely using wind energy to power the Port. The results show that if a small portion of funds, namely 5% of total investment, is added on the top of total capital investment budget for new renewable energy investments, the Port will become green, and each dollar of the marginal greening investment can lead to 424 kg of carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction. If the case is applicable to 10% of infrastructure investments under the OBOR, a total of $20 billion is needed, and the marginal investments will likely mitigate a total of 8.48 billion tonnes of CO2. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon emission reductions through foreign direct investment; Green infrastructure; Wind farm in the Port of Baku","alternative energy; capital provision; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; energy use; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; foreign direct investment; infrastructural development; urbanization; wind farm; wind power; Africa; Azerbaijan; Baku; Central Asia; Europe; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055887174

As an important component of the biogeochemical cycle, carbon flows through various natural and artificial processes. Therefore, carbon can be used as a research vector to explore the relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being. This study proposed a method for a quantitative assessment of “ecosystem services-human well-being” based on carbon flows. The assessment of the changes in ecosystem services and human well-being based on carbon in the Manas River Basin from 1990 to 2015 revealed the complex relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being. The results were as follows: (1) The development of ecosystem services was uneven, with increasing provisioning services and decreasing regulating, supporting and cultural services. (2) The basic materials for a good life and health in human well-being showed an upward trend, and the security indicator showed a downward trend. (3) The indicators of the basic materials for a good life and health were significantly positively correlated with provisioning services and were significantly negatively correlated with the other three services. Moreover, the internal structure of the security and health indicators were malformed. (4) Over time, the impact of provisioning services on the well-being indicators has gradually weakened, and the influence of regulating, supporting and cultural services has continually increased. In general, this study evaluated the complex relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being through carbon flow quantification, which can not only unify the dimensions for comparison, but also eliminate the impact of subjective factors to achieve a scientific nature.

Extensive OCB is detected during harvest seasons in most regions of China. Emissions from OCB have been widely investigated in China, but few studies have focused on regional discrepancies in spatiotemporal variations with a long timescale. In this study, emissions from OCB in three typical regions of China, including Northeast China, Chengdu-Chongqing and Guangdong, from 2003 to 2016, were estimated using a combination of statistical data and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations, and regional discrepancies in spatiotemporal variations and driving forces were analyzed in detail. The results showed that OCB emissions of CO and PM 2.5 in 2016 were 3.63 × 10 6 and 6.96 × 10 5 tons in Northeast China, 9.77 × 10 5 and 1.36 × 10 5 tons in Chengdu-Chongqing, and 1.24 × 10 5 and 1.19 × 10 4 tons in Guangdong, respectively. The OCB emissions in Northeast China maintained an overall increasing trend, which were mainly dominated by rural economic development and agricultural modernization, with great potential for reduction. In Chengdu-Chongqing, emissions increased until 2013 and then decreased, due to the impact of policies prohibiting OCB. In Guangdong, emissions showed annual fluctuations with a slightly decreasing trend influenced by metrological conditions and related policies. The analysis of the driving forces behind the regional discrepancies among these typical regions indicated that OCB emissions in China were characterized by uneven rural economic development, control policies, and natural conditions, suggesting that region-dependent control measures are needed for reducing OCB emissions. This study provided a better understanding of OCB emission characteristics in the three typical regions and revealed the diversity of OCB emission characteristics in China. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Driving forces; Long timescale; Open crop residue burning; Regional discrepancies; Spatiotemporal variations","Agricultural wastes; Crops; Radiometers; Crop residue burning; Driving forces; Regional discrepancies; Spatio-temporal variation; Time-scales; Economic and social effects; aerosol; crop residue; emission; modernization; MODIS; particulate matter; spatiotemporal analysis; trace gas; air analysis; air pollution; air quality; Article; carbon footprint; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; economic development; environment; environmental impact; geographic distribution; open crop residue burning; priority journal; trend study; urbanization; Chengdu; China; Chongqing; Guangdong; Sichuan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063459578

It is our responsibility to notify the environmental attitude and behaviour so that the environmental pollution problem might be reduced dramatically. Shanghai has advocated the concept of energy-saving and low-carbon life since 2009. Therefore, this study tries to understand the current problem of environmental pollution, the degree of public awareness and recognition of low-carbon behaviours. In this study, the New Environmental Paradigm (NEP) scale was cited as the survey item of environmental attitude. Meanwhile, according to the low-carbon strategy advocated at present, the recognition scale of low-carbon behaviours was sorted out by combining the analysis of Shanghai's urban environment status and the daily life behaviours of citizens. This study adopts the form of network questionnaire to investigate, recover and analyze (N=219). According to the NEP scale score, the sample was divided into three attitude groups as high, medium and low. According to the analysis of one-way ANOVA, the recognition of different attitude groups on low-carbon strategy related behaviours was significantly different. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Energy conservation; Pollution; Surveys; Current problems; Environmental attitudes; Environmental pollution problem; Environmental pollutions; Low-carbon lives; Low-carbon strategies; Public awareness; Urban environments; Carbon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067892171

PM2.5, also known as fine particulate matter, refers to particles in the atmosphere with a diameter of less than or equal to 2.5 microns. PM2.5 has a serious impact on human life, a sustainable city, national economic development, and so on. How to forecast the PM2.5 concentration accurately, and then formulate a scientific air pollution prevention and monitoring program is of great significance. This paper proposes a hybrid model based on echo state network (ESN) and an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm for the Beijing air pollution problem, and provides a method for PM2.5 concentration forecasting. Firstly, the PSO algorithm is improved to speed up the search performance. Secondly, the optimal subset of the original data is selected by the convergence cross-mapping (CCM) method. Thirdly, the phase space reconstruction (PSR) process is combined with the forecasting model, and some parameters are optimized by the IPSO. Finally, the optimal variable subset is used to predict PM2.5 concentration. The 11-dimensional air quality data in Beijing from January 1 to December 31, 2016 are analyzed by the proposed method. The experimental results show that the hybrid method is superior to other comparative models in several evaluation indicators, both in one-step and multi-step forecasting of PM2.5 time series. The hybrid model has good application prospects in air quality forecasting and monitoring. © 2019 by the authors.","Air quality; ESN; Hybrid model; PM2.5 forecasting; PSO; Sustainable development","air quality; algorithm; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; data assimilation; diameter; optimization; particle size; particulate matter; reconstruction; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067288209

This study presents an optimization approach using computational performance simulation. With a genetic algorithm using the Grasshopper tool, this study analyzed the layout and configuration of urban open space and its impact on the urban micro-climate under summer and winter conditions. The outdoor mean Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) was applied as the performance indicator for evaluating the quality of the urban micro-climate. Two cases—one testbed and one real urban block in Nanjing, China—were used to validate the computer-aided simulation process. The optimization results in the testbed showed UTCI values varied from 36.5 to 37.3 °C in summer and from −4.9 to −1.9 °C in winter. In the case of the real urban block, optimization results show, for summer, although the average UTCI value increased by 0.6 °C, the average air velocity increased by 0.2 m/s; while in winter, the average UTCI value increased by 1.7 °C and the average air velocity decreased by 0.2 m/s. These results demonstrate that the proposed computer-aided optimization process can improve the thermal comfort conditions of open space in urban blocks. Finally, this study discusses strategies and guidelines for the layout design of urban open space to improve urban environment comfort. © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","cold winter and hot summer climate; performance-driven optimization; universal thermal climate index; urban design; urban open space layout","Genetic algorithms; Testbeds; Urban growth; Climate index; Performance-driven; Summer climate; Urban design; urban open space layout; Air",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064627306

By initially labeling the Salmonella strains with deuterium, we employed reverse labeling to track their metabolic changes in the time-course infection of THP-1 cell line, human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) and macrophages (Mf). We found that, in comparison with a noninvasive serovar, the invasive Salmonella strains Ty2 and D23580 have downregulated metabolic activity inside human macrophages and dendritic cells and used lipids as alternative carbon source, perhaps a strategy to escape from the host immune response.

Here, a novel, efficient and environmentally friendly recycling process has been developed to recover high performance LiFePO 4 nano composites from spent LiFePO 4 materials. The process comprises an intensive mechanochemical activation through mixing with precursor mixture and one-step solid state heat treatment. Spent LiFePO 4 , V 2 O 5 , Li 2 CO 3 , and NH 4 H 2 PO 4 are mixed according to the molar ratio of 1-xLiFePO 4 @xLi 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 (x = 0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.1). In the typical process, the decomposition of self-contained binder and the conductive carbon provide a reducing environment as well as an in-situ coating carbon source. The SEM, XRD and XPS results illustrate that V 5+ is doped in the Fe 2+ site when x &lt; 0.01, with co-existence of V 5+ doping and Li 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 when x ≥ 0.03.

Natural gas is a high thermal and low-emission energy. Expanding natural gas consumption cannot only meet the growing demand for energy consumption but also optimize energy consumption structure. Therefore, many scholars have investigated the effect of natural gas consumption on CO2 emissions. However, ignoring a large number of nonlinear relationships between economic variables, the vast majority of existing studies use traditional linear models to explore the relationships between natural gas consumption and CO2 emissions. In order to make up for the gap in existing research, this paper uses the nonparametric additive regression model with data-driven features to investigate the relationships between the two. The results show that natural gas consumption has an inverted “U-shaped” nonlinear effect on CO2 emissions in the eastern region, but a positive “U-shaped” nonlinear effect in the central and western regions. The linear impact of natural gas consumption on CO2 emissions in the eastern and central regions is higher than that in the western region, due to the differences in resource availability and energy prices, as well as natural gas consumption. Therefore, during the process of promoting natural gas consumption, the central and local governments should adopt heterogeneous measures at different stages of development. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 emissions; Natural gas consumption; Nonparametric additive regression model","Additives; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Regression analysis; Additive regression; CO2 emission reduction; CO2 emissions; Economic variables; Energy consumption structure; Natural gas consumption; Non-linear relationships; Resource availability; Natural gas wells; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; energy use; natural gas; regression analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065074573

In arid deserts, the roles of wetlands are particularly important. The Hongjian Nur region (HJN), which has the largest desert freshwater lake in China, is not only a national reserve but also the largest breeding ground for Larus relictus in the world. However, due to climate change and human activities, extensive wetland changes have occurred in the HJN region in recent decades. To investigate the changes of wetlands in the HJN region, the dynamics of wetlands and surrounding land cover types in this region over the past three decades were studied using remote sensing. In addition, how these dynamics have been affected by climatic and human factors was analyzed. The results suggested that the area of wetlands presented a decreasing trend over the studied time period from 62.54 km 2 to 35.89 km 2 , with an average rate of change of −0.66 km 2 /year. The reduction in wetland area was mainly caused by climatic and human factors. The contribution of temperature and precipitation to vegetation growth were small, and the impacts of human activities on the wetland areas of the HJN region were mainly caused by agricultural irrigation, artificial surface expansion and ecological water use. The results also suggested that human activities in arid regions may have negative impacts on fragile wetland ecosystems. © 2019","Cultivated land change; Ecological restoration projects; NDVI; Vegetation change","Aquatic ecosystems; Arid regions; Climate change; Human engineering; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Agricultural irrigation; Artificial surfaces; Cultivated lands; Ecological restoration; NDVI; Vegetation change; Vegetation growth; Wetland ecosystem; Wetlands; agricultural land; breeding site; climate change; climate effect; desert; desert soil; environmental restoration; land cover; NDVI; restoration ecology; seabird; temperature effect; wetland; China; Hongjiannao Lake; Shaanxi; Larus relictus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059951591

This technology is more appealing when CO2 is flexibly reduced to chemicals and fuels driven by surplus electricity because it represents a low-cost and controllable approach to maximized electricity utilization and value-added CO2 utilization. Nonaqueous metal-CO2 batteries exhibited high discharge voltage and capacity with carbon and oxalate as reduction products from CO2 electrochemistry that lacks proton. In contrast, aqueous Zn-CO2 batteries implemented flexible CO2 electrochemistry for more value-added products accompanied by energy storage based on a proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism.In this Account, we have exemplified our recent results in the development of CO2 electrochemistry from nonaqueous Li-CO2 batteries to aqueous Zn-CO2 batteries toward practical value-added CO2 conversion. Aimed at the challengingly limited CO2 electrochemistry and high cost of nonaqueous Li-CO2 batteries, we proposed aqueous Zn-CO2 batteries. Our previous works on nonaqueous Li-CO2 batteries, aqueous Zn-air batteries, and aqueous CO2 reduction electrocatalysts further shed light on battery mechanism, device construction, and electrocatalyst design. For example, bipolar membranes maintain the stability of the basic anolyte and neutral catholyte, as well as the kinetics of ion transport at the same time, forming the device base for aqueous Zn-CO2 batteries. Moreover, in terms of the electrocatalyst catalyzing both discharge and charge reactions on the cathode, the design of multifunctional electrocatalysts is of great importance for not only CO2 electrochemistry but also spontaneous discharge and energy efficiency of aqueous Zn-CO2 batteries. We have explored a series of multifunctional electrocatalyst cathodes, including noble metal, transition metal, and metal-free materials, all of which facilitated CO2 electrochemistry in aqueous Zn-CO2 batteries with value-added carbon-based products. Meanwhile, several operating models for practical complicated situations are presented, such as rechargeable, reversible, dual-model, and solid-state batteries. Zn-CO2 batteries with different models require different design mechanisms for electrocatalyst cathodes. Reversible aqueous Zn-CO2 batteries with HCOOH generation were enabled by electrocatalysts capable of catalyzing the interconversion of CO2 and HCOOH at low overpotentials, rechargeable aqueous Zn-CO2 batteries were allowed by electrocatalysts capable of catalyzing efficient CO2 reduction and O2 evolution, and dual-model aqueous Zn-CO2 batteries were realized by electrocatalysts capable of catalyzing CO2 reduction, water oxidation, and oxygen reduction.

The situation of mountain communities in the Pamir and Tien Shan mountains in Central Asia is exacerbated by remote location, difficult access, and poorly maintained infrastructure as well as by a distinctly continental climate. Designing and implementing climate adaptation policies for mountainous Central Asia is hindered by the limited understanding of a wide range of environmental and socio-ecological parameters. In particular, there are major knowledge gaps on the temperature and precipitation trends in high altitudes of the Pamir and Tien Shan mountains which are the result of poor and frequently unreliable data. These knowledge and date constraints have a negative effect also on forecasting the occurrence and intensity of extreme weather events which constitute a major hazard for local communities residing in the mountain foothills. This study reviews the state of research on climate change and climate change adaptation in mountainous Central Asia, also considering temperature and precipitation projections for the region. This includes an outline of the geophysical and socio-economic conditions of mountainous Central Asia as well as a survey of climate adaptation initiatives and policies currently implemented in the Pamir and Tien Shan mountain region with special consideration of their limitations and challenges.

Based on satellite observations along with the ERA-Interim reanalysis meteorology, this study examines the difference of vegetation characteristics, local wind speed, and surface temperature between the wind power regions and adjacent comparison areas in XilinGol. It shows that the construction of wind farms results in significant differences (p = 0.01) of normalized difference vegetation index values in the study areas compared to the adjacent areas in summer. The construction of the wind farms in study area has considerable influence on the change of local vegetation growth and related meteorological variables. It reduces the fraction of grassland, disrupts the wind field when speed are less than 4 m/s, and changes the spatial pattern of temperature during daytime and nighttime.

Essentially, the issue of national carbon quota allocation is an allocation among China’s provinces. The novel bi-level allocation scheme that is based on weighted voting model is put forward, which divides allocation process into two levels, given that there are great regional differences in China. At the first level, k-means clustering is employed to cluster 29 provinces into four categories that are based on emission abatement responsibility, potential, capacity, pressure, and motivation. Subsequently, the national carbon quotas are allocated to the four classes. At the second level, carbon quotas of a class are allocated to each region in this class. The weighted voting models are constructed for the two levels, where each region selects their preferable scheme from three fundamental allocation schemes that are based on their voting rights. The comprehensive index method quantifies each region’s voting rights, which utilizes the information entropy method at the first level and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) at the second level. The carbon trading market is simulated and welfare effects obtained from carbon trading market under different allocation schemes are measured to verify the rationality of the proposed model. The results indicate: (1) the emission abatement burdens are borne by all provinces in China, but the burden shares are different, which are related to their respective carbon emission characteristics.

Scholarship reveals, however, that solutions to the problem of climate change, like biofuel production, carbon capture, and ‘climate-smart’ industrial agriculture, are exacerbating both conflict and environmental change. This contradiction is created in part by long-standing and unchanging policies regarding societal security, which legitimizes economic development's extractive resource transformations to avert conflict, incorporates climate change mitigation and adaptation into a development framework, and exacerbates the environmental crises of over-development. On a positive note, the obvious failure of these policies gives rise to social and scientific collaborations that disrupt the conflict scenarios promoting continued economic growth as the path to peace.

Nevertheless, uncertainty and inherent intermittence of renewable power generation units impose severe stresses on power systems. Energy storage systems such as battery energy storage system enables the power grid to improve acceptability of intermittent renewable energy generation. To do so, a successful coordination between renewable power generation units, ESSs and the grid is required. Nonetheless, with the existing grid architecture, achieving the aforementioned targets is intangible. In this regard, coupling renewable energy systems with different generation characteristics and equipping the power systems with the battery storage systems require a smooth transition from the conventional power system to the smart grid. Indeed, this coordination requires not only robust but also innovative controls and models to promote the implementation of the next-generation grid architecture. In this context, the present research proposes a smart grid architecture depicting a smart grid consisting of the main grid and multiple embedded micro-grids. Moreover, a focus has been given to micro-grid systems by proposing a “Micro-grid Key Elements Model” (MKEM). The proposed model and architecture are tested and validated by virtualization. The implementation of the virtualized system integrates solar power generation units, battery energy storage systems with the proposed grid architecture. The virtualization of the proposed grid architecture addresses issues related to Photovoltaic (PV) penetration, back-feeding, and irregularity of supply. The simulation results show the effect of Renewable Energy (RE) integration into the grid and highlight the role of batteries that maintain the stability of the system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Micro-grid; Renewable sources; Smart grid; Storage energy; Virtualization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066298469

Yet such cities have been neglected in energy geography research, despite a remarkable invigoration of the subfield in recent years. Drawing on examples from around the world as well as historical examples, this paper argues that energy boomtowns are a vital feature of the expansive geographies of energy uses. It further argues that energy boomtowns must be seen as the confluence of four areas or dimensions: regional transformation; conflicts in city politics, governance and planning; legitimation of carbon economies; and social disruption. Each of these reveals the social production of energy and the frequently contentious process of urban space production. While the recurring emergence of energy boomtowns is of empirical interest, the turbulent setting of the boomtown can also reveal much about the social stakes of energy uses through their intersections with place-specific, urban-focused development agendas.

Existing methods to quantify global OH are limited to annual and global-to-hemispheric averages. Finer resolution is essential for isolating model deficiencies and building process-level understanding. In situ observations from the Atmospheric Tomography (ATom) mission demonstrate that remote tropospheric OH is tightly coupled to the production and loss of formaldehyde (HCHO), a major hydrocarbon oxidation product. Synthesis of this relationship with satellite-based HCHO retrievals and model-derived HCHO loss frequencies yields a map of total-column OH abundance throughout the remote troposphere (up to 70% of tropospheric mass) over the first two ATom missions (August 2016 and February 2017). This dataset offers unique insights on near-global oxidizing capacity. OH exhibits significant seasonality within individual hemispheres, but the domain mean concentration is nearly identical for both seasons (1.03 ± 0.25 × 106 cm−3), and the biseasonal average North/South Hemisphere ratio is 0.89 ± 0.06, consistent with a balance of OH sources and sinks across the remote troposphere. Regional phenomena are also highlighted, such as a 10-fold OH depression in the Tropical West Pacific and enhancements in the East Pacific and South Atlantic. This method is complementary to budget-based global OH constraints and can help elucidate the spatial and temporal variability of OH production and methane loss. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Currently, there are eight biogas plants in Poland, where municipal waste is the feedstock for the fermentation process, but in the future, it is likely that much more will be built. For this reason, it is very important to characterise the sources of odour emissions in the plants in order to prevent complaints from residents of the region. The paper presents results of preliminary research in the field of identification and characteristic of odour sources in two selected biogas plants processing municipal waste in Poland: Wólka Rokicka-WR and Stalowa Wola-SW. The basic sources of odour were identified in relation to the biological treatment process and the pre-treatment of waste. The odour intensity and the concentration of odour and leading impurities were analysed. Results of the research of various technological solutions carried out in biogas plants were compared. The majority of big concentrations of odour and odorants are related to the operation of the biological part of both plants. The study revealed a strong dependency between the applied operation procedures, technological regime and the obtained measurement results. The highest correspondence between the results was obtained in both tested installations in the case of odour intensity and odour concentration, and in the case of concentration of NH3 and VOC. © 2019, The Author(s).","Biogas plant; Fermentation; Municipal waste; Odour nuisance","Ammonia; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Odors; Alternative energy; Biological treatment process; Comparative analysis; Fermentation process; Odour concentrations; Operation procedure; Technological regime; Technological solution; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100681894

We analysed how continued warming over the 21st century would affect the distribution of eelgrass Zostera marina, the dominant seagrass in the Northwest Atlantic and provider of essential ecosystem functions and services. We compiled presence-only occurrence records and built a species distribution model using Maxent to determine a present-day distribution, which was compared to physiological thresholds for eelgrass growth and reproduction. Present-day models were then projected to mid- (2040−2050) and end-century (2090−2100) using 2 contrasting emissions scenarios and different global climate models. Our projections suggest an average shift of the southern range limit by 1.41°N to the north under a strong mitigation scenario (RCP 2.6) and 6.48°N under a business-as-usual emissions scenario (RCP 8.5) by 2100, resulting in substantial loss of eelgrass habitat along the eastern coast of the USA. The northern edge shift was less certain, yet resulted in an expansion of total eelgrass habitat. To minimize the extent of eelgrass bed extinction and areas of reduced growth along the southern range, strong climate mitigation is critical. Moreover, warm-temperature stress in reduced-growth areas will greatly increase the susceptibility of eelgrass to other natural or anthropogenic stressors. Our results can inform coastal management and conservation planning to protect the essential structure, functions and services provided by eelgrass in a warming climate. © Inter-Research 2019","Climate warming; Coastal habitat; Extinction; Maxent; Physiological threshold; Range expansion; Seagrass beds; Species distribution model (SDM)","climate change; coastal zone; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; extinction risk; global warming; growth response; population distribution; range expansion; seagrass; seagrass meadow; software; Atlantic Coast [North America]; Atlantic Coast [United States]; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northwest); United States; Zostera marina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067576279

In most cases, the basic elements of public transport are the bus transport subsystem. Currently, in addition to criteria such as punctuality, the frequency of departures, and the number of transfers, a travelling comfort level is an important element for passengers. An overcrowded bus may discourage travelers from choosing this mode of transport and induce them to use a private car despite the existence of many other facilities offered by a given public transport system. Therefore, the forecasting of bus passenger demand, as well as bus occupancy at individual bus stops, is currently an important research direction. The main goal of the article is to present the conceptual framework for the Advanced Travel Information System with the prediction module. The proposed approach assumes that the prediction module is based on the use of the Markov Chain concept. The efficiency and accuracy of the obtained prediction were presented based on a real-life example, where the measurements of passengers boarding and alighting at bus stops were made in a selected Cracow bus line. The methodology presented in the paper and the obtained results can significantly contribute to the development of solutions and systems for a better management as well as a cost and energy consumption optimisation in the public transport system. Current and forecasted information related to bus occupancy, when properly used in the travel information system, may have a positive impact on the development of urban mobility patterns by encouraging the use of public transport. This article addresses the current and practical research problem using an adequate theoretical mathematical tool to describe it, reflecting the characteristics and nature of the phenomenon being studied. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the article deals for the first time with the problem of prediction of onboard bus comfort levels based on in-vehicle occupancy. © 2019 by the authors.","Bus passenger occupancy prediction; Markow chain; Onboard comfort level",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068080362

We describe here the development and application of a multiphysics model to investigate the fundamental limitations of two MEA designs: one with gaseous feeds at both the anode and cathode (full-MEA), and the other with an aqueous anode feed (KHCO3 or KOH exchange solution) and a gaseous cathode feed (exchange-MEA). The total current density for the three cases follows the order: KOH-MEA &gt; KHCO3-MEA &gt; full-MEA. This trend is established by examining the distribution of the applied voltage. We show that the main charge-carrying species are carbonate anions for an MEA that uses an anion-exchange membrane (AEM). The amount of CO2 consumed but not converted to CO decreases with increasing current densities above 100 mA cm-2 for a full-MEA, but converges to 50% for exchange-MEAs. The full-MEA becomes limited by ohmic resistance as the membrane dehydrates with increasing cell temperature, and eventually becomes limited due to water mass transport. The exchange-MEAs can maintain membrane hydration and the local ion concentration at the anode, but are limited by salt precipitation at the cathode, as well as a higher tendency to flood.

The study employs a panel data set during 2001–2015 and adopts a non-parametric additive regression model to analyse the drivers of commercial department's carbon dioxide emissions in China. Non-parametric additive regression model based on the provincial panel data is first applied to investigate the carbon dioxide emissions in China's commercial department. The consequences demonstrate that the nonlinear impact of economic growth upon carbon dioxide emissions is in accordance with the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. Energy intensity is currently in the left half of the “overturned U-shaped” relationship. In the long run, the overturned “U-shaped” impact of energy intensity may be due to the discrepant level of technological development in different phases. Nevertheless, the urbanization demonstrates an erected “U-shaped” impact on carbon dioxide emissions owing to the further urban commercial consumption and fixed asset investment in recent times. Aggregate population presents a fast-to-slow growth relationship, which is the result that residents require massive commercial goods with the augment in population and income. Energy structure also reveals an erected “U-shape” relationship on account of slight electricity consumption in former times and the large amount of thermal power consumption in later phases.

Root production and turnover in response to clipping have great implications for the plant survival strategy and grassland ecosystem carbon processes. However, our knowledge about the clipping effect on root dynamics is mainly based on root living biomass, and limited by the lack of spatial and temporal observations. The study aim was to investigate the effect of clipping on seasonal variations in root length production and mortality and their distribution patterns in different soil layers in semiarid grassland on the Loess Plateau. Methods: Clipping was performed once a year in June to mimic the local spring livestock grazing beginning from 2014. The minirhizotron technique was used to monitor the root production, mortality and turnover rate at various soil depths (0-10, 10-20, 20-30 and 30-50 cm) in 2014 (from 30 May to 29 October) and 2015 (from 22 April to 25 October). Soil temperature and moisture in different soil layers were also measured during the study period. Important Findings: Our results showed that: (i) Clipping significantly decreased the cumulative root production (P < 0.05) and increased the cumulative root mortality and turnover rates of the 0-50 cm soil profile for both years. (ii) Clipping induced an immediate and sharp decrease in root length production and an increase in root length mortality in all soil layers. However, with plant regrowth, root production increased and root mortality decreased gradually, with the root production at a depth of 30-50 cm even exceeding the control in September-October 2014 and April-May 2015. (iii) Clipping mainly reduced root length production and increased root length mortality in the upper 0-20 cm soil profile with rapid root turnover. However, roots at deeper soil layers were either little influenced by clipping or exhibited an opposite trend with slower turnover rate compared with the upper soil profile, leading to the downward transport of root production and living root biomass. These findings indicate that roots in deeper soil layers tend to favour higher root biomass and longer fine root life spans to maximize the water absorption efficiency under environmental stress, and also suggest that short-term clipping would reduce the amount of carbon through fine root litter into the soil, especially in the shallow soil profile. © The Author(s) 2019.","clipping; root dynamics; seasonal variation in root growth; temperate grassland; vertical root distribution",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076412212

There is however a lack of understanding of the gas displacement behaviors at pore-scale especially under reservoir conditions. Herein we conducted an experimental investigation of CO2 and N2 flooding in the Lucaogou tight formation at 35.0 MPa and 80 °C. The flooding dynamics were continuously monitored by use of low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to map the displacement processes at pore-scale and quantify the reduction of oil saturation in-situ. We observed that the overall oil recoveries of CO2 and N2 flooding were 38.4% and 35.1%, respectively. Due to the interactions between the oil phase and CO2, a uniform displacement along the core plug was yielded by CO2 flushing, indicated by the 1D spatial distribution of local oil saturation and 2D transverse images. Interestingly, during CO2 flooding, the major reduction of NMR T2 signals occurred in the large pores (4.2 ms &lt; T2 &lt; 252.4 ms), whereas in the case of N2 flooding, the main change was found both in small pores (T2 &lt; 4.5 ms) and large pores (4.5 ms &lt; T2 &lt; 432.3 ms).

However, the carbon storage, as simulated by terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs), exhibits considerable inconsistency at the regional or global scale because the model structure, input dataset, and key parameter are quite different in TBMs. In this study, I proposed a detachable carbon cycle (DCC) model to simulate terrestrial carbon storage, internal carbon exchange, and the influx–efflux (IE) function of each carbon pool. The model was established based on a pool–and–flux scheme and contained 14 carbon pools, or carbon flow processes. Each process can be detached from the primary model and evaluated as an independent component. The average net primary productivity (NPP) from 1982 to 2008 was used as the influx carbon to drive the DCC model. The magnitude of the internal carbon exchanges of the DCC model was explicitly represented, and the carbon IE function of each carbon pool was fitted based on the characteristics of carbon flux. Results indicated that the terrestrial carbon storage was 2766.25 Pg, and carbon stored in vegetation and soil was 705.85 and 2022.00 Pg, respectively. Carbon stored in slow and passive pools accounted for 70.42% of the terrestrial carbon storage, and the slow pool contributes the highest amount of released CO2 among of all carbon pools during carbon decomposition. The IE functions exhibited a nonlinear curve feature and satisfactory adjust-R2. This study aimed to contribute to our understanding of the carbon cycle from non-equilibrium state to equilibrium state and can serve as a reference and framework for global carbon storage simulation research. © 2019","Detachable carbon cycle model; Equilibrium state; function; Influx–efflux; Terrestrial carbon storage","Ecosystems; Functions; Lakes; Carbon cycle models; Carbon decomposition; Carbon storage; Equilibrium state; Independent components; Net primary productivity; Nonequilibrium state; Terrestrial biosphere; Forestry; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; data set; decomposition; ecosystem function; global climate; net ecosystem exchange; soil carbon; vegetation cover",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064070797

Plants need a suitable balance of CO2 to achieve optimal growth. The optimum CO2 content corresponding to a high photosynthesis rate is between 0.1 and 1.0% by volume. However, air has only a CO2 content of 0.03% by volume, so plants cannot use all of their growth potential. The use of fertilizer to assist in the supply of CO2 increases the rate of photosynthesis. In this work, a slow-release CO2 gas fertilizer inspired by polyphenol chemistry was prepared to provide sustainable CO2 that could improve plant photosynthetic capacity and get a higher crop yield. The core-shell structure was designed to confer gas fertilizers slow-release property. Micron-sized calcium carbonate particles with uniform particle size and regularity morphology, as carbon sources for plant photosynthesis, was a core, and tannic acid was coated on it as a shell via oxidative oligomerization and cross-linked by polyetherimide. The structure and morphology of fertilizers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. In vitro experiments, the prepared fertilizers were proved to have slow-release properties.

The means by which forest restoration approaches might affect the soil composition of lignin, substituted fatty acids, 1 and the lignin degradation genes, remain understudied. We hypothesized that the soils of naturally restored forests have more abundant and stable lignin, SFA, and lignin degradation genes than those of artificially restored plantations. We analyzed the compositions of lignin, SFA, and the lignin degradation genes in soils restored with natural secondary forests, native species plantations, and introduced species plantations. We found that the extractable lignin content, leaf-derived SFA, leaf- to root-derived SFA ratio, and lignin oxidation state were higher in natural secondary forests than in plantations. The abundances of genes involved in glyoxal oxidase, lignin peroxidase, and manganese peroxidase were higher in the soils of natural secondary forests than in those of the two plantation types. No significant differences in the above indices were found between soils of native and introduced plantations. Nutrients and lignin oxidation state, including tree richness, litter stock, available nitrogen, combined clay and silt content, syringyl-based lignin to vanillyl-based lignin ratio, syringic acid to syringaldehyde ratio, and SFA content significantly affected the composition of genes involved in lignin degradation.

However, the same injection strategy in the SCR system shows significant variations in NOx emissions even at the same operating mode. This kind of heterogeneity poses challenges to the development of emission inventories and to the assessment of emission reductions. Existing studies indicate that these differences are related to the exhaust temperature. In this study, an emission model is established for different source types of HDDVs based on the real-time data of operating modes. Firstly, the initial NOx emission rates (ERs) model is established using the field vehicle emission data. Secondly, a temperature model of the vehicle exhaust based on the vehicle specific power (VSP) and the heat loss coefficient is established by analyzing the influencing factors of the NOx conversion efficiency. Thirdly, the models of NOx emissions and the urea consumption are developed based on the chemical reaction in the SCR system. Finally, the NOx emissions are compared with the real-world emissions and the estimations by the proposed model and the Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES). This indicates that the relative error by the proposed method is 12.5% lower than those calculated by MOVES. The characteristics of NOx emissions under different operating modes are analyzed through the proposed model. The results indicate that the NOx conversion rate of heavy-duty diesel trucks (HDDTs) is 39.2% higher than that of urban diesel transit buses (UDTBs). © 2019 by the authors.","Exhaust temperature model; HDDVs; NOx emission; Operating modes; Urea-SCR","Diesel engines; Diesel locomotives; Emission control; Metabolism; Particulate emissions; Reduction; Selective catalytic reduction; Urea; Vehicles; Exhaust temperature; HDDVs; NOx emissions; Operating modes; Urea scr; Nitrogen oxides; diesel engine; emission control; emission inventory; heterogeneity; nitrogen oxides; reduction; temperature; traffic emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068821821

This article describes a test of that hypothesis, involving simulations and evaluations of the economic performance of the above two systems for a model office building in five major U.S. climate zones. The cost–benefit analysis suggests that a GSHP system in climate zone 5 (Chicago-region) has the best return on investment, whereas climate zone 2 (Phoenix-region) is not economically promising. Relative to a reference HVAC system, the GSHP system has lower carbon emissions in each of the five climate zones, with the greatest reduction of carbon emissions occurring in climate zone 5 (Chicago-region). Significance: When faced with decisions about hot water supply and space heating and cooling, relative to drinking water utilities that rely on surface waters, groundwater-based utilities have ready access to groundwater source heat pumps (GSHPs) that should offer better energy efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions. These advantages, however, will depend on regional climate conditions and the course of electrical energy. A better understanding of GSHP performance in different climate zones will provide the information needed to make these decisions. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38:e13047, 2019. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers","climate zone; cost–benefit analysis; greenhouse gas emission; groundwater source heat pump; HVAC; water utility","Air conditioning; Carbon; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Geothermal heat pumps; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Investments; Office buildings; Operating costs; Potable water; Pumps; Surface waters; Thermal processing (foods); Water supply; American Institute of Chemical Engineers; Benefit analysis; Economic performance; Groundwater source heat pump; HVAC; Lower operating costs; Return on investments; Water utility; Climate models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055470407

Firstly, historical LCZ maps of the PRD region were generated using the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) protocol. Secondly, summer mean land surface temperature (LST) during daytime and night-time was retrieved from remote sensing data to analyze the SUHI. Thirdly, the correspondence between the spatial-temporal patterns of LCZ and LST were explored. The results show that urbanization in this region comprises transformation from natural land covers to built types and conversion in the built up, in particular densification and vertical enhancement of existing urban types. The LST in the region increased in general but the spatial pattern of LST increase is affected by the land cover change. LCZ 6 (open low-rise) and LCZ 8 (large low-rise) show the greatest increase in LST.

Interrestrial ecosystems, excess nitrogeninputs cangreatly affectsoil chemical properties, plant growth, and activities of soil microbes and fauna. Millipedes can fragment and consume large quantities of litter, and they regulate nutrient cycling and affect soil fertility through excretion of faeces. Many soil fauna graze on the faeces of millipedes as a part of the soil food web. The decomposition and stabilization of these millipede faeces are especially important in soil carbon dynamics and nutrient cycling, and these processes rely heavily upon microbial activity. However, very few studies have investigated how microbial community structure and oxidase activity of millipede faeces respond to climate change, especially N deposition. Therefore, we designed a microcosm study to investigate this question, which included two treatments, N addition treatment and control (without N addition). We found that: (i) microbial community structure in millipede faeces was altered and the biomass of fungi and actinomycetes in faecal pellets were significantly reduced after N addition, but bacteria still dominated in millipede faeces after N addition, (ii) oxidase activity was suppressed in response to N addition, and (iii) microbial community structure and oxidase activities were significantly correlated to organic carbon and dissolved total nitrogen of faeces. All these changes suggest that millipede excretion activities under nitrogen deposition contribute to carbon stabilization and reduction in greenhouse gas emission owing to the significant role of fungi and associated oxidase in carbon mineralization. It is noteworthy to pay more attention to the function of saprotrophic invertebrates in future N deposition studies. © 2019, Higher Education Press.","Macroarthropods; Microbial community structure; Millipede faeces; N deposition; Peroxidase; Phenol oxidase; PLFA",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106757785

However, recent research on upward species shifts have focused mainly on polar and high-latitude regions and it therefore remains unclear whether such vegetation change trends also are applicable to the alpine tundra at the southern edges of alpine tundra species distribution. This study evaluated an alpine tundra region within the Changbai Mountains, China, that is part of the southernmost alpine tundra in eastern Eurasia. We investigated plant species shifts in alpine tundra within the Changbai Mountains over the last three decades (1984-2015) by comparing contemporary survey results with historical ones and evaluated potential changes in the distribution of dwarf shrub and herbaceous species over the next three decades (2016-2045) using a combination of observations and simulations. The results of this study revealed that the encroachment of herbaceous plants had altered tundra vegetation to a significant extent over the last three decades, especially within low and middle alpine tundra regions in Changbai Mountains, China. The herbaceous species would continue shifting upward and expanding while their dwarf shrub counterparts would continue shifting upward and shrinking over the next three decades under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The upward shifts of plant species would not keep up with the rate of climate warming under the RCP 8.5 scenarios. The dominant plant tundra species may transform from dwarf shrubs to herbaceous varieties.

Considering spatial heterogeneity, the effects of changes in emission charge policy may subject to different Chinese regions. In this study, environmental efficiencies of Chinese regions are evaluated through provincial environmentally extended input-output tables and a frontier-based optimization model. Driving factors of environmental productivity growth are identified through global Luenberger productivity decomposition approach. Moreover, spatial heterogeneity on the effects of change in emission charge policy on environment and economy are assessed. Results show that all regions experienced environmental productivity growth. Technology progress is the major driving factor in most regions with an average contribution of 90%, while technical efficiency regress slows environmental productivity growth in Southwest region. Switching from pollutant discharge fees to environmental taxes would decreases emission intensities by 1.42% on average, but it would have different negative impact on economic growth (−1.13%∼-4.90% of regional GDP) due to spatially heterogeneous trade-offs between environmental protection and economic development.

In durability design of concrete structures, the carbonation depth should be duly considered. However, the concrete stress state would influence the carbonation depth, and there has been inadequate research on such effect. In this study, it is proposed to introduce a stress influence coefficient to the concrete carbonation depth model. With reference to the experimental data from eleven research studies in the literature encompassing both tensile and compressive stress states, the relationship between stress influence coefficient and concrete stress ratio is quantitatively investigated, and mathematical equations relating the stress influence coefficient with the concrete stress ratio are established. Comparative study with three typical existing groups of equations shows that the proposed equations of stress influence coefficient are more reasonable and have a higher reliability. The effects of carbonation time, mix proportions of concrete on stress influence coefficient are also analysed, and the magnitudes of the effects are found to be approximately within ±10%. Finally, the modified carbonation depth models are proposed and verified by the experimental data, which suggests that the proposed models are of desirable accuracy.

The highest total inorganic nitrogen removal percentage of 85.8% was obtained in SBRH, while a minimum N2O emission factor of 1.9% was obtained in SBRL. During nitrification batch experiments, the N2O emission factor and emission rate were both lower in SBRH than SBRL. More N2O production was obtained during denitrification in SBRH when denitrifiers utilized intracellular organic carbon. Nitrite reduction by heterotrophs was the main N2O production pathway during simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in SBRH and SBRL, with the N2O emission factor of 31.3% and 36.3%, respectively. Adequate anoxic duration and lowering aerobic nitrite concentrations could be adopted to mitigate N2O emission in the multiple AO process.

However, the genetic components and mechanisms underlying this regulatory loop remain poorly understood, especially in monocot crop species. Here, we report the cloning and functional characterization of a maize (Zea mays) mutant named closed stomata1 (cst1). Map-based cloning of cst1 followed by confirmation with the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/ CRISPR associated protein 9 system identified the causal mutation in a Clade I Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters (SWEET) family gene, which leads to the E81K mutation in the CST1 protein. CST1 encodes a functional glucose transporter expressed in subsidiary cells, and the E81K mutation strongly impairs the oligomerization and glucose transporter activity of CST1. Mutation of CST1 results in reduced stomatal opening, carbon starvation, and early senescence in leaves, suggesting that CST1 functions as a positive regulator of stomatal opening. Moreover, CST1 expression is induced by carbon starvation and suppressed by photoassimilate accumulation. Our study thus defines CST1 as a missing link in the feedback-regulation of stomatal movement and photosynthesis by photoassimilates in maize. © 2019 Plant Cell.

The roles these endogenous derivatives of fatty acids play in biology and their novel pathways for controlling inflammation have increased our understanding of basic human physiology. FAHFAs incorporate diverse fatty acids into their structures, however, given their recent discovery non-natural derivatives have not been a focus and as a result structure-activity relationships remain unknown. The importance of the long chain hydrocarbons extending from the ester linkage as they relate to anti-inflammatory activity is unknown. Herein the systematic removal of carbons from either the hydroxy fatty acid or fatty acid regions of the most studied FAHFA, palmitic acid ester of 9-hydroxystearic acid (9-PAHSA), was achieved and these synthetic, abridged analogs were tested for their ability to attenuate IL-6 production. Reduction of the carbon chain lengths of the 9-hydroxystearic acid portion or palmitic acid hydrocarbon chain resulted in lower molecular weight analogs that maintained anti-inflammatory activity or in one case enhanced activity. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the Japan Antibiotics Research Association.",,"13 methoxy 13 oxotridecan 5 yl palmitate; 15 methoxy 15 oxopentadecan 7 yl palmitate; 9 (palmitoyloxy)heptadecanoic acid; 9 (palmitoyloxy)octadecanoic acid; 9 (palmitoyloxy)pentadecanoic acid; 9 (palmitoyloxy)tridecanoic acid; 9 (palmitoyloxy)undecanoic acid; 9 (tetradecanoyloxy)octadecanoic acid; antiinflammatory agent; dexamethasone; hydroxy fatty acid; interleukin 6; methyl 9 (butyryloxy)octadecenoate; methyl 9 (decanoyloxy)octadecenoate; methyl 9 (dodecanoyloxy)octadecenoate; methyl 9 (hexanoyloxy)octadecenoate; methyl 9 (octanoyloxy)octadecenoate; methyl 9 (palmitoyloxy)heptadecanoate; methyl 9 (palmitoyloxy)octadecenoate; methyl 9 (tetradecanoyloxy)octadecenoate; methyl 9 acetoxyoctadecanoate; methyl 9 hydroxyheptadecanoate; methyl 9 hydroxyoctadecanoate; methyl 9 hydroxypentadecanoate; methyl 9 hydroxytridecanoate; methyl 9 hydroxyundecanoate; palmitic acid derivative; palmitic acid ester of 9 hydroxystearic acid; stearic acid derivative; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; adherent cell; antiinflammatory activity; Article; cell proliferation; controlled study; drug hydrolysis; drug synthesis; human; molecular weight; priority journal; RAW 264.7 cell line; stereochemistry; structure activity relation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064433717

To assess the effects of warming on soil C and tree roots, combined soil warming (infrared heaters, +1.5 °C soil temperature) and trenching experiments were conducted in a subtropical Castanopsis hystrix plantation. Topsoil C content was reassessed after five years of warming, and the effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) quality and microbial diversity were analyzed. Compared with corresponding controls, the topsoil (0–10 cm) SOC content was significantly lower in un-trenched warmed soil (−13.6%) as well as in trenched warmed soil (−15.4%). However, the range of SOC content after five years of warming was similar to that observed after two years of warming (−14.6%, −19.2%), indicating that the warming effect on SOC content had leveled off during the latter three years of the study. In trenched plots, warming significantly decreased the carbohydrate C as well as the ratio of carbohydrate C to N-alkyl/methoxyl C (CC/MC), suggesting that labile C was preferentially decomposed. In un-trenched plots, SOC quality was unaffected, indicating a compensatory input of labile root C. Bacterial α-diversity increased under warming, whereas no significant warming effects on fungal community diversity were observed. Both the SOC content and the proportion of soil carbohydrate C were negatively correlated with soil bacterial α-diversity, suggesting that the abundance of more recalcitrant SOC increased soil microbial diversity. Overall, our study indicates that soil warming leads to moderate initial reductions in topsoil SOC in the studied forest ecosystem. This is consistent with recent evidence that low SOC-containing soils (e.g., subtropical forest soils) exhibit a weaker response to soil warming than high SOC-containing soils. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Microbial community composition; Microbial diversity; Soil carbon quality; Soil organic carbon; Soil warming; Subtropical plantation","Carbohydrates; Ecosystems; Forestry; Global warming; Organic carbon; Tropics; Microbial community composition; Microbial diversity; Soil carbon; Soil organic carbon; Soil warming; Subtropical plantation; Soils; abundance; bacterium; community composition; evergreen tree; experimental study; forest ecosystem; global warming; microbial community; organic carbon; plantation; soil carbon; soil microorganism; species diversity; subtropical region; topsoil; tropical forest; Bacteria (microorganisms); Castanopsis hystrix",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063357709

Vehicle exhaust is one of the primary causes of smog events due to the rapid growth of motor vehicle ownership and increased fuel consumption. In this study, fault tree analysis (FTA) was used as a relatively simple but effective way to analyze the causes of smog associated with vehicle exhaust emissions in Jinan, China. First, after the identification of the top event, intermediate events, and basic events, a comprehensive fault tree system for urban smog associated with vehicle exhaust emissions was constructed. Then, during the qualitative analysis stage, minimal cut sets (MCSs) were grouped using Boolean algebra operations, and the original fault tree was simplified to an equivalent tree based on 6 MCSs. Finally, during the quantitative analysis stage, the effects of the 12 basic events on the top event were evaluated and ranked according to the structural importance, probabilistic importance, and critical importance of their analytical measures. Our results indicated that traffic congestion, superabundance of vehicles, poor supervision, and yellow-label vehicles with long use ages had the greatest impact on smog events, with importance degrees of 0.52930, 0.52920, 0.22719, and 0.22716, respectively. These results are consistent with common sense. Although different basic events exert different influences, all of the basic events should be comprehensively taken into consideration and corresponding precautionary measures developed. This research provides a good case study of the application of FTA in the analysis of the causes of urban smog events associated with vehicle exhaust emissions. Our study further demonstrates that FTA is a relatively simple but effective method for the causal analysis of smog, as well as an effective tool for environmental risk management. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Causes of smog; Fault tree analysis; Urban smog events; Vehicle exhaust emissions","Boolean algebra; Fault tree analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Traffic congestion; Vehicles; Causes of smog; Environmental risk managements; Fault tree analyses (FTA); Precautionary measures; Qualitative analysis; Structural importance; Urban smog events; Vehicle exhaust emissions; Air pollution; anthropogenic effect; car ownership; fuel consumption; smog; traffic emission; urban pollution; article; China; information science; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; risk management; smog; China; Jinan [Shandong]; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062475208

Under the scenario that greenhouse gas emissions keep increasing until the end of this century, there is the possibility of extensive global exposure to high heat stress. While under new mitigation efforts (as part of the Paris Agreement, signatory nations pledged to implement the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) for emission reductions), the regional response of heat stress to pledged emission reductions remains unclear. In this study, we analyze the heat stress response in global hotspot regions, targeting emission scenarios resulting from the INDCs pledges. Our study revealed that under the INDCs-continuous mitigation, the heat stress effect in global hotspot regions (North China, South Asia, and the Amazon) is estimated to be lower than 29 °C in the next three decades and to be from >33 °C to less than 30 °C to this century end. The heat stress effect indicates a great reduction at the continuous mitigation compared with the delayed mitigation, and the population exposed to dangerous heat stress would also decrease approximately one order of magnitude. If limiting warming to a lesser amount (1.5/2 °C targets), significantly further reduction of the population exposed to heat stress in the middle and low latitudes can be achieved, thus avoiding the adverse effects associated with heat stress. Therefore, the national intended mitigation actions under the Paris Agreement will play a crucial role in reducing the heat stress risk in these hot and humid regions. These findings will help to improve the understanding of the future risks of heat stress and are crucial for mitigation and adaptation actions in hotspot areas (approximately 1/3 of the world’s population). © 2019 by the authors.

Herein, a class of Fe−N co-doped carbon nanofibers is successfully synthesized by pyrolysis of polyacrylonitrile/metal-containing ionic liquid-based electrospun films. The ionic liquids act as porogen to provide multiscale pores as well as activator to bring carbon nanofibers active sites. The catalyst possessing appropriate active sites and unique 3D porous architecture exhibits remarkable long-term stability and electrocatalytic activity. Particularly, the catalyst maintains a shape of membrane after carbonization, manifesting its direct use as air electrode without binders. It is notable that an all solid-state Zn–air battery based on the carbon nanofibers exhibits good flexibility, indicating its promising application as wearable devices. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The headwater basin of the inland river is located in the high-altitude mountainous region, and there are few meteorological observation sites, so it is difficult to apply distributed hydrological models and other models based on the physical mechanism of runoff generation to evaluate climate change and its impact on streamflow. To simulate the climate-driven streamflow in data-scarce mountain basins of Northwest China, we developed an integrated approach by using downscaled reanalysis data, Mann–Kendall test, ensemble empirical mode decomposition and backpropagation artificial neural networks together with the weights connection method. We validated the approach in the Kaidu River basin located in the Tianshan mountains. The results showed that the streamflow increased 12.9% by 2.5×108m3 per decade with the warm and wet climate, while the average annual temperature increased 5.2% at a rate of 0.3 ∘C per decade and the precipitation increased 37.3% at a rate of 16.4 mm per decade during the period from 1980 to 2015.

To address the problem, a total factor resource input-oriented data envelopment analysis (DEA) model is used to evaluate the energy and environmental efficiency for 30 provinces in China during 2009–2013 in this paper. Based on the evaluation results, from efficient and fair perspective, a revised DEA-based resource allocation model is established. It is worth pointing out that the model takes the input orientation and output orientation into account at the same time and can be used to allocate coal consumption and carbon emission by 2020 for 30 provinces in China. Results indicate that if the Chinese government wants to fulfill the CO2 emission reduction targets of 40–45% by 2020, and coal consumption intensity reduction target during 13th Five-Year Plan, inefficient provinces will undertake more coal consumption and carbon emission intensity reduction obligation share. And provinces with historical high coal consumption and high CO2 emission intensity will have greater potential of coal consumption and carbon emission intensity reduction. In addition, this paper set several scenarios of gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate, under the scenarios analysis, finds the growth rate of GDP has negative effect on reduction of coal consumption and carbon dioxide emissions intensity. This research provides more realistic practical significance for achieving sustainable economic development. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CO2 emission intensity; Coal consumption intensity; Data envelopment analysis (DEA); Input and output orientation; Resource allocation","carbon emission; coal combustion; data envelopment analysis; economic development; emission control; empirical analysis; environmental economics; government; Gross Domestic Product; input-output analysis; panel data; resource allocation; China; carbon; carbon dioxide; coal; air pollutant; China; gross national product; Air Pollutants; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Coal; Gross Domestic Product",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045448471

The Australian plague locust (APL) Chortoicetes terminifera, is the most economically important locust species in Australia. Invasions cause large scale economic damage to agricultural crops and pastures. Understanding the regional-scale and long-term dynamics is a prerequisite to develop effective control and preventive management strategies. In this study, we used a 32-year locust survey database to uncover the relationship between historical bioclimatic variables and spatial seasonal outbreaks by developing two machine learning species distribution models (SDMs), random forest and boosted regression trees. The explanatory variables were ranked by contribution to the generated models. The bio-climate models were then projected into a future climate change scenario (RCP8.5) using downscaled 34 global climate models (GCMs) to assess how climate change may alter APL seasonal distribution patterns in eastern Australia. Our results show that the model for the distribution of spring outbreaks performed better than those for summer and autumn, based on statistical evaluation criteria. The spatial models of seasonal outbreaks indicate that the areas subject to APL outbreaks were likely to decrease in all seasons. Multi-GCM ensemble means show the largest decrease in area was for spring outbreaks, reduced by 93–94% by 2071–2090, while the area of summer outbreaks decreased by 78–90%, and 67–74% for autumn outbreaks. The bioclimatic variables could explain 78–98% outbreak areas change. This study represents an important step toward the assessment of the effects of the changing climate on locust outbreaks and can help inform future priorities for regional mitigation efforts in the context of global climate change in eastern Australia. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Australian plague locust; Climate change; GCMs; Outbreak area; Outbreak probability; Seasonal outbreaks; Species distribution models","Climate models; Crops; Decision trees; Learning systems; Population distribution; Probability distributions; Australian plague locust; GCMs; Outbreak area; Seasonal outbreaks; Species distribution models; Climate change; climate change; future prospect; locust; pest control; pest outbreak; probability; seasonal variation; species diversity; Acrididae; Article; Australia; autumn; Chortoicetes terminifera; climate change; controlled study; locust plague; nonhuman; priority journal; seasonal variation; species distribution; spring; summer; Australia; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062593786

This crustal process almost universally includes sedimentary target rocks; however, their response to impact is poorly understood, in part because of complexities due to layering, pore space and the presence of volatiles that are difficult to model. The response of carbonates to bolide impact remains contentious, yet whether they melt or decompose and liberate gases by the reaction CaCO 3(s) → CaO (s) + CO 2(g) ↑, has significant implications for post-impact climatic effects. We report on previously unknown carbonate impact melts at the Steen River impact structure, Canada, and the first description of naturally shocked barite, BaSO 4 . Carbonate melts are preserved as groundmass-supported calcite-rich clasts, sampled from an up to 164 m thick, continuous sequence of crater-fill polymict breccias. Electron microscopy reveals fluidal- and ocellar-textured calcite and barite, intimately associated with silicate melt, consistent with these phases being in the liquid state at the same time. Raman spectroscopy and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) mapping confirm the presence of high-pressure phases – reidite and coesite – within some Steen River carbonate melt-bearing breccias. These minerals attest to the strong shock provenance of the breccia and provide constraints on their shock history. Preservation of reidite lamellae in zircon indicates a shock pressure &gt;30 GPa &lt;60 GPa and temperatures &lt;1473 K. In addition to melting, we present compelling evidence for widespread (70–100%) decomposition of carbonate target rocks, mixed as lithic clasts into hot impact breccias. In this context, decomposition occurs strictly post-impact due to thermal equilibration-related heating. We demonstrate that this mechanism for CO 2 outgassing is likely more widespread than previously recognized. The presence of andradite-grossular garnet serve as mineralogical markers of decomposition, analogous to limestone-replacing skarn deposits. Ca-rich garnet may therefore prove an important indicator mineral for post-shock decomposition of carbonate-bearing target rocks at other craters. These findings significantly advance our understanding of how sedimentary rocks respond to hypervelocity impact, and have wide-reaching implications for estimating the amount and timing of climatically-active volatile release due to impact events. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","carbonate decomposition; carbonate melts; coesite; impact cratering; impact metamorphism; reidite","Barite; Barium sulfate; Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Garnets; Lime; Melting; Rivers; Sedimentology; Silica; Silicate minerals; Textures; Zircon; Carbonate decomposition; Carbonate melts; coesite; Impact cratering; impact metamorphism; reidite; Sedimentary rocks; bolide; carbonate rock; coesite; cratering; decomposition; impact structure; melting; metamorphism; nesosilicate; Alberta; Canada; Steen River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063543852

In coastal areas of the southeastern United States (USA), many imperiled vertebrates are vulnerable to hurricanes, which climate models predict to become more severe in the 21st century. Despite this escalating threat, explicit adaptation strategies that address hurricane threats, in particular, and climate change more generally, are largely underrepresented in recovery planning and implementation. We provide a basis for stronger emphasis on strategic planning for imperiled species facing the increasing threat of catastrophic hurricanes. Our reasoning comes from observations of short-term environmental and biological impacts of Hurricane Michael, which impacted the Gulf Coast of the southeastern USA in October 2018. During this storm, St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge, located along the northern Gulf of Mexico's coast in the panhandle region of Florida, received storm surge that was 3.0–3.6 m (NAVD88) above sea level. Storm surge pushed sea water into some ephemeral freshwater ponds used for breeding by the federally threatened frosted flatwoods salamander (Ambystoma cingulatum). After the storm, specific conductance across all ponds measured varied from 80 to 23,100 µS/cm, compared to 75 to 445 µS/cm in spring 2018. For 17 overwashed wetlands that were measured in both spring and fall 2018, posthurricane conductance observations were, on average, more than 90 times higher than in the previous spring, setting the stage for varying population responses across this coastal landscape. Importantly, we found live individual flatwoods salamanders at both overwashed and non-overwashed sites, although we cannot yet assess the demographic consequences of this storm. We outline actions that could be incorporated into climate adaptation strategies and recovery planning for imperiled species, like A. cingulatum, that are associated with freshwater coastal wetlands in hurricane-prone regions. © 2019 The Authors.

Apo SHMT2 exists as a dimer with unknown functions, whereas PLP binding stabilizes the active tetrameric state. SHMT2 also promotes inflammatory cytokine signalling by interacting with the deubiquitylating BRCC36 isopeptidase complex (BRISC), although it is unclear whether this function relates to metabolism. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human BRISC–SHMT2 complex at a resolution of 3.8 Å. BRISC is a U-shaped dimer of four subunits, and SHMT2 sterically blocks the BRCC36 active site and inhibits deubiquitylase activity. Only the inactive SHMT2 dimer—and not the active PLP-bound tetramer—binds and inhibits BRISC. Mutations in BRISC that disrupt SHMT2 binding impair type I interferon signalling in response to inflammatory stimuli. Intracellular levels of PLP regulate the interaction between BRISC and SHMT2, as well as inflammatory cytokine responses. These data reveal a mechanism in which metabolites regulate deubiquitylase activity and inflammatory signalling. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"BRCC36 isopeptidase complex; cytokine; dimer; interferon; methyltransferase; serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2; tetramer; unclassified drug; BRCC3 protein, human; deubiquitinase; glycine hydroxymethyltransferase; interferon; multienzyme complex; protein binding; pyridoxal 5 phosphate; SHMT protein, human; amino acid; biochemistry; enzyme activity; immune system; inhibition; metabolism; signaling; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; cellular immunity; complex formation; controlled study; cryoelectron microscopy; embryo; enzyme active site; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; enzyme modification; gene mutation; immune response; immunochemistry; in vitro study; metabolic regulation; molecular docking; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein function; protein nucleic acid interaction; protein subunit; structure analysis; chemistry; genetics; HEK293 cell line; human; immunology; inflammation; metabolism; molecular model; mutation; protein multimerization; protein quaternary structure; signal transduction; ultrastructure; Cryoelectron Microscopy; Deubiquitinating Enzymes; Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Inflammation; Interferon Type I; Models, Molecular; Multienzyme Complexes; Mutation; Protein Binding; Protein Multimerization; Protein Structure, Quaternary; Pyridoxal Phosphate; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066815714

So far, such interactions have been rarely explored to enhance the selectivity in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, Cu/CeO2-x heterodimers (HDs) are synthesized and presented as one of the prime examples where such effects promote CO2RR. A colloidal seeded-growth synthesis is developed to connect the two highly mismatched domains (Cu and CeO2-x) through an interface. The Cu/CeO2-x HDs exhibit state-of-the-art selectivity toward CO2RR (up to ∼80%) against the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and high faradaic efficiency for methane (up to ∼54%) at -1.2 VRHE, which is ∼5 times higher than that obtained when the Cu and CeO2-x nanocrystals are physically mixed. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy along with other ex-situ spectroscopies evidences the partial reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ in the HDs during CO2RR. A Density Functional Theory (DFT) study of the active site motif in reducing condition reveals synergistic effects in the electronic structure at the interface. The proposed lowest free energy pathway utilizes an O-vacancy site with intermediates binding to both Cu and Ce atoms, a configuration which allows one to break the CHO∗/CO∗ scaling relation. The suppression of HER is attributed to the spontaneous formation of CO∗ at this interfacial motif and subsequent blockage of the Cu-sites. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","colloidal nanocrystals; electrochemical CO2 reduction, copper, ceria; interfaces; synthesis design","Carbon dioxide; Cerium oxide; Colloids; Density functional theory; Design for testability; Electrolytic reduction; Electronic structure; Free energy; Interfaces (materials); Nanocrystals; X ray absorption spectroscopy; CO2 reduction; Colloidal nanocrystals; Faradaic efficiencies; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Reducing conditions; Spontaneous formation; Synergistic effect; Synthesis design; Copper",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065780037

These include accelerated tectonic subsidence driven by subduction, ocean cooling following the mid-Miocene climate optimum, nutrient excess, poisoning by sediment drifts and local erosion driven by current winnowing, occurring discretely or simultaneously. Here, we critically assess the evidence for these different mechanisms using a combination of high-resolution 3-D seismic data, regional 2-D seismic profiles, and numerical stratigraphic forward modelling. Seismic interpretation and numerical modelling found that the proposed uniform subsidence rate of 125 m/Ma between 16.5 Ma and 5.33 Ma for the northern Browse Basin (Belde et al., 2017), when combined with the published estimate of eustatic sea level in Miller et al. (2005), was insufficient to drown the Miocene carbonate sequence and generate the geomorphological changes (barrier reef to isolated carbonate build-ups) observed on seismic data. Instead, a subsidence profile comprising pulses of rapid and slow subsidence is required. Significantly, our results suggest that subsidence rates exceeded 400 m/Ma in the northern Browse Basin, and that parts of the basin record the accumulation of sediment drifts. These sediment drifts are interpreted to have buried some carbonate build-ups, while suspended sediment reduced light transmissivity, inhibiting carbonate production. Thus, we postulate that current activity and excess nutrient supply are key, but often overlooked, oceanographic processes that lead to the demise of carbonate build-ups. © 2019 The Authors","Build-up; Carbonate shelf; Demise; Equatorial margins; Miocene; Northwest Australia","Geophysical prospecting; Nutrients; Offshore oil well production; Sea level; Seismic response; Seismic waves; Stratigraphy; Subsidence; Suspended sediments; Australia; Build-up; Demise; Equatorial margins; Miocene; Carbonation; carbonate platform; geomorphological response; Miocene; paleoceanography; stratigraphy; subsidence; Australia; Browse Basin; Indian Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063395016

I will introduce the programme and the issue of induced seismicity in Groningen to the EAGE community in this EAGE workshop on induced seismicity in London. The studies program consists of two parts. The main research effort focuses on the assessment of hazard and risk the community living above the field is exposed to. This is a very targeted program consisting of monitoring of the seismicity in the field area and studies supporting the modelling of the link between the cause, the production of gas from the Groningen field, to the effect, building damage and potential risk to people in and around these buildings. This part of the research was executed under tight deadlines set by the regulator and Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy. Each of the studies in this part of the program aimed at improving the modelling of elements in the cause and effect chain. Additionally, a scientific program was set up with the aim to better understand the physical processes leading to the destabilisation of the faults in the field and the induced seismicity. The components of this research are (1) geophysical data acquisition, analysis and modelling (2) geomechanical modelling on a single fault and at the field scale and (3) laboratory experiments on the complex coupled processes controlling rupture of faults and friction during the fault movement. Synthesis of these field and laboratory observations with the geomechanical models of faults has much improved understanding of the coupling between gas production, reservoir deformation, fault rupture and seismic wave generation. Moreover, huge amounts of data have been produced and are available for advancing this understanding further, in the context of Groningen and of induced seismicity in general. © 81st EAGE Conference and Exhibition 2019 Workshop Programme.

A comparative analysis of the performance of hybrid was conducted using a proposed model, built with historical data for meteorological conditions, wind speed, and solar radiation. The model is integrated by a Southwest Wind Power Inc. wind turbine AIR 403, a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEM), an electrolyzer, a solar panel, and a regulator based on proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) controllers to manipulate oxygen and hydrogen flow entering in the fuel cell. The transient responses of the cell voltage, current, and power were obtained for the demand of 200 W under changes in solar radiation and wind speed for each day of the year 2013 in different meteorological stations, such as Ernesto Cortissoz airport, Puerto Bolívar, Alfonso Lopez airport, and Simon Bolívar airport. Through the adjustment of the hydrogen and oxygen flow into the fuel cell, the maximum contribution of power generation from the fuel cell was presented for the Simon Bolívar airport in November with a value of 158.35 W (9.45%).

We performed a search of scientific literature and found 5,533 documents published from 1993 to 2018 using SDM, representing a global network of 4,329 collaborating institutions from 155 countries, with Brazil and Mexico being in the top 10 of the most prolific countries globally. National Autonomous University of Mexico, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Kansas, and U.S. Geological Survey are the most prolific institutions worldwide. Latin American institutions (n = 556) participated in 1,000 (18% of global productivity) documents published in collaboration with 591 institutions outside Latin American countries, from which the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Federal University of Goiás, Institute of Ecology A.C., National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina, University of São Paulo, and University of Brasilia were the most productive. From this body of literature, the most frequently modeled taxonomic groups were Chordata and Insecta, and the most common realms of application were conservation planning and management, climate change, species conservation, epidemiology, evolutionary biology, and biological invasions. From the 36 modeling methods identified to generate SDMs, MaxEnt is used in 73.5% of the papers, followed by Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP) with 18.7%, and just 7.4% of the papers compared between 3 and 10 modeling methods. In Latin American countries, productivity in SDM research could be improved as the network of collaborations diversifies and connects with other productive countries (such as United Kingdom, China, Spain, Germany, Australia, and France). The scientific collaboration between Latin American countries should be increased, as the most prolific countries (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia) share less than 10% of its productivity. Some of the main challenges for SDM development in Latin America include bridging the gaps from (a) software use to research productivity and (b) translation to decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose to strengthen communities of practice where modelers, species experts, and decision-makers come together to discuss and develop SDM to shift and enhance current paradigms on how science and decision-making are linked. © The Author(s) 2019.","bibliometrics; communities of practice; ecological niche models; niche-based models; social network analysis; statistical modeling",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070308224

We have studied whether these effects could alter the probability of local extinction of three predatory mites naturally associated with the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, in citrus in Spain and, therefore, disrupt the biological control of this phytophagous mite. Laboratory and semi-field results provide evidence that the natural regulation of T. urticae in citrus can be seriously disrupted in a warmer future. On the one hand, T. urticae populations at conditions representative of future hotter and drier summers, could reach higher population densities than forecasted according to its demographic parameters. On the other hand, T. urticae regulation provided by its predators depended on the environmental conditions, was species-specific, and was affected by interspecific interactions. In some cases, one of the predatory mite species in the system could not be recovered. Because there is evidence that the composition of the community under scrutiny is highly sensitive to local habitat conditions, our results can be taken as evidence that local extinctions may occur more frequently in a warmer future and further contribute to an increasingly higher frequency of T. urticae outbreaks. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biological control; Euseius stipulatus; Food web; Global warming; Neoseiulus californicus; Phytoseiidae; Phytoseiulus persimilis; Spider mite","angiosperm; arthropod; biological control; climate change; food web; global warming; herbivore; interspecific interaction; predator control; Spain; Acari; Arthropoda; Citrus; Euseius stipulatus; Neoseiulus californicus; Phytoseiidae; Phytoseiulus persimilis; Tetranychidae; Tetranychus urticae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064575798

We evaluated both backward and income linkage effects using the Miyazawa model, and consequently demonstrated that: (1) with respect to output and employment, the backward linkage effects of the O&M stage are smaller than the construction stage, while the opposite is true for the income linkage effects. This may be mainly attributed to high value-added ratios of the O&M sectors, and implies relatively lower inputs and labor are required for running hydropower facilities than for constructing them. (2) Income linkage effects with respect to all the parameters are dispersed over several prefectures due partly to the income redistribution effect. (3) Analyses of life-cycle GHG emissions in physical terms reveal that the smaller the hydropower plant, the larger the GHG emissions per unit electricity production. This may be because more machinery must be used per unit electricity production at smaller plants, causing more emissions from both construction and maintenance works. (4) Assuming small-scale hydropower generation is conducted across 1602 sites in place of the general (including fossil fuel) power sector, Japan’s national GHG emissions are expected to be moderated by 0.145%, of which 55% is due to the technological effect and the remaining portion is through the electricity-saving effect from higher prices for small-scale hydropower. © 2018, The Japan Section of the Regional Science Association International.","C67; Climate change; Electricity; Input–output analysis; Q25; Q42; Q54; R15; Regional economy; Renewable energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100690936

The limitation of space, the technology of scale and the peaks of generation due to existing tourism, are clear examples of the barriers that must be overcome. This research studies the potential of MSW recovery on the island of La Gomera (Canary Islands) as an alternative to landfill deposition, being an additional energy source for heat and electricity. Likewise, the possibility of carrying out the landfill mining located in the El Revolcadero environmental complex is explored. The methodology followed consists, first of all, on estimating the annual amount of MSW and waste deposited in the landfill. Second, the characterization of representative samples of each municipality is carried out. Third, according to these characteristics, the thermal treatment is chosen and, finally, the energy generated is evaluated. The results are encouraging, and many advantages are derived from this model. The annual recycling figure increases by about 5000 tons per year, the percentage of renewable energy from waste reaches 35.5% (most installed capacity is diesel), and greenhouse gases (GHG) are reduced by more than half. To overcome the challenges in the integral management of MSW, it is necessary to move from a linear economy to a circular economy that takes into account the priorities established by the European Union to solve the problem of these isolated environments in terms of energy. © 2019 by the authors.","Canary Islands; Carbon emission reduction; Circular economy; Isolated environments; Waste management; Waste-to-energy","carbon emission; economic analysis; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental conditions; environmental economics; European Union; municipal solid waste; numerical model; recovery; waste management; waste technology; Canary Islands; Canary Islands; Gomera; Santa Cruz de Tenerife [(PRV) Canary Islands]; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067229130

This raises the critical question: how can enough prosumers be encouraged to participate in peer-to-peer trading so as to make its operation sustainable and beneficial to the overall electricity network? To this end, this paper proposes how a motivational psychology framework can be used effectively to design peer-to-peer energy trading to increase user participation. To do so, first, the state-of-the-art of peer-to-peer energy trading literature is discussed by following a systematic classification, and gaps in existing studies are identified. Second, a motivation psychology framework is introduced, which consists of a number of motivational models that a prosumer needs to satisfy before being convinced to participate in energy trading. Third, a game-theoretic peer-to-peer energy trading scheme is developed, its relevant properties are studied, and it is shown that the coalition among different prosumers is a stable coalition. Fourth, through numerical case studies, it is shown that the proposed model can reduce carbon emissions by 18.38% and 9.82% in a single day in Summer and Winter respectively compared to a feed-in-tariff scheme. The proposed scheme is also shown to reduce the cost of energy up to 118 ¢ and 87 ¢ per day in Summer and Winter respectively. Finally, how the outcomes of the scheme satisfy all the motivational psychology models is discussed, which subsequently shows its potential to attract users to participate in energy trading. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy trading; Game theory; Motivation; Peer-to-peer; Prosumer participation; Psychology","Commerce; Distributed computer systems; Electric power transmission networks; Game theory; Motivation; Peer to peer networks; Power markets; Cost of energies; Critical questions; Electricity networks; Energy trading; Peer to peer; Prosumer; Psychology; User participation; Smart power grids; cost analysis; electricity; game theory; model; numerical model; psychology; smart grid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063580611

Inspired by the concept of social movement–based citizen science, this article discusses how local community people have participated in knowledge production by integrating their observations and experiences into the scientific practices of air monitoring. The discussions particularly address citizens’ data generation and interpretation efforts that signaled the alternative air quality information and triggered on-demand responses from the government to improve the air quality management measures.

The work investigates the mutual influence of plant ND and of the above controls. Given a ND, it assesses the concurrent effect on performance and pollution abatement efficacy, under variability in key waste constituents. Based on the combined mass and enthalpy balance and on necessary and sufficient conditions for emissions’ compliance, it determines appropriate manipulations (directions, gains and ranges) for high efficiency and reduced emissions under large waste variability (e.g., biodegradable fraction varying by 50%). It quantifies how heat integration and oxygen enrichment enable higher throughput of poor constituents (by boosting combustion), whereas higher fluegas recirculation and excess air suppress it, enabling higher throughput and power production from rich waste constituents. Concurrent action of the control variables enhances performance.

Recent studies have shown the feasibility of using passive cavitation detection (PCD) for monitoring or real-time control of the BBB opening in a focused ultrasound device. Planar ultrasound has unique advantages including the capability to create larger BBB openings in a single exposure, simple operation, and reduced reliance on medical imaging for sonication guidance. This study proposes a novel planar ultrasound apparatus design that can provide real-time analysis for ultrasound BBB opening monitoring. In-vitro tube phantom experiments were conducted to characterize the dependence of the energy spectrum density (ESD) change with microbubble infusion. In-vivo experiments characterized the dependence of ESD change on BBB opening. We showed that the proposed configuration provide superior ESD detection than traditional water-immersed PCD arrangement and can well correlated with the cavitation activity either in the in vitro or in vivo measurement. The ESD response corresponds well to the occurrence of BBB-opening. In animal groups which demonstrated successful BBB-opening, the peak ESD was significantly higher (12.22 ± 7.019 and 14.763 ± 11.812 dB in 0.332 and 0.463-MPa exposure). The 5-dB ESD level was found to be a valid threshold level to discriminate between the BBB-intact and BBB-opened groups to provide both high detection sensitivity (100%) and specificity (88%). These results may facilitate the design of a planar ultrasound treatment apparatus for BBB opening and drug delivery to the brain. © 2018, Taiwanese Society of Biomedical Engineering.","Acoustic emission feedback; Blood–brain barrier; Passive cavitation detection; Planar ultrasound","Acoustic emission testing; Blood; Cavitation; Controlled drug delivery; Electrostatic devices; Feedback; Indium compounds; Medical imaging; Real time control; Cavitation activity; Detection sensitivity; In-vivo experiments; In-vivo measurement; Passive cavitation detection; Real time analysis; Therapeutic efficacy; Ultrasound treatments; Ultrasonic applications; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; blood brain barrier; controlled study; diagnostic imaging; drug delivery system; feedback system; microbubble; mouse; nonhuman; receiver operating characteristic; ultrasound",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058084117

In practice, the pattern of the data might not be spatially constant and cannot be well addressed by ordinary least square (OLS) regression. This study uses GWR to deal with spatial non-stationarity and to identify the spatial correlation between the plant richness distribution and the climate variables (i.e., the temperature and precipitation) in a 1 grid in different biogeographic zones of India. Methodology We utilized the species richness data collected using 0.04 ha nested quadrats in an Indian study. The data from this national study, titled ‘Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level’, were aggregated at the 1 grid level and adjudged for sampling sufficiency. The performances of OLS and GWR models were compared in terms of the coefficient of determination (R2) and the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc). Results and discussion A comparative study of the R2 and AICc values of the models showed that all the GWR models performed better compared with the analogous OLS models. The climate variables were found to significantly influence the distribution of plant richness in India. The minimum precipitation (Pmin) consistently dominated individually (R2 = 0.69; AICc = 2608) and in combinations. Among the shared models, the one with a combination of Pmin and Tmin had the best model fits (R2 = 0.72 and AICc = 2619), and variation partitioning revealed that the influence of these parameters on the species richness distribution was dominant in the arid and the semi-arid zones and in the Deccan peninsula zone. Conclusion The shift in climate variables and their power to explain the species richness of biogeographic zones suggests that the climate–diversity relationships of plants species vary spatially. In particular, the dominant influence of Tmin and Pmin could be closely linked to the climate tolerance hypothesis (CTH). We found that the climate variables had a significant influence in defining species richness patterns in India; however, various other environmental and non-environmental (edaphic, topographic and anthropogenic) variables need to be integrated in the models to understand climate–species richness relationships better at a finer scale. © 2019 Tripathi et al.

However, substantial amounts of soil carbon are lost when farmers interrupt continuous use of conservation tillage with conventional tillage. Conservation tillage is spreading, but little is known about the behavioral persistence in tillage decisions. To address the gap in the literature, we estimate county-specific Markov models of tillage-crop choices, and use the predicted probabilities of alternative two- and three-year tillage rotations to evaluate spatial variation and temporal persistence in conservation tillage adoption for the state of Iowa (U.S). We find that the county-average probabilities of continuous conservation tillage range between 0.133 and 0.295, and vary significantly among crop rotations. We also find a statistically strong positive effect of the incidence of the highly erodible land on the county-average use of continuous conservation tillage. Our results underscore the importance of dynamic modeling for understanding behavioral persistence in tillage decisions, and the interdependence between farmers’ crop and tillage rotations. © 2019 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation and China Water and Power Press","Aggregate data; Continuous conservation tillage; Crop rotations; Highly erodible land; Markov chain model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064176401

However, in lawns, management decisions influence interactions between planted turfgrass and weed species, leading to some uncertainty about the degree of human vs. climatic controls on lawn species distributions. We measured herbaceous plant carbon isotope ratios (δ13C, index of C3/C4 relative abundance) and C4 cover in residential lawns across seven U.S. cities to determine how climate, lawn plant management, or interactions between climate and plant management influenced C4 lawn cover. We also calculated theoretical C4 carbon gain predicted by a plant physiological model as an index of expected C4 cover due to growing season climatic conditions in each city. Contrary to theoretical predictions, plant δ13C and C4 cover in urban lawns were more strongly related to mean annual temperature than to growing season temperature. Wintertime temperatures influenced the distribution of C4 lawn turf plants, contrary to natural ecosystems where growing season temperatures primarily drive C4 distributions. C4 cover in lawns was greatest in the three warmest cities, due to an interaction between climate and homeowner plant management (e.g., planting C4 turf species) in these cities. The proportion of C4 lawn species was similar to the proportion of C4 species in the regional grass flora. However, the majority of C4 species were nonnative turf grasses, and not of regional origin. While temperature was a strong control on lawn species composition across the United States, cities differed as to whether these patterns were driven by cultivated lawn grasses vs. weedy species. In some cities, biotic interactions with weedy plants appeared to dominate, while in other cities, C4 plants were predominantly imported and cultivated. Elevated CO2 and temperature in cities can influence C3/C4 competitive outcomes; however, this study provides evidence that climate and plant management dynamics influence biogeography and ecology of C3/C4 plants in lawns. Their differing water and nutrient use efficiency may have substantial impacts on carbon, water, energy, and nutrient budgets across cities. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","C4 plant distribution; lawns; macroecology; plant δ13C; residential; urban; yard management","biogeography; C4 plant; carbon isotope; dominance; growing season; herb; homeowner; macroecology; nutrient use efficiency; urban area; water use; United States; Poaceae; city; ecosystem; human; photosynthesis; plant dispersal; Poaceae; United States; Cities; Ecosystem; Humans; Photosynthesis; Plant Dispersal; Poaceae; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066637123

Urban low carbon transitions suggest a substantial re-ordering of urban infrastructure. However, there is a critical need to engage with the material implications of low carbon practices since research so far has painted a picture of incremental ambitions struggling in implementation. This paper interrogates how carbon governance is implemented through urban buildings and energy systems, and the implications for urban decarbonization, by drawing on three urban case studies: Stockholm, London and San Francisco. The analysis draws on interviews with representatives from government, industry, utilities, building owners, and non-governmental organizations who are striving to achieve decarbonization in their cities. Patterns are emerging in what is being made to matter politically through the translation of carbon governance into building-energy infrastructure. In particular, the paper finds that (1) a short-term decision making timeline encourages action that incrementally reduces greenhouse gas emissions without fundamentally overcoming carbon lock-in, (2) actors are harnessing exceptional urban space to overcome the tyranny of cost-effectiveness in maintaining fossil fuel entrenchment (with concerning implications for justice and uneven development), (3) there is a pattern of individualization of responsibility for decarbonization, and (4) material politics are limiting the application of low carbon retrofits for the existing built form. Overall, this paper examines the implementation of urban carbon governance while encompassing the messy, materially embedded, and contested nature of infrastructure transformations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon; Climate change; Decarbonization; Governance; Materiality; Urban","building; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; governance approach; greenhouse gas; infrastructure; urban politics; California; England; London [England]; San Francisco [California]; Stockholm [Stockholm (CNT)]; Stockholm [Sweden]; Sweden; United Kingdom; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063876894

Public health professionals play an important role in prevention and control of the disease. This study aimed to explore dengue control and prevention in the context of climate change in China. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 630 public health professionals in 2015. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression were performed. Results: More than 80% of participants from southwest and central China believed climate change would affect dengue. However, participants from northeast China were less likely to believe so (65%). Sixty-nine percent of participants in Yunnan perceived that dengue had emerged/re-emerged in recent years, compared with 40.6% in Henan and 23.8% in Liaoning. Less than 60% of participants thought current prevention and control programs had been effective. Participants believed mosquitoes in high abundance, imported cases and climate change were main risk factors for dengue in China. Conclusion: There were varying views of dengue in China. Professionals in areas susceptible to dengue were more likely to be concerned about climate change and dengue. Current prevention and control strategies need to be improved. Providing more information for staff in lower levels of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may help in containing a possible increase of dengue. © 2018 The Authors","China; Climate change; Dengue control; Infectious disease; Public health professional","adult; Article; China; climate change; cross-sectional study; dengue; descriptive research; disease control; disease transmission; female; health practitioner; human; major clinical study; male; mosquito; priority journal; prophylaxis; questionnaire; risk factor; clinical trial; demography; dengue; health personnel attitude; multicenter study; young adult; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; China; Climate Change; Cross-Sectional Studies; Demography; Dengue; Female; Humans; Male; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059224430

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was used to calculate lifecycle impact indicators for greenhouse gases, particulate matter, acidification and eutrophication associated with the annual energy demand in each municipality. Results showed that impacts from energy use increase almost proportionally with total energy used in the participating municipalities due to the heavy reliance on fossil fuels. Analysis of two municipalities of similar size showed that impacts can be attributed to different usage sectors. For one municipality, energy plans should focus on reducing emissions from private transport and associated fuel use. For the other, energy plans should focus on reducing energy demand from residential buildings. This means that a ‘one-size-fits-all’ energy plan, which may be developed at a national level, would not fit all municipalities. The application of LCA allows for identifying and informing energy planning with impact reduction potential for multiple environmental pressures. Analysis of the provided energy use and CO2 data showed large uncertainties in CO2 emission intensities and allowing for sufficient time and guidance in the energy and emissions accounting is recommended. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change mitigation; Life cycle assessment; Municipal energy use; Municipal planning","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Emission control; Energy management; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Eutrophication; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Uncertainty analysis; Climate change mitigation; Climate mitigations; Energy and emissions; Energy use; Environmental pressures; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Municipal planning; Residential building; Life cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; energy planning; energy use; environmental policy; life cycle analysis; local government; Poland [Central Europe]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061406694

There is consensus that HIAs in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are lacking, but no study systematically focuses on those that have been successfully conducted across all regions of the world, nor do they highlight factors that may enable or hinder their implementation. Our objectives are to (1) systematically review, geographically map, and characterize HIA activity in LMICs; and (2) apply a process evaluation method to identify factors which are important to improve HIA implementation in LMICs. A systematic review of peer-reviewed HIAs in 156 LMICs was performed in Scopus, Medline,Web of Science, Sociological abstracts, and LILACs (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences) databases. The search used PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and covered HIAs across all type of interventions, topics, and health outcomes. HIAs were included if they reported a clear intervention and health outcome to be assessed. No time restriction was applied, and grey literature was not included. The eligible studies were subjected to six process evaluation criteria. The search yielded 3178 hits and 57 studies were retained. HIAs were conducted in 26 out of 156 countries. There was an unequal distribution of HIAs across regions and within LMICs countries. The leading topics of HIA in LMICs were air pollution, development projects, and urban transport planning. Most of the HIAs reported quantitative approaches (72%), focused on air pollution (46%), appraised policies (60%), and were conducted at the city level (36%). The process evaluation showed important variations in the way HIAs have been conducted and low uniformity in the reporting of six criteria. No study reported the time, money, and staff used to perform HIAs. Only 12% of HIAs were based on participatory approaches; 92% of HIAs considered multiple outcomes; and 61% of HIAs provided recommendations and fostered cross-national collaboration. The limited transparency in process, weak participation, and inconsistent delivery of recommendations were potential limitations to HIA implementation in low and middle-income countries.

Next generation emissions measurement (NGEM) approaches executed near facilities are enabling new ways to assess these sources and their impacts to nearby populations. This paper describes complementary uses of emerging NGEM systems in a Louisville, KY industrial district (Rubbertown), focusing on an important area air toxic, 1,3-butadiene. Over a one-year deployment starting in September 2017, two-week average passive samplers (PSs) at 11 sites showed both geospatial and temporal trends. At 0.24 ppbv annual average 1,3-butadiene concentration, a group of PSs located near facility fence lines was elevated compared to a PS group located in the community and upwind from facilities (0.07 ppbv average). Two elevated PS periods capturing emission events were examined using time-resolved NGEM approaches as case studies. In one event a 1.18 ppbv PS reading was found to be relatively localized and was caused by a multiday emission from a yet to be identified, non-facility source. In the other event, the airshed was more broadly impacted with PS concentrations ranging from 0.71 ppbv for the near-facility group to 0.46 ppbv for the community group. This case was likely influenced by a known emission event at an industrial facility. For both case studies, air pollutant and wind data from prototype NGEM systems were combined with source location models to inform the emission events. This research illustrates the power of applying NGEM approaches to improve both the understanding of emissions near sources and knowledge of impacts to near-source communities. © 2019 by the authors.

However, forest structure varies, in particular, through interactions with natural and human disturbances. Both variation in structural characteristics and associated relationships with ecosystem service outcomes have been poorly explored in mature, secondary forests redeveloped since 19th century agricultural abandonment in the eastern United States. Our study addressed this uncertainty focusing on carbon storage as an important climate regulation service. We conducted an inventory of 45 plots sharing similar land use history (i) to identify differences in forest structure, and (ii) to investigate links between stand structure and aboveground carbon storage. We derived 19 structural attributes and used these in Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) to categorize structurally different groups. Subsequently, we analyzed carbon density in each cluster and employed a random forest algorithm to derive partial effects of structural attributes on carbon storage. We found a distinctive disparity in forest structure inferred from two hardwood-dominated and one softwood-dominated clusters. Nine variables (cavity tree density, conifer ratio, foliage height index, gap area, live basal area, species diversity, variation in heights and diameters, and vertical shrub cover) explained significant differences between these clusters. Carbon storage varied markedly, and was highest in the softwood cluster. Structural complexity was overall positively associated with carbon storage, whereas this effect was more distinctive in hardwood compared to softwood-dominated forests. In particular, five variables exhibited a positive (conifer ratio, diameter variation, dead basal area, large live trees, and live basal area), one a negative (live tree density), and two (dead tree density and species diversity) a mixed relationship with carbon storage. Despite only moderate variation in climatic conditions across the investigated plots, we found a strong sensitivity of carbon storage to mean annual temperature. In contrast, annual precipitation and topography had no effect on carbon storage. The link between structural complexity and carbon storage suggests a high potential to actively increase forest carbon density. Based on our findings, a variety of options are available to enhance forest structure, and thus to improve carbon storage in managed forest ecosystems. These include, for instance, increasing the variability in tree dimensions and fostering large live trees which may improve niche complementarity. Increasing structural complexity in managed forest stands may thus improve buffering of potentially negative impacts of climate change on carbon stocks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dynamics; Carbon forestry; Development pathways; Forest structure; Gap dynamics; Northeastern U.S. forests; Northern hardwoods; Structural complexity; Structural variability","Biodiversity; Climate change; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Hardwoods; Land use; Sensitivity analysis; Softwoods; Topography; Carbon dynamics; Development pathways; Forest structure; Gap dynamics; Northeastern U.S. forests; Northern hardwoods; Structural complexity; Structural variability; Forestry; algorithm; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; climate conditions; cluster analysis; complementarity; complexity; coniferous forest; ecosystem service; environmental disturbance; forest ecosystem; forest inventory; gap dynamics; nature-society relations; stand structure; Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Hardwoods; Land Use; Softwoods; Topography; United States; Coniferophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063673077

In total, nine isomers of Si 3 C 2 H 2 (1-9) have been theoretically investigated. These include the lowest-energy trigonal bipyramidal geometry (1) and the other eight isomers (2-9) with either a ptC or ptSi atom(s). Among the latter, four isomers are identified to be local minima (2, 5, 6, and 9), three are found to be transition states (3, 4, and 8), and one geometry is found to be a second-order saddle-point (7) on the singlet ground electronic state of Si 3 C 2 H 2 potential energy surface at various levels of theory employed here. While the isomer with a ptC atom show aromatic characteristics (5), the isomers with ptSi atom(s) show either aromatic (2) or anti-aromatic characteristics (6 and 9).

However, unlike 1, the latter four isomers are associated with a non-zero dipole moment (μ≠0).

Modeling future acidification depends on our ability to simulate baseline conditions and changes over the industrial era. Such centennial-scale changes require a global model to account for exchange between the Arctic and surrounding regions. Yet the coarse resolution of typical global models may poorly resolve that exchange as well as critical features of Arctic Ocean circulation. Here we assess how simulations of Arctic Ocean storage of anthropogenic carbon (Cant), the main driver of open-ocean acidification, differ when moving from coarse to eddy-admitting resolution in a global ocean-circulation-biogeochemistry model (Nucleus for European Modeling of the Ocean, NEMO; Pelagic Interactions Scheme for Carbon and Ecosystem Studies, PISCES). The Arctic's regional storage of Cant is enhanced as model resolution increases. While the coarse-resolution model configuration ORCA2 (2) stores 2.0&thinsp;Pg&thinsp;C in the Arctic Ocean between 1765 and 2005, the eddy-admitting versions ORCA05 and ORCA025 (1 •2 and 1g•4) store 2.4 and 2.6&thinsp;Pg&thinsp;C. The difference in inventory between model resolutions that is accounted for is only from their divergence after 1958, when ORCA2 and ORCA025 were initialized with output from the intermediate-resolution configuration (ORCA05). The difference would have been larger had all model resolutions been initialized in 1765 as was ORCA05. The ORCA025 Arctic Cant storage estimate of 2.6&thinsp;Pg&thinsp;C should be considered a lower limit because that model generally underestimates observed CFC-12 concentrations. It reinforces the lower limit from a previous data-based approach (2.5 to 3.3&thinsp;Pg&thinsp;C). Independent of model resolution, there was roughly 3 times as much Cant that entered the Arctic Ocean through lateral transport than via the flux of CO2 across the air-sea interface. Wider comparison to nine earth system models that participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) reveals much larger diversity of stored Cant and lateral transport. Only the CMIP5 models with higher lateral transport obtain Cant inventories that are close to the data-based estimates. Increasing resolution also enhances acidification, e.g., with greater shoaling of the Arctic's average depth of the aragonite saturation horizon during 1960-2012, from 50&thinsp;m in ORCA2 to 210&thinsp;m in ORCA025. Even higher model resolution would likely further improve such estimates, but its prohibitive costs also call for other more practical avenues for improvement, e.g., through model nesting, addition of coastal processes, and refinement of subgrid-scale parameterizations. © Author(s) 2019.",,"acidification; air-sea interaction; anthropogenic effect; aragonite; baseline conditions; carbon budget; climate change; CMIP; model; ocean acidification; saturation; Arctic Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067105271

Here, we present the first economic valuation of multiple ecosystem services (ES) for Ecuador and the TEP using the Galapagos mangroves as a case study. We focused on three ES of high value and policy relevance: carbon storage, support for small-scale fisheries, and mangrove-based tourism. Our data suggest that over 778,000 tons of carbon are stored in Galapagos mangroves, with mean belowground carbon being 211.03 ± 179.65 Mg C/ha, valued at $2940/ha or $22,838/ha depending on the valuation methodology. We identified mangrove-dependent fish targeted by the local finfish fishery, with net benefits of $245 ha −1 , making this fishery the second most profitable in the Archipelago. The value of mangrove-based recreation was estimated at $16,958/ha, contributing $62 million to the industry.

Based on the atom probe tomography data used to reveal this clustering, we develop a k · p model that takes these features into account and links the observed nanostructure to the optical properties of the quantum wells. The calculations show that electrons and holes tend to colocalize at indium clusters. The transition energies between the electron and hole states are strongly affected by the shape and size of the clusters. Hence, clustering contributes to the very large line widths observed in the experimental low temperature photoluminescence spectra. Also, the emission from m-plane InGaN quantum wells is strongly linearly polarized. Clustering does not alter the theoretically predicted polarization properties, even when the shape of the cluster is strongly asymmetric. Overall, however, we show that the presence of clustering does impact the optical properties, illustrating the importance of careful characterization of the nanoscale structure of m-plane InGaN quantum wells and that atom probe tomography is a useful and important tool to address this problem. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Atoms; Gallium nitride; III-V semiconductors; Indium; Nanotechnology; Optical properties; Photoluminescence; Polarization; Probes; Semiconductor alloys; Temperature; Atom probe tomography; Atomic scale structures; Freestanding GaN substrates; InGaN/GaN quantum well; Low temperature photoluminescence; Nanoscale structure; Optical properties of the quantum wells; Polarization properties; Semiconductor quantum wells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067225674

Although socioeconomically advantaged households were initially better able to cope with the shock than other households, the capture resulted in a decline in expenditure for the entire population within three months. Struggling households turned to several coping strategies - they increasingly made purchases on credit, increased their reliance on self-employment to deal with a decline in the economic climate, and reduced both the quantity and quality of foods consumed. Furthermore, there was evidence of a loss of autonomy for women, where women were less likely to oversee food purchases and more likely to be in the household during the survey interview. These results demonstrate that the capture of territory without widespread violence can result in a decline in standards of living and further illustrate the manners in which households were able to cope with the shock. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

A positron emission tomography (PET) ligand for an allosteric site of mGlu4 may provide evidence that a clinical drug candidate reaches and binds the target. A carbon-11-labeled PET radioligand binding an allosteric site of mGlu4, [11C]PXT012253, has been recently developed. Here, we describe the detailed characterization of this novel radiolabeled mGlu4 ligand in nonhuman primates. Procedures: [11C]PXT012253 binding in the brain of cynomolgus monkeys, under the baseline and blocking conditions with the structurally different mGlu4 allosteric ligand PXT002331, currently in clinical trials for Parkinson’s disease, was quantified with compartment and graphical modeling approaches using a radiometabolite-corrected plasma input function. Whole-body biodistribution of [11C]PXT012253 was then assessed using PET/x-ray computed tomography to estimate the human effective doses of [11C]PXT012253 for further clinical studies. Results: [11C]PXT012253 displayed binding in mGlu4-expressing regions in the brain of cynomolgus monkeys. Brain regional time-activity curves of [11C]PXT012253 were well described in the two-tissue compartment model (2TC). Total distribution volume was stably estimated using Logan plot and multilinear analysis (MA1) although 2TC showed unstable values in some cases. Competition with PXT002331 showed high specific binding in the total distribution volume. Whole-body PET showed high accumulation of [11C]PXT012253 in the liver, kidney, heart, and brain in the initial phase. The radioligand was excreted through both the gastrointestinal and the urinary tracts. Effective dose of [11C]PXT012253 was estimated to be 0.0042 mSv/MBq. Conclusions: [11C]PXT012253 was shown to be a promising PET radioligand for mGlu4 allosteric modulators in the monkey brain. MA1 would be the choice of quantitative method. Further development of [11C]PXT012253 in human subjects is warranted. © 2018, World Molecular Imaging Society.","Allosteric; Brain; Dosimetry; Foliglurax; Glutamate; Metabotropic glutamate receptor 4; Positron emission tomography; Primate; Radiotracer","foliglurax; metabotropic receptor 4; pxt 012253 c 11; radioligand; unclassified drug; carbon; Carbon-11; metabotropic receptor; metabotropic receptor 4; radiopharmaceutical agent; allosterism; animal experiment; Article; controlled study; female; high performance liquid chromatography; in vivo study; ligand binding; Macaca fascicularis; nonhuman; positron emission tomography; priority journal; protein binding; quantitative analysis; radiation dose; radioactivity; whole body PET; x-ray computed tomography; allosterism; animal; brain; chemistry; diagnostic imaging; human; male; metabolism; radiation response; time factor; whole body imaging; Allosteric Regulation; Animals; Brain; Carbon Radioisotopes; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Female; Humans; Macaca fascicularis; Male; Positron-Emission Tomography; Radiopharmaceuticals; Receptors, Metabotropic Glutamate; Time Factors; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Whole Body Imaging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051418962

The wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is a useful index for evaluating heat stress and anticipating conditions related to heat-related illness in the present climate, but projecting the WBGT with a sufficiently high temporal and spatial resolution remains challenging for future climate conditions. In this study, we developed a methodological framework for estimating the site-specific hourly resolution WBGT based on the output of general circulation models using only simple calculations. The method was applied to six sites in Japan and its performance was evaluated. The proposed method could reproduce the site-specific hourly resolution WBGT with a high accuracy. Based on the developed framework, we constructed future (2090s) projections under two different greenhouse gas emission pathways. These projections showed a consistent rise in the WBGT and thus the capacity to perform physically demanding activities is expected to decrease. To demonstrate the usefulness of the projected WBGT in planning adaptation measures, we identified the optimal working schedules which would minimize outdoor workers’ exposure to heat at a specific site. The results show that a substantial shift in the working time is required in the future if outdoor workers are to compensate the effect of increased heat exposure only by changing their working hours. This methodological framework and the projections will provide local practitioners with useful information to manage the increased risk of heat stress under climate change. © 2019, ISB.","Climate change; Diurnal variation; Heat stress; Statistical downscaling; WBGT","climate change; heat; heat injury; human; Japan; occupational exposure; temperature; Climate Change; Heat Stress Disorders; Hot Temperature; Humans; Japan; Occupational Exposure; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062014326

Here we use an Earth system model with idealized boundary conditions to simulate climate responses to paleogeographic changes associated with the breakup of a supercontinent. After the supercontinent splits, weaker tropical easterlies occur in the larger ocean basin, which dampens the Walker circulation and warms the equatorial ocean through reduced upwelling. Additionally, cloud formation increases across the midlatitude ocean, causing locally cooler sea surface temperatures. Over land, there is dramatic tropical cooling post breakup due to enhanced moisture and cloud formation. Consequently, the latitudinal temperature gradient responses over land and ocean oppose each other, which makes inferring large scale climate changes from spatially spare proxy records particularly challenging in this scenario. Our findings emphasize the tight coupling between geography and planetary scale climate dynamics in the tropics and subtropics. ©2019. American Geophysical Union.

Identifying climate refugia within our national parks using not only statistical models, but also validating predictions using robust field data should provide focus for managers in their stewardship of parks’ biological resources. In the region surrounding Joshua Tree National Park (JTNP), which straddles the Colorado and Mojave deserts in southern California, previous research has predicted the widespread demise of its namesake iconic species, the Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia) due to climate change. In order to assess whether climate refugia exist for Joshua trees in the future at JTNP, we employed both field measurements and statistical models. We used current distribution point data together with historic climate data, to match conditions when the existing Joshua trees established, in order to predict the distribution of continuously suitable conditions (refugia) at the end-of-century. While the high and moderate mitigation could result in refugia for approximately 19% and 14% of the original area within JTNP, respectively, the business-as-usual scenario indicated an almost complete elimination of Joshua trees from the park. In order to validate model predictions, using teams of community scientists, we measured the demographic patterns of Joshua tree stands from low to upper elevations within JTNP. Recruitment within stands shows a strong concordance with modeled climate refugia; high-recruiting stands were within or closer to modeled refugia and in areas with lower climatic water deficit, higher precipitation, and lower maximum temperature than low-recruiting stands. These findings most importantly indicate the importance of regional to global mitigation strategies for carbon emissions, as reflected in the difference between maintenance of refugia vs. an almost complete elimination of the species from the park by the end-of-century. This also underscores the need to protect areas predicted to support refugia from multiple management threats. Rather than an ominous prediction of extinction, climate refugia provide land stewards with targets for focusing protective management, giving desert biodiversity places to weather the future. © 2019 The Authors.","citizen science; climate change; community science; conservation; Joshua trees; Mojave Desert; plant distribution; recruitment; refugia; species distribution modeling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068235902

To better assess the overall effects of biodiesel application, an experimental study was conducted concerning the effects of rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) and its blends with baseline diesel on particle size distribution (PSD) of a turbocharged compression-ignited (CI) engine under both steady and transient operating conditions. The influence of fuel-side combustion technique of using oxygenated additives on the transient particle emission was identified. Tests were carried out under constant engine speed and various load conditions, and controlled transient operation was employed for the transient study. The results show that biodiesel addition causes advanced start of combustion (SOC) under constant injection timing and higher in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate. Biodiesel has significant effects on the particle size distribution (PSD) under both steady-state and transient condition. For steady-state condition, the number concentration of carbonaceous particles (dp &gt; 22 nm) decrease while that of non-carbonaceous particles (dp &lt; 22 nm) increase with the increase of biodiesel proportion. For transient condition, biodiesel addition, as an oxygenated blending agent, can effective suppress the increase of carbonaceous particles but the nuclei mode particle increase dramatically during the load increasing process.

The study derives (1) combustion emission factors (EFs) of refinery fuels (e.g., refinery catalyst coke and refinery combined gas), (2) U.S. refinery GHG emissions and CAP emissions per crude throughput at the national and regional levels, and (3) GHG and CAP emissions attributable to U.S. refinery products. The latter two emissions were further itemized by source: combustion emission, process emission, and facility-wide emission. We estimated U.S. refinery product GHG and CAP emissions via energy allocation at the refinery process unit level. The unit energy demand and unit flow information were adopted from the Petroleum Refinery Life Cycle Inventory Model (PRELIM version 1.1) by fitting individual U.S. refineries.

Under near-ultraviolet excitation, the Ba 3 (ZnB 5 O 10 )PO 4 : Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ phosphors displayed an intense blue emission attributed to the 4f-5d transition of the Eu 2+ ions along with a characteristic orange-red emission due to the 4 T 1 ( 4 G)- 6 A 1 ( 6 S) transition of the Mn 2+ ions. Increasing the doping concentration of the Mn 2+ ions considerably strengthened Mn 2+ emission and reduced Eu 2+ emission owing to the energy transfer from Eu 2+ to Mn 2+ ions, thus implementing the continuous tuning of chromaticity coordinates of the Ba 3 (ZnB 5 O 10 )PO 4 : Eu 2+ , Mn 2+ phosphors from blue to orange-white and eventually to orange-red. Furthermore, theoretical calculations demonstrated that the dipole-dipole interaction was dominantly involved in the mechanism of energy transfer from Eu 2+ to Mn 2+ ions in the phosphors, and the critical distance was calculated to be 23.61 Å.

We find that commuters in our sample choose online ojek substituting for a diverse set of other modes, especially minibuses. The results of our survey show that reduction in GHG emissions from mode shift towards online ojek are negligible once pick-up distance of motorcycles is included.

EU directives set targets for member states to reduce energy use in buildings. Energy saving in historic buildings requires special measures, balancing energy-saving renovations against the preservation of heritage values. Traditional constructions are open to vapor diffusion and generally work differently from modern constructions. Modern materials in traditional constructions sometimes damages the original material as they are usually diffusion-tight. The aim of this study was to investigate whether hemp-lime could be used as an insulation material to improve the energy effciency of historic timber building envelopes with a rendered façade in Sweden. The objective was to determine the actual energy savings for space heating. An additional objective was to determine the actual thermal transmittance and to study thermal buffering through in-situ measurements in a full-scale wall renovated with hemp-lime. Two full-scale wall sections were constructed at the Energy and Building Design laboratory at Lund University: A traditional post-and-plank wall with a lime render (80 mm), and a post-and-plank wall with a hemp-lime render (90 mm). Energy use for space heating was monitored continuously over a period of one year. The wall with a hemp-lime render required 33% less energy for space heating than the traditional post-and-plank wall with a lime render. This was accomplished without changing the framework, appearance or material in the render and without drastically changing the hygric properties of the façade. From the gathered data, the thermal transmittance (U-values) for both walls was calculated using two different methods, one based on material properties and the other based on energy use data. For both walls, thermal transmittance based on actual energy use data during the heating period was lower than what was expected from their material properties. This indicates that more material properties than thermal conductivity and material thickness need to be taken into account when performing energy use calculations. With hemp-lime, a renovation can be accomplished without damaging the timber structure and wooden slats, and it can be done with local traditional materials and building methods with no difference in appearance to a traditional lime render. This allows for heritage values to be preserved, while also allowing the building to comply with modern standards and with increased thermal comfort and reduced energy use. © 2019 by the authors.","Cultural heritage; Energy effciency; Hemp-lime; Lime render; Retrofitting; Thermal insulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068135811

The region remains mostly intact but is expected to undergo major changes over the next century due to anthropogenic climate change. This warming, and resulting changes in moisture regimes, are altering vegetation and disturbance dynamics, and will likely result in expansion of grasslands and deciduous forests, strongly challenging bird species to keep pace. We present a vulnerability-adaptation framework to guide bird conservation based on species’ individual vulnerability and exposure to climate change. For sensitive species with declining populations, conservation should focus on management of current threats and species recovery in situ to improve adaptive capacity and facilitate future shifts in distribution. Sensitive species with high exposure to climate change may warrant more extensive intervention, such as habitat manipulation or even translocation. For species with lower sensitivity and stable populations, but high climate change exposure, longterm investments in protecting refugia and “stepping stones” will be most effective. In general, across all species, land-based approaches that “conserve nature’s stage” by promoting geophysical diversity and habitat connectivity, maintaining natural disturbance dynamics, and facilitating broad shifts in bird distribution may prove most effective in maintaining species diversity. Implementation of this framework will require large-scale, interagency coordination on recovery plans, as well as adaptive forest management, designation of critical habitat, and land protection. Challenges include data gaps, uncertainty about future conditions, coordination of conservation actions during the nonbreeding periods, and the region’s vast scale. However, given the region’s continental importance, successful implementation of this framework could benefit birds throughout the western hemisphere. © 2019 by the author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070746253

Although much has been learned from studying the Sivas basin, Turkey, other sites require analysis in order to gain a more general understanding. This study focuses on the Plio-Pleistocene minibasin that lies adjacent to the Onion Creek Salt Diapir in Fisher Valley, Utah, United States. A curious feature of these sediments is the apparent presence of cycles that begins with gravels, followed by loose sands, finally terminated by paleosols. Magnetic Susceptibility measurements of the outcrop also display an apparent sinuosity when compared to depth. Furthermore the Middle Pleistocene transition, a period when Earth's climate cycles shifted from 41-ka to 100-ka cycles, appears to be recorded in the magnetic susceptibility data. This implies that climate was a significant factor in the development of this basin and further studies of terrestrial minibasins should consider the role of climate when studying facies changes. © 81st EAGE Conference and Exhibition 2019.

In this study pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC–MS) has been used to quantify the solvent-insoluble component of marine organic matter in surface sediments to gain a more holistic understanding of the macromolecular composition at five stations along a south to north transect in the Arctic Barents Sea, east of Svalbard (depths 288–334 m.b.s.l). Two methods were compared to identify the effectiveness of rapid screening, in contrast to grouping similar pyrolysis products. There were changes in macromolecular composition of marine surface sediments across the S-N transect using both methods, highlighting the varying benthic and pelagic communities north of the Polar Front and across the variable sea ice margin, corresponding to differing biological communities (e.g. fish, phytoplankton, ice algae, zooplankton). All five stations across the changing sea ice transect were interpreted as having primarily marine surface sediment macromolecular signatures, given their locations far from major terrestrial inputs and the more subtle changes when compared with previous investigations on the East Siberian Artic shelf. Fluctuations in macromolecular compositions across the transect included increasing N-containing compounds (including pyridines) and n-alkene/n-alkane doublet pyrolysis products from sediments collected in stations with the greatest average ice cover. If the future position of the Polar Front moves northwards then deposition of labile organic matter which appears to be efficiently processed will move further north, meaning greater deposition of organic carbon under areas of open ocean. Future research needs to understand how this OC will be buried and if it is regionally significant, given anticipated weakening stratification and a more Atlantic influenced northern Barents Sea. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Arctic ocean; Barents Sea; Carbon cycling; Macromolecular organic matter; Marine sediment; Sea ice retreat","Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Climate change; Deposition; Gas chromatography; Macromolecules; Marine biology; Mass spectrometry; Oceanography; Plankton; Pyrolysis; Sea ice; Submarine geology; Surficial sediments; Arctic ocean; Barents sea; Carbon cycling; Marine sediments; Sea ice retreats; Organic carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062008415

As such the Valle de la Fueva catchments in the southern Pyrenees present high-lying talus remnants, extensive denudation surfaces (pediments), deeply incised tributary ravines, and low-lying fluvial-cut terraces. Based on geomorphic analyses and absolute dating using terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides and optically stimulated luminescence, a (late stage) catchment erosion model for the Valle de la Fueva was elaborated and indicates successive development stages of (i) lasting pedimentation under cold-climate conditions during Marine Isotope Stages 4–2, (ii) rapid fluvial dissection, sediment remobilization and downcutting of ravines in response to the last major climate transition and establishing interglacial conditions, and (iii) late stage fluvial incision after 3–4 ka due to regionally increased flood magnitudes, and/or intensification of agriculture and forest management. Valle de la Fueva headwater catchment analysis indicated that the styles and magnitudes of basin surface processes were directly correlated with the amplitude and nature of paleoclimatic changes, modified by the interplay of environmental parameters. In contrast to large-scale fluvial systems, mountain headwater catchments seemed to be less afflicted with temporal and spatial averaging biases. They are thus useful targets for investigating direct climate change effects, surface process coupling, and non-linear response mechanisms in Quaternary fluvial systems. © 2019 by the authors.

In this study, the SUBSTOR-Potato model was used to simulate the potato crop growth and yield in a sub-tropical region of West Bengal comprising of three districts, namely West Medinipur, Bankura and Birbhum in India. Also, the effect of temperature and planting dates scenario on potato crop growth was evaluated by using 30 years historical weather data of the aforesaid districts. Field experiments were conducted on potato crops of cultivar Kufri Jyoti under two planting dates (10th and 25th of December) and different fertilizer treatments in the years 2013–2014 and 2014–2015, respectively. The statistical results showed the satisfactory performance of the model with an R2 of 0.82 to 0.98 and d-stat of 0.94 to 0.98 for the year 2013–2014 and an R2 of 0.89 to 0.98 and d-stat of 0.97 to 0.98 for the year 2014–2015. Evaluation of planting dates with past 30 years historical data showed planting dates 20th and 30th of November resulted in average higher yield than planting dates 10th, 25th and 30th of December, respectively, in current climate scenario. Furthermore, the study suggests that amending the planting dates is an effective climate change adaptation strategy for reducing the effect of temperature on the yield of a potato crop in the near future. © 2018, European Association for Potato Research.","Planting dates; Potato; SUBSTOR model; Temperature; Yield",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058140424

AWD could reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and save water use without compromising rice yields. However, its effects depend on how water level is effectively controlled. This study aims to evaluate GHG emissions, water use and yield of rice cultivation as affected by the implementation of incomplete AWD and complete AWD. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) was transplanted in the experimental field at Ratchaburi province, Thailand under CF and AWD water management. Water management for AWD in wet season was not complete due to the interference of rainfall in the tillering stage, while it was complete in the dry season. Relative to CF, the incomplete AWD reduced CH 4 emission by 10.62% but increased N 2 O emission by 5.94%. The complete AWD reduced CH 4 emission by 23.10% but increased N 2 O emission by 14.79%. Although both AWD systems increased N 2 O emission, however, their total global warming potentials (GWP) were still lower than CF by 5.32% under incomplete AWD and 10.83% under incomplete AWD. The incomplete AWD and complete AWD used 11.88% and 3.79% less water (irrigation + rainfall) when compared to CF. In terms of rice yield, it was enhanced only under complete AWD by 2.42% through increased number of tillers and panicles. The yield was reduced under incomplete AWD by 9.12%. Complete AWD and incomplete AWD reduced the irrigation water by 4.52% and 16.72%. The water productivity and water scarcity footprint have been reduced in both AWD systems while the carbon footprint was reduced by 13.95% under complete AWD but increased by 3.44% under incomplete AWD. The results showed that, during dry season, complete AWD is a good water management practice to replace CF as it can help mitigate GHG emissions, save water and increase yield. It was noted that in a case where incomplete AWD happened, although less water was used than the complete AWD but high emissions and yield reduction may occur. Therefore, to avoid incomplete AWD, it is recommended to implement AWD in the area or season with no frequent rainfall. © 2019","Complete AWD; GHG emissions; Incomplete AWD; Rice cultivation; Rice yield; Water use","Carbon footprint; Drought; Gas emissions; Global warming; Irrigation; Rain; Water levels; Water management; Water supply; Wetting; Complete AWD; GHG emission; Incomplete AWD; Rice cultivation; Rice yield; Water use; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063640564

The target is to compare engine performance and emissions. At full load, engine performance varies due to the variation in LHV. Under the same values of performance, the sugarcane biodiesel-LS9 provides the lowest THC emissions. The higher CN and exhaust gas recirculation of the sugarcane biodiesel-LS9 and the higher H/C ratio of the sugarcane diesel-farnesane compared to the diesel S50 provide a NOx reduction. Neither the increment in bsfc nor the increment of %EGR for the sugarcane biodiesel-LS9 deteriorate the combustion, so its CO emissions are lower. The sugarcane biodiesel-LS9 leads to the lowest NOx and PM specific emissions under transient operation, followed by the sugarcane diesel-farnesane. The THC and CO specific emissions are higher for the biofuels in comparison to the diesel S50. The main reason for these results is the impact of the properties of the biofuels on the ECU response However, both biofuels produce less harmful emissions at idle conditions, which supports their usage to reduce exhaust emissions in urban areas. © 2019","Diesel engine; European transient cycle; Regulated emissions; Sugarcane biodiesel-LS9; Sugarcane diesel-farnesane","Biodiesel; Diesel engines; Nitrogen oxides; Comparative studies; Engine performance; Engine test benches; Exhaust emission; Harmful emissions; Regulated emissions; Transient cycle; Transient operation; Exhaust gas recirculation; biofuel; comparative study; diesel engine; emission control; European Union; exhaust emission; performance assessment; sugar cane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064161957

However, it is limited to explore the impact of altruism on energy-saving appliances use from the perspective of pro-environmental behavior. To remedy the problem, according to the particular situation of China, we propose an extended norm activation theory model. The 435 valid questionnaires have been analyzed using the structural equation model and the hierarchical regression model. The results prove that, haze pollution has promoted the consumption of energy-saving appliances for urban residents in China; personal norm, environmental concern, and perceived consumer effectiveness all have a significant positive impact on purchasing behavior of energy-saving appliance; personal norm is influenced by four cognitive factors of awareness of consequences, ascription of responsibility, environmental concern and perceived consumer effectiveness; personal norm mediates the relationship between environmental concern, perceived consumer effectiveness and purchasing behavior, respectively; herd mentality negatively moderates the relationship between environmental concern and purchasing behavior, and positively moderates the relationship between personal norm and purchasing behavior. Instead, policy and propaganda only positively moderate the relationship between personal norm and purchasing behavior. Moreover, the results also confirmed the appropriateness of the extended norm activation theory for exploring urban residents’ purchasing behavior of energy-saving appliances. The findings could be helpful for a better understanding of urban residents’ purchasing behavior of energy-saving appliances, which in turn promotes the development of energy-saving appliances. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Energy-saving appliances; Extended norm activation model; Haze pollution","Chemical activation; Consumer behavior; Emission control; Regression analysis; Sales; Surveys; Activation models; Consumption of energy; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Environmental concerns; Haze pollutions; Hierarchical regression models; Pro-environmental behaviors; Structural equation modeling; Energy conservation; atmospheric pollution; empirical analysis; energy efficiency; haze; urban area; adult; article; awareness; China; consumer; empiricism; energy conservation; female; haze; herd; human; human experiment; male; propaganda; purchasing; questionnaire; responsibility; structural equation modeling; urban population; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062409550

However, the impacts of cutting overcapacity of industries on economic development and environmental quality still remain unrevealed clearly. In this study, a dynamic input-output simulation model is developed by integrating supply and demand balances of material and value with industrial capacity and applied to Tangshan City, which is typically implementing cutting overcapacity against four key sectors (oil processing and coking, cement, iron and steel, and power and heat). Three scenarios are set for analyzing changes in capacity and pollutant (SO 2 , NO x and particulate matter) emission mitigation during 2017–2025 through mutual comparisons. Changes in capacity of four key sectors as well as gross regional product are simulated. Industrial structure will be reshaped with most notable changes in service industry and iron and steel industry. Critical industrial chains are traced for manifesting to what extent cutting overcapacity will influence the sectors closely interacted with the key sectors. Remarkable mitigation of emissions and concentration contribution can be contributed by cutting overcapacity with accumulative mitigated emissions of the pollutants as 0.48, 1.09 and 0.79 Mt, respectively.

The results show: i) There is an apparent difference in perception levels for long-term temperature and precipitation changes. Specifically, 57.4% of farmers perceived the long-term temperature change correctly, but only 29.7% of farmers perceived the long-term precipitation change correctly; ii) The factors influencing the farmers' perceptions are almost completely different between precipitation and temperature, the former are mostly agriculture related, while latter are mostly non-agriculture related, except for farm size; and iii) Farmers are not expected to pay more attention to long-term precipitation changes over the crop growing seasons, because less than 30% of farmers can correctly perceive long-term precipitation change. Therefore, to improve the accuracy of farmers' perceptions of climate change, the government is recommended to: i) enhance education and training programs; ii) speed up land transfer and expand household land farm size; iii) develop farmer cooperative organizations; iv) invest more in agricultural infrastructure, specifically in major grain producing regions; and v) improve the agricultural environment and increase farming income. © 2019 CAAS.

The purpose is to explore strategic interactions between the two actors in the case of Mlumbilo village in Tanzania. Whereas carbon sequestration at minimum cost is an objective for the principal, the village community aims at maximizing the net present value of income from all types of land use. The application of both a multi-objective bio-economic model with detailed biological data and a bargaining game theory model with asymmetric information revealed that the choice of reference level used as a performance benchmark had major implications for the negotiated prices for CO 2 . However, the choice of reference level did not affect the cost efficiency of carbon sequestration. Additionally, the outcome of the bargaining model was unique and efficient. The authors conclude that recipient discretion will yield efficient results when the agent trusts that the principal will pay for verified sequestration. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bargaining game; Constrained model; Land use; Nash equilibrium; Pareto optimality","carbon dioxide; carbon; asymmetric information; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; cost analysis; emissions trading; game theory; land use; model; strategic approach; village; Article; carbon sequestration; economic aspect; income; land use; Tanzania; economic model; game; interpersonal communication; Tanzania; Tanzania; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Game Theory; Models, Economic; Negotiating; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063983570

Hydrogen fugacity (fH2) in tightly sealed Pt and Au capsules was controlled using the double capsule technique at the Mo + MoO2 + H2O (MMO) or Fe + FeO + H2O (IW) equilibria. Synthesis of light alkanes (C2 &gt; C1 &gt; C3 &gt; C4), with smaller amounts of unsaturated hydrocarbons and O-bearing species, occurred all over the experimental P-T-fH2 ranges. For the first time, formation of hydrocarbons from inorganic compounds was directly proved by the reaction of 13C carbon with hydrogen, which yielded isotopically pure 13C light alkanes. In 6.3 GPa runs, the fluid-graphite reaction rate progressively grew, and the process became avalanche-like as the run duration exceeded 1 h. The greatest amounts of HCs (CH4/C2H6 &lt; 1, CH4/C3H8, and CH4/C4H10 ≤ 10) formed at 1400 °C in the 10-hr run. The amount of HC fluid synthesized at 1200 °C was twice smaller. An increase in the experiment duration to 40 h had no effect on amounts of HCs and the composition of species, which indicated that the system achieved equilibrium. The rate of HCs formation was slowest in runs with diamond. The fluid composition varied with pressure and temperature: it contained less methane and slightly more unsaturated hydrocarbons and O-bearing species as pressure and temperature were increased from 5.5 to 7.8 GPa and from 1150 to 1350 °C. An increase in the CO2 concentration in the fluid led to a drastic decrease in the yield of hydrocarbons. The absence of C17O2 in products of the reaction between graphite and fluid containing 17O-labeled water indicated that water was not directly involved in HCs synthesis. The experiments have provided the first unambiguous evidence that volatile-rich and reduced mantles of terrestrial planets (at fO2 near or below IW) provided favorable conditions for formation of a wide range of HCs, mainly light alkanes. Carbon for the HC synthesis may come from graphite, diamond, and soot-like carbon. It should be expected that the efficiency of HCs formation by carbon hydrogenation should be maximal for an increased heat flux (&gt;40 mW/m2) at mantle depths corresponding to the graphite stability region. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Experiment; Fluid; Hydrocarbons; Mantle; Terrestrial planets","Diamonds; Experiments; Fluids; Graphite; Heat flux; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen; Hydrogen inorganic compounds; Hydrogenation; Iron oxides; Molybdenum oxide; Paraffins; Planets; Soot; Carbon , graphites; Composition of species; Favorable conditions; Mantle; Pressure and temperature; Stability regions; Terrestrial planets; Unsaturated hydrocarbons; Carbon inorganic compounds; experimental study; heat flux; hydrocarbon; hydrogen; inorganic compound; mantle structure; methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064553189

This study aimed to evaluate plant preferences for oviposition of gravid females of noctuid stemborers, Busseola fusca and Sesamia calamistis, and the crambid Chilo partellus for uninfested maize plants and plants infested by conspecific or heterospecific larvae. The involvement of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by uninfested and maize plants infested by conspecific or heterospecific larvae on moth orientation was studied in Y-tube olfactometer assays and in the field. All gravid female moths significantly preferred VOCs emitted by plants infested by conspecific or heterospecific larvae over those from uninfested plants, and female moths did not systematically prefer VOCs emitted by plants infested by conspecifics. Field trials confirmed these results. Chemical analysis by coupled gas chromatography/mass spectrometry showed that VOCs emitted by larvae-infested plants, regardless of the stemborer species, were compositionally richer than those released by uninfested plants but their emission intensity varied with species involved in the infestation. Busseola fusca larvae induced a compositionally richer VOCs profile than S. calamistis and C. partellus larvae. Eight candidate attractants were associated with larvae-infested plants. These results open new avenues to develop attractants specific to trap female stemborer moths in the field. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Interactions; Lepidoptera stemborers; Maize plant; Olfaction; Volatiles",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062787362

Model predictive control strategy (MPC) is considered as a way to tackle this issue efficiently. This optimization-based control strategy selects the best control action by anticipating the system expected response. As the main contribution, this paper provides the impact of the State of Charge (SoC) estimation by the Battery Management System (BMS) on the performance of a MPC through the cost function pareto front study accounting for the equivalent fuel consumption and the battery capacity fade during the charge sustaining (CS) mode. MPC demonstrates abilities to reduce the equivalent fuel consumption and battery capacity fade respectively by 1% and 49% compared to an On Off thermostat control strategy when the battery is in charge sustaining mode. Moreover, the results show that the SoC estimation by a BMS impacts slightly the fuel efficiency and battery lifetime when MPC is the control strategy. However, the accuracy of the vehicle linear speed prediction has more influence than the precision of the SoC provided by the BMS on the MPC performance. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Carbon footprint; Charging (batteries); Cost functions; Electric utilities; Fuels; Model predictive control; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Predictive control systems; Secondary batteries; Vehicle performance; Battery capacity; Battery lifetime; Control strategies; Electrified vehicles; Equivalent fuel consumption; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Powertrain components; State-of-charge estimation; Battery management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071287036

Given this dearth of information, the present study sought to identify a valid and reliable measure of safety climate at both the workgroup and organizational levels within the fire service. Methods: Researchers surveyed 994 firefighters in two large metropolitan fire departments. Preliminary analyses including psychometrics, confirmatory factor analyses, and shared perception analyses were completed. A linear mixed model analysis was then completed to assess the relationships between workgroup safety climate, organizational safety climate, and safety behaviors, including both safety compliance and safety citizenship behaviors. Results: Measures of safety climate at the workgroup (WGSC) and organizational levels (OSC) were derived. WGSC factors include supervisor support (α = 0.92), vertical cohesion (α = 0.89), and horizontal cohesion (α = 0.94). OSC factors include management commitment (α = 0.91), safety programs/policies (α = 0.89), perceived fairness (α = 0.86) and incident command (α = 0.90). Confirmatory factor analyses confirmed our multi-factor models were a good fit to the data. The linear mixed model analysis found that WGSC positively predicted safety compliance behavior (B = 0.13, p < .001) and safety citizenship behavior (B = 0.22, p < .001) and OSC positively predicted safety compliance behavior (B = 0.16, p < .001) and safety citizenship behavior (B = 0.15, p < .001). Conclusions: This work presents reliable and valid measures of both workgroup and organizational safety climate, which have positive relationships with safety behavior outcomes. Practical application: The measures, which were developed through an extensive multi-method process, provide a means for researchers and practitioners to assess safety climate in the fire service and provides guidance for future safety climate research, including informing intervention research, which could potentially bolster safety climate and enhance safety in the fire service. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and National Safety Council",,"Emergency services; Factor analysis; Fires; Multivariant analysis; Confirmatory factor analysis; Intervention research; Linear mixed model analysis; Organizational levels; Organizational safety; Preliminary analysis; Safety citizenship behaviors; Supervisor supports; Climate models; adult; factor analysis; female; fire fighter; health behavior; human; male; middle aged; organization and management; organizational culture; psychometry; questionnaire; safety; young adult; Adult; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Firefighters; Health Behavior; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Organizational Culture; Psychometrics; Safety Management; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062917895

The scheme groups 3-day precipitation totals exceeding 100 mm into one of five precipitation categories, or ‘‘P-Cats.’’ To demonstrate the categorization scheme and assess its observational uncertainty across a range of precipitation measurement approaches, we compare the climatology of P-Cats defined using in situ station data from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily (GHCN-D); satellite-derived data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA); gridded station data from the Parameter-Elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM); global reanalysis from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2; and regional reanalysis from the North American Regional Reanalysis. While all datasets capture the principal spatial patterns of P-Cat climatology, results show considerable variability across the suite in frequency, spatial extent, and magnitude. Higher-resolution datasets, PRISM and TMPA, most closely resemble GHCN-D and capture a greater frequency of high-end P-Cats relative to the lower-resolution products. When all datasets are rescaled to a common coarser grid, differences persist with datasets originally constructed at a high resolution maintaining a higher frequency and magnitude of P-Cats. Results imply that dataset choice matters when applying the P-Cat scheme to track extreme precipitation over space and time. Potential future applications of the P-Cat scheme include providing a target for climate model evaluation and a basis for characterizing future change in extreme precipitation as projected by climate model simulations. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.",,"extreme event; precipitation (climatology); precipitation assessment; spatial analysis; temporal analysis; uncertainty analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073386389

While there are currently several low/near net zero-community pilots in existence or in the making, they usually occur in specialized circumstances such as residential subdivisions or model communities, and they tend to focus on technology fixes.

There are many modifications in cell membranes which ensure that solutes are transported smoothly even at low temperatures. Other mechanisms include the synthesis of antifreeze proteins (AFPs), cold-shock proteins (Csps), cold acclimation proteins (Caps), cryoprotectants, ice nucleation factors and cold-adapted enzymes. Since agricultural ecosystems are mainly characterized by low temperatures because of the effects of global warming, the psychrophilic microbes have gained lot of importance to plants growing in cold climatic conditions and higher altitudes having temperatures below 0°C. Hence there is a need to identify the cold tolerant microbes that can sustain such lower temperatures, retain their functional traits under low temperature conditions. Such microorganisms can be used as inoculants in agricultural production systems in the temperate regions of the world.

Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have evolved from their inchoate state and are proving to be a promising solution to the serious existential problem posed to the planet earth. Not only do HEVs provide better fuel economy and lower emissions satisfying environmental legislations, but also they dampen the effect of rising fuel prices on consumers. HEVs combine the drive powers of an internal combustion engine and an electrical machine. The main components of HEVs are energy storage system, motor, bidirectional converter and maximum power point trackers (MPPT, in case of solar-powered HEVs). The performance of HEVs greatly depends on these components and its architecture. This paper presents an extensive review on essential components used in HEVs such as their architectures with advantages and disadvantages, choice of bidirectional converter to obtain high efficiency, combining ultracapacitor with battery to extend the battery life, traction motors’ role and their suitability for a particular application. Inclusion of photovoltaic cell in HEVs is a fairly new concept and has been discussed in detail. Various MPPT techniques used for solar-driven HEVs are also discussed in this paper with their suitability. © 2019, The Author(s).","Architecture; Bidirectional converter; Hybrid electric vehicle; Hybrid energy storage system; Traction motors",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071003996

People, governments, and a range of non-state actors are responding to these climatic and non-climatic risks through planned and autonomous response strategies. While several studies examine the drivers of vulnerability and range of response strategies undertaken, few distinguish development interventions from climate adaptation actions, making it difficult to identify particular entry points for enabling and strengthening adaptation action. In this paper, we apply Eakin et al.'s (2014) framework of generic versus specific capacity to data from three semi-arid regions in India to examine the implications of multi-scalar response strategies on local adaptive capacities and adaptation processes. We find that current arguments of good development translating into effective adaptation are not always seen: building specific capacities to deal with climatic risks is essential to leverage wins through development interventions. This can help semi-arid regions and people living in them to move towards sustainable adaptation pathways. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Adaptive capacity; India; Risk management; Sustainable adaptation; Synergies; Vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065624622

Over the last two decades, the European Union (EU) reform of electricity markets has had positive results, and market liberalization acts as a stimulus for energy efficiency, lower prices, and technological progress. Today’s EU policy for the development of electricity and the entire energy sector seeks to provide system modernization, stability, reinforcement of the single market, and implementation of climate change policy with an emphasis on the decarbonization of energy sources and the increase of energy efficiency. After all of the EU efforts to form an electricity sector in member states, it is necessary to assess the efficiency of the policy implemented and to identify the results achieved in shaping a sustainable electricity sector. The purpose of this article is to carry out a sustainability assessment of the electricity sector in the EU countries. A set of eight indicators designed to assess the sustainability of the electricity sector of different EU countries in 2017 has been drawn up. The assessment is made using the multi-criteria decision-making method (MCDM) Technique for Order Preference (TOPSIS). The assessment shows that the electricity market of Slovenia is the most sustainable, with Luxembourg in the second position in the EU. © 2019 by the authors.","Electricity sector; European Union; MCDM; Multi-criteria decision-making; Renewable electricity; Renewable energy; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable energy; TOPSIS","Climate change; Commerce; Decision making; Electric industry; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Electricity sector; European union; MCDM; Multi criteria decision making; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable energy; TOPSIS; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067254122

First, global 3-D tropospheric chemistry and transport model (GEOS-Chem)-integrated satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) and vertical profiles were used to estimate near-surface sulfate and nitrate levels at 10-km resolution over China from 2006 to 2014. Ground measurement validation of our satellite model yielded correlation coefficients (r) of 0.7 and 0.73 and normalized mean bias (NMB) values of −37.96% and − 32.73% for sulfate and nitrate, respectively. Second, analyses of the spatiotemporal distributions of sulfate and nitrate as well as the vertical density Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)-measured SO 2 (PBL_SO 2 ) and NO 2 (TVCD_NO 2 ) indicated that the highest nitrate and sulfate levels occurred in the North China Plain (~25 μg/m 3 ) and Sichuan Basin (SCB) (~30 μg/m 3 ), respectively. The long-term variations in the estimated components and precursor gases indicated that the large sulfate decline was positively correlated with the SO 2 emission reduction due to the mandatory desulfurization implemented in 2007. The annual growth rate of sulfate relative to the national mean was −6.19%/yr, and the concentration decreased by 17.10% from 2011 to 2014. Energy consumption increases and a lack of control measures for NO 2 resulted in persistent increases in NO 2 emissions and nitrate concentrations from 2006 to 2010, particularly in the SCB. With energy consumption structure advancements, reductions in NO 2 emissions and corresponding nitrate levels over three typical regions were prominent after 2012. Third, the estimated national-scale uncertainties of satellite datasets at 0.1° × 0.1° were 26.88% for sulfate and 25.55% for nitrate. Differences in the spatial distributions and temporal trends between our estimated components and precursor gases were mainly attributed to the dataset accuracy, the data pre-processing strategy, inconsistent column density and near-surface mass concentration, meteorological variables and complex chemical reactions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Nitrate; NO 2; SO 2; Spatial distribution; Sulfate; Temporal variation","Aerosols; Chemical analysis; Data handling; Emission control; Energy utilization; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Reduction; Satellites; Spatial distribution; Sulfur compounds; Ultraviolet spectrometers; Uncertainty analysis; Complex chemical reactions; Correlation coefficient; Energy consumption structure; Meteorological variables; Ozone monitoring instruments; Spatiotemporal distributions; Sulfate; Temporal variation; Growth rate; nitrate; sulfate; concentration (composition); environmental assessment; nitrate; optical depth; particulate matter; spatial distribution; sulfate; temporal variation; vertical profile; air pollution; Article; chemical reaction; China; concentration (parameter); correlation coefficient; desulfurization; energy consumption; gas; growth rate; measurement accuracy; meteorological phenomena; pollution control; priority journal; satellite imagery; spatiotemporal analysis; validation study; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062902901

The maximum temperature and pressure in the capsules reached 545 K and 12.5 GPa respectively. Using the LC-MS-MS analysis, the 21 synthesis products have been identified, including amines and polyamines, carboxamide, acetamide and urea derivatives, compounds containing aniline, pyrrolidine, pyrrole, imidazole, as well as alcohol groups. It was found that the Fischer-Tropsch-type syntheses with catalysis on the surface of the stainless steel of the conservation capsule associated with the adsorbed hydrogen cyanide reactions and transamidation processes play the main role in the shock syntheses. Formation reactions of all the above-mentioned compounds have been suggested. It was proposed that hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, isocyanic acid, aminonitrile, aminoacetonitrile, as well as adsorbed species H(a), CH(a), CH2(a), CHOH(a), NH2(a) and H2CNH(a) are especially important for the formation of the products. A reduction reaction of adsorbed bicarbonate with hydrogen to formaldehyde has been first postulated. In the studied system also classical reactions take place – Wöhler’s synthesis of urea and Butlerov’s synthesis of methenamine. It was suggest that material of meteorites may be an effective catalyst in the Fischer-Tropsch-type syntheses at falling of the iron-nickel meteorites in the water – formamide regions on the early Earth.

APHH-Beijing brings together leading China and UK research groups, state-of-the-art infrastructure and air quality models to work on four research themes: (1) sources and emissions of air pollutants; (2) atmospheric processes affecting urban air pollution; (3) air pollution exposure and health impacts; and (4) interventions and solutions. Themes 1 and 2 are closely integrated and support Theme 3, while Themes 1-3 provide scientific data for Theme 4 to develop cost-effective air pollution mitigation solutions. This paper provides an introduction to (i) the rationale of the APHH-Beijing programme and (ii) the measurement and modelling activities performed as part of it. In addition, this paper introduces the meteorology and air quality conditions during two joint intensive field campaigns-a core integration activity in APHH-Beijing. The coordinated campaigns provided observations of the atmospheric chemistry and physics at two sites: (i) the Institute of Atmospheric Physics in central Beijing and (ii) Pinggu in rural Beijing during 10 November-10 December 2016 (winter) and 21 May-22 June 2017 (summer). The campaigns were complemented by numerical modelling and automatic air quality and low-cost sensor observations in the Beijing megacity. In summary, the paper provides background information on the APHH-Beijing programme and sets the scene for more focused papers addressing specific aspects, processes and effects of air pollution in Beijing. © 2019 Author(s).",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; health impact; megacity; numerical model; pollutant source; pollution control; research work; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066949604

Firstly, a fuzzy logic control strategy is designed. The fuzzy controller takes the difference between the required torque and the optimal torque of the engine, state of charge (SOC) of the battery and the motor speed as the inputs, and the engine output torque factor as the output. Secondly, because the division of membership functions and the formulation of fuzzy rules have certain subjectivity, we use an improved adaptive genetic algorithm (IAGA) to optimize the parameters of the fuzzy controller. Finally, two control strategies are simulated on the ADVISOR platform. The simulation results show that compared with the original fuzzy control strategy, the optimized fuzzy logic control strategy could improve the fuel economy of the vehicle and reduce the emissions significantly. © 2019 IEEE.","Energy control Strategy; Fuzzy Control; Improved Adaptive Genetic Algorithm; Parallel Hybrid Electric Vehicle",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073121492

In urban area with high population density, vehicles contribute a big portion of PM 2.5 . The effect of vegetations along road, i.e., road greenbelts, on PM 2.5 concentration is still a hot research topic. This study used three-dimensional green volume (3DGV, the three-dimensional volume of the crown and stems of all vegetations including trees, shrubs and grass) to evaluate the vegetation quantity of road greenbelts along four main roads in Nanjing, China. High spatial resolution images were collected with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for othomosaic and feature extraction analysis. A Geographic Information System (GIS) database was developed to cover the location, crown diameter, crown height, and 3DGV information of vegetations in the road greenbelts. The environmental benefits of the road greenbelts were evaluated based on 3DGV information. The relationship between 3DGV of road greenbelts and PM 2.5 concentration was analyzed and it was found that large 3DGV does not mean lower PM 2.5 concentration. A road greenbelt with even vertical distribution of biomass and diversified vegetation species works better to reduce PM 2.5 concentration. The implication of this research is that road greenbelt development should systematically consider surface water control, noise reduction, recreation, aesthetic, and air pollution control, thus to maximize its ecoservices to human being. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; GIS; PM 2.5; Road greenbelt; Three-dimensional green volume (3DGV); UAV","Air pollution; Antennas; Geographic information systems; Noise abatement; Population statistics; River pollution; Roads and streets; Surface waters; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Water pollution control; Environmental benefits; High population density; High spatial resolution images; PM2.5; Road greenbelt; Three-dimensional greens; Three-dimensional volume; Vertical distributions; Air pollution control; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); GIS; greenbelt; particulate matter; spatial resolution; unmanned vehicle; urban area; air pollution control; Article; biomass distribution; China; concentration (parameter); crown diameter; crown height; experimental study; extraction; geographic information system; grass; image analysis; noise reduction; nonhuman; particulate matter; plant stem; plant structures; priority journal; process development; recreation; road greenbelt; shrub; species diversity; traffic and transport; tree; vegetation; water management; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; particulate matter; statistics and numerical data; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062331802

Specifically, we assess the platform's potential to enable greater representation and participation of Indigenous peoples (IPs) within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). An analytical framework based on the extensive TEK and environmental management literature is developed, with a set of criteria identified against which to evaluate the platform. We find that although the process of designing the platform appears to be inclusive of Indigenous views, the structure itself does not recognize the roles that unequal power relations and colonialism play in marginalizing IPs. Limited attention is paid to the institutional barriers within the UNFCCC and the drawbacks of pursuing knowledge “integration” as an end in itself. Based on this, recommendations for improving the platform structure are put forward including using a rights-based framing, giving greater decision-making power to IPs, and developing mechanisms to ensure the holistic integrity of TEK and build the overall resilience of climate mitigation and adaptation systems.

This has inadvertently resulted in little attention to the other important link between energy and climate, namely energy access and climate adaptation. In particular, the potential role of reliable, affordable and sustainable modern energy services in strengthening societies’ adaptive capacities to address climate disaster events has been ignored across both policy and practice. This paper probes these links and argues for a critically co-dependent conceptual relationship between energy access, rural development, and climate adaptation and disaster management. It then explores how, if at all, these links may exist in Odisha, one of India's most climate vulnerable states with low socio-economic development. The paper concludes that a deep-seated policy reform is necessary to bring about a shift in how we a) measure ‘successful’ disaster policy, b) understand the role of energy in a disaster context, and c) recognise, and seek greater synergies between energy access, rural development and climate adaptation objectives. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Disaster; Energy access; India; Odisha; SDGs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061227542

There are different ways for the identification and separation which vary from simple statistical methods (on the basis of statistical parameters functions Function) to complicated fractal methods (on the basis of the spatial structure of data). Fractal geometry supplies new instruments to estimate hydrocarbon reservoir properties. In the last few years, fractal geometry is known as a new trick of human mind for identifying and analyzing behavioral and structural complexities of generally natural phenomena. One of the uses of fractal geometry is to estimate the threshold limit and the results of separating the anomaly communities from the base regarding the fractal dimension differences. In this study, after saturation parameter modeling of a reservoir rock located in south of Iran, different communities were separated by kriging geostatistical method and using concentration-area fractal method. Based on the water saturation parameters, the results of fractal analysis represent two different communities in the reservoir. © 2018, The Author(s).","Estimation; Fractal geometry; Geostatistics; Kriging; Variogram","Estimation; Hydrocarbons; Interpolation; Separation; Statistical methods; Fractal geometry; Geo-statistics; Geostatistical method; Kriging; Saturation parameters; Static reservoir modeling; Statistical parameters; Variograms; Fractal dimension",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055313636

We have carried out analysis and selection of the priority way for MSW recycling. It was shown that usage of MSW as a fuel for thermal and electrical energy production economizes traditional fuel types (coal, gas, mazut). Also it serves for reduction of greenhouse gas emission. It was established that the most perspective method for thermal utilization is waste gasification. According to the world data, the efficiency for syngas production from gasification is about 70%. At this, the remaining portions are physical heat losses as well as chemical and physical energies of the generated tar. Gasification setup modeling was performed using Aspens Plus.

The extracted phases with a low gross content are scattered over the vast occupied area. Large deposits of Kazakhstan are related to this type of ore-bearing formations. Studies of the natural objects are complicated manyfold by heterogeneity of substances and the staging of the ongoing processes. In our studies, as reference matter we adopt the solid natural carbon substances, synthetised in various chemical processes running in compliance with strict rules of chemical reactions under given thermodynamic conditions. The natural carbon substance, as a rule, exists in a whole range of probable phases, often having the filmplanar structure habit. Rock transformation (squeezing) results in curving film-lamellar carbon-bearing layers, present also within the nanopipes and fullerens; they often break, with obvious formation of a planar structure. Respective alternation of layers may lead to local formation of graphite, which is witnessed in photographies, made using the transmission electron microscopy. Particles, seized by folding, can be trapped in hollows (a trap trench system) and start accumulating clusters. The only method so far fixing the newly formed carbon layers is the Raman spectroscopy. It especially concerns the carbon matter, due to various reasons, possessing a small coherent zone. The current paper presents data obtained in the RK MES Institute of Geological Sciences n.-a. K.I.

WRF-Chem is applied in this study to explore the discrepancies of the simulated air pollutants induced by employing different emission inventories, particularly during haze events. Two inventories are involved in this study, MEIC (Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China) and GlobEmission (inventory from GlobEmission project emission estimates), representing the emission inventories based on quite different ways. We first compared monthly emissions of SO2 and NOx in two inventories during January over YRD, and found the mean differences of SO2 (NOx) are 20% (7%), with the ranges of 0%–47% (−100%–100%). The largest differences are both found in Shanghai, with 47% for SO2 (MEIC in 2010, GlobEmission in 2014), and 45% for NOx (MEIC in 2010, GlobEmission in 2015), respectively, partly because the reduction of emissions was large during the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011–2015) in this area. By comparing the simulated air pollutants mass concentrations using two inventories with in-situ observations during January 2015, we found that the simulated SO2 using MEIC and GlobEmission are both higher than observations, with mean normalized biases of 207% and 121% over YRD, respectively, and much larger in the city cluster of Nanjing-Shanghai, where are nearly four (MEIC) and three times (GlobEmission) higher than observations. In contrast, NO2 simulations using GlobEmission are lower than observations (22%) and MEIC simulations (45%) over YRD. The largest biases of GlobEmission simulation are found in Zhejiang province (over 70%). The biases of simulated monthly mean PM2.5 are 38% (MEIC) and 30% (GlobEmission) over YRD, respectively. A case study during heavy haze event shows that the biases increase to 61% (MEIC) and 39% (GlobEmission), and spatial correlation coefficient in the simulation using GlobEmission increase to 0.69 over YRD.

High-resolution TMs emission inventory is important input data for assessing human exposure risks, especially synergistic toxicity of multiple toxic metals. By using the latest city- and enterprise-level environment statistical data, an emission inventory of five TMs (Hg, As, Pb, Cd, Cr) in Guangdong province for the year of 2014 was developed using a bottom-up approach. The total emissions of Hg, As, Pb, Cd and Cr in Guangdong were estimated as 17.70, 32.59, 411.34, 13.13, and 84.16 t, respectively. Major emission sources for each TM were different. Hg emissions were dominated by coal combustion (33%), fluorescent lamp (18%) and cement (17%). 78% of Hg emissions were in the form of Hg 0 , 19% of Hg 2+ , and only 3% of Hg p due to strict particulate matter control policies. Coal combustion (48%), nonferrous metal smelting (25%) and iron and steel industry (24%) were the major sources of As. Pb emissions primarily came from battery production (42%), iron and steel industry (21%) and gasoline combustion (17%). Cd and Cr emissions were dominated by nonferrous metal smelting (71%) and iron and steel industry (82%), respectively. Most of these TMs were emitted in the non-Pearl River Delta region, where the newly-built iron and steel industry, nonferrous metal smelting and cement production factories were intense. The uncertainties in the five TM emissions were high, due much to high uncertainties in TM emission factors and limited activity data. Thus, to improve the accuracy of these estimates, we recommend more field tests of TM emissions, especially for the industrial process sector. This study provides scientific support for formulating robust TMs control policies to alleviate the high risk of TMs exposure in Guangdong. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Emission inventory; Guangdong province; Pearl River Delta; Toxic metals; Uncertainty assessment","Biochemistry; Cement industry; Cements; Coal combustion; Coal industry; Industrial emissions; Nonferrous metals; Risk assessment; Smelting; Steelmaking; Toxicity; Emission inventories; Guangdong Province; Pearl River delta; Toxic metals; Uncertainty assessment; Iron and steel industry; arsenic; cadmium; chromium; iron; lead; mercury; metal; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; bottom-up approach; emission inventory; heavy metal; pollutant source; risk assessment; spatial variation; toxic material; uncertainty analysis; air pollution; Article; calculation; China; coal combustion; combustion; denitrification; environmental exposure; environmental impact assessment; high temperature; iron and steel industry; low temperature; mathematical analysis; oxidation; particulate matter; population research; priority journal; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063377898

In the present study, we designed wheat ideotypes based on the state-of-the-art knowledge in crop physiology to increase genetic yield potential for the 2050-climate, as projected by the HadGEM2 global climate model for the RCP8.5 emission scenario, in two high-wheat-productive countries, viz. the United Kingdom (UK) and New Zealand (NZ). Wheat ideotypes were optimized to maximize yield potential for both water-limited (IW 2050 ) and potential (IP 2050 ) conditions by using Sirius model and exploring the full range of cultivar parameters. On average, a 43–51% greater yield potential over the present winter wheat cv. Claire was achieved for IW 2050 in the UK and NZ, whereas a 51–62% increase was obtained for IP 2050 . Yield benefits due to the potential condition over water-limitation were small in the UK, but 13% in NZ. The yield potentials of wheat were 16% (2.6 t ha −1 ) and 31% (5 t ha −1 ) greater in NZ than in the UK under 2050-climate in water-limited and potential conditions respectively. Modelling predicts the possibility of substantial increase in genetic yield potential of winter wheat under climate change in high productive countries. Wheat ideotypes optimized for future climate could provide plant scientists and breeders with a road map for selection of the target traits and their optimal combinations for wheat improvement and genetic adaptation to raise the yield potential. © 2019 The Authors","Climate change; Crop modelling; Genetic yield potential; Ideotype design; Sirius model; Wheat","agricultural modeling; climate change; climate modeling; crop improvement; crop plant; crop yield; genetic engineering; global climate; high yielding variety; wheat; New Zealand; United Kingdom; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062180841

Forest reforestation programmes that are typically motivated only by carbon benefits also have the potential to improve livelihoods, reduce gender disparities, and provide non-carbon ecosystem benefits with appropriate targeting of land selection and involvement of local communities in governance. The Hiniduma Bio-link Project is owned and maintained by Conservation Carbon Company in Sri Lanka. Apart from the direct benefit of forest protection on decreasing carbon emissions and increasing carbon sequestration, forest projects yield indirect benefits called co-benefits that can be linked to the national agenda of the SDGs and beyond-carbon impacts of forest carbon projects that are often of equal or greater importance to buyers of emissions reductions. Our project, the Hiniduma Bio-link, offers value-added carbon credits for socially and environmentally conscious organisations and individuals. It is a reforestation project to establish a biodiversity corridor between two large protected remnant Sri Lankan rainforest patches – Singharaja and Kanneliya. In addition to mitigating the broader issue of climate change, the project helps to (1) conserve limited rainforest groves by providing buffers and a safe corridor between the two protected forest patches to help reduce threats to local biodiversity and wildlife from adjacent human communities, and (2) improve livelihoods of local farmers and landholders by providing training and income generating opportunities. The Bio-link Project accomplishes this through the reforestation of traditional farmers’ home-gardens in the lowland wet zone region through analog forestry concept. Along with the baseline biomass estimation of the selected pilot phase project, the carbon savings from the newly planted trees were calculated and registered for carbon credits. The expected sequestration potential per hectare is 152.14 t CO2/ha after a 20% deduction for unexpected losses. The ecosystem services provided by the project are sold as Plan Vivo Certificates, which represent long-term carbon sequestration. Crediting period of the project is 15 years. A baseline survey was conducted in each land and the base-load was calculated to be 299.47 tCO2/ha. The certificates registered under the Plan Vivo registry for CO2 sequestrated from the newly planted trees are eligible to be sold as Voluntary Carbon Credits in the international market. The Hiniduma Bio-link Project is also the first project in Asia to complete a Plan Vivo. Plan Vivo is a standard for designing and certifying community based payments for ecosystem services (PES) programmes. One of the noteworthy successes of the project has been the sale of carbon credits from the Hiniduma Bio-link Project to Marks &amp; Spencer, UK. Beyond-carbon impacts of creating just employment or saving habitat for an endangered species are actually the main motivators of the project, and the verified emissions reductions that result are themselves a “co”-benefit – and a means of leveraging carbon finance to implement project activities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon credits; Carbon market and community forests; Payments for ecosystem services; Reforestation; Sustainable Development Goals",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066151149

Consequently, in contrast to our initial conclusions, the polaritonic emission appears thermalized and there is no evidence for polariton emission that is blue-shifted with respect to the polariton absorption. For this reason, the interpretation of the blue-shift as a signature of polariton-polariton interactions is obsolete. Two errors have been made: First, the dielectric function of PMMA was only modeled in the range from 1400 to 2100 cm-1 (original Figure 2(b)). However, by virtue of the Kramers-Kronig relations, the relatively strong absorption lines at lower energies (cf. original Figure 2(a)) influence the refractive index in the vicinity of the strongly coupled C=O stretching band. Therefore, the simulated free spectral ranges between the cavity and the polariton modes were incorrect. Second, a small aperture was kept inside the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer transmission compartment for both emission and transmission measurements. As a consequence, only a small area of the prepared cavity was sampled. It was not checked which part of the emitting sample was imaged onto the aperture in the transmission compartment. Therefore, it is likely that different spots of the same sample were measured in transmission and emission, respectively. A film thickness inhomogeneity on the order of 10 nm (the polymer film was about 4 μm thick) can cause a spectral shift of the modes on the order of the initially derived polariton blue-shift (17 and 6 cm-1) . Both errors added up in a way that the transmission spectrum fit yielded a match of emission maxima and reflectivity minima at the first and the third cavity mode, as expected from thermalized emission (cf. original Figure 3(b)). The emission maxima appeared however blue-shifted with respect to the reflection minima (cf. original Figure 3(d)). It should be noted that absorption maxima and reflection minima overlap. In an analogous manner to the procedure described in the original paper, we spin-coated an about 1 μm thick PMMA film on a 0.5 mm thick silicon substrate. We measured the sample transmission with an FTIR spectrometer and fitted it by transfer-matrix analysis while optimizing the model of the dielectric function of PMMA. The silicon substrate was treated as an incoherent layer. Its complex refractive index was taken from the literature1 and was in good agreement with experimental data. To approximate the dielectric function of PMMA, we started from the Lorentz-oscillator model used in the original paper. Next, we adjusted the imaginary part of the PMMA complex refractive index and finally applied Kramers- Kronig relations to obtain the real part of the refractive index.2 Figure 1 shows the measured transmission spectrum, the fit with the originally used simplified dielectric function, and the fit with the refined dielectric function. (Figure Presented). Consequently, we fitted again the cavity transmission and emission data originally published. The fit of the polaritonic transmission peaks is shown in Figure 2(a). The horizontal black bar denotes the spectral region that has previously been considered (original Figure 2(b)). Subsequently, the polaritonic peaks are modeled well by both dielectric functions. However, the transmission peaks of the first and the third cavity mode are only well matched by the refined dielectric function, whereas the simulation predicts blue-shifted peaks for the originally used function. Figure 2(b) shows the derived normalized absorption spectra and compares them to the experimentally determined emissivity. The use of the original dielectric function results in a good agreement between the first and the third cavity mode peak locations, but a larger discrepancy between the measured and simulated lower polariton emissivity peaks. This led to the original conclusion of nonthermal polariton emission. By contrast, the refined dielectric function shows a spectral offset not only for the (Figure Presented). polariton peaks but also for the peaks of the bare cavity modes; that is, the whole simulated absorption spectrum is red-shifted with respect to the experimentally determined emissivity spectrum. In Figure 2(c), this shift is corrected by enforcing the overlap of the third cavity mode absorption and emissivity peaks. This results in excellent agreement between the emissivity peaks and the absorption peaks modeled with the refined dielectric function. The original dielectric function, however, shows offsets between absorption and emissivity peaks of the first cavity mode as well as the polaritons. Finally, the corresponding transmission spectra are shown in Figure 2(d). They are computed by means of the cavity parameters used in Figure 2(c). The clear offsets between experimental and simulated third cavity mode peaks manifest that the (Figure Presented). originally measured transmittance and emissivity spectra were not directly comparable, as the locally sampled cavity lengths were different. To attain consistence among simulations, emissivity, and transmittance measurements, we prepared another Fabry- Perot cavity comparable to the one used to collect the original data. We used a ZnS substrate, sputter-coated an about 10 nm thin Au film on it, spin-coated an about 4 μm thick PMMA layer on top, and finally closed the cavity by sputter-coating another about 10 nm thin Au film. We removed the aperture from the transmission compartment of the FTIR to sample the same cavity area in emission and transmission. As a consequence, the signal-to-noise ratio in the emission measurement was reduced, and thus we performed an additional correction for atmospheric absorptions in the FTIR and we subtracted the reference spectrum from the signal of the sample and the experimental blackbody spectrum (cf. eq 13 of the original paper). Measurement results and simulations are shown in Figure 3. As in Figure 2(c) and (d), the peaks of the third cavity mode emissivity and simulated absorption were matched. Figure 3(a) exhibits again an overlap of simulated and measured polariton emission peaks if the refined dielectric function is used, whereas the original dielectric function predicts blue-shifted emission of the lower polariton. This is highlighted in Figure 4, where only the spectral range from 1400 to 2000 cm-1 is considered, like in Figure 3(d) of the original publication. The absence of the aperture in the transmission compartment leads to a clearly improved agreement between measured and simulated transmittance spectra, as the comparison between Figures 2(d) and 3(b) demonstrates. The shift between measured and simulated third cavity mode as well as the line width difference is much smaller in the latter case. The refined dielectric function leads also to a good agreement between measured and simulated transmittance of the polariton modes, as Figure 4(b) shows.

They consider only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) commercial buildings and make two fundamental assumptions: (1) that each LEED building, year after year, achieves the energy savings projected by its design team, and (2) that the fuel mix of LEED buildings is the same as the average mix for other buildings in the same geographic region. Here we show that these assumptions are not supported by data. Numerous studies have shown that buildings, on average, use significantly more energy than projected by design simulations. Furthermore, a decade of research suggests that LEED-certified buildings, on average, achieve little or no primary energy savings relative to other similar buildings. In addition, evidence suggests that any reduction in site energy is typically achieved through increased electric use and corresponding off-site energy loss. The environmental benefits of LEED buildings calculated by MacNaughton et al. have dubious value because they are based on assumptions that are inconsistent with measured LEED building energy performance. © 2018, Springer Nature America, Inc.",,"editorial; energy conservation; leadership; simulation",Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054387779

The jurisdictional juxtaposition facilitates the identification of administrative burdens, which could increase environmental review-related costs for developers and prolong the entire approval process. Environmental impact assessment (EIA) frameworks, a major component of the LS-RE approval process, suffer from administrative fracturing between the local, regional, and national levels as well as between various government agencies. In combination with strong reservations from local civil society stakeholders, the results revealed some of the flaws of the current LS-RE project approval systems in place. The EIA frameworks and reform efforts in all four jurisdictions illustrate the importance of consolidated and comprehensive frameworks to reduce the amount of planning uncertainties for developers.

But the process of downscaling climate visualizations does not neutralize the political problems with their synoptic global sources—namely, their failure to empower communities to take action and their replication of neoliberal paradigms of globalization. In this study we examine these problems as they apply to interactive climate-visualization platforms, which allow their users to localize global climate information to support local political action. By scrutinizing the political implications of the “zoom” tool from the perspective of media studies and rhetoric, we add to perspectives of cultural cartography on the issue of scaling from our fields. Namely, we break down the cinematic trope of “zooming” to reveal how it imports the political problems of synopticism to the level of individual communities. As a potential antidote to the politics of zoom, we recommend a downscaling strategy of connectivity, which associates rather than reduces situated views of climate to global ones.

Human-biometeorological information can be valuable for tourists and visitors, but also for citizens looking for information about their neighbourhood or a new residence. Cities or health resorts can also promote their climate conditions for health rehabilitation. To derive this human-biometeorological information in a unified, comprehensive, and comprehensible form, a tool was developed. The input information contains the coordinates of a place and/or area of interest, and the time period of data chosen by the user. For meteorological data, the basic dataset of Test-Reference-Years from the German Meteorological Service is used, containing hourly meteorological data for the time period from 1995 to 2012, covering Germany with a spatial resolution of 1 km2. Based on the Perceived Temperature as a thermal index, days with heat stress and cold stimulus are identified. In this process, the effects of short-term human acclimatisation on the thermal environment are considered by using a variable threshold value based on the thermal conditions of the last 30 days. The results of the tool's application consist of several frequency diagrams, the Climate-Tourism/Transfer-Information-Scheme, a diagram of heat waves, and maps of the area of interest, displaying the spatial distribution of heat stress and cold stimulus.

More precisely, a nonequilibrium hadronic transport approach to describe relativistic heavy-ion collisions is benchmarked with respect to photon emission. Cross sections for photon production in π+ρ→π+γ and π+π→ρ+γ scattering processes are derived from an effective chiral field theory and implemented into the hadronic transport approach, SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons). The implementation is verified by systematically comparing the thermal photon rate to theoretical expectations. Further, the impact of form factors is discussed, scattering processes mediated by ω mesons are found to contribute significantly to the total photon production. Several comparisons of the yielded photon rates are performed: to parametrizations of the very same rates as used in hydrodynamic simulations, to previous works relying on different cross sections for the production of direct photons from the hadronic stage, and to partonic rates. Finally, the impact of considering the finite width of the ρ meson is investigated, where a significant enhancement of photon production in the low-energy region is observed. This benchmark is the first step toward a consistent treatment of photon emission in hybrid hydrodynamics+transport approaches and toward a genuine dynamical description. © 2019 American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069744677

In the present work, a methodology is proposed for an outdoor air unit equipped with a WAHP-based dehumidifier along with other auxiliary components. For this, the ambient conditions over an entire year are categorized into six constituent regions based on temperature and humidity levels. The proposed method involves defining specific control sequences corresponding to ambient conditions under each psychrometric region for tandem operation of system components. Fundamentally, this establishes a sort of segregated climatic control protocol for maintaining acceptable levels of humidity and temperature inside the conditioned spaces during a whole year's operations. An energy simulation study is performed for two DOE prototype office buildings with six representative weather locations ranging from extremely hot and humid to dry and hot as per ASHRAE's climate classification. Results show that a 100% outdoor unit comprising WAHP-based dehumidifier system equipped with proposed climatic controls saves cooling plant energy in a range of 1.5-19%, when compared with a similar WAHP-based outdoor unit without any climatic controls and auxiliary components. The proposed controls also enable the outdoor air unit in maintaining comparatively better indoor environmental conditions (temperature and relative humidity), resulting in lesser number of building occupied hours drifting away from prescribed indoor temperature and relative humidity limits than its basic counterpart without any climatic controls. This substantiates the intent and applicability of proposed control methodology for WAHP-based dehumidifier systems. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","climatic control; dehumidifier; energy; humidity; Wrap-around heat pipe (WAHP)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064213180

Designing light, compact and, at the same time, improved NVH solutions is often a challenge, as low noise and vibration levels often require heavy and bulky additions, especially to be effective in the low frequency regime. Recently, locally resonant metamaterials have emerged among the novel NVH solutions because of their performant NVH properties combined with lightweight and compact design. Due to the characteristic of stop band behavior, frequency ranges where free wave propagation is inhibited, metamaterials can beat the mass law, be it at least in some tunable frequency ranges. Previously the authors demonstrated how metamaterials can reduce the vibrations in a simplified shock tower upon shaker excitation. In this work, the authors apply the metamaterial concept on the real rear shock towers of a vehicle. In order to be able to benchmark the solution, a test vehicle is chosen, which is equipped in its commercial version with a 1.46 kg tuned vibration absorber (TVA) on each of the rear shock towers as NVH solution. It is shown that the metamaterial solution allows to achieve similar interior NVH performance, while reducing the added mass by 48%. The metamaterial additions are realized through additive manufacturing and they are designed to be effective around 190 Hz, as was the case for the original solution. Both experimental results and numerical validation of a road test are presented. © 2019 SAE International.

Lately, the Nordic countries have shown remarkable success in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially in the power and heat sector. However, when it comes to transportation, the greatest source of Nordic GHG emissions, stronger measures are needed. Relying on a rich and diversified portfolio of renewable sources and expertise, the Nordic countries could benefit from a common mitigation strategy by encompassing a larger variety of solutions and potential synergies. This article reviews studies addressing integrated energy and transport scenario analysis for the Nordic region as a whole. The studies targeted are those applying energy system models, given their extensive adoption in supporting scenario analysis. Most notable of these studies is the “Nordic Energy Technology Perspectives 2016” to which a special focus is dedicated. The article reviews the methodological choices and the research content of the selected literature. Challenges/limitations are identified in light of recent transport research, and categorized as: “transport behavior”, “breakthrough technologies”, “domestic energy resources” and “geographical aggregation and system boundaries”.

Hence, this study aimed to investigate the spatio-temporal variability of rangeland ANPP in seven bioclimatic zones in Isfahan Province using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) ecosystem model fitted with MODIS-NDVI and climatic data during 2000–2016. The model evaluation indicated a good agreement between the estimated and observed ANPP (R2 = 0.917). In concomitant with the precipitation gradient, the mean annual ANPP increased from east towards west and southwest of the region from zero to 160 g C m–2 yr–1. The maximum and minimum ANPP values occurred in humid and cold as well as hyper-arid and warm zone, respectively. The annual temporal variability of ANPP was analyzed in response to climatic factors (precipitation and temperature), Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) and Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) drought indices. The drought was found as the most important factor affecting ANPP. The minimum and maximum ANPP values were observed in 2000 (23.23 g C m–2 yr–1) and 2014 (41.73 g C m–2 yr–1). The maximum ANPP occurred in May and June during which temperature, as an important factor in plant growth, reached its optimum and precipitation affected with a time lag. The annual rangeland ANPP was positively associated with precipitation and negatively with temperature. © 2019, The Association of Korean Geoscience Societies and Springer.","Aboveground Net Primary Production; arid and semi-arid regions; CASA model; climatic factors; drought indices; Isfahan Province",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053414675

This can only be achieved through risk-based decision-making and smart resources treatment. To provide a basis for such actions, we here propose a risk assessment (RA) framework focusing on the risk-resilience-sustainability nexus. In contrast to focusing on the traditional RA approach, we propose an integrative approach based on hazard, vulnerability, and resilience covering the full spectrum of RA for effective risk reduction. We further explain how the proposed framework can simultaneously provide useful input for resilience management in parallel to achieving certain Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We apply this framework for typhoon risk assessment (represented by a Typhoon Risk Index—TRI) of coastal counties of mainland China. Different TRIs e.g. total population, elderly population, non-adult population, and economic status are calculated for each coastal county to supplement multi-objective empirical measures for risk reduction. The RA results show a large spatial heterogeneity in typhoon risk with an increase in the risk from north to south along the coast of mainland China. The comparative results from this study are relevant to the prioritization of different regions for immediate or gradual actions, wise decision-making, and risk reduction through proper treatment of resources-related policy implications. The evaluation of the SDGs achievement status reveals that the overall performance of coastal provinces in mainland China is higher to achieve SDGs 3 and 15 followed by 13 and 8. The study shows that while Guangdong province is in the highest risk category, its achievement status for SDG-13 (climate actions, strengthening resilience) is the lowest relative to other provinces, which is critical.

This paper proposes a novel dynamic process intensification approach that results in similar benefits as the traditional process intensification. The proposed approach utilizes a dynamic optimization approach in improving the operation of a plant. The main contribution of this work includes the development of a dynamic particle swarm optimization algorithm and a data-driven model of the plant while the operational and economical metrics of the plant are compared to the same system when steady-state optimization is practiced. Additionally, a roadmap is developed that enables the practitioners to apply the proposed dynamic process intensification concept to any similar systems. A CSTR reactor is used as the case study to demonstrate the benefits of dynamic process intensification over a static approach. The results demonstrate that a dynamic, data-driven optimization algorithm can achieve similar profit as gradient-based optimization approaches. Additionally, a 59.9% increase in profitability of the plant is observed when a dynamic approach is used for optimization, as opposed to a steady-state approach. This is well-aligned with the targets pursued from the traditional process intensification concepts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CSTR; Data-driven modeling; Dynamic optimization; Dynamic process intensification; Particle swarm optimization; Steady-state optimization","Profitability; CSTR; Data-driven model; Dynamic optimization; Dynamic process; Steady-state optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065538098

The addition of GAC significantly reduced lag phases for methane production in comparison with the unamended control at both temperatures. Microbial community analyses revealed that GAC addition increased the diversity and richness of both bacterial and archaeal communities. Besides, several known or potential electroactive fermentative bacteria (e.g., Calorameter, Sporanaerobacter, Coprothermobacter, etc.) were found in GAC-amended bioreactors at both temperatures, suggesting the possibility of DIET-based syntrophy in these reactors. At mesophilic temperature, GAC amendment increased methane productivity (L CH4/kg-VS) by almost two-fold in comparison with the control; however, methane production at the thermophilic temperature was unaffected by GAC addition.

Being part of exhaust and intake systems, the turbocharger strongly influences the orifice noise emission. Although 1D-CFD simulations are commonly used for the development of intake and exhaust systems, validated acoustic turbocharger models are not yet state-of-the-art. Consequently, the aim of the paper is the investigation of the turbocharger's influence on the orifice noise and the development of an accurate 1D-CFD model. The passive acoustic transmission loss was measured for a wide operating range of four turbochargers, including wastegate and VTG-system variations. Low frequency attenuation is dominated by impedance discontinuities, increasing considerably with mass flow and pressure ratio. High frequency transmission loss is generated by destructive interferences in the stator, which depend on the stator mass flow distribution and the turbocharger size. A new generic turbocharger model was developed to model both low frequency impedance discontinuities and high-frequency interferences by linking an idealized stator geometry with potential sources and turbocharger performance maps. In this way, high acoustic and thermodynamic accuracy could be achieved.

However, the formation of thick eolian dust deposits requires not only climatic prerequisites for dust emission and transport but also climatic and topographic conditions favourable for deposition and accumulation. The scarcity of widespread eolian deposition around the CLP before 7-8 Ma hinders a full understanding of the processes and mechanisms of Central Asian aridification. The deposition of eolian dust also impacts the hydrogeochemistry of fluvial systems and the precipitation of authigenic phases in continental sedimentary systems could be an archive for studying eolian dust dynamics when pure eolian deposits are scarce. Here, we present the Ca-Mg-Sr concentrations and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope compositions of bulk carbonates in a new fluvial sequence (12.7-4.8 Ma) of the Xining Basin. The Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios of the carbonate describe a power law relationship with a power coefficient of ∼0.8, lower than the coefficient characteristic of prior calcite precipitation (PCP). An input of eolian dust with the dissolution of Mg-rich carbonate is likely responsible for the deviation from a pure PCP process. The bulk carbonates also show a general decrease of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios from 12.7 to 4.8 Ma, with a transition around 8.6 Ma revealed by lower Sr/Mg ratios. The comparison of these proxies to a previously reported fluvial section (12.2-5.1 Ma) in the Linxia Basin, ∼200 km to the southeast, shows that the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of the bulk carbonates and water-soluble salts in the Linxia Basin are around 0.7098, which is 0.0018 lower than those in the Xining Basin before 8.6 Ma, but shows a significant rise between 8.6 and 7.0 Ma. The two basins share the same range of carbonate 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios when sediments are younger than 7 Ma. For the last 7 Myrs, the evolution of the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios in bulk carbonates of fluvial sediments and Pliocene-Quaternary eolian deposits found in the Xining Basin are similar to those in typical eolian red clays/loess-palaeosol sequences on the CLP. These results suggest a transition of the hydrochemical regime at 8.6 Ma in the Linxia Basin from a catchment only influenced by the weathering of its bedrock to one significantly impacted by eolian dust input. In the Xining Basin, the carbonate elemental and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios are consistent with a hydrochemistry more impacted by the presence of the eolian dust. There, the dust input occurred earlier, at ≥12.7 Ma, though it has strengthened since 8.6 Ma. The eolian dust impact on fluvial systems in the Xining Basin was much earlier than in the Linxia Basin and also preceded the initial accumulation of widespread eolian red clays on the CLP (7-8 Ma), suggesting a temporally propagating and spatially stepwise expansion of eolian dust delivery across the Asian inland during the late Cenozoic. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","carbonate; eolian dust; Linxia Basin; Sr isotopes; Xining Basin","Calcite; Calcium alloys; Carbonates; Carbonation; Catchments; Deposits; Dust; Hydrochemistry; Isotopes; Magnesium alloys; Magnesium compounds; Ternary alloys; Eolian dust; Linxia Basin; Northeastern tibetan plateaux; Power law relationship; Prior calcite precipitations; Sr isotopes; Topographic conditions; Xining Basin; Strontium alloys; aridification; carbonate; deposition; eolian deposit; fluvial deposit; river water; strontium isotope; water chemistry; China; Gansu; Linxia Basin; Qinghai; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Xining Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063386918

EOTCF undergoes a thermal activation process to form TEOTCF. EROTCF, TEOTCF and TEROTCF show specific capacitance values of 1455, 1438 and 1426 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 and capacitance retention values of 0.97%, 35.62%, and 59.61% when the current density increases from 1 to 20 mA cm−2. EROTCF, TEOTCF and TEROTCF show similar capacitance values, but much superior to CF (709 mF cm−2). TEROTCF shows much higher rate capability than EROTCF and TEOTCF. Carbonyl, epoxy and hydroxyl groups are introduced on the TCF by electrochemical oxidation activation. Carbonyl groups existing at the edge of the basal plane contribute towards improving the specific capacitance of CF. Hydroxyl and epoxy groups on the basal plane of the carbon skeleton lead to the destruction of the conjugated system. The electrochemical reduction and secondary thermal activation cause the removal of the non-electroactive epoxy and hydroxyl groups for recovering the sp2 structure, accordingly enhancing the rate capability of CF. All-solid-state flexible supercapacitors using two TEROTCF electrodes achieve 26.0 μW h cm−2 at 125.0 μW cm−2 and good cycling performance. So, CF with thermal and electrochemical activation treatment shows highly enhanced capacitance for high-performance supercapacitor application. © the Partner Organisations 2019.",,"Capacitance; Carbon fibers; Chemical activation; Electrochemical oxidation; Electrolytic reduction; Supercapacitor; Capacitance retention; Cycling performance; Electrochemical activation; Electrochemical performance; Electrochemical reductions; Specific capacitance; Supercapacitor application; Thermal activation process; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077797707

Identifying fracture zones is a complex task. Seismic data are one of the sources of information about the anisotropy of the medium and the scattering objects. Implementation of the azimuthal angle depth migration can help us to extract maximum information related directly to fracture characterization and localize these zones. In this paper we demonstrate the advantages of such an approach used to achieve a better understanding of the cavernous-fractured-porous subsalt carbonate reservoir. Higher reliability of fracture zones interpretation can be obtained by effectively combining anisotropic and diffraction energy attributes, together with more conventional structural attributes (coherency) and well data. © 81st EAGE Conference and Exhibition 2019.

Throughout the years, local farmers have modified their farming systems to mitigate the negative effects of climate. This paper aimed to describe the trend of climate change and at what extent it could affect the farming systems. The climate evolution was analyzed through the annual rainfall time series (1970- 2011) of 50 observation stations spread over the study area. A study of modifications in farming activities engendered by climate change, such as a shifting to new farming systems, was carried out on a sample of 537 farms spread over in three agro-ecological regions: the northern, central and southern zones. The annual rainfall of the period 1970-2011 over the study area was 457mm, However the annual rainfall maps for the periods 1970-1990 and 1991-2011 showed a high spatiotemporal variability, where some areas tended to become more wet, in contrast others areas were affected by drought severity. The main changes in agricultural activities for adapting to climate constraint were a reduction of areas devoted to rainfed crops (cereals) and the adoption of an intensive farming system based on poultry, cattle breeding and intensive crops, especially in the central and the southern zones. Challenges of agricultural development programs in the context of future climate change will be to manage the conversion of the ancestral farming systems to sustainable systems, preserve the social value of agriculture and boost the economic profitability of farms without affecting natural resources. © 2019 Istituto Agronomico per l'Oltremare di Firenze.

Forest landscape restoration and other restorative ecosystem management activities are important measures that contribute towards reaching the objectives of the Bonn Challenge, which aims to restore 350 million hectares by 2030. In this context, many restoration projects are being planned and implemented in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). We present an overview of the location, goals and activities, and an estimated climate change mitigation potential of 154 recent, ongoing and planned restoration projects in LAC. Our analysis suggests that most projects are located in the humid tropics and less attention is paid to drylands. Increasing vegetation cover, biodiversity recovery and recovery of ecological processes are the most common goals. Restorative activities to fulfil these goals were diverse and were related to the type and source of funding that projects receive. For example, projects implemented through the Forest Investment Program (FIP) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) generally rely on natural or assisted regeneration over large areas ( > 20,000 ha), whereas Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects establish forest plantations, often including exotic monocultures, in smaller project areas ( < 5000 ha). Projects that are specifically implemented within the scope of Initiative 20 × 20 and other local initiatives that target the local environmental problems, are more varied and rely on a wider portfolio of restorative activities, such as erosion control, exclusion of grazing and mixed plantations. These projects are usually implemented in smaller project areas ( < 5000 ha). All projects had the potential to contribute to climate change mitigation by storing additional forest aboveground biomass through natural regeneration, assisted regeneration or establishing a plantation. Further analysis of the implemented activities is an important next step to investigate their effectiveness in terms of goals achieved under Initiative 20 × 20 and the Bonn Challenge. This would provide information for future restoration projects and upscaling of restorative activities in a wider area. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change mitigation; Comparative analysis; Ecological restoration; Forest biomass; Forest landscape restoration; Latin America and the Caribbean","Biodiversity; Conservation; Emission control; Investments; Land reclamation; Reforestation; Restoration; Climate change mitigation; Comparative analysis; Ecological restoration; Forest biomass; Forest landscape restoration; Latin America and the Caribbean; Climate change; biodiversity; biomass; climate change; comparative study; forest dynamics; landscape protection; mitigation; restoration ecology; America; Biodiversity; Conservation; Land Reclamation; Reforestation; Restoration; Caribbean Islands; Latin America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068875291

Both estimates achieve excellent agreement based on the bias and normalized scatter. The relationship between the predictors of the model and the climatic conditions of each case of study, according to the Köppen-Geiger climatic classification was analyzed, which to the best of the authors' knowledge, it's the first study of this kind. An analysis on correlation and statistical significance was carried out between the model predictors and four determining geographic and climatic variables: altitude, latitude, precipitation and temperature. The statistical analysis shows that two of the six predictors correlate with temperature and precipitation and one predictor is correlated with latitude. Therefore, it can be suggested that the BRL model seems largely insensitive to the different regional climatic conditions, nevertheless, evaluation of the effect of the apparent correlation of the respective predictors and microclimatic and geographical variables points to further research in this area considering a wider selection of locations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","BRL; Diffuse estimation; DNI; Geiger; Köppen; Solar radiation; Statistical analysis","Mathematical models; Renewable energy resources; Solar radiation; Climatic conditions; Climatic variables; Costa Rica; Diffuse fraction; Diffuse radiation; Direct normal irradiances; Geiger; Statistical significance; Statistical methods; correlation; estimation method; microclimate; numerical model; regional climate; solar radiation; statistical analysis; time series; Australia; Chile; Costa Rica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062145802

These algorithms are based on a standard vector dataset and integrated in a free and open source Geographic Information System. These algorithms are applied to New York and districts of Nantes. The skeletonization presents the advantage of pulling down the calculation time without affecting the accuracy. Moreover, the methodology proposed is reproducible everywhere. In addition, the major LCZ obtained on the districts of Nantes are verified by comparison to previous measurements and classifications, which supports the results presented in this paper. Finally, the methodology and functionalities developed in this paper seem useful for the urban climate community and town planners, because LCZ can provide input data for numerical climate models that incorporate urban canopy parameters to forecast climate variables and forecast Urban heat island (UHI). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","2D GIS; Local climate zone; Standard data; Urban Heat Island; Urban morphological indicators; Urban skeleton",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063514367

The local diving community has termed these speleothems as Hells Bells because of their shape and appearance in a dark environment in ∼ 28-38 m water depth above a sulfidic halocline. It was also suggested that Hells Bells form under water, yet the mystery of their formation remained unresolved. Therefore, we conducted detailed hydrogeochemical and geochemical analyses of the water column and Hells Bells speleothems including stable carbon isotopes. Based on the comprehensive results presented in this study we deduce that both biogeochemical processes in the pelagic redoxcline and a dynamic halocline elevation of El Zapote cenote are essential for Hells Bells formation. Hells Bells most likely form in the redoxcline, a narrow 1-2 m thick water layer immediately above the halocline where a pelagic chemolithoautotrophic microbial community thrives from the upward diffusion of reduced carbon, nitrogen and sulfur species released from organic matter degradation in organic-rich debris. We hypothesize that chemolithoautotrophy, in particular proton-consuming nitrate-driven anaerobic sulfide oxidation, favors calcite precipitation in the redoxcline and hence Hells Bells formation. A dynamic elevation of the halocline as a hydraulic response to droughts, annual tidal variability and recharge events is further discussed, which might explain the shape of Hells Bells as well as their occurrence over a range of 10 m water depth. Finally, we infer that highly stagnant conditions, i.e., a thick halocline, a low-light environment and sufficient input of organic material into a deep meromictic cenote are apparent prerequisites for Hells Bells formation. This might explain their exclusivity to only a few cenotes in a restricted area of the northeastern Yucatán Peninsula. © 2019 Author(s).",,"biogeochemistry; degradation; hydraulic conductivity; microbial community; organic matter; oxidation; redox conditions; sinkhole; speleothem; sulfide; Mexico [North America]; Yucatan Peninsula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066853129

In order to jointly achieve these goals, careful consideration should be put on the operational cost and management of PT services, in order to promote the adoption of green mobility solutions and advanced management techniques by operators. In this work we develop a dynamic fleet management approach for next generation Public Transportation systems, considering the instance of mixed electric / hybrid fleet. Our objective is that of investigating to what extent electrification, coupled with optimal fleet management, can yield operational cost savings for PT operators, explicitly considering real-Time disturbances, including delays, service disruptions etc. We propose a Mixed Integer Linear Program to address the problem of optimal scheduling of a mixed fleet of electric and hybrid / non-electric buses, and employ it as predictor in a Model Predictive Control approach. Test results based upon a real-life scenario showcase how the proposed approach is indeed capable of yielding a sizable reduction in operational costs, even when considerable disturbances arise from the underlying system. © 2019 IEEE.","Dynamic bus fleet management; e-bus charging scheduling; MILP; MPC","Bus transportation; Buses; Integer programming; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Scheduling; Transportation routes; Bus fleet managements; Dynamic fleet management; Management techniques; MILP; Mixed integer linear program; Model-predictive control approach; Public transportation systems; Sustainable mobility; Fleet operations",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074946857

For three stars (τ Ceti, Fomalhaut, and Vega), we establish upper limits that are consistent with theoretical expectations. For Eridani, we find a possible spatially coincident source with a soft energy spectrum of dN/dE ∼ E -3.6. However, at this stage we are unable to rule out that this emission is due to a more extended feature in the diffuse background. In the interpretation that the emission is due to Eridani, the &gt;100 MeV gamma-ray luminosity is ∼1027 erg s-1 ≃ 3 ×10-7 L o, which is ∼1010 times the gamma-ray luminosity from the disk of the quiet Sun. We find ≲2σ evidence of source variability over a ∼7 yr timescale. In the interpretation that the gamma-ray emission is from Eridani itself, we consider two possible models: (1) cosmic-ray collisions with solid bodies in the debris disk, which extends out ∼60 au from the host star, and (2) emission from the stellar activity. For the former model, assuming a total disk mass consistent with infrared measurements, we find that the size distribution of bodies is steeper than expected for a collisional cascade state. If confirmed as being associated with Eridani, this would be the first indication of gamma-ray emission from the vicinity of a main-sequence star other than the Sun. © 2019.

This happened in response to increasing insight into impacts of climate on drinking-water and required adaptation to anticipated climate change. Literature was reviewed for published guidance and case examples, documenting how to consider climate in water safety planning to support future uptake. Climate-resilient water safety plans were piloted within a project in the water supplies of Addis Ababa and Adama, Ethiopia. Case examples have been published in four of six WHO regions with a focus on urban supplies. Integration of climate aspects focused mostly on the steps of establishing the team, system description, hazard analysis and risk assessment, improvement planning and development of management procedures. While the traditional framework focuses on drinking-water quality, considering climate change augments aspects of water quantity. Therefore, other factors affecting water quantity such as population development and demand of other sectors need to be considered as well. Local climate information and tools should be employed as a significant success factor for future uptake. Such information should be incorporated as it becomes available, and may – depending on the setting – be incrementally integrated into existing water safety plans or used to develop new ones. © 2019","Climate change; Climate impacts; Climate-resilient water safety plans; Drinking water; Water safety plans","drinking water; chemistry; climate change; Ethiopia; microbiology; parasitology; water quality; water supply; Climate Change; Drinking Water; Ethiopia; Water Quality; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065888374

The link between food, energy and water depicts a technological knowledge gap, represented by previous attempts to investigate the combination between ground source heat pump and permeable pavement systems. This research aims to transfer these concepts into greener sustainable urban drainage systems like wet swales. A 1:2 scaled laboratory models were built and analysed under a range of ground source heat pump temperatures (20-50 °C). Behavioral models of vertical and inlet/outlet temperature difference within the system were developed, achieving high R2, representing the first attempt to describe the thermal performance of wet swales in literature when designed alongside ground source heat pump elements.

To capitalize on this potential, it is necessary to understand the mechanism in which car electronics enter and exit the vehicle fleet over time. We analyze the historical penetration of selected car electronic control systems (ECS) in 65,475 car models sold in the past 14 years by means of statistical learning. We find that the historical penetration of ECS tends to follow S-shaped curves, however with substantial variations in penetration speed and saturation level. Although electronic functions are increasing rapidly, comfort-related ECS tend to remain below 40% penetration even after 14 years on the market. In contrast, safety regulations lead to rapid ECS penetration approaching 100%, while environmental emission regulations seem to indirectly push related ECS to a medium penetration level (e.g., growing to 60% after six years). The trend towards integration of individual ECS poses long-term challenges for car electronics dismantling and recycling. Monitoring the ECS embedded in new cars, such as carried out in this study, can inform timely updates for such strategies. The results also provide a framework for developing scenarios to identify related future CRM stocks and flows. © 2019 by the authors.","Car electronics; Critical raw materials; Machine learning; Statistical learning; Technological diffusion; Urban mine",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067512827

Given the possibility that drought-induced growth decline will be caused by a prolonged growing season under a warming climate, we investigated the effect of growth rate and duration of xylem production on annual wood biomass in drought-prone environments. We analyzed the intra-annual dynamics of wood formation in Qilian junipers (Juniperus przewalskii) from the semi-arid north-eastern Tibetan Plateau, China (2009–2014) and in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) from the hyperarid Mojave Desert in Nevada, USA (2015–2016). Most variability in the number of xylem cells (N cell ) was related to growth rate (r m ) rather than duration of cell production (D cell ). At the Tibetan sites, 69.9% and 54.7% of variability in N cell was attributable to r m for the lower and upper treeline, respectively. Within the Mojave Desert site, 53.9% of the variability in N cell was related to r m . The growth rate in the Tibetan Plateau forest is affected by minimum temperature and precipitation. Thus, r m is a primary control on wood biomass in conifer species of semi-arid forests. Under warmer and drier conditions, a longer growing season will not benefit xylem formation of conifers, and in turn warming-induced drought could limit carbon sequestration by reducing the rate of cell production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon sequestration; Conifer; Drought stress; Growing season length; Growth rate; Wood production","biomass; carbon sequestration; coniferous tree; drought stress; forest ecosystem; growing season; growth rate; semiarid region; temperature effect; treeline; wood; China; Mojave Desert; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; United States; Coniferophyta; Juniperus; Juniperus przewalskii; Pinus ponderosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062230647

Both parameterizations achieve reasonable current carbon uptake rates and aboveground biomass amount at the ecosystem scale. When vegetation types are subjected to increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation, the generalized parameterization differs substantially from the species-specific parameterization by homogenizing the diversity of adaptations for dealing with higher temperature and drought, leading to divergent responses under changing climate.

In this article, we present our initial experience with this technique. Materials and Methods: We used a three-port technique through the oral vestibule, one 10 mm port for the laparoscope and two additional 5 mm ports for the endoscopic instruments required. The carbon dioxide insufflation pressure was set at 12 mm of Hg. Anterior cervical subplatysmal space was created from the oral vestibule down to the sternal notch, and the thyroidectomy was done using conventional laparoscopic instruments and a harmonic scalpel. Results: From May 2016 to December 2017, we have performed ten such procedures in the Department of General Surgery in our hospital, which is a tertiary referral center. Six patients had solitary thyroid nodules, for which a hemi-thyroidectomy was done. Four patients had multi-nodular goiter and total thyroidectomy or near-total thyroidectomy was done. The preoperative fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was suggestive of Bethesda class 2 lesions in all the patients with multinodular goiter and in five of the six patients with solitary nodular goiter. Only one patient with solitary nodular goiter had a Bethesda class 3 lesion on FNAC. The final histopathological report of the specimen was benign, either colloid goiter, or degenerative nodule in all cases of multinodular goiter and in four cases of solitary thyroid nodule. In one Bethesda class 2 solitary nodule, the histopathological report was suggestive of follicular carcinoma; in the Bethesda class 3 solitary nodule, the histopathological report was suggestive of follicular variant of papillary carcinoma. No complication such as temporary or permanent vocal cord paralysis, hypoparathyroidism, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, tracheal injury, esophageal injury, mental nerve palsy, or surgical site infection was found postoperatively. However, two patients developed small hematomas in the midline. Conclusion: Transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy is a safe, feasible, and minimally invasive technique with excellent cosmetic results. © 2018 Journal of Postgraduate Medicine.","Endoscopic thyroidectomy using vestibular approach; scar-free thyroidectomy; transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy","adult; Article; carbon dioxide tension; clinical article; endoscopic surgery; female; fine needle aspiration biopsy; follicular carcinoma; follow up; hematoma; histopathology; human; male; nerve paralysis; nodular goiter; operation duration; papillary carcinoma; postoperative period; thyroid nodule; thyroidectomy; endoscopy; natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery; procedures; thyroid disease; thyroid gland; thyroidectomy; treatment outcome; Adult; Endoscopy; Female; Humans; Male; Natural Orifice Endoscopic Surgery; Thyroid Diseases; Thyroid Gland; Thyroidectomy; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065186480

To assess policy implementation targets for Scotland's National Forest Estate under climate change, we simulated forest growth through the 21st century - with and without the abiotic impacts of climate change, and with and without the biotic impacts of an important fungal disease. Eight different forest management trajectories were simulated under a climate projection, to assess the future provision of forest ecosystem goods and services. Climate change was represented by the IPCC RCP 4.5 projection, and the biotic impact of Dothistroma needle blight was predicted using a new vulnerability matrix. Indicators of three important goods and services: timber production, standing biomass, and biodiversity were measured in the simulation of forest growth and reported at decadal intervals using dynamically linked forest models. We found that both a broadleaved species trajectory and a Forest Enterprise Scotland selected species trajectory would improve standing biomass and biodiversity, but slightly reduce timber volume. Dothistroma needle blight could reduce standing biomass (by up to 3 t ha− 1) and timber volume (by up to 5 m3 ha− 1), but the predicted impact is dependent on the type of forest management trajectory. Our findings show opportunities for diversifying forest management and tree species – and at the same time supporting forest policy to improve forest resilience under uncertain climate change and Dothistroma impacts. The forest simulation has been used to demonstrate and evaluate national strategic delivery of multi-purpose forest benefits in Scotland, and how species and management might be targeted regionally in Forest Districts, to maintain achievable national targets for timber production, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity under climate change. © 2017","Abiotic impacts; Biotic impacts; Climate change; Ecosystem goods and services; Forest management simulation; Forest policy analysis; Uncertainty","Biodiversity; Biomass; Ecosystems; Forestry; Needles; Timber; Trajectories; Uncertainty analysis; Abiotic impacts; Biotic impacts; Forest policy; Management simulations; Uncertainty; Climate change; Biodiversity; Biomass; Ecosystems; Forestry; Needles; Trajectories",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033228290

In semi-arid Kenya, persistent drought has made male incomes from pastoralism insecure, and contributed to women's growing engagement with trade, farming and other independent enterprises, for survival. This has, however, raised questions about women's dependence on men for household provisioning, and enhanced expectations of reciprocity in both production and reproduction within households. While demographers note the rise in female headship in sub-Saharan Africa, and female headed households are often the target of policy attention, the situation on the ground is much more complex. Polygamy, separation and consensual unions, multi-generational and multi-locational households, point to a growing diversity in gender and generational relationships, in rights, responsibilities and norms. Based on data from household surveys, focus group discussions and life history interviews with differently positioned women and men within pastoralist communities in northern Kenya, the paper explores the implications of changing household structures beyond headship, in particular the loosening of marriage ties, frequent separation and regrouping, on relational vulnerability and the micro-politics of adaptation in the region. © 2019 The Author","Borana; Drought; Gender; Kenya; Marital strategies; Pastoralism","autonomy; climate change; female headed household; gender issue; household survey; pastoralism; Isiolo; Kenya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063538137

A precise estimate of aboveground biomass of the juvenile stages of trees is therefore very important. We developed a generalized allometric biomass model for the prediction of aboveground biomass of the juvenile individuals of Rhododendron arboreum (Sm.). We used data from 66 destructively sampled juveniles of R. arboreum in Gorkha district-one of the mountainous districts in Nepal, for the purpose. Using eight nonlinear functions of various forms (power, exponential, fractional forms), we evaluated several individual-level characteristics, such as size (diameter, height), crown measures (crown ratio, crown width, crown spread ratio, crown index, crown fullness ratio), height-to-diameter ratio (plant bole slenderness), number of branches, wood density, and stand-level characteristics, such as altitude and slope of sites for their potential contributions to the biomass variations of the juvenile individuals. A simple power function with cross-product of the squared-diameter and height as a main predictor and crown spread ratio as a covariate predictor showed the best fit to data (R2 adj =0. 90); RMSE=59.35 g) without adj substantial trends in the residuals. Our model is site-specific and its application should therefore be limited to those stands which were the basis of this study. Further works on recalibration, validation, and verification of our model using a larger dataset collected from a wider range of species distribution will be more interesting. © 2019, Federal University of Lavras.

Recently, significant attention has focused on the development of size-selected subnanometer nanocatalysts because of the unique electronic, geometric, and catalytic properties of these clusters, which often exhibit enhanced catalytic activities and selectivities compared to bulk metal catalysts and larger nanoparticles. In this paper, we investigate in detail the electrocatalytic activity of size-selected Cun clusters (n = 3-6) employing the computational hydrogen electrode model. We have found a striking similarity between the CO2RR activity of Cu3 and Cu5 and between Cu4 and Cu6 nanoclusters. The reaction proceeds through ∗ + CO2 → COOH∗ → CO∗ + H2O → CHO∗ → CH2O∗ → CH3O∗ → O∗ + CH4 → OH∗ → ∗ + H2O as in the case of copper surface on all Cu clusters. The rate-limiting potential on Cu4 and Cu6 clusters is the proton-electron (H+ + e-) transfer to CO∗ to form the CHO∗ adsorbed species, which is also the rate-limiting step on Cu surfaces, whereas on Cu3 and Cu5 clusters, it is the removal of the adsorbed OH∗ from the cluster surface (OH∗ → ∗ + H2O). Most importantly, we have identified a general trend in the exergonicity and endergonicity of each step with the spin-state of the nanocluster. In general, electrochemical steps corresponding to an odd total number of (H+ + e-) pair transfers, leading to the formation of the doublet adsorbed species on Cu4 and Cu6 clusters, are highly endergonic uphill processes relative to the same steps on Cu3 and Cu5 clusters. However, the steps corresponding to an even total number of proton-electron pair transfers, leading to the formation of singlet adsorbed species on Cu4 and Cu6 clusters, are highly exergonic downhill processes relative to the same steps on Cu3 and Cu5. We have also found that the competing hydrogen evolution reaction is more hindered on Cu3 and Cu5 compared to Cu4 and Cu6 clusters. There is also a general qualitative relationship between the exer/endergonicity of an electrochemical step and the HOMO-LUMO gap of the various cluster-adsorbate complexes. We have found that an increase or decrease of a single valence electron can significantly alter the electrocatalytic activity and reactivity on the subnanometer level, and this has great implications in the design and development of size-selected nanoclusters for CO2RR and similar reactions. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Copper; Electrons; Hydrogen; Metal nanoparticles; Nanocatalysts; Nanoclusters; Catalytic properties; Design and Development; Electrocatalytic activity; Electrocatalytic reduction; Electron pair transfers; Enhanced catalytic activity; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Size selected nanoclusters; Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066974806

Several commonly used promoters in yeast cell factories belong to glycolytic genes, highly expressed in actively growing yeast when glucose is used as a carbon source. However, their expression can be suboptimal when alternate carbon sources are used, or if there is a need to decouple growth from production. Hence, there is a need for alternate promoters for different carbon sources and production schemes. In this work, we demonstrate a reversal of regulatory function in two glycolytic yeast promoters by replacing glycolytic regulatory elements with ones induced by the diauxic shift.

Abu, in the Aravalli Range in western India from January 2015 to December 2016. The aerosol scattering and absorption coefficients were higher in the afternoon than during the forenoon and night because of atmospheric boundary layer dynamics that, when accompanied by strong thermal convection, promote an upward movement of pollutants to the observational site from the surrounding foothills. The aerosol scattering and absorption coefficients exhibited a strong seasonal variability. The average scattering coefficients during the winter, premonsoon, monsoon and postmonsoon seasons were 78.5 ± 22.9, 61.8 ± 12.2, 49.9 ± 25.1 and 121.8 ± 47.4 Mm–1, respectively, and the corresponding absorption coefficients were 14.9 ± 3.1, 9.1 ± 2.9, 5.1 ± 3.2 and 20.2 ± 10.2 Mm–1. The single scattering albedo also exhibited a significant seasonal variation, with the maximum occurring during the monsoon season (0.91) and the minimum during winter (0.83). The mean annual βsca, βabs and SSA at 550 nm were 74 ± 34 Mm–1, 12 ± 7 Mm–1 and 0.87 ± 0.04. These results indicate that Gurushikhar, a remote high altitude site, is influenced by local and long-range transported aerosols through convection and advection processes. However, the aerosol properties at this pristine location are governed by transported emissions rather than local anthropogenic sources and also display low inter-annual variability. Thus, Gurushikhar can be considered a background site for the nearby source regions in western India. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Aerosol absorption coefficient; Aerosol scattering coefficient; Interannual variability; Mountain site; Single scattering albedo","Aerosols; Atmospheric boundary layer; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Heat convection; Landforms; Solar radiation; Aerosol absorption; Aerosol scattering coefficient; Interannual variability; Mountain site; Single scattering albedo; Optical properties; absorption; albedo; altitude; annual variation; anthropogenic source; atmospheric convection; boundary layer; mountain region; optical property; seasonal variation; Aravalli Range; India; Mount Abu; Rajasthan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068742833

Changing [CO2]a affects plant carbon-water balance, with implications for growth, drought tolerance and vegetation shifts. The evolution of C4 photosynthesis improved plant hydraulic function under low [CO2]a and preluded the establishment of savannahs, characterized by rapid transitions between open C4-dominated grassland with scattered trees and closed forest. Understanding directional vegetation trends in response to environmental change will require modelling. But models are often parameterized with characteristics observed in plants under current climatic conditions, necessitating experimental quantification of the mechanistic underpinnings of plant acclimation to [CO2]a. Methods: We measured growth, photosynthesis and plant-water relations, within wetting-drying cycles, of a C3 tree (Vachellia karroo, an acacia) and a C4 grass (Eragrostis curvula) grown at 200, 400 or 800 ppm [CO2]a. We investigated the mechanistic linkages between trait responses to [CO2]a under moderate soil drying, and photosynthetic characteristics. Key results: For V. karroo, higher [CO2]a increased assimilation, foliar carbon:nitrogen, biomass and leaf starch, but decreased stomatal conductance and root starch. For Eragrostis, higher [CO2]a decreased C:N, did not affect assimilation, biomass or starch, and markedly decreased stomatal conductance. Together, this meant that C4 advantages in efficient water-use over the tree were maintained with rising [CO2]a. Conclusions: Acacia and Eragrostis acclimated differently to [CO2]a, with implications for their respective responses to water limitation and environmental change. Our findings question the carbon-centric focus on factors limiting assimilation with changing [CO2]a, how they are predicted and their role in determining productivity. We emphasize the continuing importance of water-conserving strategies in the assimilation response of savannah plants to rising [CO2]a © 2019 The Author(s).

In order to determine chemical and physical differences, PM 2.5 samples were collected at urban, rural and industrial areas of the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro (MRRJ), Brazil. The chemical characterization of the samples was performed using ion chromatography (IC) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), while the physical characterization was done by scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS). Through the use the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectories (HYSPLIT) model, it was observed that all the studied sites presented the influence of ocean air masses. The industrial and rural sites showed to influence of continental air masses too, that carried aerosols with greater UV absorption compared to those observed in trajectories originating in the Atlantic Ocean. Among analyzed species, NO 3 − and SO 4 2− ions and V, Pb and Sn elements were predominant in the urban site whereas in the rural and industrial sites Na + , SO 4 2− were the major ions and Na, Zn and Ba were the elements with the higher concentrations. Through SEM-EDS analysis, the particles were classified into two categories, the first in terms of the morphological similarities and the second in function of the elemental composition. As observed in ICP-MS analysis, the elements K, Al, Ca, Fe, Cu, Zn, Ba and Mg were detected also in the individual particles analysis by SEM-EDS. These results showed that C, O and Si were predominant elements at all sites.

The results indicate that the methane emissions in each region had been growing steadily from 2001 to 2015. After the adoption of methane emission reduction technology, the methane emissions have decreasing trend, and the peak value will show up mainly from 2026 to 2029.

To facilitate the identification of mitigation priorities, we use a state-of-the-science global chemistry-climate coupled model (AM3), with additional tagged BC tracers representing regional (East Asia, South Asia, Europe and North America) and sectoral (land transport, residential, industry) anthropogenic BC emissions to identify sources with the largest impacts on air quality, human health and glacial deposition. We find that within each tagged region, domestic emissions dominate BC surface concentrations and associated premature mortality (generally over 90%), as well as BC deposition on glaciers (∼40–95% across glaciers). BC emissions occurring within each tagged source region contribute roughly 1–2 orders of magnitude more to their domestic BC concentrations, premature mortality, and BC deposition on regional glaciers than that caused by the same quantity of BC emitted from foreign regions. At the sectoral level, the South Asian residential sector contributes ∼60% of BC associated premature mortality in South Asia and ∼40–60% of total BC deposited on southern Tibetan glaciers.

Additionally, less is known about the modification of such association by factors measured at the individual level. We aimed to investigate the risk of fatal intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) incidence in case of PM2.5 (particles ≤ 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter) exposure. Methods: Data on incidence of fatal ICH from 1 June 2012 to 31 May 2014 were extracted from the acute stroke mortality database in Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention (SCDC). We used the time-stratified case-crossover approach to assess the association between daily concentrations of PM2.5 and fatal ICH incidence in Shanghai, China. Results: A total of 5286 fatal ICH cases occurred during our study period. The averaged concentration of PM2.5 was 77.45 μg/m3. The incidence of fatal ICH was significantly associated with PM2.5 concentration. Substantial differences were observed among subjects with diabetes compared with those without; following the increase of PM2.5 in lag2, the OR (95% CI) for subjects with diabetes was 1.26 (1.09-1.46) versus 1.05 (0.98-1.12) for those without. We did not find evidence of effect modification by hypertension and cigarette smoking. Conclusions: Fatal ICH incidence was associated with PM2.5 exposure.

There are Graphs of changes in various indicators of landfill gas in this article. This study can be used to predict energy conservation not only of large cities, but also of small settlements from the use of an alternative energy source - landfill gas. Its main characteristic (in terms of thermal physics) is the lower calorific value of the fuel. It depends on the composition and moisture of the gas. The report discusses the methodology for studying the lower calorific value of landfill gas, based on the chemical balance of this fuel. Another important characteristic is the environmental effect. Reducing emissions of landfill gas decrease the greenhouse effect, which has a negative impact on the Earth's atmosphere, biosphere and hydrosphere. It could be provided for the production of electrical energy, as well as a combination of electric and thermal. There is the possibility of producing hydrogen for a fuel cell.

However, the majority of the existing studies focus on Australia, the United States and Europe and few carry out cross-country comparisons to find general trends or cross-national differences. Based on a quantitative analysis our empirical research suggests that factors such as education, access to information via mobile phones and radios and market integration increase people's awareness of climate change independent of their cultural background. At the same time, these factors do not seem to affect people's understanding of the causes of climate change, while subjective vulnerability partly does. Misperception of climate change causes is quite heterogeneous suggesting that local factors such as beliefs, values, and other short-term pressing problems (such as poverty and food security) limit understanding.

These processing steps yield simple sugars as well as plant-derived and process-added organic acids, sugar-derived dehydration products, aldehydes, phenolics and other compounds that inhibit the growth of many microorganisms. Lipomyces starkeyi is an oleaginous yeast capable of robust growth on a variety of sugars and lipid accumulation on pretreated lignocellulosic substrates making it attractive as an industrial producer of biofuels. Here, we examined gene expression during batch growth and lipid accumulation in a 20-L bioreactor with either a blend of pure glucose and xylose or pretreated corn stover (PCS) that had been enzymatically hydrolyzed as the carbon sources. Results: We monitored sugar and ammonium utilization as well as biomass accumulation and found that growth of L. starkeyi is inhibited with PCS hydrolysate as the carbon source. Both acetic acid and furfural are present at concentrations toxic to L. starkeyi in PCS hydrolysate. We quantified gene expression at seven time-points for each carbon source during batch growth and found that gene expression is similar at physiologically equivalent points. Analysis of promoter regions revealed that gene expression during the transition to lipid accumulation is regulated by carbon and nitrogen catabolite repression, regardless of carbon source and is associated with decreased expression of the translation machinery and suppression of the cell cycle. We identified 73 differentially expressed genes during growth phase in the bioreactor that may be involved in detoxification of corn stover hydrolysate. Conclusions: Growth of L. starkeyi is inhibited by compounds present in PCS hydrolysate. Here, we monitored key metabolites to establish physiologically equivalent comparisons during a batch bioreactor run comparing PCS hydrolysate and purified sugars. L. starkeyi's response to PCS hydrolysate is primarily at the beginning of the run during growth phase when inhibitory compounds are presumably at their highest concentration and inducing the general detoxification response by L. starkeyi. Differentially expressed genes identified herein during growth phase will aid in the improvement of industrial strains capable of robust growth on substrates containing various growth inhibitory compounds. © 2019 The Author(s).","Biofuel; Bioreactor; Corn stover; Inhibitors; Lipomyces starkeyi; Oleaginous; PCS; Transcriptome; Yeast","Aldehydes; Bioconversion; Biofuels; Bioreactors; Blending; Carbon; Cellulosic ethanol; Corrosion inhibitors; Detoxification; Enzymatic hydrolysis; Gene expression; Machinery; Organic acids; Personal computers; Physiology; Sugars; Yeast; Chemical pre-treatment; Corn stover; Differentially expressed gene; Lignocellulosic biomass; Lignocellulosic substrates; Lipomyces starkeyi; Oleaginous; Transcriptomes; Ecology; accumulation; biofuel; bioreactor; crop residue; detoxification; enzyme; gene expression; inhibitor; lipid; yeast; Lipomyces starkeyi; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071021250

Other emissions, like nitrogen oxides or carbon monoxide, are detrimental to human health. A prominent way to understand and thus be able to minimize emissions is by using traffic simulations to evaluate different scenarios. In that way, one can find out which policies, technical innovations, or behavioral changes can lead to a decrease in emissions. Since the effect of CO2 is on a global scale, a macroscopic model is often enough to find reasonable results. However, NOx emissions can also have a direct, local effect. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate these emissions on a mesoscopic scale, to gain insight into the local distribution of this pollutant. In this study, we used a traffic model that, contrary to most other state-of-the-art traffic simulations, does not require an origin-destination matrix as an input, but calculates it from mobility behavior extracted from a survey. We then generated agents with realistic mobility behavior that perform their daily trips and calculate key features like congestion and emissions for every edge of the road network. Our approach has the additional advantage of allowing to investigate technical, juridical, as well as behavioral changes, all within the same framework. It is then possible to identify strategies that minimize NOx emissions caused by private motorized transport. Evaluation showed good agreement with reality in terms of local and temporal resolution. Especially when looking at the sum of emissions, the main feature for evaluating policies, and deviations between our simulation and available statistics were negligible. We found that, from all scenarios we investigated, the ban of old diesel cars is the most promising policy: By replacing all diesel cars built in 2005 or earlier with petrol cars of the same age, NOx emissions could drop by roughly a third. © 2019 by the authors.","Agent-based model; Congestion; Emissions; Incomplete combustion; Nitrogen oxides; Spatial networks; Traffic simulation","Autonomous agents; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Computational methods; Diesel engines; Global warming; Motor transportation; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Superconducting materials; Urban transportation; Agent-based model; Congestion; Incomplete combustion; Spatial network; Traffic simulations; Traffic congestion; combustion; congestion; emission inventory; mobility; nitrogen oxides; policy analysis; private sector; spatial data; traffic emission; urban transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068882593

Ponzio 31, Milano, 20133, Italy","The construction sector and, more specifically, the building renovation sector plays a decisive role in the achievement of the EU targets for the reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The main strategies implemented by the EU are aimed, on one side, at increasing the number of buildings to be renovated and, on the other, at promoting deep renovation on the existing stock. The main objective is to drastically reduce the CO2 emissions associated with the energy consumption of buildings during their operation in consideration of the decarbonization targets by 2050. Several studies have shown that around 75% of the EU building stock needs energy retrofitting, and a significant amount of thermal insulation is expected to be installed on the building envelopes in order to decrease the energy losses. The carbon emission for the production of materials and construction might slow down the transition to a low carbon society and significantly reduce the carbon budget available by 2050. In this perspective, the paper shows the results of some recent research activities aimed at identifying alternative approaches based on the use of biogenic materials applied to the building envelope retrofitting. On one side, they meet the energy and CO2 targets established by the EU while promoting, on the other one, sustainable regeneration processes that include, among the others, the storage of CO2 in building elements and the efficient land use.

Even when it has been argued that agriculture is the main cause of its increase in the atmosphere, natural ecosystems are also an important source of N2O. However, the impacts of human activities on N2O emissions through biodiversity loss or primary productivity changes in natural ecosystems have rarely been assessed. Here, we analyzed the effects of vegetation attributes such as plant diversity and production, as drivers of N2O emission rates, in addition to environmental factors. We measured N2O emissions monthly during 1 year in 12 sites covering a large portion of the Rio de la Plata grasslands, Argentina, and related these emissions with climate, soil and vegetation attributes. We performed spatial and temporal models of N2O emissions separately, to evaluate which drivers control N2O in space and over time independently. Our results showed that in the spatial model, N2O emissions decreased with increments in plant species richness, with concomitant reductions in soil NO3-, whereas N2O emissions increased with primary productivity. By contrast, in the temporal model, monthly precipitation and monthly temperature were the main drivers of N2O emissions, with positive correlations, showing important differences with the spatial model. Overall, our results show that biological drivers may exert substantial control of N2O emissions at large spatial scales, together with climate and soil variables. Our results suggest that biodiversity conservation of natural grasslands may reduce regional greenhouse gas emissions, besides maintaining other important ecosystem services. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biodiversity–ecosystem function relationship; Climate change; Ecosystem services; Greenhouse gases; Spatial and temporal drivers","biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; grassland; greenhouse gas; nitrous oxide; primary production; spatial variation; temporal variation; Rio de la Plata; nitrous oxide; Argentina; ecosystem; grassland; greenhouse gas; soil; Argentina; Ecosystem; Grassland; Greenhouse Gases; Nitrous Oxide; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067011155

In this study, we constructed a targeted systems genetics coexpression network of xylogenesis in Eucalyptus using plastid and mitochondrial carbon metabolic genes and compared the resulting clusters to the aspen xylem developmental series. The constructed network clusters reveal the organization of transcriptional modules regulating subcellular metabolic functions in plastids and mitochondria. Overlapping genes between the plastid and mitochondrial networks implicate the common transcriptional regulation of carbon metabolism during xylem secondary growth. We show that the central processes of organellar carbon metabolism are distinctly coordinated across the developmental stages of wood formation and are specifically associated with primary growth and secondary cell wall deposition.

Here, we explore the effects of wind power curtailment on the energy system composition and operation on two levels: national (Finland) and city level (Helsinki). For each level, optimization-based models were used. The results indicate that increasing the amount of wind power and curtailment and implementing power-to-heat conversion may not automatically lead to positive effects, such as emission reductions, but may need additional measures such as higher CO2 emission pricing and more effective heat generation (heat pumps) to realize the full benefits. © The Author(s) 2019.

To quantify this process, accurate measurements of CO2 fluctuation, coupled with variations in residence time of coastal water-bodies are required. Nearshore ecosystems, including coastal lagoons, may provide an effective sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide, particularly those containing productive biota such as seagrass. However, the rate and pattern of carbon sequestration in seagrass meadows across a range of environmental settings is still poorly constrained. In this study, we utilize a robust physical tidal model, along with biogeochemical dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) assessment, to estimate water residence time and net sequestration of atmospheric CO2 in an intertidal lagoon containing a seagrass (Zostera noltii) meadow. Total alkalinity and pH measurements taken from advected water mass exchanged with the open ocean at inlet boundaries are used to calculate DIC and pCO2. A predictive model of hydrodynamics provides good approximation of mean water residence time to within 6 h (±3 s.d). Results indicate that during the daytime study period the lagoon is a sink for carbon, having a mean net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of 3.0 ± 0.4 mmol C m−2 hr−1. An equivalent diel NEP range of between 15.23 and −9.24 mmol C m−2 d−1 is calculated based on reported shallow water pelagic respiration rates. Moreover, approximately 4% of DIC availability occurs from atmospheric CO2 transfer to lagoon water. However, a negative diel rate of −82 ± 81 mmol C m−2 d−1 is found, assuming overnight respiration ascertained from converted Zostera noltii O2 utilization. We hypothesize that analogous regional nearshore ecosystems provide baseline study sites suitable to elucidate the carbon capture potential of planned, nearby tidal range energy schemes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Atmosphere-ocean carbon exchange; Carbon sinks; Coastal lagoons; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Irish sea coastal modelling; Tidal energy","atmosphere-ocean coupling; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; climate change; coastal lagoon; dissolved inorganic carbon; hydrodynamics; net ecosystem production; open ocean; seagrass meadow; shallow water; tidal range; Zostera noltii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065830706

The nearly free internal rotation of methane within the complex gives rise to three states that do not relax even in a 5 K supersonic expansion. Eighteen lines have been assigned to the lowest state and are well fitted to a semirigid rotor model, with rotational constants A = 7553.8229 (24) MHz, B = 2483.9200 (8) MHz, and C = 2041.8692 (5) MHz, and six distortion constants. The structure has the methane positioned above the plane defined by the propane carbon atoms with a center-of-mass van der Waals bond distance of 3.98 Å. This is significantly larger than the equilibrium value of 3.71 Å found with ab initio calculations done at the CCSD(T)-F12a/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. Further calculations encompassing a large range of angular orientations of the methane subunit indicate that angular motion produces a large zero-point contribution to the energy, which not only lowers the effective barrier to internal rotation of the methane but also increases the radial distance between subunits. Therefore, although in the lowest energy structure the methane can get close to the propane by interdigitating the hydrogens atoms, the zero-point energy effectively flattens out the potential so that the hydrogens become less restricting. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Calculations; Propane; Van der Waals forces; Ab initio calculations; Barrier to internal rotation; Distortion constants; Lowest energy structure; Microwave transitions; Structure and dynamics; Supersonic expansions; Van der Waals complex; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068348481

The corrected Table and Sections are shown below. The changes are to the magnitudes of mercury species deposition to the Great Lakes region, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and the Adirondack region of the Lakes basin. The changes to the Adirondack values reduce the numerical differences in these magnitudes compared to magnitudes of total mercury deposition to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The changes to the mercury species deposition to the Great Lakes region and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan have no implications. The changes do not impact the conclusions of the article. 3.1 Atmospheric deposition of Hg to the GL region, Michigan's UP, and New York's Adirondacks region in the present vs. 2050 Changes in total (wet + dry) Hg deposition estimated from GEOS-Chem simulations from the present to the future (2050) are summarized in Table 3, along with % contributions to the policy-in-action scenario from the three policy scales (global, U.S., or Lake Superior). Total deposition is estimated to decrease by 70% due to the aspirational policy change scenario in the GL region (Fig. S1'), while it is estimated to decrease by 65% in Michigan's Upper Peninsula (UP) and 73% in the New York Adirondack region. These large estimated decreases are reasonable given that for the aspirational scenario, all anthropogenic emissions in the 2050 simulation were turned off. Because legacy emissions are held constant, this scenario does not represent pre-industrial emissions. The combined policy-in-action scenario leads to 20%, 15%, and 22% decreases in atmospheric deposition in 2050 in the GL, Michigan's UP, and New York Adirondack regions, respectively (Table 3). Fig. 2 presents the effects of individual scales of policies (Lake Superior, U.S., and global) on the combined policy-in-action deposition bene?t for the GL region. Approximately 85% of the total decrease is due to U.S. Clean Air Act regulations including MATS, while the local (Lake Superior Basin) and global (Minamata Convention) policies each account for 1% and 14% of the total decrease, respectively. Fig. 2B demonstrates the effect of reducing U.S. emissions on GL regional deposition. The 1.5 times greater reduction in deposition in the Adirondacks compared to the UP for this scenario is therefore largely related to differences in the in?uence of U.S. policies. Compared to the GL region policy-in-action scenario contributions of 14% from global policies, 85% from U.S., and 1% from Lake Superior, the UP receives 25% of total deposition decrease from global sources, 70% from the U.S., and 5% from Lake Superior (Table 3). In the Adirondacks region, approximately 89% of the total decrease in deposition for this scenario is due to Clean Air Act regulations in the U.S., while local (Lake Superior Basin) and global (Minamata Convention) each account for 0.1% and 11% of the total decrease, respectively. These values clearly show the signi?cant differences in contributions that proximity to up-wind sources make. The global contribution (as a percentage) of emissions reductions to decreased atmospheric deposition is 2.3 times greater for the UP than for the Adirondacks (Table 3). Sources within the U.S. (mostly coal-?red power plants) provide a greater fraction of the deposition to the Adirondacks as compared to the UP. The minimal-regulation scenario leads to increases in total deposition of 35% and 34% in the GL (Fig. S2') and Michigan's UP region, respectively (Table 3). The similarity in these estimates is likely coincidental. Based on the policy-in-action scenario, differences in deposition bene?t are largely related to U.S.-scale changes in emissions, and the largely U.S. emissions that comprise the minimal-regulation total deposition estimates happen to lead to similar increases in deposition. (Table Presented). The climate change, land use/land cover change, and biomass burning scenarios lead to smaller total Hg deposition changes in 2050 as compared to the policy scenarios (Table 3). In the GL region, these estimates are 3.8% (Fig. S3'), 0% (Fig. S4'), and 1.9% (Fig. S5'), respectively, whereas for Michigan's UP, the changes are 5.2%, 0%, and 2.3%, respectively. The climate change increase is primarily due to an increase in Hg(0) dry deposition and total wet deposition ?uxes. The negligibly small land use/land cover changes are a result of both increases and decreases in land cover in 2050 that in?uence the surfaces to which Hg deposits (Fig. S4'). The increase in deposition from biomass burning is a result of higher biomass burning emissions in the boreal parts of North America and Western U.S. These increases are, in turn, a result of greater ?re activity caused by more vegetation availability and a warmer climate in 2050. 4.1 Regional nature of deposition responses to policy changes Mapping of the projected changes in deposition due to environmental changes (climate, land use/land cover, biomass burning) and policy clearly shows that even within the GL region there is spatial variability (Fig. 2 and Table 3). Areas in close proximity to upwind sources show a larger response to controls of those sources than do areas far from sources. In all locations, the majority of the simulated decrease in deposition is due to decreased Hg(II) deposition rather than Hg(0) deposition; for the GL region as a whole, 80% of the decrease is due to Hg(II) and 20% due to Hg(0). However, in the Adirondacks, 79% of the decrease is due to Hg(II) while in the UP 75% is due to Hg(II). This projected outcome results from the short atmospheric residence time of Hg(II) emissions (0.5'2 days15) and does not re?ect regional differences in availability of oxidants for Hg(0).16 The projected large decrease in Hg(II) deposition is at odds with the absence of a trend in wet deposition of Hg but an observed decrease in litterfall Hg ?uxes in the Adirondacks37 that are postulated to result from recent declines in Hg(0) deposition. According to our scenario modeling, those areas currently receiving the highest rates of atmospheric deposition show the largest percentage decreases in deposition due to enactment of existing policies in the U.S. In contrast, the UP is not downwind of major Hg emission sources. U.S. policy-in-action changes in emissions still represent the majority of changes in deposition in the UP (70%), but the rest of the world contributes 1.8 times more to UP deposition than to the GL region, and 2.3 times more than to the Adirondacks. One implication of these regional differences in trajectories of Hg deposition is that it will be easiest to detect system responses to policy in those regions projected to show the largest responses. This study suggests that it will be difficult to detect policy-related changes in lake monitoring data in Michigan's UP over the next 50 years, unless additional policy steps are taken beyond those included in the scenarios of this project. Similarly, because the predicted changes in deposition due to climate- and land-use changes are small relative to those associated with policy changes, the likelihood is small that those changes can be detected in the GL region unless anthropogenic emissions stabilize. Within the GL region, changes will be easiest to detect in northern Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania (Fig. 2).

These data driven networks can be used to quantify ship performance and navigation conditions, where the outcome can also be used to improve vessel energy efficiency and reduce engine emissions in a local scale. A blockchain represents a decentralized, distributed and digital ledger system in a public domain and can handle and record transactions executed by many users. That has categorized as a high-level information model due the high quality data sets from industrial processes that these networks are handling.

The paratransit service operations are unique, since they do not run fixed routes and have relatively long passenger stops. During these stops, passengers onboard the vehicle must be kept comfortable, requiring operation of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). In a conventional bus configuration, the engine must be idling to power the HVAC compressor and other accessories. Thus, the engine idle time in a paratransit fleet is a substantial portion of the daily operation. This paper describes a research program with goals of lowering paratransit bus emissions, improving fuel economy, and reducing engine idle time. The program concept is electrification of the bus accessories using a high voltage battery and alternator system. With the vehicle engine running, the high voltage battery is charged via the engine driven high voltage alternator.

Water contaminated with pollutants can affect the consumption, life of aquatic animals and fishery. This article numerically studies the pollutant concentration dispersions in a two-dimensional confluent river model which is simulated from the river in Thailand. The effects of the inlet flow velocities of the canal, inlet flow velocities of the river, and pollutant temperatures are taken into consideration. The velocity field, pollutant concentration dispersion, and temperature distribution are obtained by solving the continuity equation, momentum equations, heat transfer equation, and species concentration equation for an unsteady state. The solution of these equations uses the finite element method. The results indicate that an increase in the inlet flow velocities of both channels increases pollutant emissions. It also can reduce the pollutant concentration at a greater rate. A deposition of pollutant results from the inlet flow velocity of the canal being too lower than that of the river. Meanwhile, the pollutant temperature can affect the pollutant concentration when the inlet flow velocities of both channels are high. The suitable inlet flow velocities of both channels are an important factor for removing pollutants in the confluent river. The inlet flow velocity of the canal should be not too lower than that of the river in order to avoid the deposition of pollutants. © 2019, Mathematical Modelling of Engineering Problems.","Confluent river; Convective heat transfer; Pollutant concentration dispersion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067656710

In this work, a fluorescent colour tuneable molecule BA-C16 is rationally designed and facilely synthesized by attaching flexible long alkyl chains to 2-hydroxybenzophenone azine (BA), which shows both aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) characteristics. Compared to BA, the simple introduction of long alkyl chains in BA-C16 leads to an emission wavelength redshift from 542 to 558 nm. This strategy of extending emission wavelength is rarely reported, and is ascribed to the enlarged through-space π-conjugation between interplanar molecules in the aggregate of BA-C16. Three crystals of BA-C16 are obtained with green, yellowish green and yellow emission. According to characterization by X-ray crystallography, X-ray powder diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry, alkyl chains play an important role in inducing different stacking modes of the three crystals, which further leads to polymorph-dependent fluorescence colour. BA-C16 exhibits tuneable solid-state fluorescence upon vapor fumigation, or annealing based on a transition between a “near-monomer” crystalline state and a “dimer” crystalline state. BA-C16 is further applied for rewritable fluorescence printing tuned by vapor- and thermal-treatment. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Demand Response (DR) has been identified as a key enabler of integrating these, and other, Smart Grid technologies, while, simultaneously, ensuring grid stability and secure energy supply. The massive deployment of smart meters, IoT devices and DERs dictate the need to move to decentralized, or even localized, DR schemes in the face of the increased scale and complexity of monitoring and coordinating the actors and devices in modern smart grids. Furthermore, there is an inherent need to guarantee interoperability, due to the vast number of, e.g., hardware and software stakeholders, and, more importantly, promote trust and incentivize the participation of customers in DR schemes, if they are to be successfully deployed.In this work, we illustrate the design of an energy system that addresses all of the roadblocks that hinder the large scale deployment of DR services. Our DR framework incorporates modern Smart Grid technologies, such as fog-enabled and IoT devices, DERs and RES to, among others, automate asset handling and various time-consuming workflows. To guarantee interoperability, our system employs OpenADR, which standardizes the communication of DR signals among energy stakeholders. Our approach acknowledges the need for decentralization and employs blockchains and smart contracts to deliver a secure, privacy-preserving, tamper-resistant, auditable and reliable DR framework. Blockchains provide the infrastructure to design innovative DR schemes and incentivize active consumer participation as their aforementioned properties promote transparency and trust. In addition, we harness the power of smart contracts which allows us to design and implement fully automated contractual agreements both among involved stakeholders, as well as on a machine-to-machine basis. Smart contracts are digital agents that ""live"" in the blockchain and can encode, execute and enforce arbitrary agreements. To illustrate the potential and effectiveness of our smart contract-based DR framework, we present a case study that describes the exchange of DR signals and the autonomous instantiation of smart contracts among involved participants to mediate and monitor transactions, enforce contractual clauses, regulate energy supply and handle payments/penalties. © 2019 IEEE.","blockchains; demand response; end-to-end security; fog computing; IoT devices; smart contracts; virtual node","Blockchain; Contracts; Data privacy; Electric power transmission networks; Fog computing; Internet of things; Interoperability; Legacy systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Renewable energy resources; blockchains; Demand response; End-to-end security; IoT devices; Virtual node; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070828921

Abellon Clean Energy has established 3 MW solar plant for practicing agricultural under the solar panels to address food and energy security involving a rural community. This innovation is first of its kind named as ""solar-agri-electric model."" The water used for washing the solar panels to maintain efficiency by dust removal irrigates agriculture produce under the panels. This gives 24-34 tones/hectare/yr agriculture produced by reusing 78 lakhs liters of water per year and capturing 250 tons of CO2 in vegetables as food. The 3 MW solar project is registered under clean development mechanism (CDM) under United National Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that reduces 0.1 million tonnes CO2 emissions over 25 years vis-a-vis fossil fuels. Around 52 MT/yr postharvested residues are used for organic fertilizer, composting, and fodder. Compound wall to safeguard the project site allowed creeper vegetables to grow and reduces dust deposition on the panels through wind breaking filtration. This initiative enhanced degree of sustainability along with local employment of 215 people from four villages including 156 women. In India, 1059.64 MW installed solar plants have potential to sequester 1,600,000 tons CO2/year with abilities of 10,000 tons of agricultural produce that could employ 2000 people. Worldwide solar farms have potential to sequester 143,000 MTCO2 through vegetation producing 100,000 MT of agriculture produce annually.

This will be performed within the context of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), which has represented a major scheme in Europe to cope with CO2 emissions since 2005. The actual situation in the field of the EU ETS is described and key scientific studies focusing on the EU ETS are presented. Based on a broad set of indicators we examine and evaluate possible geographical pattern in the development of selected indicators within the EU and provide detailed spatial analysis of economic and environmental data of EU28 countries, with the use of (geo)visual analysis of spatial data and spatial statistics (grouping analysis). The preliminary results of the (geo)visual analysis show that CO2 emissions within EU countries were decreasing in the selected period 2005-2015, with some exceptions (e.g. Iceland and Latvia). As the development of CO2 emissions in all EU countries is not similar, the other economic and environmental indicators were included (e.g. GDP, Investments) into the analysis in order to reveal a common (geographical) pattern and explain the current situation. Based on grouping/cluster analysis, it is possible to form territorial groups of EU states with similar development, which are almost perfectly in the line with current EU member states strategies of CO2 emissions trade. The current auction markets are well in tune with geographical and economic characteristics of particular EU countries. Results of grouping analysis of all indicators in 2015 using six K-nearest neighbours underline current separate auction markets for Germany, the United Kingdom and Poland.It indicates that the system of emission auctions has logical background and the markets represent natural platforms for emission trading, corresponding to both economic and spatial characteristics of particular countries/polluters. Presented approach thus brings valuable information for policymakers both on the national and international level for the next phases of EU ETS scheme planning. © 2019 Vít Pászto et al., published by Sciendo 2019.","Cluster analysis; Economic indicators; Emission Trading System; EU28; Spatial analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068721692

Solid tumor initially grows as an avascular bulk of cells carrying oncogenic mutations until diffusion distances from the nearest functional blood vessels limit delivery of nutrients and oxygen on the one hand and removal of metabolic waste on the other one. These restrictions result in regional hypoxia and acidosis that select for adaptable tumor cells able to promote aberrant angiogenesis, remodel metabolism, acquire invasiveness and metastatic propensity, and gain therapeutic resistance. Tumor cells are thereby endowed with capability to survive and proliferate in hostile microenvironment, communicate with stroma, enter circulation, colonize secondary sites, and generate metastases. While the role of oncogenic mutations initializing and driving these processes is well established, a key contribution of non-genomic, landscaping molecular players is still less appreciated despite they can equally serve as viable targets of anticancer therapies. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) is one of these players: it is induced by hypoxia, functionally linked to acidosis, implicated in invasiveness, and correlated with therapeutic resistance. Here, we summarize the available experimental evidence supported by accumulating preclinical and clinical data that CA IX can contribute virtually to each step of cancer progression path via its enzyme activity and/or non-catalytic mechanisms. We also propose that targeting tumor cells that express CA IX may provide therapeutic benefits in various settings and combinations with both conventional and newly developed treatments. © 2019, The Author(s).","Acidosis; Cancer progression; Carbonic anhydrase IX; Hypoxia; pH regulation; Tumor microenvironment","carbonate dehydratase IX; carbonate dehydratase IX; acidosis; cancer cell; cancer growth; carcinogenesis; cell homing; enzyme activity; enzyme regulation; gene expression; human; hypoxia; malignant neoplasm; metastasis; nonhuman; primary tumor; priority journal; Review; tumor microenvironment; animal; cell hypoxia; enzymology; metabolism; neoplasm; pathology; physiology; Acidosis; Animals; Carbonic Anhydrase IX; Cell Hypoxia; Humans; Neoplasms",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065714479

During marine isotope stage 3 (MIS3) corresponding to past 60,000–25,000 years, the millennial-timescale fluctuations of the δ13CTOC values in Hanam were more similar to those in Hongcheon located in the inner mountain area of central Korea than those in Cheollipo area in west coast of Korea. Periods with significantly decreased δ13CTOC values representing decreased C4 plants under wetter climates in these two inland areas are comparable with millennial-timescale Dansgaard–Oeschger (D-O) warming events recorded in Greenland ice cores, suggesting strong climatic teleconnection between East Asia and subpolar areas during the last glacial period. During MIS1 (Holocene), the changes in vegetation and climate in Hanam have been influenced by the long-term summer monsoon changes. Regarding past latitudinal change in aridity or humidity over Korea, during the middle Holocene, δ13CTOC values in areas of central South Korea gradually decreased, suggesting moving to a more humid climate. This is contrary to the increasing δ13CTOC values in southern South Korea indicating more dry climates. Furthermore, it is likely that there were two severe dry climates at different times at different latitudes (1000 cal BP in Hanam in northern South Korea and 2500 cal BP in Geoje in southern South Korea), suggesting possible different climate changes at millennial timescales over Korea. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","C4 plant; Carbon isotope value; Climate change; East asian monsoon; MIS1; MIS3","carbon isotope; climate change; Holocene; monsoon; regional climate; relative humidity; teleconnection; timescale; total organic carbon; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064106061

The interest in lean-premixed combustion has increased to reduce NOx emissions in the industrial gas-turbine as a suitable reduction strategy. The present study investigates methane/air premixed flames with a detailed chemical kinetic model to better understand the pressure effect on NOx formation. A detailed chemical kinetic model is developed by merging AramcoMech 3.0 and recently proposed nitrogen chemistry. The proposed mechanism is first validated against experimental data, including laminar flame speed, ignition delay times, and NO concentration in premixed flames at various pressures. Freely propagating methane/air lean-premixed flames are simulated over a pressure range 1–20 atm and equivalence of 0.5, 0.55 and 0.6. Prompt NO formation is dominant within a narrow heat release region and thermal NO production pathways lead to the total NO formation in the postflame zone. Prompt NO formation rate increases between 1 and 5 atm and then decreases with further increasing pressure due to pressure dependent NCN formation rates. On the other hand, the formation rate of NO in the postflame zone increases monotonically as pressure increases. © 2019, KSME & Springer.","Detailed chemical kinetic model; Gas turbine; Lean-premixed flame; NCN; NO formation","Air pollution; Combustion; Gas emissions; Gas turbines; Industrial emissions; Kinetic parameters; Kinetic theory; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone layer; Detailed chemical kinetic; Ignition delay time; Industrial gas turbines; Laminar flame speed; Lean premixed combustion; Lean premixed flames; NO formation; Ozone layer depletion; Pressure effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067199831

When natural gas (NG) is applied to a DF-PCCI engine, its low reactivity reduces the maximum pressure rise rate under high loads. However, the NG–diesel DF-PCCI engine suffers from low combustion efficiency under low loads. In this study, an injection strategy of fuel supply (NG and diesel) in a DF-PCCI engine was investigated in order to reduce both the fuel consumption and hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions under low load conditions. A variation in the NG substitution and diesel start of energizing (SOE) was found to effectively control the formation of the fuel–air mixture. A double injection strategy of diesel was implemented to adjust the local reactivity of the mixture. Retardation of the diesel pilot SOE and a low fraction of the diesel pilot injection quantity were favorable for reducing the combustion loss. The introduction of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) improved the fuel economy and reduced the NOx and PM emissions below Euro VI regulations by retarding the combustion phasing. The combination of an NG substitution of 40%, the double injection strategy of diesel, and a moderate EGR rate effectively improved the combustion efficiency and indicated efficiency, and reduced the HC and CO emissions under low load conditions. © 2019 THE AUTHORS","Dual fuel; Exhaust gas recirculation; Injection strategy; Natural gas; Premixed charge compression ignition; Reactivity controlled compression ignition","Carbon monoxide; Dual fuel engines; Efficiency; Exhaust gas recirculation; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Ignition; Mixtures; Natural gas; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Combustion efficiencies; Compression ignition; Compression ignition engine; Dual-fuels; Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR); Particulate matter emissions; Pilot injection quantities; Premixed charge compression ignition; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065927491

As of the end of 2016 in Korea, 16.1% of households received district heating service as the government pushed to expand the integrated energy supply. Since large-scale facilities are installed according to local demand for heat, IES—compared to individual heating systems—can increase the consumer benefit by reducing the annual cost of heating through lower facility costs. This study estimates the consumer benefits of district heating service from IES. We apply the compensated variation (CV) based on the Hicksian welfare concept and evaluate new consumers as well as existing consumers who switch from individual heating to district heating. The estimated CV shows that the new consumer benefit is 1.75 times higher in terms of heating cost if they use district heating from IES; moreover, they benefit 50% more than the Marshallian consumer surplus. Consumers who switch to district heating gain a 24% benefit (economic value/heat price equals 1.24). Electricity produced from IES is an indispensable energy source for industrial production, household appliances, cooking, and lighting and the estimated CV shows that a consumer who uses one unit of electricity enjoys 1.38 times additional benefit. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Compensated variation; District heating in Korea; Heat demand function","District heating; Domestic appliances; Electric power generation; Energy resources; Functions; Compensated variation; Consumer benefits; Consumer surplus; Economic values; Energy supplies; Heat and electricity; Heat demands; Industrial production; Energy efficiency; compensation; consumption behavior; cost-benefit analysis; electricity generation; energy market; heat balance; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062720841

However, their major drawback is the relatively low spatial and temporal beam quality, see Fig.1 [1]. We propose to control and improve the spatiotemporal dynamics in BAS lasers applying a global P-symmetric and local PT-symmetric potential [2] which may localize energy at the P-symmetry leading to a narrow and enhanced beam emission. This approach produces a two-fold benefit: the reduction of transverse mode number and the control the spatiotemporal dynamics improving the laser stability. The resulting narrow, bright and stable beam emission is shown in Fig.1.d,e,f.

However, how different forests as well as the soil parent materials influence the soil microbial carbon metabolism remains poorly understood. In this study, a natural secondary forest and a Pinus yunnanensis plantation, with similar climatic conditions under contrasting parent materials (clasolite in the non-karst areas and limestone in the karst areas) in Yunnan Province, China, were investigated. The soil microbial carbon metabolism diversity was assessed by the Biolog® ECO-plates. During the dry season, the soil microbial communities used carbon substrate in secondary forest and Pinus yunnanensis plantation, showing no significant difference, both in non-karst and karst areas. The microbial communities in the non-karst area were more efficient in utilizing carbon substrates than those in the karst area with the same vegetation types, resulting in the higher accumulation of organic carbon in the karst area. The six categories of most frequently utilized carbon substrates were carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, and amino acids in both the non-karst and the karst areas. The soil basal respiration of the secondary forest was higher than that of the Pinus yunnanensis plantation, both in the non-karst and the karst areas. In addition, the driving factors of the soil microbial community functional diversity in the non-karst and karst areas are different. Our findings suggest that soil microbial functional diversity is governed by vegetation types as well as by soil properties in subtropical forests. Moreover, calcareous soil holds a higher proportion of recalcitrant organic carbon, which is difficult to utilize by microorganisms. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon substrate; Microbial functional diversity; Pinus yunnanensis plantation; Secondary forest; Subtropical forests; Vegetation types","Forestry; Landforms; Lime; Metabolism; Microorganisms; Organic carbon; Substrates; Tropics; Vegetation; Carbon substrates; Microbial functional diversities; Pinus yunnanensis plantation; Secondary forests; Subtropical forests; Vegetation type; Soils; forest soil; metabolism; microbial activity; microbial community; secondary forest; soil microorganism; soil property; substrate; subtropical region; vegetation type; Forestry; Lime; Metabolism; Microorganisms; Substrates; Tropics; China; Yunnan; Pinus yunnanensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068893833

This paper analyzes when car owners will abandon car driving based on a survey of the parking experiences of people in Changsha, China. The results indicate that car owners are most likely to abandon driving when the total time expenditure (including the search time and walking time) exceeds 20 min or the walking distance between a car park and a destination exceeds 400 m. In addition, car owners' decisions regarding different trip purposes (commuting, business, hospital trips, shopping and entertainment activities) are compared. Multinomial logistic regression models and correspondence analysis methods are applied to identify the factors influencing car owners' decisions. The results show that public transport and the parking pricing level near work places have a substantial impact on people's decisions: people will more readily abandon driving when the travel time of public transit decreases; age, occupation and annual household income have a significant influence on people's parking condition preferences for business trips and trips to hospitals; and the factor that primarily influences the mode choice for shopping and entertainment trips is annual household income. The outcome of this study can provide a basis for determining the optimal parking supply level and facilitate the realization of sustainable transportation. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Mode choice; multinomial logistic regression; parking time; survey",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067378492

In this study, four scenarios were developed to understand how future fleet electrification and turnover of both gasoline and diesel vehicles affect air quality and health in the Houston Metropolitan area. These scenarios considered increased vehicle activity and various configurations of emissions controls. Comparing to a base year of 2013, model predictions for 2040 indicated a ∼50% emissions increase in the Business As Usual (BAU) case, and ∼50%, ∼75%, and ∼95% reductions in the three distinct emissions control cases, the Moderate Electrification (ME), Aggressive Electrification (AE), and Complete Turnover (CT) cases, respectively. Each modeling scenario was conducted using a high-resolution (1 km) WRF-SMOKE-CMAQ-BenMAP air quality and health modeling framework, which helped capture urban features in higher detail. The emissions control cases resulted in 1–4 ppb maximum 8 h O3 increase along highways and reductions both in the regions enclosed by the highways and those downwind. Simulated PM2.5 concentrations decreased between 0.5 and 2 μg m−3. Health impact results suggest that increased O3 and PM2.5 concentrations from the BAU case will lead to 122 additional premature deaths with respect to 2013. However, reduced emissions for the control cases (ME, AE, CT) will prevent 114–246 premature deaths. Additionally, about 7,500 asthma exacerbation and 5,500 school loss days will be prevented in the ME case, benefiting younger individuals. The economic benefits generally followed the same trends as health impacts. The analysis framework developed in this study can be applied to other metropolitan areas.

This intensified system uses renewables to produce ammonia both as fertilizer and as fuel for tractors and grain drying, to meet local electrical power demand and to provide predictable, consistent power export to the grid. The conceptual design of this system exploits synergies between ammonia production and energy supply to allow for economic viability, specifically time-varying chemical production as well as the potential of ammonia and hydrogen as energy storage media. A framework for combined optimization of the ABSEA design and its inherently time-varying operating schedule is proposed with a view on further improving economic competitiveness. A case study which considers the use of wind turbines to meet ammonia fertilizer and fuel demands of 40,300 kg/year and an annual hourly average power demand of 985 kW demonstrates the promise of the ABSEA system and the associated design-scheduling optimization framework. The annual net present cost is approximately $75,000, which corresponds to an emissions reduction cost of $17.60/tonCO2. The ABSEA optimal design uses both hydrogen and ammonia, but not a battery, for energy storage, illustrating their efficacy in this synergistic application. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Design; Optimization; Process intensification; Renewable energy; Scheduling","Agriculture; Conceptual design; Design; Electric power utilization; Emission control; Energy conservation; Fertilizers; Hydrogen storage; Optimization; Scheduling; Wind turbines; Design optimization; Economic competitiveness; Electrical power demand; Emissions reduction; Process intensification; Renewable energies; Scheduling optimization; Sustainable energy supply; Ammonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064903698

Insect phenology is driven by local climate variables, most notably temperature. Increased warming has been linked to advancements in critical phenophases such as the spring flight of reproductive adults in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S.A. 2. Local climate is governed by the fluctuations of large-scale climate oscillations. In the northern hemisphere, both the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) control the local autumn and winter severity. Low NAO and AO indices are associated with colder autumns and winters, which can delay spring phenology. 3. In this study, 36 years of data from experimental fruit orchards in Biglerville, Pennsylvania, were used to run partial least-squares regressions in order to determine the climate variables related to the spring phenology of five tortricid pest species. 4. The phenology of the tortricid pests did not advance, even though there was evidence of warming at the research site. 5. Spring temperatures were found to be the most significant climate variables in determining the timing of the spring flights. However, autumn–winter temperatures were also important. 6. For the NAO and the AO, it was found that these oscillations affected the tortricid moths by influencing autumn–winter conditions. The oscillations of the NAO and AO can obscure long-term changes in phenology. 7. These findings suggest that the inclusion of large-scale climate oscillations can provide important insights into how climate conditions can influence insect phenology, and presents an opportunity for improving the ability to forecast spring emergence. © 2018 The Royal Entomological Society","Cydia pomonella; Grapholita molesta; insect phenology; large-scale climate indices; tortricid moths","Arctic Oscillation; climate conditions; climate effect; flight activity; moth; North Atlantic Oscillation; phenology; phenotypic plasticity; regional climate; reproductive biology; seasonality; Pennsylvania; United States; Cydia pomonella; Grapholita molesta; Hexapoda; Lepidoptera; Tortricidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058849198

The closure to the traffic of the Caracciolo promenade, one of the most famous and panoramic streets of the city, made possible the organization of some festivals in this area, with subsequent impacts on congestion and livability of the nearby boroughs. In 2018, 13 festivals were organized in the same area, during a period of 50 days, and more than 2 million visitors participated. The accessibility to the area with public transport, today very constrained, will increase in the coming years due to the opening of a new underground station (Chiaia station) of the metro Line 6. The objectives of this study are: (i) to evaluate the environmental impacts (in terms of CO2 and PM10 emissions) produced by visitors attending the festivals organized in the area of Caracciolo promenade, (ii) to estimate the emissions variations following the opening of the new station of metro Line 6. To this aim, a mobility survey was carried out during the period of one of the most important festival held in 2018, the Buffalo Festival. Assuming that the mobility choices of the visitors to the Buffalo festival are comparable to the mobility choices of visitors for all the other festivals in 2018, it was estimated the total emission produced in 2018 by visitors who went to the festivals organized along the Caracciolo promenade. It was thus possible to estimate that in 2018, during the 50 days in which the festivals took place, 408 tons of CO2 and 793 kg of PM10 pollutants were produced due to visitors' travels. Moreover from the surveys, it was estimated that 39% of users, choosing car or motorbike, declared that they would have used the metro if it had been opened. The opening of the metro station can reduce these emissions up to 48%. By applying the national and European guidelines, it was possible to estimate the economic benefits produced by this reduction. Specifically, the total economic benefits for the events in 2018 was over 583 thousand Euros. © 2019 IEEE.","Accessibility; Environmental impacts analysis; Events; Festivals; Transportation System","Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Subway stations; Surveys; Accessibility; Economic benefits; Events; Festivals; Mobility surveys; Public transport; Transportation system; Underground stations; Environmental impact",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070811694

In this study, we take this first step of evaluating climate change in the Tibetan Plateau region for different distinct climate states. We do this using a high-resolution regional climate model parameterized for the Cenozoic rise of the Plateau and prominent Quaternary glacial and interglacial episodes. The main objective is to delimit the range of climate variability due to important natural drivers in the region by comparing climate changes during the main Cenozoic uplift period with climate anomalies during the last glacial maximum and the mid-Holocene optimum. This helps to interpret environmental changes documented by proxy data and to benchmark man-made climate changes expected during the 21st century. The innovative aspects of this study pertain to the use of a consistent high-resolution modeling framework and a multivariate statistical assessment of climate types and their shift during the various paleo-climatic episodes. Reduced plateau elevation leads to regionally differentiated patterns of higher temperature and lower precipitation amounts on the plateau itself, whereas surrounding regions are subject to colder conditions. In particular, Central Asia receives much more precipitation prior to the uplift, mainly due to a shift of the stationary wave train over Eurasia. Cluster analysis indicates that the continental-desert type climate, which is widespread over Central Asia today, appears with the Tibetan Plateau reaching 50% of its present-day elevation. The mid-Holocene is characterized by slightly colder temperatures, and the last glacial maximum by considerably colder conditions over most of central and southern Asia. Precipitation anomalies during these episodes are less pronounced and spatially heterogeneous over the Tibetan Plateau. The simulated changes are in good agreement with available paleo-climatic reconstructions from proxy data. The present-day climate classification is only slightly sensitive to the changed boundary conditions in the Quaternary. However, it is shown that in some regions of the Tibetan Plateau the climate anomalies during the Quaternary have been as strong as the changes occurring during the uplift period. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamical downscaling; Last glacial maximum; Mid-Holocene; Paleo-climate; Surface uplift; Tibetan Plateau","Climate models; Cluster analysis; Earth (planet); Glacial geology; Multivariant analysis; Orbits; Tectonics; Dynamical downscaling; Holocenes; Last Glacial Maximum; Paleo-climate; Tibetan Plateau; Climate change; Cenozoic; climate modeling; climate variation; comparative study; downscaling; glacial-interglacial cycle; Holocene; orbital forcing; paleoclimate; proxy climate record; regional climate; standing wave; uplift; Central Asia; China; Eurasia; Himalayas; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063114393

Combining nationwide data over a decade from Guyana's United Nations-approved Forest Reference Emission Level (FREL) submission and national documents, we found that REDD+ implemented at national level would annually add almost a quarter to the country's budget, and should not incentivize land grabbing as it places little direct value on forest, but financial penalties (lost income) on forest damage. We show quantitatively that national REDD+ in Guyana is competitive on a hectare basis when viewed from the resource owner's perspective, even against high value commodities such as gold and timber (the country's main emission drivers), and at a preliminary US$5 carbon price. Hidden by the latter appears a very lopsided distribution of overall net revenue between the state and private sector commodity chains (∼1:99 and ∼1:1200). We show government or electorate pressure towards more equitable distribution, or ‘cleaning profit chains’, would both be justified and highly worthwhile, without job loss. Investing part of this homegrown finance in further securing lawful and rational management of exhaustible forest-based resources has several additional economic, social and environmental benefits, including for forest-dependent citizens. Society awareness of current revenue ratios, REDD+ income losses, and potential returns of interventions may add helpful (i.e. economic, domestic) motivation for forest governance change in sovereign countries. Weak law enforcement, prevailing across the tropics, enhances lopsided sharing, and linked political leverage could undermine plans that would interfere with private income streams, e.g. rural social development, tenure, forest/biodiversity conservation. Interventions may therefore additionally enhance these sectors’ performances. Assessing and cleaning private profit chains may more generally have potential for REDD+ and global climate change mitigation goals, along with its many associated social and environmental co-benefits. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Equity; Forest commodities; Forest governance change; Land grabbing; Private state revenue ratios; REDD+ economic competitiveness","climate change; competitiveness; deforestation; emission control; forest management; gold mine; land management; land rights; logging (timber); national planning; private sector; profitability; Guyana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062000276

However, accumulating evidence suggested it is an independent biomarker, which is denoted as ""F"" in the very study. Methods: A total of 551 A+T+ individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database were recruited and then further divided into four groups based on the biomarker positivity as 132 A+T+N-F-, 102 A+T+N-F+, 113 A+T+N+F-, and 204 A+T+N+F+. Frequency distributions of the groups were compared, as well as the clinical progression [measured by the longitudinal changes in cognition and brain structure, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD dementia conversion] between every pair of F+ and F- groups. Results: The prevalence of A+T+N+F+ profile was 66.24% in clinically diagnosed AD dementia patients; similarly, the majority of individuals with reduced FDG-PET were AD dementia subjects. Among the 551 individuals that included, 537 had at least one follow-up (varied from 1 to 8 years). Individuals in F+ groups performed worse and dropped faster in Mini-Mental State Examination scale and had faster shrinking middle temporal lobe than those in F- groups (all p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, in MCI patients, reduced FDG-PET exerted 2.47 to 4.08-fold risk of AD dementia progression compared with those without significantly impaired FDG-PET (both p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Based on the analyses, separating FDG-PET from ""N"" biomarker to build the ATN(F) system is necessary and well-founded. The analysis from this study could be a complement to the original ATN framework for AD's biological definition. © 2019 The Author(s).","18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET); Alzheimer's disease; ATN profile; Biomarker","fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; biological marker; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain metabolism; cognition; cognitive defect; controlled study; dementia; disease exacerbation; disease severity; female; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; medial temporal lobe; Mini Mental State Examination; nerve degeneration; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; prevalence; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; rating scale; Rey auditory verbal learning test; Alzheimer disease; brain; cerebrospinal fluid; diagnostic imaging; metabolism; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Disease Progression; Female; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Positron-Emission Tomography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068136091

To date, many studies have explored the effects of acute stresses, but few have investigated the consequences of prolonged shifts in climatic conditions on plant growth and chemistry. Methods: Plant size and metabolite profiles were assessed on naturally occurring Plantago lanceolata plants growing under different precipitation (ambient, 50 % less than ambient = drought) and temperature (ambient, +0.8, +2.4 and +4.0 °C above ambient) treatments at the Boston Area Climate Experiment (constructed in 2007). Key Results: The analysis of primary and secondary metabolites revealed pronounced effects of drought, and a precipitation × temperature interaction. Strikingly, the effects of precipitation were minimal at the two lower temperatures but marked at the two higher temperatures. Compared with the ambient condition, plants in the drought plots had lower concentrations of foliar nitrogen, amino acids and most sugars, and higher concentrations of sorbitol, citrate and malate, common stress-induced metabolites. This pattern was especially evident at high temperatures. Moreover, drought-exposed plants showed lower concentrations of catalpol, an iridoid glycoside. Conclusions: While the effect of warming on the metabolite profiles was less pronounced, differences were marked when combined with drought. Given the interactive effect of environmental variables on leaf chemistry, and the fact that woody and herbaceous plants seem to differ in their responses to temperature and precipitation, future studies should account for the direct and indirect effects of the community response to multifactorial field conditions. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

The forest in GLNP is rich in biodiversity which harboring various species as well as important for upstream water regulation and subsequent climate change mitigation. A rapid assessment of plant communities and diversity at the park was carried out in June 2014. Five sampling sites were identified based on elevation gradient. Overall, 68 plant species representing 58 genera and 35 families were recorded for all study sites. In each site, the plant species ranged from 15 to 32 species. The plant families with largest number of species in the studied sites were Euphorbiaceae (12 species) and Myrtaceae (5 species). The plant diversity in each site ranged from 2.7 to 3.5 based on Shannon diversity index. Three plant communities of the park separated out: lower (L1 and L2), middle (L3 and L6) and upper (L10) plant communities. Some exotic invasive species had been recorded and they were rated as natural vegetation. It is important to consider them as invasive species because of the obvious negative impacts on local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of the pristine GLNP; and some actions are needed to remove them. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agriculture; Biodiversity; Food supply; Climate change mitigation; Ecosystem functioning; Elevation gradient; Invasive species; Natural vegetation; Number of species; Plant communities; Shannon diversity; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067661082

RETScreen software was used to calculate technical and economic parameters such as the cost of energy production, capacity factor, payback period, internal rate of return, net present value, benefit-cost ratio and gross reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The results showed that using the oneaxis tracker system increases the capacity factor of the power plant by approximate one-third relative to the fixed panel state. Moreover, the payback period of investment was achieved less than 4 years in all the studied cities. Considering all of the above parameters, we compared selected cities with each other from economical point of view.

We rely on original data from a large survey conducted among households in eight EU countries. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study of low-energy building adoption to rely on a demographically representative sample. Our set of covariates includes parameters of time and risk preferences that were elicited via state-of-the-art incentivized multiple price list experiments and via self-assessment scales. We find mixed results for the effects of time discounting on low-energy house adoption.

Production varies extensively between different countries and within countries, as biogas production is heavily dependent on local and regional feedstocks. In Germany, distinct regional differences can be observed. Therefore, understanding the kinds of biogas systems operating within a region is crucial to determine their greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potential and carbon neutrality. This is the first study to conduct an integrated life cycle assessment of biogas configurations in the landscape (biogas plants and their biomass catchments) for an entire region. RELCA a ‘REgional Life Cycle inventory Assessment’ approach was used to model the GHG mitigation potential of 425 biogas plants in the region of Central Germany (CG), aggregated to nine biogas clusters, based on feedstock mix (e.g. animal manures and energy crops) and installed capacity. GHG emission profiles were generated to compare and to identify the role of GHG credits and size of installed capacity on the mitigation performance of the regional biogas clusters. We found that smaller scaled slurry dominant clusters had significantly better GHG mitigation performance (−0.1 to −0.2 kg CO2eq kWhel−1), than larger energy crop dominant (ECdom) clusters (0.04–0.16 kg CO2eq kWhel−1), due to lower cultivation emissions and larger credits for avoided slurry storage. Thus, for the CG region larger ECdom clusters should be targeted first, to support GHG mitigation improvements to the overall future electricity supplied by the regional biogas systems. With the addition of GHG credits, the CG region is producing biogas with GHG savings (−0.15 kg CO2eq kWhel−1, interquartile range: 0.095 kg CO2eq kWhel−1). This infers that biogas production, as a waste management strategy for animal manures, could have important ramifications for future policy setting and national inventory accounting. © 2019 The Authors.

A framework is proposed for estimating the relationship between GHG emissions from pavement resurfacing activities and pavement cracking-threshold policies, where cracking is the trigger distress. Cracking threshold is the maximum percentage cracking level a pavement is allowed to reach before an asphalt overlay is applied.

Plant–plant interactions can constrict (through competition) or loosen (through facilitation) the strength of these environmental filters, which in turn inhibit or enhance establishment and recruitment of plant species at a finer spatial scale. Although competition is often the focus of community assembly processes that further impede the entry of plant species into a site, facilitation is also important for potentially loosening environmental filters (especially climatic filters such as temperature and precipitation), ultimately enhancing species occurrence beyond their physiological optimum. We used multiple data sets from the arid site of Rambla del Saltador Valley to test the hypothesis that facilitation by a nurse-plant promotes the presence of herbaceous, beneficiary species beyond their environmental optimum relative to open sites. Furthermore, we propose that the median elevation and community composition of herbaceous species expands with the age of the nurse-plant, and we tested this hypothesis by examining 105 beneficiary species under 50 nurse-plant shrubs varying in age from 6 to 48 years old. We found nurse-plants both facilitate herbaceous species occurrence beyond their median elevation and support more diverse and a distinctly different composition of species in contrast to open sites. Specifically, herbaceous species that originate from a median elevation more than 600 to 700 m above the site only existed beneath nurse-plants, and below this median elevation, half the species only occurred below the nurse-plant. Moreover, the richness and elevation provenance of the herbaceous species increased with increasing nurse-plant age. Our results highlight the importance of facilitation for alleviating physiological strain (in support of the strain hypothesis) and mediating regional species distributions, which has implications for understanding species movements and community assembly at larger-scales under hotter and drier climates. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Climate change; Community assembly; Environmental filters; Nurse-plants; Plant-climate interactions; Species distributions","abiotic factor; arid region; assembly rule; climate change; community composition; elevation; environmental conditions; facilitation; herb; hypothesis testing; nurse plant; physiological response; recruitment (population dynamics); seedling establishment; shrub; spatial distribution; species occurrence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063758307

In order to deal with recurrent water scarcity, different types of ice reservoirs, commonly called “artificial glaciers,” have been introduced in Ladakh and promoted as appropriate adaptive strategies to cope with changes in the cryosphere. The resulting seasonal ice reservoirs increase meltwater availability during the critical period of water scarcity in spring. We examine the efficacy of 14 ice reservoirs through a long-term analysis of their functioning within the environmental and socioeconomic context of Ladakh. Using multi-temporal satellite data (1969–2017), close range photogrammetry, and repeat field measurements (2014 and 2015), we provide an inventory and typology of these ice reservoirs and estimate storage volume of one selected structure, which ranges from 1010 to 3220 m3 of water. We extrapolate this volume to all ice reservoirs and estimate potential irrigation cycles of cropped areas, which vary between less than 0.1 in unfavorable cases and almost 3 in optimal cases and years. Based on interviews and field surveys (2007–2017), we discuss the benefits perceived by local smallholders, such as the reduction of seasonal water scarcity and resulting crop failure risks together with the possibility of growing cash crops. We argue that “artificial glaciers” are remarkably suited to the physical environment. However, their usefulness as a climate change adaptation strategy is questionable because climatic variability, natural hazards, and an incomplete integration into the local socioeconomic setting significantly reduce their efficacy. © 2018, The Author(s).","Climate change adaptation; Cold-arid region; Ice reservoirs; Irrigated agriculture; Socio-hydrology; Water conservation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049080752

Adverse effects include changes in species habitats and compositions, and consequently changes in ecosystem functioning. We assessed the magnitude of expected changes of biodiversity by performing a meta-analysis of the responses of species distributions to climate change. We focused on the proportion of local remaining species and their habitats. We summarized 97 studies and calculated two effect-size metrics from their results to quantify changes in biodiversity. These metrics are the fraction of remaining species (FRS) and the fraction of remaining area (FRA) with suitable climate for each species. Both metrics calculate deviations from the original biodiversity state and together they indicate biodiversity intactness. We found an expected gradual decrease in both FRS and FRA with significant reductions of 14% and 35% between 1 and 2 °C increase in global mean temperatures. Strong impacts are projected for both mammals and plants with FRS reductions of 19%. The climate-change response of biodiversity varies strongly among taxonomic groups and biomes. For some taxonomic groups the FRA declines strongly beyond 3 °C of temperature increase. Although these estimates are conservative, as we assume that species are unable to disperse or adapt, we conclude that already at moderate levels (i.e., 1–2 °C) of temperature increase a significant decrease of original biodiversity is projected. Our research supports the pledge to limit climate change to 1.5 °C and preferably lower to protect biodiversity. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Mammals; Adverse effect; Ecosystem functioning; Global-mean temperature; Meta analysis; Research support; Species distributions; Taxonomic groups; Temperature increase; Climate change; assessment method; biodiversity; biome; climate change; conservation status; ecosystem function; habitat type; temperature effect; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066913440

Understanding occurrence and impacts of hydrometeorological disasters on people's well-being and which livelihood assets are significant for identifying coping strategies to deal with disasters are important ingredients to increased resilience of communities living in disaster prone areas. This study relies on the data collected using the Community-based Risk Screening Tool - Adaptation and Livelihoods (Cristal) to map major risks and vulnerabilities along with coping strategies then ascertaining their relationship with community-based livelihoods assets. According to results, there are three frequent disaster risks in the study area which comprise avalanches, landslides and floods. These disasters inflict a heavy damage to the livelihood assets including crops, water, houses and other physical infrastructure. In order to overcome these losses, communities apply short-term coping strategies by spending limited means and hard-earned cash reserves. These unsustainable strategies further exacerbate vulnerabilities and give way to new ones. Taking empirical example of Chitral, the study recommends to formulate policies and encourage investment to substitute short term coping strategies with long term climate change adaptation measures in order to minimize impact of devastating disasters in future.

The extreme flexibility of observing from geostationary orbit induces an optimization problem, as operators must choose what to observe and when. The proposed scanning strategy for the GeoCarb mission tracks the sun's path from east to west and covers the entire area of interest in five coherent regions in the order of tropical South America east, tropical South America west, temperate South America, tropical North America, and temperate North America. We express this problem in terms of a geometric set cover problem, and use an incremental optimization (IO) algorithm to create a scanning strategy that minimizes expected error as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The IO algorithm used in this studied is a modified greedy algorithm that selects, incrementally at 5 min intervals, the scanning areas with the highest predicted SNR with respect to air mass factor (AF) and solar zenith angle (SZA) while also considering operational constraints to minimize overlapping scans and observations over water. As a proof of concept, two experiments are performed applying the IO algorithm offline to create an SNR-optimized strategy and compare it to the proposed strategy. The first experiment considers all landmasses with equal importance and the second experiment illustrates a temporary campaign mode that gives major urban areas greater importance weighting. Using a simple instrument model, we found that there is a significant performance increase with respect to overall predicted error when comparing the algorithm-selected scanning strategies to the proposed scanning strategy. © Author(s) 2019.",,"algorithm; geostationary satellite; greenhouse gas; instrumentation; observatory; optimization; orbit determination; signal-to-noise ratio; tropical environment; zenith angle; North America; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067898396

However, current approaches to informing communities of future climate risk are problematic. The predominant focus on end-of-century projections neglects more pressing development concerns, which relate to the management of shorter-term risks and climate variability, and constitutes a substantial opportunity cost for the limited financial and human resources available to tackle development challenges. When a long-term view genuinely is relevant to decision-making, much of the information available is not fit for purpose. Climate model projections are able to capture many aspects of the climate system and so can be relied upon to guide mitigation plans and broad adaptation strategies, but the use of these models to guide local, practical adaptation actions is unwarranted. Climate models are unable to represent future conditions at the degree of spatial, temporal, and probabilistic precision with which projections are often provided, which gives a false impression of confidence to users of climate change information. In this article, we outline these issues, review their history, and provide a set of practical steps for both the development and climate scientist communities to consider. Solutions to mobilize the best available science include a focus on decision-relevant timescales, an increased role for model evaluation and expert judgment and the integration of climate variability into climate change services.

Previous studies in Central Cameroon evidenced farmers’ ability to realize afforestation by establishing cocoa-based agroforestry systems (cAFS) on humid savannah. In this forest-savannah transition zone, we studied an 80 years chronosequence of cAFS to assess C dynamics. We selected cAFS established after forest or savannah, and we used local forest and savannah patches as controls. Aboveground carbon (AGC) was highest in the forests (118 Mg C ha−1) and lowest in the savannahs (8 Mg C ha−1). Systems established after forest (F-cAFS) revealed a mean AGC 40% lower than that of forests and did not evolve with time. The AGC of cAFS established after savannah (S-cAFS) increased with time and reached the mean AGC of F-cAFS (72 Mg C ha−1) after ca. 75 years. Soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration depended on clay content (R2 = 0.55, P &lt; 0.001). The SOC concentration of F-cAFS did not evolve with time and revealed no difference with forest. In S-cAFS, considering a time of about 80 years after afforestation, the average annual increase in SOC concentration in the 0–15 cm layer ranged from 7.3‰ in soils with low clay content (10–15%) (R2 = 0.60, P &lt; 0.01) to 9.5‰ in soils with higher clay content (20–25%). No significant change in SOC concentration was found for the 15–30 cm layer. Overall, S-cAFS revealed to store and maintain significant levels of C both in the aboveground biomass and in the soil. Such an afforestation thus appeared as a valuable local strategy to combine cocoa and other perennial plant productions with C storage while avoiding deforestation. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Carbon sequestration; Chronosequence; Climate change mitigation; Humid savannah; Land-use change","aboveground biomass; afforestation; agroforestry; carbon sequestration; chronosequence; clay soil; climate change; cocoa; hydrocarbon seep; land use change; organic carbon; perennial plant; savanna; soil carbon; transition zone; Cameroon; Theobroma cacao",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040049871

Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, CO infrared spectroscopy, and oxygen uptake-titration studies probe the structural dynamics of these nanocreatures in response to changing gas-phase compositions and oxygen chemical potentials, whereas rate assessments in the kinetically controlled regime under differential fuel-lean conditions at 698-773 K elucidate their catalytic roles in C-H bond activation during methane oxidation catalysis. Reductive treatments on Pt-Pd bimetallic catalysts (0.92-3.67 wt % Pt, 1 wt % Pd) lead to redistributions of the metals as Pt single atoms, small Pt clusters (2 nm), and large Pt-Pd alloy clusters (&gt;5 nm), and their relative abundances depend largely on the overall Pt-to-Pd atomic ratio. Treatments in incremental O2 pressures at temperatures relevant to CH4-O2 catalysis redisperse the small Pt clusters, thus increasing the density of Pt single atoms, while the remaining clusters retain their metallic bulk. The large Pt-Pd alloy clusters, however, undergo incipient structural reconstruction, forming a thin PdO shell covering a Pt-rich core, driven by the large, negative free energy of PdO formation and the lower surface free energy of PdO in comparison to Pt. During CH4-O2 catalysis, Pt single atoms and small Pt clusters are largely inactive. In contrast, the core-shell clusters are highly reactive. On these cluster surfaces, the O2- anions are highly nucleophilic, whereas the Pd2+ cations are highly electrophilic, as they are contacted to the underlying Pt-rich core. They form Pd2+-O2- site pairs that catalyze the kinetically relevant C-H bond cleavage of methane at &lt;40 kJ mol-1 via the formation of the highly stabilized four-center transition state (H3CI--Pd2+-HI+--O2-)a much more effectively than monometallic O∗-covered Pt or PdO clusters. An increase in the Pt-to-Pd atomic ratio results in excess Pt that is present as inactive Pt single atoms or Pt clusters, thus lowering the overall, ensemble average rate constants. The Pt-to-Pd atomic ratio of 0.5 is optimal for creating effective Pd2+-O2- site pairs on bimetallic core-shell clusters and minimizing the density of inactive Pt single atoms and clusters for CH4-O2 reactions. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","aberration-corrected STEM; infrared characterization; exhaust emission control; C-H activation; core-shell; methane oxidation; Pt-Pd catalyst","Activation analysis; Atoms; Binary alloys; Catalyst supports; Catalytic oxidation; Chemical activation; Chemical bonds; Emission control; Free energy; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Infrared spectroscopy; Methane; Nanocatalysts; Nanostructures; Oxidation; Oxygen; Palladium alloys; Platinum metals; Rate constants; Scanning electron microscopy; Shells (structures); Structural dynamics; C-h activation; Core shell; Infrared characterization; Methane oxidation; Pt-pd catalysts; Platinum alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067048229

Different vehicles are modeled for each operation and their performance is evaluated over the defined drive cycles. Different charging infrastructures are proposed for each operation to ensure that electric freight vehicles can be used for similar duty cycles as conventional vehicles. The additional power demand, additional load, capital cost needed, and the CO2 emissions savings for each case are calculated. The results are scaled up for the entire city and combined with estimated performance requirements for electrified urban deliveries.

One issue attracting much attention is the high level of aerosol loading, so that, aerosol effects on climate and air quality are more significant than in other regions. These effects can substantially influence air quality prediction. Thus, it leads to a need to apply online models for climate and air quality simulations in this region. In this study, an online coupled meteorology and air quality modeling system composed of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was applied for the purpose of evaluating the impacts of aerosol direct effects on meteorology and air quality in East Asia. Simulations were carried out in both one-way and two-way online (without and with the aerosol direct effects) for the whole historical year 2014 at a horizontal resolution of 45 km × 45 km. The model showed a good performance in reproducing the observations as well as capturing the spatial and temporal fluctuation of meteorological variables and air pollutant concentrations. On average, due to aerosol direct effects, shortwave radiation (SWR), temperature (T), planetary boundary layer height (PBLH), and wind speed (WS) were decreased by −7.71%, −0.42 °C, −8.13% and −1.00%, respectively; PM2.5, SO2, and NO2 concentrations were increased by +6.26%, +4.91%, +7.48%, respectively; while O3 concentration was decreased by −3.12% over China, Korea, and Japan for the entire year. Analyzing the cause-effect relationships among the responses of the above selected meteorological variables and air pollutants indicated that the reduction in SWR at ground surface caused by aerosol direct effects produces a decrease in T and PBLH, leading to an increase in PM2.5 concentration and a decrease in O3 concentration. Aerosol direct effects also affected long-range transport of PM2.5 from the continent to downwind area. Investigation of eastward response of PM2.5 to aerosol direct effects revealed that the amount of long-range transported PM2.5 was decreased in downwind area due to the impact of aerosol direct effects. It was mainly attributed to the increase in dry deposition of PM2.5 precursors and the decrease in WS in the continent. The results of study highlighted that the aerosol direct effects play an important role in the atmospheric dynamic and chemistry and cause considerable impacts on East Asia air quality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosol direct effects; Air pollution; East Asia; Long-range transported PM2.5; online model","Aerosols; Air pollution; Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Climate models; Meteorology; Weather forecasting; Wind; Air pollutant concentrations; Cause-effect relationships; Community multi-scale air qualities; East Asia; Long-range transported PM2.5; Online modeling; Planetary boundary layers; Weather research and forecasting models; Radiation effects; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; aerosol; air quality; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; concentration (composition); dose-response relationship; dry deposition; long range transport; particulate matter; shortwave radiation; wind velocity; air pollutant; air quality; Article; boundary layer; China; climate; concentration (parameter); conceptual framework; dry deposition; Japan; Korea; meteorology; online analysis; particulate matter; priority journal; radiation; secondary organic aerosol; simulation; temperature; wind speed; China; Japan; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063687991

Many Permian volcanic deposits of southwestern Gondwana (southern South America, southern Africa, West Antarctica and eastern Australia), however, remain to be accurately correlated to magmatic source regions along the active paleo-Pacific margin of Gondwana, and this lack of correlation limits our understanding of the timing and distribution of voluminous volcanism. Here we present detrital zircon U-Pb and Hf isotope data for Permian volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks from the Ellsworth Mountains, Pensacola Mountains, and the Ohio Range of central Antarctica in southwestern Gondwana used to determine their volcanic source along the paleo-Pacific margin of Gondwana. Rocks in central Antarctica record Permian (ca. 268 Ma) volcanism with a mean zircon εHfi of -0.04 ± 4.8 (2 standard deviation). Comparison of these zircon age and Hf data with compilations for adjacent regions along the Gondwana margin suggest derivation of the Antarctic zircons from a major episode of Permian explosive arc volcanism that is broadly synchronous with, and geochemically similar to, the voluminous Choiyoi Province in South America. This correlation also relates the source of synchronous volcaniclastic deposits in the Karoo Basin, South Africa, to the same major Permian volcanic episode associated with the Choiyoi Province. In aggregate, geochemical data from Permian zircon in central Antarctica support an along-arc variation in geochemistry, with isotopically enriched high-flux magmatism associated with thicker crust and lithospheric mantle in South America, and isotopically depleted magmatism and thinner crust and lithospheric mantle in Australia. The timing of inferred Choiyoi-related explosive arc volcanism recorded in the Antarctic sector, South African sector, and South American sector is contemporaneous with a documented increase in global arc flux, an increase in atmospheric CO2, a decrease in δ13C of benthic marine fossils, and mass extinction events. We suggest that the Choiyoi Province and correlated arc volcanism along the Gondwana margin contributed to increased global arc flux in the Permian leading to elevated background levels of atmospheric CO2 conducive to producing an environmental crisis during mafic large igneous province emplacement, and may serve as an example of continental arc outgassing exerting a first order control on climate. © 2019 The Authors.",,"Binary alloys; Carbon dioxide; Deposits; Explosives; Geochemistry; Global warming; Hafnium; Lead alloys; Sedimentary rocks; Silicate minerals; Uranium alloys; Volcanoes; Zircon; Environmental crisis; Isotopically enriched; Large igneous provinces; Lithospheric mantle; Mass extinction events; Paleo-Pacific margin of Gondwana; Southern south america; Volcaniclastic deposits; Volcanic rocks; continental arc; explosive volcanism; global warming; Gondwana; igneous province; Permian; tracking; volume; warming; zircon; Antarctica; East Antarctica; Ellsworth Mountains; Karoo; Ohio Range; Pensacola Mountains; South Africa; South America; Transantarctic Mountains; West Antarctica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066926196

It is shown that the use of such complex heat-recovery systems, due to the useful heat of exhaust-gases from boilers, provides a reduction in fuel consumption and, consequently, the volumes of harmful emissions generated during its combustion, by 8-12%, depending on the mode of operation of boilers during the heating period. The efficiency of using combustion-air humidifying in these installations to decrease the level of formation of nitrogen oxides in the combustion area of boilers is considered. It is also shown that the use of these systems provides a decrease emissions of nitrogen oxides to the environment by up to 60% by reducing the combustion temperature in the combustion area at moisture introduction with the combustion air and, as a result, suppression of formation these oxides during fuel combustion in boilers. The substantiation of the accuracy of the obtained calculated values of the levels of relative decrease of emissions of nitrogen oxides with the moisture introduction into the boiler by comparing them with experimental data is given.

It has become endemic in Lahore after its recent reemergence in 2016. This study investigates the impacts of climatic factors (temperature and rainfall) on DF transmission in the district of Lahore through statistical approaches. Initially, the climatic variability was explored using a time series analysis on climatic factors from 1970 to 2012. Furthermore, ordinary and multiple linear regression analyses were used to measure the simulating effect of climatic factors on dengue incidence from 2007 to 2012. The time series analysis revealed significant annual and monthly variability in climatic factors, which shaped a dengue-supporting environment. It also showed a positive temporal relationship between climatic factors and DF. Moreover, the regression analyses revealed a substantial monthly relationship between climatic factors and dengue incidence. The ordinary linear regression of rainfall versus dengue showed monthly R2 = 34.2%, whereas temperature versus dengue presented R2 = 38.0%. The multiple regression analysis showed a monthly significance of R2 = 44.6%. Consequently, our study shows a substantial synergism between dengue and climatic factors in Lahore. The present study could help in unveiling new ways for health prediction modeling of dengue and might be applicable in other subtropical and temperate climates. © 2019 by the authors.

The scenarios combine policies affecting urban land-use plans within the Cambridge Sub-Region of the UK, alongside technological changes within the projected vehicle fleet. Broadly, the scenarios consist of the ‘Trend’ for urban form policy and vehicle technology and the urban form policy options of ‘Planned expansion’, ‘Market-led development’ and ‘Urban compaction’, each combined with form-appropriate technological scenarios addressing the uptake of current, and future, technologies in the vehicle fleet. The framework developed for environmental assessment is described, from land-use transport interaction, through traffic assignment and emissions modelling, through to dispersion calculations. The urban form-vehicle technology combinations have been assessed in terms of overall vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT), greenhouse gas (CO 2 ) emissions, and local air quality (NO x , NO 2 , PM, HC). Results are presented for 2021 and show that overall network emissions change from −13% (Compaction) to +8% (Market-led) relative to the Trend, but effects on emissions in individual districts (NO x ) may much greater, −40% to +50%. Annual mean concentrations of NO 2 at the street level may vary by −7 to 8 μg/m 3 . The use of electric vehicles in the ‘Urban compaction’ scenario aids mitigation of air quality issues in the city centre. The results are discussed with respect to the feasibility of scenario implementation, current approaches to planning, and trends in vehicle technology. Limitations of the modelling framework are also identified, and future developments outlined. © 2019","Air quality; Policy options; Regional development; Transport emissions; Transport technology; Urban form","atmospheric pollution; emission control; future prospect; land use planning; regional development; transport vehicle; transportation technology; trend analysis; urban development; urban policy; Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]; Cambridgeshire; England; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062936754

Over the United States, atmospheric ammonia has seen an increasing trend due in most part to the declining SO2 and NOx emissions. We conduct the first comprehensive assessment of multiyear Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS)-Chem simulated ammonia concentration ([NH3]) over conterminous United States along with surface observations from all 90 National Atmospheric Deposition Program Ammonia Monitoring Network (AMoN) sites that have at least 2 years of continuous measurements. Model-simulated [NH3] is along empirically expected lines with regard to temporal trends, seasonal variations, and spatial distribution. GEOS-Chem-simulated [NH3], compared to AMoN observed values, has weighted average correlation (τ) of 0.50 ± 0.15 and mean fractional bias (MFB) of −8.8 ± 56%. Most sites (63 out of 90) have −60% &lt; MFB &lt; +60%. The deviations from observed values vary spatially and seasonally, and there is significant wintertime underestimation (−44 ± 58%) across most of conterminous United States (except the Pacific states). The largest positive deviations occur in the Pacific states (101 ± 46%) and the largest negative deviations in the Southern Plain states (−73 ± 39%) and the Mountain states (−73 ± 84%), both in the winter months. Over the Great Plains region, GEOS-Chem simulated [NH3] shows a much stronger dependence to emissions than AMoN observed [NH3], indicating scope for improved representation of emissions for the region. Over Southeast United States, there appears to be the strong effect of the changing emissions of SO2 and NOx in both modeled and observed [NH3]. ©2019. American Geophysical Union.

The study employs state-of-the-art analytical techniques to develop GHG emission inventory, its forecasting and preparing mitigation plan. The total carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2 e) emission was estimated at 41.26 million tonnes (Mt.) for the year 2014. The major contributors were power plants (46.8%), vehicles (29.7%), municipal solid waste burning (7.6%) and domestic cooking (6%). To achieve a continuous reduction, targets were set for two phases in the years, 2022 and 2030. The emissions were projected by considering growth in population, GDP, vehicles on the road and other activities; 63.64 (year 2022) and 79.19 (year 2030) Mt. tCO 2 e. The electricity consumption showed the highest increase followed by vehicles. Based on emission intensity (ratio of emission quantity to GDP), the target emission in the year 2030 was 54.74 Mt. tCO 2 e. The control-plan primarily comprised use of renewable sources, energy efficient devices and introduction of electric vehicles. Electricity generation by renewable sources (40% by 2030) could result in a reduction of 25.6 Mt. tCO 2 e (32% of tCO 2 e).

Pore fluid studies revealed a pattern of repeated fluid inputs, fluid diffusion, and methane and ethane accumulations, which represent “fluid anomalies” that disturb the fluid profiles. First-order reversal curve analysis, magnetic hysteresis, saturation isothermal remanent magnetization, and low-temperature remanence cycling reveal a detrital input dominated by vortex-state and multidomain magnetite, which passes through an initial stage of partial magnetite dissolution and greigite authigenesis in the upper few tens of meters. Progressive magnetic mineral diagenesis comprises the continued loss of fine-grained magnetite and gradual pyritization of greigite and produces a background logarithmic decrease in saturation isothermal remanent magnetization normalized by magnetic susceptibility. This process implies a continuing slow supply of S2− to depths &gt;1,500 m. Thermally driven diagenesis, which would cause extensive loss of greigite at these depths, does not appear to be significant here. Multidomain magnetite grains dominate the magnetic mineralogy in the deepest part of the sequence, but some single-domain magnetite survives as inclusions in silicates. Fluid anomalies representing sulfate influx drive locally renewed greigite authigenesis, as do methane and ethane accumulations. In some cases, where methane is accompanied by H2S (“sour gas”), fine-grained greigite is converted to pyrite. We term these multiple episodes of enhanced magnetic mineral alteration “punctuated magnetic mineral diagenesis.” Despite both progressive and punctuated magnetic mineral diagenesis, enough depositional remanence survives to allow recognition of the magnetostratigraphy to 1,320 m below seafloor. ©2019.

A forward-facing MATLAB/Simulink powertrain model was used to develop a rule-based deterministic control system for a post-transmission parallel hybrid urban bus. The control strategy targeted areas where conventional powertrains are typically less efficient, focused on improving fuel economy and emissions without boosting vehicle performance. Stored electrical energy is deployed to assist the IC engine system leading to an overall reduction in fuel consumption while maintaining vehicle performance at a level comparable with baseline conventional IC engine operation. Regenerative braking is integrated with the existing braking systems on the vehicle, and the control system tailored to maximise the amount of energy recuperated during deceleration events and accelerator pedal lift off without adversely impacting on the normal behaviour of the vehicle. The control system was implemented on both prototype single (Streetlite) and double-deck (Streetdeck) vehicle configurations for real vehicle testing with partner Wrightbus. The hybridisation has reduced equivalent CO2 emissions by 34% (single-deck)/ 35% (double-deck) over the conventional Euro VI diesel vehicle on the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership UK bus cycle (based on London Bus Route 159). These results compare favourably with alternative powertrain technologies currently available with similar certification. Moreover, the next generation hybrid urban bus has several distinct advantages as it is less restricted by infrastructure, range, or terrain issues, and has a comparatively lower purchase price point. Hybrid bus technologies offer the option of maintaining existing service levels without significant modifications to operations or budgets while achieving significant reductions in average fleet emissions. © 2019 Queen's University Belfast; Wrightbus.

Recent charge-exchange calculations show that cross sections from excited deuterium (n = 2, 3) with He+ are over 4-orders of magnitude higher than those from the ground state (n = 1) and occur at very low energies where they are more likely to interact with the thermal He+ ions introduced by ionization of the diagnostic helium gas-puff injection. Higher densities of excited deuterium are typically present in the Scrape-Off Layer (SOL), divertor, and edge regions of tokamaks, where the LIF and THB helium diagnostics are typically used for nHeI and simultaneous determination of electron temperatures and densities and where contributions from charge-exchange emission may offset these values if not taken into account. The analysis presented in this work shows that due to the higher density of deuterium in the ground rather than in excited states and the divergent behavior of deuterium and He+ density profiles along the SOL and edge regions, the deuterium-He+ charge-exchange contributions to the helium puff emission are 3-orders of magnitude lower than those from electron-impact excitation. Similar plasma conditions are expected in the ITER divertor, with the exception that in the area near the strike-points and targets, the electron temperature is not high enough to excite from the ground state but deuterium, electron, and He+ densities are high enough to dominate the emission from charge-exchange and recombination. These findings strengthen the assumption made in the present line-ratio model that helium emission from gas-puff into plasma is mainly dominated by electron-excitation. It is also shown that, in general, charge-exchange helium emission is 2-orders of magnitude higher than the emission due to recombination. These findings suggest the importance of including charge-exchange processes as a source of neutrals in ionic fractional abundance calculations in plasmas and helium-ash transport modeling in fusion reactors. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Charge transfer; Deuterium; Electrons; Excited states; Fluorescence; Gas generators; Ground state; Impact ionization; Ion exchange; Ionization of gases; Laser beam effects; Laser optics; Laser produced plasmas; Magnetoplasma; Nuclear reactors; Sols; Charge exchange process; Collisional radiative model; Divergent behaviors; Electron excitations; Electron-impact excitation; Laser induced fluorescence; Simultaneous determinations; Transport modeling; Electron temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067245018

However, the nature and evolution of existing policy mixes that underlie NDCs remain poorly understood. This critical issue has emerged from the outcomes of the Talanoa Dialogue for Climate Ambition, where little progress was made in building a comprehensive, evidence-based foundation for effective climate policy. To a large extent, this is due to the nature of the process, and a lack of data related to policy interventions in the pre-2020 period, notably their composition, coverage, and orientation. We seek to address these shortcomings by applying a directed content analysis to a dataset of national and city-level policy interventions. The aim is to quantify the nature and evolution of policy efforts that promote the adoption of low-carbon energy technologies (LCETs) globally. Fifteen databases, containing more than 10,000 policies and measures were reviewed. Our findings highlight the rapid spread of policy portfolios and an international convergence towards economic incentives (notably subsidies). At the city level, technology and infrastructure policies dominate. However, it is unclear to what extent behavioural factors (i.e., cognitive, motivational and contextual aspects) that affect the choice and use of LCETs are taken into account in policy design. This is particularly important because studies that model the feasibility of the 1.5 °C target reveal behavioural changes and the rapid adoption of low-carbon lifestyles as critical enabling factors. In response to the outcomes from the Talanoa Dialogue, we argue that policymakers need to go beyond stringent policy mixes and rapidly re-think their traditional economic-driven policymaking approach. Far more attention needs to be given to behavioural factors when designing, evaluating and implementing LCET policies. © 2019 The Author(s).

However, reliable rainfall measurements are not always available, making it necessary to predict rainfall values for particular locations through time. Predicting rainfall in space and time can be a complex and challenging task, especially where the rain gauge network is sparse and measurements are not recorded consistently for all rain gauges, leading to many missing values. Here, we develop a flexible Bayesian model for predicting rainfall in space and time and apply it to Narok County, situated in southwestern Kenya, using data collected at 23 rain gauges from 1965 to 2015. Narok County encompasses the Maasai Mara ecosystem, the northern-most section of the Mara–Serengeti ecosystem, famous for its diverse and abundant large mammal populations and spectacular migration of enormous herds of wildebeest, zebra and Thomson’s gazelle. The model incorporates geographical and meteorological predictor variables, including elevation, distance to Lake Victoria and minimum temperature. Salient features of our model are the use of non-stationary covariance structures and the facility to handle excess zeros and many missing observations. We assess the efficiency of the model by comparing it empirically with the established Gaussian process, Kriging, simple linear and Bayesian linear models. We use the model to predict total monthly rainfall and its standard error for all 5 × 5 km grid cells in Narok County for each year from 1965 to 2015. Using the Monte Carlo integration method, we estimate seasonal and annual rainfall and their standard errors for 29 sub-regions of Narok for each of the 51 years spanning 1965–2015. The non-stationary model can handle data from a sparse network of observations with many missing values and performs at least as well as or better than four established and widely used models on the Narok rainfall data set. The model produces rainfall predictions consistent with expectation and in good agreement with blended station and satellite rainfall values. The predictions are precise enough for most practical purposes. The model is very general and applicable to other variables besides rainfall.

A primary household survey has been conducted to collect data on socio-demographic profile, livelihood strategy, health, food, water, social network, natural disaster and climate variation indicators, were selected for Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) and Livelihood Vulnerability Index-Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (LVI-IPCC) analyses to measure and compare the vulnerability of mouzas (administrative unit) currently suffering from frequent flooding, coastal erosion and embankment breaching on an annual basis. Secondary data collected from the Indian Meteorological Department, the Water Resources Information System of India and the Global Sea Level Observing System have been used to identify dynamics of climate change by employing statistical and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. A GPS survey has been conducted to identify locations of embankment breaching, and satellite images obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and U.S. Geological Survey (NASA USGS) Government website have been applied to shoreline and land use change detection, using a supervised maximum likelihood classification. The results indicate that the study area has experienced increasing temperature, changing precipitation patterns, rise in sea level, higher storm surges, shoreline change, constant land loss, embankment breaching and changing land use, which have had impact on vulnerability, particularly of poorer people. The LVI (0.48 to 0.68) and LVI-IPCC (0.04 to 0.14) scores suggest that the populations of Dhablat, Bankimnagar, Sumatinagar, Muri Ganga and Sibpur mouzas are highly vulnerable (LVI scores of 0.60 to 0.68 and LVI-IPCC scores of 0.11 to 0.14) to climate change both because the communities are more exposed to it, and because poor access to food, health facilities and water makes them extremely sensitive to it and lowers their adaptive capacity. The findings of this study could be crucial to framing further development and adaptation strategies relating to climate change, and to safeguarding the estuarine ecosystem and the vulnerable population. © 2019, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adaptation strategies; climate change; estuarine ecosystem; livelihood vulnerability index (LVI); vulnerable population","climate change; embankment; estuarine ecosystem; GIS; GPS; household survey; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; livelihood; local adaptation; maximum likelihood analysis; satellite imagery; strategic approach; vulnerability; India; Sagar Island; West Bengal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066119865

Higher PM levels for short time periods and lower ozone (O3) levels were present due to meteorological and mountain valley conditions. Nitrogenous pollutants were relatively strongly correlated with PM variables. Diurnal cycles of NOx, O3, and fine PM(PM 2.5) (aerodynamic diameter &lt;2.5 μm [PM2.5]) suggested formation from NOx. O3 levels increased from early morning into midafternoon, and NOx and PM2.5 increased throughout the morning, followed by sharp decreases. Toluene/benzene and xylenes/benzene ratios and VOC correlations with nitrogenous and PM species were indicative of local traffic sources. Wind sector comparisons suggested that pollutant levels were lower when winds were from nearby mountains to the east versus winds from northerly or southerly origins. Implications: The Cache Valley in Idaho and Utah has been designated a PM2.5 nonattainment area that has been attributed to air pollution buildup during winter stagnation events. To inform state implementation plans for PM2.5 in Cache Valley and other PM2.5 nonattainment areas in Utah, a state and multiagency federal research effort known as the UWFPS was conducted in winter 2017. As part of the UWFPS, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) measured ground-based PM species and their precursors, VOCs, and meteorology in Logan, Utah. Results reported here from the EPA study in Logan provide additional understanding of wintertime air pollution conditions and possible sources of PM and gaseous pollutants as well as being useful for future PM control strategies in this area. © 2019, This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

This study, in contrast, explores timber supply in a multi-disciplinary approach that analyses contextual factors and expands the space of future forest management options. Methodological steps include: (i) participatory development of qualitative scenarios, following different trajectories of contextual factors affecting forest management; (ii) identification of forest management programmes at the stand level; and (iii) modelling and economic assessment of future flows of timber at the landscape level. This research is carried out in a case study area (CSA) in central Lithuania containing 37,000 ha of forest, of which 80% is under state ownership. The development of forest resources was simulated for four contextualised scenarios: Business as Usual, Efficiency and Reforms, Ecology, and Climate Change Mitigation. Six forest-management programs were constructed together with stakeholders to describe the behaviour of state forest managers and private forest owners under each scenario. All four scenarios led to increased timber supply, largely due to the high proportion of middle-aged and premature stands in current forests. Notably, the present-day approach of rigid area control prioritises a steady timber supply through an evener age-class structure but largely fails on the last point. Our scenario analysis shows that relaxation of legislative requirements not only leads to increased long-term contribution to economic welfare but also enables achievement of evener age-class distributions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Economic assessment; Forest management; Modelling; Scenarios","Climate change; Models; Timber; Age-class structures; Class distributions; Climate change mitigation; Economic assessments; Legislative requirements; Multi-disciplinary approach; Private forest owners; Scenarios; Forestry; Area; Control Systems; Development; Forest Management; Forestry; Lithuania; Models; Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040698504

Blue Corridors are routes that aim to enable the use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for heavy vehicles as a substitute to Diesel oil. Therefore, this work proposes four scenarios for a Blue Corridor in the State of São Paulo and analyzes its environmental and economic impacts. The results are presented in cartographical figures and show that LNG costs up to 40% less than diesel, while reducing CO 2 equivalent emissions by up to 5.2%. Particulate matter (PM) emissions are reduced by 88%, nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 75% and hydrocarbon emissions are eliminated. However, despite the economic and environmental advantages presented in the results of this study, LNG still faces regulatory barriers that must be addressed in order to allow its widespread use in the transportation sector. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Blue Corridor; Cost assessment; GHG and pollutant emissions; Liquefied natural gas; State of São Paulo (Brazil)","Gas emissions; Gas fuel purification; Greenhouse gases; Liquefied natural gas; Natural gas vehicles; Nitrogen oxides; Blue Corridor; Cost assessment; Environmental and economic impacts; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Particulate matter emissions; Pollutant emission; Social and environmental; Sustainable transportation systems; Natural gas transportation; carbon dioxide; diesel fuel; hydrocarbon; liquefied natural gas; methane; nitrogen oxide; nitrous oxide; carbon emission; cost analysis; economic impact; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; liquefied natural gas; pollutant; transportation system; air pollutant; Article; Brazil; combustion; controlled study; cost benefit analysis; environmental economics; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; exhaust gas; greenhouse gas; liquefaction; motor vehicle; particulate matter; priority journal; traffic and transport; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062710078

As a result, improved stoves are often only used alongside traditional technologies, or are rejected by cooks entirely, and may fall short in efforts to address health and environmental problems even if they are technically capable of doing so. A testing protocol for cookstove usability was developed by the authors to help stove designers and implementers evaluate user needs for a given stove technology and cooking culture, and balance them with technical design criteria more effectively. The protocol is based on established usability practices and includes ethnographic testing methods to increase validity in cross-cultural testing applications. This paper discusses evaluative trials of the protocol in 10 rural and urban households and 2 institutional kitchens near Lira, Uganda, 4 rural households in Antigua, Guatemala, and 11 stove designs in a US laboratory, as well as preliminary results from a usability study on 20 rural households near Gulu, Uganda by an international NGO. These trials, along with feedback from test administrators in Uganda and Guatemala, demonstrated that the protocol is a viable tool for increasing the understanding of cookstove usability, though more work is needed to improve its validity and connect the results to effective stove design and selection decisions, as well as health and environmental impact. As a result of this research, various improvements were made to the protocol, and opportunities for further validation, expansion, and improvement were identified. In addition, methods used by the protocol elicited related data from participants regarding their attitudes towards improved cookstoves and the relative importance of reducing air pollution and fuel use in the larger context of their lives. Finally, this research highlights the value of an interdisciplinary approach, in this case based in anthropology and engineering, to increase the accessibility of user input in international development more broadly. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Ethnographic; Evaluation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062958111

China has pledged to reduce CO2 intensity by 60–65% in 2030 relative to 2005 and to stop the increase in absolute CO2 emissions around 2030. In this series of studies, we enhance the MIT Economic Projection and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model to include the latest assessments of the costs of power generation technologies in China to evaluate the impacts of different potential ETS pathways on deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. This paper reports the results from baseline scenarios where power generation prices are assumed to be homogeneous across the country for a given mode of generation. We find that there are different pathways where CCS might play an important role in reducing the emission intensity in China's electricity sector, especially for low carbon intensity targets consistent with the ultimate goals of the Paris Agreement. Uncertainty about the exact technology mix suggests that decision makers should be wary of picking winning technologies, and should instead seek to provide incentives for emission reductions. While it will be challenging to meet the CO2 intensity target of 550 g/kWh for the electric power sector by 2020, multiple pathways exist for achieving lower targets over a longer timeframe. Our initial analysis shows that carbon prices of 35–40$/tCO2 make CCS technologies on coal-based generation cost-competitive against other modes of generation and that carbon prices higher than 100$/tCO2 favor a major expansion of CCS. The next step is to confirm these initial results with more detailed modeling that takes into account granularity across China's energy sector at the provincial level. © 2019","Carbon capture; Carbon Price; China; Emissions trading; General equilibrium","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Decision making; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Carbon price; China; China's electricities; Emissions Trading; Emissions Trading Scheme; General equilibrium; Power generation technology; Carbon capture; carbon sequestration; decision making; emission control; emissions trading; energy market; environmental economics; general equilibrium analysis; incentive; pollution tax; power generation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067228045

The larvae of several lycaenid butterfly species that exhibit obligate associations with specific ant species have been reported to use chemical mimicry. However, little is known about the strategies used by the larvae of species that have facultative associations with multiple ant species. We attempted to reveal the effects of larval CHC profiles on interactions with Formica japonica workers, using three lycaenid species, two facultative ant-associated (Lycaeides argyrognomon and Zizeeria maha) and one non-ant-associated (Lycaena phlaeas), which commonly possess n-alkanes as the major CHCs. In field bioassays, the lycaenid larvae were attacked by ant workers less often than larvae of Papilio polytes (Papilionidae), the CHCs of which were rich in 7-alkenes. Treating the lycaenid larvae with 7-heptacosene and 9-heptacosene significantly activated ant aggression (biting), whereas treating them with n-heptacosane, n-octacosane and 13-methylheptacosane had little effect. Furthermore, larvae of Pieris rapae (Pieridae), possessing n-alkanes as the dominant CHCs, suffered an intermediate level of ant biting between the lycaenid and Pa. polytes larvae. However, treatments of the P. rapae larvae with 7-heptacosene and 9-heptacosene significantly affected the frequency of ant biting. These findings suggest that the absence of alkenes in larval CHC profiles is an effective means of circumventing predation by ants and allows lycaenid larvae to inhabit the foraging territory of predaceous ants, at least to some extent. © 2019 The Entomological Society of Japan","alkene; ant association; biting behavior; cuticular hydrocarbon; Lycaenidae",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061800537

Over the past century, vehicular passenger transport has experienced hypergrowth in terms of task, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. For a variety of reasons, future decades may well see a significantly reduced global passenger transport task, as well as a widespread phasing-out of internal combustion engine vehicles, especially in cities. In contrast, the global freight transport task is unlikely to decline much, and could even grow, so that freight transport will dominate total transport energy use. Even if the world does finally respond seriously to climate change, likely policies will not favour hydrogen for private passenger vehicles for many decades. Nevertheless, hydrogen has clear superiority over electric vehicles for heavy freight transport. Given this advantage, it may be desirable to promote hydrogen for freight well before large amounts of renewable hydrogen are available from surplus intermittent renewable energy electricity. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Electric vehicles; Freight transport; Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles; Passenger transport; Renewable energy","Climate change; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Petroleum prospecting; Vehicles; Freight transport; Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Passenger transport; Passenger vehicles; Renewable energies; Renewable hydrogens; Transport energy; Freight transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065896067

Forests annually sequester large quantities of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and store carbon above and below ground for long periods of time. Intact forests—largely free from human intervention except primarily for trails and hazard removals—are the most carbon-dense and biodiverse terrestrial ecosystems, with additional benefits to society and the economy. Internationally, focus has been on preventing loss of tropical forests, yet U.S. temperate and boreal forests remove sufficient atmospheric CO2 to reduce national annual net emissions by 11%. U.S. forests have the potential for much more rapid atmospheric CO2 removal rates and biological carbon sequestration by intact and/or older forests. The recent 1.5 Degree Warming Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change identifies reforestation and afforestation as important strategies to increase negative emissions, but they face significant challenges: afforestation requires an enormous amount of additional land, and neither strategy can remove sufficient carbon by growing young trees during the critical next decade(s). In contrast, growing existing forests intact to their ecological potential—termed proforestation—is a more effective, immediate, and low-cost approach that could be mobilized across suitable forests of all types. Proforestation serves the greatest public good by maximizing co-benefits such as nature-based biological carbon sequestration and unparalleled ecosystem services such as biodiversity enhancement, water and air quality, flood and erosion control, public health benefits, low impact recreation, and scenic beauty. © Copyright © 2019 Moomaw, Masino and Faison.","afforestation; biodiversity crisis; biological carbon sequestration; forest ecosystem; old-growth forest; Pinchot; reforestation; second-growth forest",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077160020

This work suggests a resolutive and robust multiphase discharge model suited for matching all expected CO2 discharge mechanisms. The application to real scale CO2 pipelines shows an essential incidence of the pipeline geometry (length and internal diameter) as well as of the orifice size on the release features. Wider thermal dynamics and enlarged solid contents are expected in short pipelines subjected to large ruptures. The resulting expansion transformations are characterized by increasing degrees of reversibility. Results show that expected solid content may amount up to 45% on a mass basis under usual carbon sequestration operative conditions. The latter, being linked to the initial CO2 aggregation state, play a key role in determining the whole discharge dynamics especially because of the effects of phase change mechanisms. A peculiar mass flow rate discharge profile is observed depending on the occurrence of liquid-vapor and solid-vapor mixtures. Specific set of geometric and operative conditions allow for the applicability of the isothermal bulk hypothesis and negligible wall effect in heat transfer mechanisms. Main governing parameters are the ratio between the pipeline length and internal diameter L/D and that between the orifice and the internal pipeline diameter d/D. Essential in driving the QRA procedure is the occurrence of the solid phase in rapid depressurizations that is expected only for pipeline shorter than 1500 m subjected to d/D &gt; 0.30.

It is also a cause of excess nutrients that make their way to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. To address unsustainable changes to biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functions, a multidisciplinary approach involving social science, natural science, and engineering is often effective. Given the potential of second-generation biofuels, and capitalizing on the deep-rooted perennial bioenergy crops capable of thriving in poor soils, we demonstrated an integrated socio-environmental analysis of the impacts of growing switchgrass within row-crop landscapes in Illinois. In this study, we model land use scenarios that incorporate switchgrass as a biofuel crop in a Midwest corn-belt watershed using the Soil Water Assessment Tool coupled with an economic analysis for the Vermilion Basin in Illinois. We estimated the values of ecosystem services under an alternative bioenergy landscape, including commodity and bioenergy crops, changes in biogeochemistry, and recreational services. The estimated annual values of nitrate and sediment reduction attributed to bioenergy crops range from $38 million to $97 million and $16,000 to $197,000, respectively. The annual value of carbon dioxide emission reduction ranges from $1.8 million to $6.1 million based on the initial crop rotation pattern. Estimated average annual values for wildlife viewing, water-based recreation, and pheasant hunting are $1.24 million, $0.17 million, and $0.3 million, respectively. To our knowledge, this study represents the first effort to comprehensively quantify ecosystem services using a process-based model, and estimate their value in an alternative bioenergy landscape. The information we generate could aid in understanding the potential for biomass production from marginal land and the total economic value of the landscape at various spatial scales. The framework is useful in fostering alternative bioenergy landscapes with synergies in a food, energy, and conservation nexus. © 2019 The Authors.

For such simulation codes, where bit-for-bit comparisons are too restrictive, finding the source of statistically significant discrepancies (e.g., from a previous version, alternative hardware or supporting software stack) in output is non-trivial at best. Although there are many tools for program comprehension through debugging or slicing, few (if any) scale to a model as large as the Community Earth System Model (CESM™), which consists of more than 1.5 million lines of Fortran code. Currently for the CESM, we can easily determine whether a discrepancy exists in the output using a by now well-established statistical consistency testing tool. However, this tool provides no information as to the possible cause of the detected discrepancy, leaving developers in a seemingly impossible (and frustrating) situation. Therefore, our aim in this work is to provide the tools to enable developers to trace a problem detected through the CESM output to its source. To this end, our strategy is to reduce the search space for the root cause(s) to a tractable size via a series of techniques that include creating a directed graph of internal CESM variables, extracting a subgraph (using a form of hybrid program slicing), partitioning into communities, and ranking nodes by centrality. Runtime variable sampling then becomes feasible in this reduced search space. We demonstrate the utility of this process on multiple examples of CESM simulation output by illustrating how sampling can be performed as part of an efficient parallel iterative refinement procedure to locate error sources, including sensitivity to CPU instructions. By providing CESM developers with tools to identify and understand the reason for statistically distinct output, we have positively impacted the CESM software development cycle and, in particular, its focus on quality assurance. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Abstract syntax tree; Community detection; Eigenvector centrality; Graph analysis; Program slicing; Root cause analysis","Climate models; Computer software; Directed graphs; Iterative methods; Quality assurance; Software design; Trees (mathematics); Well testing; Abstract Syntax Trees; Community detection; Eigenvector centralities; Graph analysis; Program slicing; Root cause analysis; Program debugging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069232816

This article presents one of the first empirical analyses of adaptation to flooding on a global scale. Using a sample of 97 countries between 1985 and 2010, we investigate the extent and pattern of flood adaptation by estimating the effects of a country's climatological risk, recent flood experiences, and socioeconomic characteristics on its flood-related fatalities. Our results provide mixed evidence on adaptation: countries facing greater long-term climatological flooding risks do not necessarily adapt better and suffer fewer fatalities; however, after controlling for the cross-country heterogeneity, we find that more recent flooding shocks have a significant and negative effect on fatalities from subsequent floods. These findings may suggest the short-term learning dynamics of adaptation and potential inefficacy of earlier flood control measures, particularly those that promote increased exposure in floodplains.

Focusing on the distributional impacts of energy taxes is too narrow a framework. The United States relies much more heavily on regulation than taxation to address energy-related market failures. It argues that most regulatory policies and tax subsidies to achieve energy policy goals are regressive. This includes fuel economy standards, EV purchase incentives, and energy efficiency tax incentives. In contrast, a carbon tax is likely to be progressive, even when ignoring the use of revenue. The view that carbon taxes are regressive stems from an incomplete distributional analysis that assumes all impacts arise from increases in the costs of consumer goods and services. Recent analyses have emphasized the importance of impacts on sources of income. In particular, a carbon tax is likely to reduce returns to capital more than wages. With capital disproportionately held by higher income households, this differential factor income effect is progressive. In addition, transfer income, more important for lower income households, tends to be indexed and so contributes to a carbon tax's progressivity. How carbon tax revenue is used can add even greater progressivity to a carbon tax reform. © 2019","Climate policy; Distribution; Energy policy; Regulation; Taxation","Carbon; Economics; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Fuel economy; Climate policy; Differential factors; Distribution; Energy related markets; Fuel-economy standards; Regulation; Regulatory policies; U.S. energy policy; Taxation; energy policy; environmental policy; incentive; pollution tax; regulatory framework; subsidy system; survey; tax system; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062707293

Unfortunately, the efficiency of the urban freight system is hampered by urban distribution issues such as congestion, regulatory measures, noise pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and so on. Hence the need for actions and good practices for the management of urban freight transport. These actions deal with the management of goods deliveries as well as return flows. Urban logistics solutions are diverse and concern the storage and organization of urban transport. Urban warehousing actions are divided into four categories. The Urban Consolidation Centers (UCC), a kind of mutualization platform located on the outskirts of the city center. Proximity Logistics Spaces (PLS) which are small platforms that allow a temporary storage of goods and have clean vehicles ensuring the last meters. Afterwards the Veh]icle Reception Points (VRP) where city center's actors offer a storage capacity of their own store and it is the consumer who moves for recovering its packages, and finally the Urban Logistics Boxes (ULB) which are mobile or fixed structures located at a street level, which allow temporary storage of goods. These Urban Logistics Spaces lead to the improvement of the flow of goods by favoring clean vehicles. The objective of this article is to study the different solutions of urban logistics, based on the literature, to make a comparative study of the development of urban logistics solutions in emerging cities comparable to Casablanca, to synthesize the experiments implemented by these cities and thus to lead an investigation on different urban solutions in a national context. © 2019 IEEE.","Benchmarking; Good practices; Mutualization; Urban Freight Transport; Urban logistics","Benchmarking; Freight transportation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Noise pollution; Supply chain management; Urban planning; Comparative studies; Good practices; Mutualization; Temporary storage; Urban consolidation; Urban distribution; Urban freight transport; Urban logistics; Urban transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076048770

This paper examines how lobbying spending on the Waxman–Markey bill, the most prominent and promising United States climate regulation so far, altered its likelihood of being implemented. We combine data from comprehensive United States lobbying records with an empirical method for forecasting the policy’s effect on the value of publicly listed firms. Our statistical analysis suggests that lobbying by firms expecting losses from the policy was more effective than lobbying by firms expecting gains. Interpreting this finding through a game-theoretic model, we calculate that lobbying lowered the probability of enacting the Waxman–Markey bill by 13 percentage points, representing an expected social cost of US$60 billion (in 2018 US dollars).

The aim of this research is to quantify the emissions of natural volatile organic compounds produced by the forest species: Eucalyptus globulus L., Pinus radiata and Alnus acuminata in Riobamba, Ecuador. Methods: Identification of plant coverings in the years 2014 and 2017was performed using geographic information systems tools, complemented with the application of the Guenther model for the calculation of monoterpenes and other organic volatile compounds; thus, to analyze the relationship between meteorological variables and concentrations of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen dioxide per species. Results: Mathematical calculation of emissions in Riobamba showed that Eucalyptus globulus L. registered higher emissions in the years 2014-2017, followed by Pinus radiata and Alnus acuminata. These emissions are due to the vegetation cover covering each species. The analysis of volatile organic compounds in forest plantations in air is directly related to the emissions represented in the environment and correlated with the meteorological variables of temperature, global solar radiation and wind velocity. The proposed method manages to estimate concentrations of monoterpenes and volatile organic compounds for the two examined seasons, presenting the influence of the species introduced in this study such as Eucalyptus globulus L. and Pinus radiata, with a reduction in their emissions (less area found in the year 2017, with respect to 2014). However, the emission of Alnus acuminata can be quantified only in 2017, since in 2014 no records of this species were found.

The current study examines further potential of Bayesian inversion on-site X-ray computerized tomography (CT) in producing quantifiable digital representations of core samples. To that end, workflows using 3D tomographic images depict (1) rock heterogeneity, (2) lithological changes, (3) bedding planes, (4) fractures and nodules, and (5) scale of heterogeneity by quantifying porosity regions. In so doing, this wellsite-based analysis AIDS in accelerating an informed assessment of whole round core and plug-sample locations for laboratory analysis. Additionally, earlier first-stage core analysis, promotes timely core-log integration and can significantly improve efficiency of subsequent laboratory sampling and analysis programs. Considering carbonate core samples with complex pore topology, images stemming from Bayesian inversion yield estimates of image-detectable macroporosity within 8% relative to those from customary medical tomograms and depict similar distribution of vugs and angular bedding. Moreover, further appraisal of the performance of the proposed imaging technique, in the presence of multiphase saturation, considers a micro-CT of an oil-bearing carbonate after waterflooding. The intent is to confirm availability of a consistent CT method across scales, and its relevance to whole-core imaging in situations of sponge coring or filtrate invasion.

This paper presents a comprehensive approach for electrification projects applied to this sort of equipment, including the technical feasibility study for an existing tractor backhoe loader in a real work cycle. For the hybrid proposal, besides the gain of having the internal combustion engine near its maximum efficiency point with the addition of an energy storage device, the electrification approach includes the improvement of the hydraulic system operation by adding a variable speed drive, which reduces the losses due continuous oil flow recirculation presented on the conventional model. The methodology involves modeling of the conventional system and the design and modeling of the proposed hybrid system. Both models are submitted to experimental data gathered from real work cycle for analysis and comparison. A supercapacitor is considered as the energy storage device for this application due the low amount of energy required and high frequency of charge and discharge cycles.

Efficiency models, material metrics, and current research are discussed for thermoelectrics, thermionics, laser-coolers, and modern technologies. Then, we discuss nonequilibrium optical phonon harvest in the phonovoltaic cell. We make an effort to distinguish between the harvest of equilibrium heat, or thermal-electricity, and the targetted harvest of a particular nonequilibrium phonon mode, or phonoelectricity. We survey the state of phonovoltaic research, focusing on phonovoltaic materials, the electron-phonon coupling, and entropy production in a phonovoltaic cell. Throughout this review, discussions are connected to the electron and phonon structures, interactions, and transport. The modern thermal-electric harvesters are shown to reshape broad-spectrum, high-entropy heat into a narrow-spectrum of low-entropy emissions in order to efficiently generate thermal-electricity. Phonoelectricity, in contrast, intervenes before a low-entropy population of nonequilibrium optical phonons becomes high-entropy heat. In particular, the phonovoltaic cell generates phonoelectricity by utilizing the nonequilibrium, low-entropy, and high temperature optical phonon population produced by, e.g., the relaxation of electrons excited by an electric field. A phonovoltaic material has an ultranarrow electronic bandgap, such that the hot optical phonon population can relax by producing electron-hole pairs (and power) instead of multiple acoustic phonons (and entropy). The phonovoltaic device has an electric diode, e.g., a p-n junction, such that the internal electric field of the diode splits the electrons and holes in order to produce an electric current, and thus, power. The low entropy and high-temperature of the nonequilibrium optical phonon population enable efficient, in-situ heat harvesting. Bilayer graphene, for example, can theoretically convert the nonequilibrium population of optical phonons generated in a field-effect transistor into electricity with an efficiency exceeding 70% of the Carnot limit. The thermal-electric devices, in contrast, are either inefficient or restricted to ex-situ power generation. Furthermore, as the phonoelectric Carnot limit is defined by the local nonequilibrium between electron and optical phonon populations, rather than the spatial nonequilibrium across the device, the Carnot limit can be very large without inducing melting. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Efficiency; Electron-phonon interactions; Electrons; Entropy; Field effect transistors; Graphene transistors; Plasma diagnostics; Semiconductor junctions; Electron hole pairs; Electron phonon couplings; Electronic band gaps; Electrons and holes; Internal electric fields; Modern technologies; Nonequilibrium phonons; Thermal electricity; Electric field effects",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064399451

This study quantifies the variations in the outdoor thermal profile of built forms in a heterogeneous urban area. A two-step process was adopted to quantify built form induced heat stress. The build form typologies referred to as Urban Built Form (UBF X ) were clustered based on parameterised build form indices (sky view factor, built height etc.) using statistical data reduction. The heat stress of the categorised UBFs was then examined through field measurements and radiation simulation model. Variations in thermal variables were assessed using three indices - Cooling Potential (CP), Humidex (Hx) and Mean Radiant Temperature (Tmrt) that collectively define the thermal profile of each UBF. A novel Heat Stress Risk Index (HSRI) was conceptualised and computed to represent the aggregate risk of a particular UBF towards heat stress. It was found that among the UBFs, the medium-rise compact (UBF 4) show lowest rate of cooling, exposure to high Tmrt, and high discomfort levels throughout the day and therefore exhibit thermally stressed profile. High rise-open typologies (UBF1) have high Tmrt and Hx during the noon (12:00 to 14:00 h), but their high cooling potential reduces the thermal impact of its built form during the cooling hours (18:00 to 20:00 h). Three thermal indices provide varied aspects of thermal performance of UBFs and HSRI cumulatively represents the heat stress risk of the UBFs. This study is a proof of concept, that uses empirical evidence to demonstrate thermal variations in urban built forms during calm and clear weather conditions. Results indicate the significance of built form indices as a policy variable for framing climate sensitive urban development regulations that aim to achieve a thermally efficient built environment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cooling potential; Heat stress risk; Thermal index; Thermal performance; Urban built form","Urban growth; Cooling potential; Field measurement; Heat stress; Mean radiant temperature; Thermal index; Thermal Performance; Thermal variation; Urban environments; Thermal stress; conceptual framework; cooling; empirical analysis; heating; parameterization; regulatory framework; risk factor; urban area; urban development; urban planning; article; built environment; climate; cooling; heat stress; height; high temperature; human; proof of concept; radiation; simulation; urban area; weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062959354

This increased responsibilisation of citizens has implications for the roles of governments. The degree of government involvement does not necessarily decline, but government roles may need to shift: from a regulating and steering government towards a more collaborative and responsive government that enables and facilitates community initiatives that are self-governed by citizens. However, we lack a conceptual understanding of such new government roles, as well as empirical insights into how local governments participate in citizens' initiatives and how they take up such new roles. In this paper, a “ladder of government participation” is introduced, which is used to explore the roles of local governments in citizens' initiatives for climate change adaptation in the Netherlands. The results show that local governments are slowly but gradually shifting towards more networking, stimulating, and facilitating roles. Key concerns of local practitioners are (a) a lack of flexibility and support of their own municipal organisation to facilitate citizens' initiatives, (b) uncertainty about the continuity of citizens' initiatives over time, and (c) a potential increase of inequity among citizen groups resulting from facilitating citizens' initiatives. An important finding is that the roles of local governments tend to be flexible, in that they can move from one role to the other over time for one and the same citizens' initiative depending on its stage of development, as well as take up several roles simultaneously for different citizens' initiatives. © 2019 The Authors.

One of the well-established technologies for CO2 capture is the amine-based post-combustion CO2 capture. During the CO2 capture process, amines have been found to undergo nitrosation, producing nitramines and nitrosamines, which are potentially carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic. Investigations on the formation of nitrosamines, nitramines and their destruction are at the state of the art for amine-based post-combustion CO2 capture technology. However, significant literature is available on this issue based on water treatment practices. Nitrosamines are more potent carcinogenic than nitramines. Whereas, nitramines are more stable than nitrosamines. Formation of nitrosamines through post-combustion CO2 capture within the process operating premises is mainly a function of NOx content in flue gas. Moreover, other contaminants like SOx and chlorine (Cl) also affect nitrosamines formation. Atmospheric formation of nitrosamines and nitramines is due to loss of amine to the environment through aerosols, amines mist, and amine vapors. All the available technologies for the elimination of nitramines and nitrosamines have certain limitations. However, photolysis and UV treatment through advanced oxidation processes are more effective. This study provides an alarmist situation of nitrosamines and nitrosamines formation from amine-based post-combustion CO2 capture technology based on the literature available for water treatment as well as CO2 capture. The manuscript discusses the concerns, formation and elimination of nitramines and nitrosamines. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed at evaluating the potential benefits of implementing local-BMA short-term measures to abate emissions of precursors. To this end, we analyzed in detail spatial and time variations of concentration of O3 and nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2, including OMI remote sensing data for the latter). Subsequently, a sensitivity analysis is done with the air quality (AQ) data to evaluate potential O3 reductions in the north of the BMA on Sundays compared with weekdays as a consequence of the reduction in regional emissions of precursors. The results showed a generalized decreasing trend for regional background O3 as well as the well-known increase in urban O3 and higher urban NO decreasing slopes compared with those of NO2. The most intensive O3 episodes in the Vic Plain are caused by (i) a relatively high regional background O3 (due to a mix of continental, hemispheric-tropospheric and stratospheric contributions); by (ii) intensive surface fumigation from mid-troposphere high O3 upper layers arising from the concatenation of the vertical recirculation of air masses; but also by (iii) an important O3 contribution from the northward transport/channeling of the pollution plume from the BMA. The high relevance of the local-daily O3 contribution during the most intense pollution episodes is clearly supported by the O3 (surface concentration) and NO2 (OMI data) data analysis. A maximum decrease potential (by applying shortterm measures to abate emissions of O3 precursors) of 49 μg O3 m-3 (32 %) of the average diurnal concentrations was determined. Structurally implemented measures, instead of episodically, could result in important additional O3 decreases because not only the local O3 coming from the BMA plume would be reduced, but also the recirculated O3 and thus the intensity of O3 fumigation in the plain. Therefore, it is highly probable that both structural and episodic measures to abate NOx and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions in the BMA would result in evident reductions of O3 in the Vic Plain. © 2019 Author(s).",,"air quality; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric plume; concentration (composition); data set; metropolitan area; ozone; spatiotemporal analysis; Barcelona [Barcelona (PRV)]; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066879544

By modifying the land surface, land use and land cover changes (LULCCs) and land management changes (LMCs) alter the physical, chemical, and biological processes of the biosphere and therefore all land-atmosphere interactions, from local to global scales. Through socio-economic drivers and regulatory policies adopted at different levels (local, regional, national, or supranational), human activities strongly interfere in the land-atmosphere interactions, and those activities lead to a patchwork of natural, semi-natural, agricultural, urban, and semi-urban areas. In this context, urban and peri-urban areas, which have a high population density, are of particular attention since land transformation can lead to important environmental impacts and affect the health and life of millions of people. The objectives of this review are to synthesize the existing experimental and modelling works that investigate physical, chemical, and/or biogeochemical interactions between land surfaces and the atmosphere, therefore potentially impacting local/regional climate and air quality, mainly in urban or peri-urban landscapes at regional and local scales. The conclusions we draw from our synthesis are the following. (1) The adequate temporal and spatial description of land use and land management practices (e.g. areas concerned, type of crops, whether or not they are irrigated, quantity of fertilizers used and actual seasonality of application) necessary for including the effects of LMC in global and even more in regional climate models is inexistent (or very poor). Not taking into account these characteristics may bias the regional projections used for impact studies. (2) Land- atmosphere interactions are often specific to the case study analysed; therefore, one can hardly propose general solutions or recommendations. (3) Adaptation strategies, proposed after climatic impacts on the targeted resource have been derived, are often biased as they do not account for feedbacks on local/regional climate.

Graphene nanoplatelets modified with MnO2 particles under sonication in an organic solvent. The produced solution was utilized to form film electrodes on aluminum substrate and also to wet carbon fiber cloth in order to form multifunctional structural composite with energy storage ability. The morphology of the graphene nanoplatelet/manganese oxide electrodes was characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Quasi solid-state electrolytes, consisted of different % wt. loadings of succinonitrile (SN), ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMImBF4) and copolymer poly vinylidenefluoride-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP), were prepared to be utilized as ionic conductors for the formation of supercapacitors. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to characterize the thermal stability of the electrolytes. DSC studies confirmed that polymer electrolytes remain stable in the same phase over a wide temperature range of -40 to 140 °C. Also, mixture of epoxy and the quasi-solid polymer electrolyte was prepared to form a solid polymer electrolyte with higher stiffness. The electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor electrodes was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, charge/discharge and impedance spectroscopy. The maximum value of specific capacitance achieved for the film electrodes was ˜450 F/g and for semi-solid and solid polymer electrolyte was ˜165 F/g and ˜15 F/g respectively. Finally, tensile tests performed at ambient conditions to determine the mechanical behavior of the supercapacitors.

Various engine modifications were experimented by the researchers to optimise the biofuels operated engine performance. Thermal barrier coating is one of the techniques used to improve the biofuels operated engine performance and combustion characteristics by reducing the heat loss from the combustion chamber. In this study, engine tests results on performance, combustion and exhaust emission characteristics of the biofuels operated thermal barrier coated engines were collated and reviewed. The results found in the literature were reviewed in three scenarios: (i) uncoated versus coated engine for fossil diesel fuel application, (ii) uncoated versus coated engine for biofuels (and blends) application, and (iii) fossil diesel use on uncoated engine versus biofuel (and blends) use on coated engine. Effects of injection timing, injection pressure and fuel properties on thermal barrier coatings were also discussed. The material type, thickness and properties of the coating materials used by the research community were presented. The effectiveness and durability of the coating layer depends on two key properties: low thermal conductivity and high thermal expansion coefficient. The current study showed that thermal barrier coatings could potentially offset the performance drop due to use of biofuels in the compression ignition engines. Improvements of up to 4.6% in torque, 7.8% in power output, 13.4% in brake specific fuel consumption, 15.4% in brake specific energy consumption and 10.7% in brake thermal efficiency were reported when biofuels or biofuel blends were used in the thermal barrier coated engines as compared to the uncoated engines. In coated engines, peak cylinder pressure and exhaust gas temperature were increased by up to 16.3 bar and 14% respectively as compared to uncoated condition. However, changes in the heat release rates were reported to be between −27% and +13.8% as compared to uncoated standard engine. Reductions of CO, CO 2 , HC and smoke emissions were reported by up to 3.8%, 11.1%, 90.9% and 63% respectively as compared to uncoated engines. Significant decreases in the PM emissions were also reported due to use of thermal barrier coatings in the combustion chamber. In contrast, at high speed and at high load operation, increase in the CO and CO 2 emissions were also reported in coated engines. Coated engines gave higher NO x emissions by about 4–62.9% as compared to uncoated engines. Combined effects of thermal barrier coatings and optimisation of fuel properties and injection parameters produced further performance and emissions advantages compared to only thermal barrier coated engines. Overall, current review study showed that application of thermal barrier coatings in compression ignition engines could be beneficial when biofuels or biofuel blends are used instead of standard fossil diesel. However, more research is needed combining coatings, types of biofuels and other engine modifications to establish a concrete conclusion on the effectiveness of the thermal barrier when biofuels are used in the compression ignition engine.

Nevertheless, this practice does not account for the differences of climatic parameters frequently detected among core urban, sub-urban and rural areas which coexist in the same region and in some cases might be significant. In the current work, publicly available data collected from 15 meteorological stations scattered as evenly as possibly in the Greater Metropolitan Area of London are utilized in order to estimate energy demand differences between urban and suburban areas. The result was consistent with previous attempts found in the literature, thus proving that the existing publicly available meteorological stations can be carefully utilized for the production of fine resolution climatic datasets in order to be used for estimation of energy demands for heating and cooling through metropolitan areas.

Four different quantification diagnostics were used: Gas chromatography, a chemiluminescence NOx analyzer, continuous wave cavity ring-down spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results showed that the onset temperature of the fuel reactivity was the same (575 K) regardless of the type of bath gases. Although the low-temperature fuel oxidation window was not affected by the type of bath gas, the n-pentane conversion was slightly larger when diluted in Ar through the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) region (625-725 K). Above 800 K, the reactivity according to the diluent was in the order CO2 &gt; Ar &gt; He. In the presence of NO2 or NO, it was found that the consumption rate of n-pentane exhibited a different trend below 700 K. The presence of NO2 did not modify the fuel conversion below 675 K. On the contrary, NO addition increased the onset temperature of the fuel reactivity by 75 K and almost no NTC zone was observed. This clearly indicated that NO addition inhibited n-pentane oxidation below 675 K. Above 700 K, n-pentane conversion was promoted by the presence of both NOx additives. The intermediate species HONO was quantified, and a search for HCN and CH3NO2 species was also attempted. A new detailed kinetic mechanism was developed, which allowed a good prediction of the experimental data. Reaction rate and sensitivity analyses were conducted to illustrate the different kinetic regimes induced by the NOx addition. The inhibition by NO of the n-pentane oxidation below 675 K can be explained by its direct reaction with C5H11O2 radicals disfavoring the classical promoting channels via isomerizations, second O2 addition, and formation of ketohydroperoxides, the well-known branching agents during alkane oxidation. With respect to NO2 addition, the major consumption route is via NO2 + CH3 = NO + CH3O, which is not directly related to the direct fuel consumption. HONO formation mainly derives from NO2 reacting with CHiO (i = 2, 3). The reaction, HONO + M = OH + NO + M, is one of the most sensitive reactions for HONO depletion. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Addition reactions; Additives; Carbon dioxide; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Fuels; Gas chromatography; Gases; Light measurement; Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Paraffins; Sensitivity analysis; Temperature; Chemiluminescence NOx analyzers; Consumption rates; Continuous-wave cavity; Detailed kinetic mechanisms; Intermediate specie; Jet stirred reactor; Low-temperature oxidation; Onset temperature; Argon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066897069

For species that are slow growing and poorly dispersed, climate change can force a lag between the distributions of species and the geographic distributions of their climatic envelopes, exposing species to the risk of extinction. Climate also governs the resilience of species and ecosystems to disturbance, such as wildfire. Here we use species distribution modelling and palaeoecology to assess and test the impact of vegetation–climate disequilibrium on the resilience of an endangered fire-sensitive rainforest community to fires. First, we modelled the probability of occurrence of Athrotaxis spp. and Nothofagus gunnii rainforest in Tasmania (hereon “montane rainforest”) as a function of climate. We then analysed three pollen and charcoal records spanning the last 7,500 cal year BP from within both high (n = 1) and low (n = 2) probability of occurrence areas. Our study indicates that climatic change between 3,000 and 4,000 cal year bp induced a disequilibrium between montane rainforests and climate that drove a loss of resilience of these communities. Current and future climate change are likely to shift the geographic distribution of the climatic envelopes of this plant community further, suggesting that current high-resilience locations will face a reduction in resilience. Coupled with the forecast of increasing fire activity in southern temperate regions, this heralds a significant threat to this and other slow growing, poorly dispersed and fire sensitive forest systems that are common in the southern mid to high latitudes. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; palaeoecology; rainforest; resilience; subalpine","climate variation; endangered species; forest fire; geographical distribution; montane forest; paleoclimate; paleoecology; palynology; Quaternary; rainforest; subalpine environment; Australia; Tasmania; Athrotaxis; Nothofagus gunnii; climate change; Cupressaceae; ecosystem; Fagaceae; fire; rain forest; Tasmania; Climate Change; Cupressaceae; Ecosystem; Fagaceae; Fires; Rainforest; Tasmania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063407940

Coal-alternative solid fuel production from MSW though hydrothermal carbonization can play a critical role to improve both waste management and energy supply. Moreover, MSW conversion to a carbon neutral solid fuel that can be burnt in existing coal-fired power stations might reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions despite GHG releases from waste collection, waste conversion to fuel, and fuel transportation processes. The purpose of this paper is to investigate present MSW generation in Zimbabwe, its characteristics as a fuel source, and the impact of coal-alternative solid fuel production from MSW using hydrothermal carbonization technology on GHG and other air pollutant emissions. Four different scenarios based on the balance between fuel supply and demand were tested in this paper. The results suggest 0.54 ± 0.14 kg/capita/day of MSW generation in Zimbabwe and about 1051.7 ± 270.7 Gg of annual MSW generation from the current urban population. 289.3 Gg of coal-alternative solid fuel production was expected from domestic MSW collectable in urban areas. The model predicted that co-burning of alternative fuel in coal-fired power plants could reduce the methane potential of household waste from 62,200 to 15,800 Mg CH 4 per year. Under the best possible scenario, it could reduce SO x emissions by 4.2%, CH 4 emissions by 4.5%, CO 2 emissions by 3.1%, and Global Warming Potential by 2.2%. On the other hand, NO x emissions would increase by 18%. If without additional installation of air pollutant control devices in power plants, waste-to-energy generates a trade-off between global warming and acid rain. In addition, geological locations generate a large demand/supply gap of alternative fuel and regulate maximum available consumption of alternative fuel. © 2019","Atmospheric pollutant emission; Hydrothermal carbonization; Municipal solid wastes; Waste to energy; Zimbabwe","Acid rain; Air pollution; Air pollution control; Alternative fuels; Coal; Coal carbonization; Coal transportation; Economic and social effects; Economics; Energy policy; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Thermochemistry; Waste management; Atmospheric pollutant emissions; Coal fired power station; Global warming potential; Hydrothermal carbonization; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Waste to energy; Waste to energy technologies; Zimbabwe; Municipal solid waste; carbon; coal; fuel; methane; nitrogen oxide; sulfur oxide; alternative fuel; atmospheric pollution; coal; emission inventory; hydrothermal alteration; municipal solid waste; pollution control; power generation; power plant; waste management; acid rain; air pollution control; Article; atmospheric dispersion; biofuel production; carbon footprint; carbonization; domestic waste; electric power plant; greenhouse effect; incineration; municipal solid waste; prediction; priority journal; solid waste management; urban area; urban population; Zimbabwe; Zimbabwe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062649159

The findings showed that by decreasing the SRT, the pilot plant could maintain excellent carbon removal efficiencies throughout the experiments. In contrast, the biological carbon removal showed a slight nitrification and was slightly affected by the decrease of the SRT, showing high performance (approximately 91%, on average). Thus, the biofilm might have helped sustain the nitrification throughout the experiments. The average phosphorus removal performance increased slightly with a decrease in SRT, achieving the maximum efficiency (61.5%) at a SRT of 15 days.

In this context, assessment of air pollution tolerance index (APTI) offers simple tool for screening and identifying plants that tolerate air pollution. Six plants commonly growing in the polluted regions of Bengaluru were selected for assessing the air pollution tolerance response. APTI indices of Ocimum sanctum, Ricinus communis, Leucas aspera, Lantana camara, Bougainvillea spectabilis, and Vinca rosea were assessed and compared with the plants grown in non-polluted sites of Bengaluru to analyze the response to air pollution. APTI correlations with the biochemical and physicochemical parameters were analyzed to identify the important determinants of air pollution tolerance. Among the parameters assessed ascorbic acid content correlated with APTI scores of plants (R2 0.88).

Consequently, large-scale reductions in urban GHG emissions will not be possible without significant improvements in the transport sector. Increasing public transit mode share is widely promoted in efforts to reduce GHG emissions from transport. Large increases in public transit use will require the provision of new transportation infrastructure, which is itself GHG intensive. This paper presents a time-dependent analysis of the embodied GHG emissions associated with construction and reconstruction for the refurbishment and street redesign of the 510 Spadina streetcar route in Toronto, Canada during a 38-year period. From 1987 to 2015, the embodied emissions in the line's civil infrastructure are calculated as 27.4 kilotons of CO2 equivalent (ktCO 2 e). It is expected that, by 2025, further reconstruction of the right-of-way (ROW) will increase embodied GHG emissions to 32.1 ktCO 2 e. Overall, reconstruction projects increase GHG emissions by 25.9% beyond initial construction. When accounting only for at-grade infrastructure, reconstruction increases embodied emissions by 45.8% during the 38-year study period. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Gas emissions; Urban transportation; Civil infrastructures; Embodied emissions; Reconstruction projects; Temporal assessment; Time-dependent analysis; Toronto , Canada; Transport sectors; Transportation infrastructures; Greenhouse gases; carbon emission; greenhouse gas; road construction; time dependent behavior; traffic emission; urban area; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060981252

A specially designed water bath equipped with perforated tubes submerged in water and supplied with water circulation to maintain the cleanness of water was used for this purpose. The diesel engine exhaust gas was admitted to the water bath through the perforated tubes such that the exhaust gas is ""cleaned up"" thoroughly before being released to the atmosphere. An experimental work was conducted on a four-stroke, air-cooled, one-cylinder diesel engine to verify the feasibility of using this technique in reducing exhaust gas emissions before applying it to large size diesel engines. The experimental results indicated that the use of the proposed water bath led to enormous reductions in oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), unburnt Hydrocarbons (HC), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and exhaust gas temperatures. In addition to a relatively small reduction in exhaust noise. For the engine power range considered in this work (0.4-2 kW), NOx was reduced by 62-73%, unburned HC was reduced by 72-85%, CO was reduced by 41-68%, exhaust gas temperature was reduced by 89-91% and exhaust noise was reduced by 1-7%. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon monoxide; Diesel engines; Electric power generation; Nitrogen oxides; Sustainable development; Exhaust gas temperatures; Oxides of nitrogen; Perforated tubes; Private sectors; Small reduction; Stationary diesel engines; Un-burnt hydrocarbons; Water circulation; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067812731

A territory-oriented approach was adopted, analysing the production of organic residues in local breweries and the potential methane production from each residue. An energy balance and a simplified dimensioning for anaerobic reactor installation at brewery scale was proposed, analysing actual energy consumption and the effect of biogas on plant energy balance improvement. Brewery spent grain, spent yeast, whirlpool residue and end-of-fermentation beer were identified as the main organic residues in the analysed plants. Biochemical methane potential tests revealed high methane potential of spent yeast, up to 486.9 NL CH4/kg VSadded, and spent grain, up to 356.2 NL CH4/kg VSadded. Granular activated carbon and biochar were added to selected tests to evaluate an eventual increase in methane yield; a noticeable effect was observed in particular on spent yeast, due to the enhanced microorganism activity and C/N ratio optimization. Co-digestion tests were performed on spent grain and spent yeast: a synergistic effect arose with a mixture of 70% spent yeast and 30% spent grain, where methane yield increased up to 447.7 NL CH4/kg VSadded. Electricity consumption was estimated as 130.6-148.9 MJ/hL, while heat need was 116.4-147.0 MJ/hL; it was showed that anaerobic digestion implementation, through a digester having 65 m3 volume, could provide up to 53.9% of electric and 64.4% of thermal need of the facility. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The deposition of these structures as oriented films is expected to promote their incorporation into diverse optoelectronic devices. However, to date, a controlled deposition strategy applicable for the different members of this MOF family has not been reported yet. Herein, we present the synthesis of highly oriented thin films of TP-MOFs by vapor-assisted conversion (VAC). We targeted the M-CAT-1 series comprising hexahydroxytriphenylene organic ligands and metal-ions such as Ni2+, Co2+, and Cu2+. These planar organic building blocks are connected in-plane to the metal-ions through a square planar node forming extended sheets which undergo self-organization into defined stacks. Highly oriented thin Ni- A nd Co-CAT-1 films grown on gold substrates feature a high surface coverage with a uniform film topography and thickness ranging from 180 to 200 nm. The inclusion of acid modulators in the synthesis enabled the growth of films with a preferred orientation on quartz and on conductive substrates such as indium-doped tin oxide (ITO). The van der Pauw measurements performed across the M-CAT-1 films revealed high electrical conductivity values of up to 10-3 S cm-1 for both the Ni- A nd Co-CAT-1 films. Films grown on quartz allowed for a detailed photophysical characterization by means of UV vis, photoluminescence, and transient absorption spectroscopy. The latter revealed the existence of excited states on a nanosecond time scale, sufficiently long to demonstrate a photoinduced charge generation and extraction in Ni-CAT-1 films. This was achieved by fabricating a basic photovoltaic device with an ITO/Ni-CAT-1/Al architecture, thus establishing this MOF as a photoactive material. Our results point to the intriguing capabilities of these conductive M-CAT-1 materials and an additional scope of applications as photoabsorbers enabled through VAC thin-film synthesis. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","metal organic framework; thin films; time-resolved absorption spectroscopy; triphenylene metal-catecholate; vapor-assisted conversion","Absorption spectroscopy; Conductive films; Crystalline materials; Electric conductivity; Indium compounds; Metal ions; Metals; Optoelectronic devices; Organic polymers; Organometallics; Oxide films; Quartz; Tin oxides; Topography; Vapor deposition; Catecholate; High electrical conductivity; Indium doped tin oxides; Metal organic framework; Photoinduced charge generation; Photophysical characterization; Time-resolved absorption; Transient absorption spectroscopies; Thin films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067060925

This paper analyzes the LAPA initiatives and process focusing on agriculture including assessment of local climatic contexts, vulnerabilities, adaptations and barriers. Moreover, the paper presents the adaptation cases that has enhanced the awareness and adaptive capacity at the local level. The assessments followed the qualitative research, review and analysis using the participatory and socially inclusive approach. The adaptations were analyzed for their effectiveness in enhancing the adaptive capacity of poor and vulnerable. Furthermore, the institutional mechanism suitable for the LAPA were also assessed and analyzed. The paper concludes the appropriate procedure for LAPA design along with the potential actors and their roles.

The high monetary subsidies widely used to promote EV diffusion in many countries are not sustainable in the long term. Therefore, effective alternative incentives are needed as subsidies are gradually phased out. In this paper, consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for alternative incentives is studied based on a questionnaire survey. Using a discrete choice experiment, 1719 Chinese consumer questionnaires were collected. Consumers' WTP for nine alternative policies was calculated by applying the multinomial logit model and mixed logit model, and the mixed logit model is used as the main model of this study because of its better statistical performance. Finally, the relationship between the respondent heterogeneity and policy preferences was studied. The results show that alternative incentives can fill the gap produced by subsidy reductions. EV privileges like no restrictions on driving and purchases, which have the lowest implementation cost, are suitable for first- and second- tier cities. For second-tier cities, construction of more charging stations is the most appropriate choice. The heterogeneous features of the respondents, including cities of residence, type of vehicle owned, recognition of the environmental benefits of EVs, gender, and whether the family has children, had a significant impact on policy preferences. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Alternative incentives; Discrete choice experiment; Electric vehicle; Policy design; Willingness to pay","Economics; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Alternative incentives; Discrete choice experiments; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Environmental benefits; Multinomial logit model; Policy design; Statistical performance; Willingness to pay; Surveys; discrete choice analysis; electric vehicle; emission control; environmental economics; experimental study; incentive; policy analysis; subsidy system; sustainability; willingness to pay; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064211124

This study explored the relationship and development trends associated with regional transportation carbon emissions. A social network method was used to analyze the structural characteristics of the spatial association of transportation carbon emissions. Indicators for each of the structural characteristics were selected from three dimensions: The integral network, node network, and spatial clustering. Then, this study established an association network for transportation carbon emissions (ANTCE) using a gravity model with China’s provincial data during the period of 2007 to 2016. Further, a block model (a method of partitioning provinces based on the information of transportation carbon emission) was used to group the ANTCE network of inter-provincial transportation carbon emissions to examine the overall association structure. There were three key findings. First, the tightness of China’s ANTCE network is growing, and its complexity and robustness are gradually increasing. Second, China’s ANTCE network shows a structural characteristic of “dense east and thin west.” That is, the transportation carbon emissions of eastern provinces in China are highly correlated, while those of central and western provinces are less correlated. Third, the eastern provinces belong to the two-way spillover or net benefit block, the central regions belong to the broker block, and the western provinces belong to the net spillover block. This indicates that the transportation carbon emissions in the western regions are flowing to the eastern and central regions. Finally, a regression analysis using a quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) was used to explore the spatial association between provinces. We found that per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and fixed transportation investments significantly influence the association and spillover effects of the ANTCE network.

It also requires adapting them to the specific object of assessment. For the construction and real estate industry, this means, among other things, extending the already complex interrelationships of designing, constructing and operating real estate properties by considering sustainability aspects. This not only has consequences for the decisionmaking processes of individual actors, but also for the exchange of information along the value chain and across the individual levels of action. Typical levels of action are the manufacturing of construction products, the provision of services (transport, construction site processes), the building, the neighbourhood, the city, the region, the national building stock. Selected actors also deal with the management of municipal, commercial and institutional building stocks. At all levels of action, developments are currently underway to support sustainable development. At the product level, the extension of the present scope of Environmental Product Declarations in the direction of additional requirements for environmental information is currently underway. This development will allow the reporting of additional indicators for the quantification of environmental impacts on the global environment, support a more sophisticated assessment of the GWP, and provide guidance on risks to health and the local environment as additional information. At the construction level, the results of a sustainability assessment in determining the value of the asset as well as determining the conditions for financing and insurance will be taken into account more than ever before. Again, the consideration of additional indicators in the environmental performance assessment is discussed. BIM provides a tool to handle complex design and assessment tasks that affect data delivery requirements - EPDs must be designed to be BIMable among others. The aim is to combine life cycle costing (LCC) and life cycle assessment (LCA). The life cycle carbon footprint is becoming an important indicator. Almost all countries are currently working on the introduction of compulsory calculation and assessment rules as well as carbon footprint benchmarks. This is also integrated as a requirement in the green public procurement. It remains to be seen what impact the introduction of taxes or fees on CO2 can have. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Architectural design; Carbon footprint; Construction; Costs; Decision making; Ecodesign; Emission control; Environmental management; Health risks; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle; Planning; Risk assessment; Decision making process; Environmental information; Environmental performance assessment; Environmental product declarations; Exchange of information; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Real estate properties; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068733923

Global ecosystem models have limited capacity to simulate the various effects of tillage. With respect to the decomposition of soil organic matter, they either assume a constant increase due to tillage or they ignore the effects of tillage. Hence, they do not allow for analysing the effects of tillage and cannot evaluate, for example, reduced tillage or no tillage (referred to here as ""no-till"") practises as mitigation practices for climate change. In this paper, we describe the implementation of tillage-related practices in the global ecosystem model LPJmL. The extended model is evaluated against reported differences between tillage and no-till management on several soil properties. To this end, simulation results are compared with published meta-analyses on tillage effects. In general, the model is able to reproduce observed tillage effects on global, as well as regional, patterns of carbon and water fluxes. However, modelled N fluxes deviate from the literature values and need further study. The addition of the tillage module to LPJmL5 opens up opportunities to assess the impact of agricultural soil management practices under different scenarios with implications for agricultural productivity, carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas emissions, and other environmental indicators. © 2019 The Author(s).",,"agricultural practice; decomposition analysis; ecosystem modeling; simulation; soil organic matter; soil property; tillage; zero tillage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067658180

However, high temperature inhibits water-gas shift reaction (WGSR) and therefore restrains the yield of H2 and leads to the formation of an excessive amount of CO. The modification of non-noble metal catalyst to enhance WGSR is an attractive alternative. In this study, CeOx was firstly loaded onto a nano-scaled NixMgyO matrix and subsequently used as the catalyst for hydrogen production via SRE. Morphology of the catalyst materials was characterized by using a series of technologies, while H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), CO-temperature programmed deposition (CO-TPD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), were employed to study the surface nickel, ceria clusters, and their interactions. The catalytic activity and durability of the catalyst were studied in the temperature region of 500°C to 800°C. The CeOx-coated nano NixMgyO matrix exhibited an outstanding hydrogen yield of 4.82 mol/molethanol under a high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 200 000 hour−1. It is found that the unique Ni0-CeOx structure facilitates the adsorption of CO on the surface and therefore promotes the effective hydrogen production via WGSR. Moreover, this modified NixMgyO matrix was found to be a more robust and anticoking nanocatalyst because of reversible switch between Ce4+ and Ce3+. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","CeO2; hydrogen production; NixMgyO matrix; steam reforming of ethanol; water-gas shift reaction","Catalyst activity; Catalytic reforming; Cerium oxide; Chemical shift; Deposition; Ethanol; Hydrogen production; Magnesium compounds; Morphology; Nanocatalysts; Nickel compounds; Precious metals; Steam reforming; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; CeO2; Gas hourly space velocities; H2 temperature-programmed reduction; Non-noble metal catalysts; Reversible switches; Steam reforming of ethanol; Temperature programmed; Water gas shift (WGS) reaction; Water gas shift",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065492575

Most studies, however, focus on its impacts on surface temperature, and possible effects on atmospheric humidity are less known. By examining the humidity changes in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration of China during 1961–2014, we find a prominent urban dry island (UDI) effect in this urban agglomeration, as characterized by reduced humidity and increased vapor pressure deficit in the urban core area. In the past decades, the UDI effect has been significantly intensified by rapid urban land expansion. Urban expansion contributes to around half of the decrease in atmospheric humidity and the increase in vapor pressure deficit in urban areas. These effects are particularly stronger in wet hot summer and relatively weaker in cold dry winter. We suggest that the UDI effect should be considered in future urban planning, landscape design, and climate change assessment and mitigation. ©2019. American Geophysical Union.

We measure carbon transparency based on both managerial propensity to publicly disclose carbon information and the level and comprehensiveness of the voluntary carbon disclosure. We operationalize financial transparency based on firms’ earnings management (EM). We find that our carbon transparency proxies are negatively associated with EM. These results are consistent with the ethical perspective, which suggests that carbon transparency complements financial transparency rather than substitutes for it. Furthermore, we find that the complementary relationship between carbon transparency and financial transparency is dependent on a country’s stakeholder orientation, collectivism in the national culture, the presence of an emissions trading scheme, and regulatory governance. © 2019, American Accounting Association.

Specific measures were designed in the Action Plan to reduce emissions of atmospheric pollutants, with core contents in energy related measures. Implementing these measures would potentially have significant co-benefits on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. This study quantitatively analyzes the impacts of the different measures in the Action Plan on the emissions of major air pollutants of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX), particulate matter (PM) and CO2 in the Jing-Jin-Ji (JJJ, i.e., Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei) region using the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies model (GAINS)-China model. The results show that the Action Plan in JJJ would reduce 47.3 ± 0.8% of SO2, 32.5 ± 2.6% of NOx, 15.2 ± 0.2% of PM2.5, and 39.9 ± 5.3% CO2 emissions, compared to the emissions in 2012. PM2.5 emission reduction has the highest co-benefit for CO2 reduction in JJJ, and also in Tianjin and Hebei. In Beijing, NOx emission reduction has high co-benefit for CO2 reduction, when considering the relative degree of co-benefit. Among the different source sectors, industrial and residential sectors are identified to be the source sectors that contribute the most to the co-benefit of CO2 emission reduction in JJJ. The results suggest that implementing energy replacement in the industrial and residential sectors in JJJ can not only generate large amounts of air pollutants emission reduction, but also can lead to significant CO2 emission reduction. © 2019","Action plan; Air pollutants; Carbon dioxide; Co-benefit; Emissions; GAINS-China","Air quality; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Quality control; Sulfur dioxide; Action plan; Air pollutants; Air pollution prevention; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon dioxide mitigation; Co benefits; CO2 emission reduction; GAINS-China; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; action plan; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; air pollutant; air pollution control; air quality; Article; atmospheric dispersion; China; concentration (parameter); denitrification; desulfurization; environmental planning; particulate matter; quantitative analysis; Beijing [China]; China; Jingjinji; Jixian [Tianjin]; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075406505

However, the effects of different biochar application rates on soil GHG emissions and their linkages with biochar-induced changes in soil environmental factors remain unclear in managed plantations. This study examined the responses of soil GHG emissions to different application rates of bamboo leaf biochar in a Chinese chestnut plantation. A two-year field trial was conducted to determine the changes in soil GHG emissions and key soil properties over time in B0 (control), B2, B5 and B10 treatments, representing biochar application rates of 0, 2, 5 and 10 t ha −1 , respectively. Biochar application significantly (P &lt; 0.05) decreased soil N 2 O emissions (from 2.60 to 2.11 t ha −1 yr −1 ) and increased soil CH 4 uptake (from 3.13 to 4.22 t ha −1 yr −1 ), but did not change soil CO 2 emissions. The biochar inhibition effect on soil GHG emissions increased with increasing biochar application rates, with greater inhibition in the first year than in the second year. Biochar application also decreased the concentrations of soil NH 4 + -N, NO 3 – -N and water-soluble organic N (WSON), but increased the concentrations of water-soluble organic C (WSOC) and microbial biomass C (MBC). Regardless of the treatments, the soil GHG emissions were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) correlated with soil temperature, but not with soil moisture content. Soil CO 2 and N 2 O emissions, and soil CH 4 uptake were positively (P &lt; 0.05) correlated with WSOC concentration under the B0, B2 and B5 treatments only. A significant relationship (P &lt; 0.05) was observed between soil MBC and soil CO 2 emissions (only for the B0 and B2 treatments), and soil MBC and soil N 2 O emissions (only for the B0, B2 and B10 treatments). The results suggest that biochar application rates can alter the relationships between GHG emissions and soil WSOC and MBC concentrations. The soil N 2 O emissions were positively (P &lt; 0.05) correlated with the NH 4 + -N, NO 3 − -N and WSON concentrations in all treatments. This study demonstrated that the management practice (i.e. biochar application to soil) decreased soil GHG emissions in a Chinese chestnut plantation via changes in key soil properties, with implications for the mitigation of soil GHG emissions in subtropical plantations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biochar; CH 4; Chinese chestnut; CO 2; Forest soil; N 2 O","agricultural emission; biochar; environmental factor; forest soil; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrous oxide; nut; plantation; soil property; subtropical region; Castanea mollissima",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062711337

In recent decades, N deposition has been increasing rapidly, especially at several hotspots in China, Europe and the U.S. In this study, a process-based terrestrial ecosystem model, IBIS (Integrated BIosphere Simulator), was used to simulate the effects of N deposition on WUE globally. The results indicated that increasing N deposition led to a global increase in WUE of 0.005 g C kg −1 H 2 O on average over the first 10 years of the 21st century. The effects of N deposition on WUE were more evident in certain hotspots than in other parts of the world. The effect of N deposition on gross primary productivity (GPP) determined the change in WUE. In particular, high N deposition led to decreased ET and consequently increased the WUE in southeastern China. Moreover, increased N deposition has significantly enhanced the WUE in response to elevated CO 2 in southeastern China, indicating the importance of N deposition in regulating the terrestrial carbon cycle. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon and nitrogen coupling; Climate change; Model simulation; Nitrogen deposition; Water use efficiency","Carbon; Climate change; Climate models; Efficiency; Nitrogen; Carbon and nitrogen; Gross primary productivity; Integrated biosphere simulators; Model simulation; Nitrogen deposition; Terrestrial carbon cycle; Terrestrial ecosystems; Water use efficiency; Ecosystems; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; climate change; global perspective; net primary production; nitrogen cycle; simulation; terrestrial ecosystem; water use efficiency; China; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061363617

The climate change has an increasingly serious impact on water resources and grain production. Strengthening scientific research in relevant fields of climate change and enhancing grain production in order to adapt to climate change is of vital significance to guarantee food security, improve farmers’ income and maintain social stability. This paper constructs a new economic-climate model based on the original Cobb-Dougla (C-D) production function by adding climate factors, and empirically analyzes the impacts of climate change on grain yield and illustrates regional differences. Constraints of water resource restriction on agricultural yields and agricultural planting structure are also proposed. Based on the analysis of the correlation between climate change and grain yield, the relationship between the use of irrigation water and irrigation is proposed. Human factors such as agricultural technology innovation, policy mechanism guarantee and increase in farmland water conservancy construction investment can mitigate all kinds of negative impacts of climate warming on the Chinese agricultural water to a certain extent. © 2019","Analysis of the correlation; C-D-C model; Climate change; Grain production; Water resources","Climate models; Economics; Food supply; Grain (agricultural product); Irrigation; Water management; Water resources; Agricultural technologies; C modeling; Climate change impact assessments; Construction investments; Farmland water conservancies; Grain production; Resource restrictions; Scientific researches; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; crop production; food security; income; innovation; technological development; warming; water resource; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063211099

Currently available data from emissions inventories show the negligible impact of waste incineration on air quality. A number of impact assessment studies are currently available too. A few of them are site-specific, but none of them makes a direct comparison between the local impact of the emissions from a WTE plant and emissions from other “common” sources (such as vehicles and domestic heating) perceived as less potentially hazardous in the public opinion. This paper examines the impact on air quality of actual emissions from a WTE plant in the municipality of Desio (located to the North of Milan in the Lombardy region) using CALPUFF atmospheric disper-sion model. Continuous emission monitoring data were used to measure the plant’s actual emissions of PM10, NOx, cadmium, and dioxins (PCDD/F) as inputs for model simulations. For comparison purposes, the impact of traffic emissions along the main roads in Desio was also simulated. The results of the model show that the WTE plant has a marginal impact on local air quality compared with pollution from vehicular traffic. The contribution of the plant’s actual emissions to ambient pollution concentration levels in the urban area of Desio is between two (NOx and cadmium) to four (PM10 and PCDD/F) orders of magnitude smaller than the contribution from road traffic emissions. © 2018 Cisa Publisher.

Understanding their fate and behaviour in rivers can help in improving management strategies. We develop a particle-facilitated transport model considering suspended sediments with sorbed PAH from different origins to investigate the turnover and legacy of sediment-bound PAH in the baseflow-dominated Ammer River in southwest Germany. Our model identifies the contributions of dissolved and particle-bound PAH during wet and dry periods to the annual load. The analysis of in-stream processes enables investigating the average turnover times of sediments and attached PAH for the main stem of the river. The legacy of sediment-bound PAH is studied by running the model assuming a 50% reduction in PAH emissions after the introduction of environmental regulation in the 1970s. Our results show that sediment-bound and dissolved PAH account for 75% and 25% of the annual PAH load, respectively. PAH are mainly emitted from urban areas that contribute over 74% to the total load. In steep reaches, the turnover times of sediments and attached PAH are similar, whereas they differ by 1–2 orders of magnitude in reaches with very mild slopes. Flow rates significantly affect PAH fluxes between the mobile water and the riverbed over the entire river. Total PAH fluxes from the river bed to the mobile water are simulated to occur when the discharge is larger than 5 m 3 s −1 . River segments with large sediment storage show a potential of PAH legacy, which may have caused a PAH release over 10–20 years after the implementation of environmental regulation. This study is useful for assessing environmental impacts of PAH in rivers (e.g., their contribution to the river-water toxicity) and exemplifies that the longitudinal distribution, turnover, and legacy potential of PAH in a river system require a mechanistic understanding of river hydraulics and sediment transport. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Legacy; PAH; Particle-facilitated transport; Turnover","Aquatic ecosystems; Environmental impact; Environmental regulations; Rivers; Sediment transport; Suspended sediments; Facilitated transport; In-stream process; Legacy; Longitudinal distribution; Management strategies; Orders of magnitude; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH); Turnover; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; baseflow; environmental fate; flow modeling; PAH; sediment transport; spatial distribution; suspended sediment; turnover; Article; concentration (parameter); desorption; ecotoxicity; environmental factor; environmental impact assessment; flow rate; limit of quantitation; particle size; pollution transport; priority journal; river; sediment; sediment transport; urban area; Ammer River; Bavaria; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063642889

In this study, particulate samples were collected from September 2014 to August 2015 at an urban site in Jinan, which is the capital of Shandong Province and a typical city in the North China Plain. The PM 2.5 samples were analyzed for BSOA (isoprene (SOA I ) and monoterpenes (SOA M )) and ASOA (aromatic (SOA A )) tracers. The concentrations of the SOA A tracer (1.1 ± 1.0 ng/m 3 ) were lowest, and those of SOA I tracers (41.8 ± 86.2 ng/m 3 ) were highest, with the concentrations of SOA M tracers (19.4 ± 9.9 ng/m 3 ) being intermediate. The SOA I tracers were more abundant in the summer and less abundant in the winter. Both SOA I and SOA M increased with increasing ozone level but decreased with increasing NOx level. Correlation analysis revealed a good correlation between 2,3-dihydroxy-4-oxopentanoic acid and levoglucosan levels in three seasons. These results suggested that biomass burning activities occurring in the NCP can enhance the emissions of aromatics and should be controlled, especially in the autumn and winter. SOA tracers were classified according to pollution degree, and the results showed that as pollution increases, the contributions of SOA A increase. These results indicate that reducing anthropogenic emissions is necessary to prevent SOA pollution, especially during heavy pollution episodes. © 2018","Anthropogenic contributions; Biogenic secondary organic aerosols; Biomass burning; Seasonal variations","Aerosols; Monoterpenes; Particulate emissions; Urban growth; Anthropogenic contribution; Anthropogenic emissions; Biomass-burning; Correlation analysis; North China Plain; Pollution episodes; Seasonal variation; Secondary organic aerosols; Air pollution; aerosol; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; biogenic emission; biomass burning; seasonal variation; urban atmosphere; urban site; China; Jinan [Shandong]; Shandong; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; China; city; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; statistics and numerical data; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058672002

Because the exhaust post-treatment technology does not need to be reformed for diesel engine, and the quality requirement of fuel is relatively low, domestic and foreign research and development institutions all attach great importance to the research of exhaust post-treatment technology. By analyzing the mechanism and main chemical reaction of SCR reaction, the overall design scheme of marine diesel engine exhaust intelligent emission reduction control system was completed in order to reduce the nitrogen oxides and solid particles in the exhaust of marine diesel engine. According to TierIII emission regulation and marine diesel engine exhaust, the hardware structure design and model selection of marine diesel engine exhaust intelligent emission control system are completed.

Lumbar puncture (LP)plays central role in the diagnosis and treatment process, but options for analgesia are limited. Objectives: The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a fixed N2O/O2 mixture to reduce pain in children with leukemia during LP as compared with placebo. Methods: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized clinical trial involving children who needed LP for diagnosis or treatment was conducted in the pediatrics department of the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to inhale either a fixed N2O/O2 mixture or O2. The primary endpoint was the maximal pain level felt by the patient during the procedure measured using a numerical rating scale (0–10). Results: One-hundred fourteen consecutive patients were enrolled in this study and randomized. Pain scores during the procedure showed a significant decrease in N2O/O2 mixture–treated patients to 1.05 ± 1.40 versus 8.00 ± 2.13 in controls (P &lt; 0.01). No serious adverse effects were attributed to N2O/O2 mixture inhalation. Analysis of the satisfaction of patients receiving N2O/O2 mixture indicated that medical staff were satisfied with this treatment. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that self-administered fixed N2O/O2 is efficient to reduce pain related to LP in children with leukemia. © 2019 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine","analgesia; Lumbar puncture; nitrous oxide; procedural pain","lidocaine; nitrous oxide; oxygen; analgesic agent; nitrous oxide; oxygen; acute leukemia; adolescent; analgesia; analgesic activity; anxiety; Article; cancer patient; childhood leukemia; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; drug mixture; female; heart rate; human; local anesthesia; lumbar puncture; major clinical study; male; medical staff; nausea and vomiting; numeric rating scale; pain intensity; patient satisfaction; pediatrics; procedural pain; randomized controlled trial; systolic blood pressure; adverse event; child; complication; drug effect; inhalational drug administration; leukemia; pain; pain measurement; preschool child; procedures; treatment outcome; Administration, Inhalation; Adolescent; Analgesics, Non-Narcotic; Child; Child, Preschool; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Leukemia; Male; Nitrous Oxide; Oxygen; Pain; Pain Measurement; Patient Satisfaction; Spinal Puncture; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063913926

To meet the technical requirements of this issue challenging us human beings, increasing numbers of researches have been published around this topic, among which reactive modeling is a popular viewpoint. In this paper, mathematical models governing the reactive transport process from fluid dynamics and thermal dynamics have been comprehensively reviewed, and the corresponding numerical methods have been concluded and presented in details. To help readers new in this area to have a basic knowledge of how to conduct a reactive transport modeling, some commonly used simulators are introduced in our paper, with their general simulation logic and authors’ comments. Due to the urgent need of CO 2 sequestration, risks are often inevitable in the practical application of CO 2 injection and trapping process. Varieties of risks are concluded from different viewpoints of business, technique and social impacts, and we have presented some monitoring methods to handle these risks. It should be pointed out that long-term sequestration is still a difficulty, and the complex environmental conditions including changing temperature, porous structure, and chemical compositions are still hard to specify. Numerically speaking, high order schemes are still in need to meet the stability and convergence requirement, as well as local mass conservation property. No simulator now can handle CO 2 sequestration cases in all projects, so that a more common model and solver should still be our future aim. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Numerical methods; Risk assessment; Changing temperature; Chemical compositions; Environmental conditions; Mass conservation properties; Reactive transport modeling; Reactive transport process; Stability and convergence; Technical requirement; Transport properties; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; global warming; numerical method; numerical model; reactive transport; risk assessment",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062502704

N2O5 heterogeneous hydrolysis is the most important pathway of nitrate formation at nighttime. In the present study, the WRF-Chem model is applied to simulate a heavy haze episode from 10 to 27 February 2014 in BTH to evaluate contributions of N2O5 heterogeneous hydrolysis to nitrate formation and effects of organic coating. The model generally performs reasonably well in simulating meteorological parameters, air pollutants, and aerosol species against observations in BTH. N2O5 heterogeneous hydrolysis with all the secondary organic aerosol assumed to be involved in coating considerably improves the nitrate simulations compared to the measurements in Beijing. On average, organic coating decreases nitrate concentrations by 8.4 % in BTH during an episode, and N2O5 heterogeneous hydrolysis with organic coating contributes about 30.1 % of nitrate concentrations. Additionally, the reaction also plays a considerable role in the heavy haze formation, with a PM2:5 contribution of about 11.6 % in BTH. Sensitivity studies also reveal that future studies need to be conducted to predict the organic aerosol hygroscopicity for accurately representing the organic coating effect on N2O5 heterogeneous hydrolysis. © 2019 Author(s).",,"aerosol; atmospheric chemistry; coating; concentration (composition); haze; hydrolysis; nitrate; particulate matter; winter; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068037134

Green communication in CRNs will contribute to reducing emission pollution, minimizing operation cost and decreasing energy consumption. The Green CRNs would help in realizing “green spectrum management”. In this paper, we examine the key issue to show how to conserve the energy of base stations in the Green CRNs. In order to meet the demand for more sustainable green communication, we propose a multiple-sleep mode for licensed channels in CRNs. Based on a dynamic spectrum access strategy with the proposed multiple-sleep mode, we establish a continuous-time Markov chain model to capture the stochastic behavior of secondary user (SU) and primary user packets. By using the matrix geometric solution method, we obtain the steady-state probability distribution for the system model. This paper further presents analysis for performance measures in terms of the throughput of SU packets, the average latency of SU packets, the energy saving rate of the system and the channel utilization. We also provide statistical experiments with analysis and simulation to investigate the influences of the service rate of one channel and the sleep timer parameter on the system performance measures. In order to get the utmost out of the spectrum resource and meet the demands for the quality of service requirements of SUs, we construct a system cost function, and improve a Jaya algorithm employing an insect-population model to optimize the proposed energy saving strategy. We also show the optimal combination and global minimum of the system cost by numerical results. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cognitive radio networks; Energy saving; Jaya algorithm; Multiple-sleep mode; Performance measures; System cost function",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055747299

The DFT model is first verified by grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation in graphite slit pores for pure and binary component systems at different temperatures, pressures, pore sizes, and bulk gas compositions for methane/ethane with CO2. Then, the model is utilized in multicomponent systems that include CH4, C2H6, and C3+ components of different compositions. It is shown that the selectivity of CO2 decreases with increases in temperature, pressure, nanopore size, and average molecular weight of shale gas. Extending the model to more realistic situations, we consider the impact of water present in the pore and consider the effect of permeation of fluid molecules into the kerogen that forms the pore walls. The water-graphite interaction is calibrated with contact angle from molecular simulation data from the literature. The kerogen pore model prediction of gas absolute sorption is compared with experimental and molecular simulation values in the literature. It is shown that the presence of water reduces the CO2 adsorption but improves the CO2 selectivity. The dissolution of gases into the kerogen matrix also leads to the increase in CO2 selectivity. The effect of kerogen type and maturity on the gas sorption amount and CO2 selectivity is also studied. The associated mechanisms are discussed to provide fundamental understanding for gas recovery by CO2. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Contact angle; Density of gases; Gases; Graphite; Intelligent systems; Kerogen; Molecular structure; Monte Carlo methods; Nanopores; Oil shale; Pore size; Shale gas; Sorption; Associated mechanism; Average molecular weight; Competitive sorption; Enhanced gas recoveries; Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation; Molecular simulations; Multi-component systems; Perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theories; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067505132

The allocation of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) helps forests adapt to increasing drought. Previous studies that focused on site-level observations of NSC responses to changes in seasonal rainfall suggested that NSC in branches and stems showed no difference under different levels of drought stress. We conducted large-scale sampling of Larix sibirica-dominated forest patches of different sizes at 7 sites with different mean annual precipitation (MAP) in northern Mongolia in August 2017. Results showed that MAP determines the leaf and stem soluble sugar (SS), leaf and branch starch concentrations of Larix sibirica. The branch stores more starch at lower MAP. A comparison of seasonal NSC dynamics between wetter and dryer sites in the arid timberline of northern China shows that starch in stems is significantly higher for both Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica and Betula platyphylla at drier sites in the dry year 2017 than the normal year 2016. Our two lines of evidence suggest that the enhanced shoot starch allocation is an immediate response of trees to drought, rather than an adaptation strategy to regional climate dryness, although a spatial pattern may exist. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Drought; Nonstructural carbohydrates; Organ; Seasonal dynamic; Semiarid forest; Spatial pattern","adaptation; biomass allocation; carbohydrate; drought stress; dry season; rainfall; regional climate; semiarid region; spatial analysis; starch; sugar; treeline; Mongolia; Betula platyphylla; Larix sibirica; Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063335181

However, a significant challenge in this field pertains to a phenomenon known as thermal quenching, which takes place inside phosphors and leads to a pronounced reduction of the emission intensity under high-power light-emitting diode operation. The development of new, more thermally stable phosphors depends on a better understanding of the mechanisms underpinning thermal quenching in phosphors. Here we review the current understanding of thermal quenching mechanisms in Ce3+-doped garnet phosphors, which are widely considered one of the most important families of phosphors for application in pc-WLEDs. In particular, we highlight key structural and dynamical properties, such as the coordination environment of the Ce3+ ions, phonons and local vibrational modes, and structural and chemical defects, which are shown to correlate with phosphor performance.

However, the emissions from coal mining in the form of ventilation air methane (VAM), usually in ultra-lean concentration, pose the most significant technical challenge to the mitigation of methane emission. Therefore, a better understanding of ultra-lean methane combustion is essential. With three 5 mm × 50 mm rectangle cross-section slot jets, a novel sandwich-type triple-jet burner is proposed to provide stable combustion of an ultra-lean methane-air mixture with equivalence ratios from 0.3 to 0.88, and 0.22 in extreme conditions. The ultra-lean methane flame in the center of the triple-jet burner is supported by the two lean outer flames at an equivalence ratio Φ = 0.88. The flow field and combustion chemical reactions are predicted by detailed numerical simulation with GRI-Mech 3.0 reaction mechanisms. Two-dimensional numerical results are validated with those obtained by experimental particle image velocimetry (PIV), as well as visual flame height and temperature measurements. An ultra-lean methane-air mixture has to burn with external support. In addition, the ultra-lean flame is non-propagating with a relatively low temperature. The ultra-lean center flame is seen to start from the outer flame and incline perfectly to the post-flame temperature and OH concentration profiles of the outer lean flame. The adjacent stronger flame provides heat and active radicals, such as OH and HO2, from the post-flame region and in the wall proximity of the gap between the adjacent flame and the central ultra-lean jet to initiate and maintain the combustion of the central ultra-lean flame. The outstanding wall-proximity radical of HO2 is found to be the main contributor to the initiation and stabilization of the central ultra-lean flame by providing a low-temperature oxidation of fuel through the following reaction: HO2 + CH3 ↔ OH + CH3O. The major chemical reaction paths contributing to fuel decomposition and oxidation of the supported ultra-lean center flame are also identified and delineated. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; GRI-Mech 3.0; Lean flames; Methane-air combustion; Mitigation; PIV; Ultra-lean methane flame","Climate change; Coal combustion; Gas burners; Global warming; Mixtures; Temperature; Temperature measurement; Velocity measurement; GRI-Mech 3.0; Lean flames; Methane flame; Methane-air combustion; Mitigation; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067384074

Bad weather and dangerously low harvests provided momentum and urgency for answers to questions about how best to improve and acclimatize staple varieties. In the 1790s, a series of crop failures in Britain led to the popularization of and widespread debate over Thomas Andrew Knight’s suggestion that poor weather was in fact largely unconnected to the bad harvests. Rather, Knight argued, Britain’s older varieties—particularly its fruit trees—were coming to the natural end of their lifespans. At a period when Britain was trying to maximize its agricultural land usage, Knight campaigned that his fellow farmers ought to set aside land and resources in order to cultivate new varieties—an expensive and time-consuming procedure—in order to avoid disaster. In this paper, I argue that Knight’s lifelong commitment to his position demonstrates the role played by changes in climate and weather on popular understandings of plant heredity. Further, drawing upon the historiography of Britain’s climate and agriculture, I show that despite reliable weather and good harvests, Knight’s campaign survived for several decades before the continued health of Britain’s trees was finally treated as sufficient evidence to dispense with Knight’s warnings. This case provides a means of thinking about the history of heredity as it is shaped and impacted by changes in climate and local conditions. © 2018, The Author(s).","Botany; Climate; Environmental history; Food security; Grafting; Heredity; Malthus; Royal Horticultural Society; Thomas Andrew Knight","agricultural land; agricultural worker; article; botany; climate; disaster; drawing; food security; fruit; Great Britain; heredity; history; human; human experiment; lifespan; male; thinking; weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058367090

Several high-resolution structures have been determined at various stages of the reduction, which can be used as good starting points for the present computational study. The cluster model is used in combination with a systematic application of the density functional theory as recently described. The results are in very good agreement with experimental evidence. There are a few important results. To explain why the X-ray structure for the reduced Cred1 state has an empty site on nickel, it is here suggested that the cluster has been over-reduced by X-rays and is therefore not the desired reduced state, which instead contains a bound CO on nickel. After an additional reduction, a hydride bound to nickel is suggested to play a role. In order to obtain energetics in agreement with experiments, it is concluded that one sulfide bridge in the Ni-Fe cluster should be protonated. The best test of the accuracy obtained is to compare the computed rate for reduction using -0.6 V with that for oxidation using -0.3 V, where good agreement was obtained. Obtaining a mechanism that is easily reversible is another demanding aspect of the modeling.

We aimed to assess the potential effects of air-quality improvements on respiratory health by investigating the number of cases of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) advanced by air pollution each year. Methods: Daily city-wide concentrations of PM10, PM2·5, PMcoarse (particulate matter &gt;2·5–10 μm diameter), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3) in 2013–17 were averaged from 35 monitoring stations across Beijing. A generalised additive Poisson time-series model was applied to estimate the relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs for hospitalisation for acute exacerbation of COPD associated with pollutant concentrations. Findings: From Jan 18, 2013, to Dec 31, 2017, 161 613 hospitalisations for acute exacerbation of COPD were recorded. Mean ambient concentrations of SO2 decreased by 68% and PM2·5 decreased by 33% over this 5-year period. For each IQR increase in pollutant concentration, RRs for same-day hospitalisation for acute exacerbation of COPD were 1·029 (95% CI 1·023–1·035) for PM10, 1·028 (1·021–1·034) for PM2·5, 1·018 (1·013–1·022) for PMcoarse, 1·036 (1·028–1·044) for NO2, 1·019 (1·013–1·024) for SO2, 1·024 (1·018–1·029) for CO, and 1·027 (1·010–1·044) for O3 in the warm season (May to October). Women and patients aged 65 years or older were more susceptible to the effects of these pollutants on hospitalisation risk than were men and patients younger than 65 years. In 2013, there were 12 679 acute exacerbations of COPD cases that were advanced by PM2·5 pollution above the expected number of cases if daily PM2·5 concentrations had not exceeded the WHO target (25 μg/m3), whereas the respective figure in 2017 was 7377 cases. Interpretation: Despite improvement in overall air quality, increased acute air pollution episodes were significantly associated with increased hospitalisations for acute exacerbations of COPD in Beijing. Stringent air pollution control policies are important and effective for reducing COPD morbidity, and long-term multidimensional policies to safeguard public health are indicated.

In China, NOx emissions are very high and NOx emissions exhausted from on-road vehicles make up 20&amp;thinsp;% of total NOx emissions. In order to detect the NO and NO2 emissions on road, a dual-channel cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) system for NO2 and NO detection has been developed. In the system, NO is converted to NO2 by its reaction with excess O3 in the NOx channel, such that NO can be determined through the difference between two channels. The detection limits of NO2 and NOx for the system are estimated to be about 0.030 (1σ, 1 s) and 0.040 ppb (1σ, 1 s), respectively. Considering the error sources of NO2 absorption cross section and RL determination, the total uncertainty of NO2 measurements is about 5%. The performance of the system was validated against a chemiluminescence (CL) analyser (42i, Thermo Scientific, Inc.) by measuring the NO2 standard mixtures. The measurement results of NO2 showed a linear correction factor (R2) of 0.99 in a slope of 1.031±0.006, with an offset of (-0:940 ± 0:323) ppb. An intercomparison between the system and a cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy (CEAS) instrument was also conducted separately for NO2 measurement in an ambient environment. Least-squares analysis showed that the slope and intercept of the regression line are 1:042 ± 0:002 and (-0:393 ± 0:040) ppb, respectively, with a linear correlation factor of R2 D 0:99. Another intercomparison conducted between the system and the CL analyser for NO detection also showed a good agreement within their uncertainties, with an absolute shift of (0:352 ± 0:013) ppb, a slope of 0:957 ± 0:007 and a correlation coefficient of R2 D 0:99. The system was deployed on the measurements of on-road vehicle emission plumes in Hefei, and the different emission characteristics were observed in the different areas of the city. The successful deployment of the system has demonstrated that the instrument can provide a new method for retrieving fast variations in NO and NO2 plumes. © 2019 The Author(s).",,"air quality; detection method; measurement method; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; traffic emission; troposphere; urban pollution; Anhui; China; Hefei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067424435

Identifying the aerosol variations and the underling determinates can provide insights into united mitigation policy controls targeting on both aerosol pollution and climate change. Long-term trend analysis and modeling offers an effective way to fully appreciate how aerosols interlink with carbon cycle and climate change. This study analyzes the current trends, models the future predictions, and investigates potential driving forces of aerosol loading at six sites across North America and East Asia during 2003–2015. Satellite-retrieved MODIS Collection 6 retrievals and ground measurements derived from AERONET are used. Results show that there is a persistent decreasing trend in AOD for both MODIS data and AERONET data at three sites. Monthly and seasonal AOD variations reveal consistent aerosol patterns at sites along mid-latitudes. Regional differences caused by impacts of climatology and land cover types are observed for the selected sites. Statistical validation of time series ARIMA models indicates that the non-seasonal ARIMA model performs better for AERONET AOD data than for MODIS AOD data at most sites, suggesting the method works better for data with higher quality. The seasonal ARIMA model reproduces time series with distinct seasonal variations much more precisely.

In this study, a hybrid remote sensing and machine learning approach, named RSRF model is proposed to estimate daily ground-level PM2.5 concentrations, which integrates Random Forest (RF), one of machine learning (ML) models, and aerosol optical depth (AOD), one of remote sensing (RS) products. The proposed RSRF model provides an opportunity for an adequate characterization of real-time spatiotemporal PM2.5 distributions at uninhabited places and complex surfaces. It also offers advantages in handling complicated non-linear relationships among a large number of meteorological, environmental and air pollutant factors, as well as ever-increasing environmental data sets. The applicability of the proposed RSRF model is tested in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH region) during 2015–2017. Deep Blue (DB) AOD from Aqua-retrieved Collection 6.1 (C_61) aerosol products of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is validated with Aerosol Robotic Network. The validation results indicate C_61 DB AOD has a high correlation with ground based AOD in the BTH region. The proposed RSRF model performed well in characterizing spatiotemporal variations of annual and seasonal PM2.5 concentrations. It not only is useful to quantify the relationships between PM2.5 and relevant factors such as DB AOD, meteorological and air pollutant variables, but also can provide decision support for air pollution control at a regional environment during haze periods. © 2019 Elsevier LtdWe developed a RSRF framework combining satellite and machine learning to predicted PM2.5 concentrations and provide decision support for air pollution control. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosol optical depth; Machine learning; PM2.5; Random forest; Remote sensing","Aerosols; Air pollution; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Health risks; Learning systems; Machine learning; Optical properties; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Supercomputers; Aerosol optical depths; Aerosol robotic networks; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Machine learning approaches; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; PM2.5; Random forests; Spatio-temporal variation; Air pollution control; aerosol property; concentration (composition); machine learning; optical depth; particulate matter; remote sensing; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution control; article; China; decision support system; haze; optical depth; random forest; remote sensing; validation process; aerosol; analysis; chemistry; China; city; environmental monitoring; machine learning; meteorology; particulate matter; procedures; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sediment; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Beijing; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Machine Learning; Meteorology; Particulate Matter; Remote Sensing Technology; Satellite Imagery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063446547

The city currently suffers from serious traffic congestion and extreme air pollution. Beijing’s metropolitan government is currently considering implementation of a congestion charging system intended to discourage the use of private motor vehicles and encourage a shift to public transportation. Nearly 1500 Beijing-area business managers responded to a survey asking their opinions about the system. The data was analyzed using multinomial logit modeling and cluster analysis to identify the major sources of support and non-support for the proposed system, and to create profiles of “typical” businesses that support, are neutral to, or oppose the system. These results indicate that support for the system is highest among small businesses located in the city’s central business district, where there is significant traffic congestion and good access to public transportation. Support is weakest among large businesses located in outer suburbs with relatively limited public transit. Business managers’ level of understanding of congestion charging and the extent to which they think it will successfully reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality were major factors in support or non-support for the proposed system. The results indicate that providing clear and credible information about the way the proposed system will work, how the revenue from congestion charging will be used, and the transportation and environmental benefits of the system are essential to gaining support from the business community. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Acceptability; Business; Congestion charging; Multinomial logit","Air quality; Cluster analysis; Industry; Managers; Mass transportation; Acceptability; Business perspective; Central business districts; Congestion charging; Environmental benefits; Multinomial Logit; Multinomial logit model; Public transportation; Traffic congestion; air quality; economic activity; logit analysis; metropolitan area; public transport; traffic congestion; transportation planning; urban transport; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029752723

Compared with the fresh CsPbBr3 NCs, a better color purity and a higher photoluminescence quantum yield were achieved, accompanied with a gradual blue shift of the emission peak with an increasing Na+ doping ratio. On the one hand, the passivation effect with Na+ doping substantially reduces the nonradiative trap centers in NCs. On the other hand, the density functional theory calculations indicate that the doping of Na+ ions forms the energetically preferred substitution NaPb, which increases the optical band gap of CsPbBr3 and the diffusion barrier of Br vacancy in CsPbBr3 structures. Experimentally, the as-synthesized Na+-doped CsPbBr3 NCs present obvious enhancements in stability against ultraviolet light, heat, and moisture. The above advantages allow us to use such CsPbBr3:Na NCs as solid-state phosphors for white light-emitting device (WLED) applications. Finally, the prepared WLED exhibits a pure white light with Commission International de I'Eclairage color coordinates at (0.31, 0.33), with a color temperature of 6652 K, a color rendering index of 75.2, and a high power efficiency of 67.3 l m/W. More importantly, the WLED shows only 15% decay after continuous runs for as long as 500 h, which demonstrates a great superiority to the reference device with the fresh CsPbBr3 NCs as the phosphors. The approach used here provides an effective strategy to improve the emission efficiency and stability of perovskite NCs, showing promising potentials for their applications in lighting and display fields. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Binary alloys; Blue shift; Current density; Density functional theory; Diffusion barriers; Efficiency; Electrooptical devices; Energy gap; Nanocrystals; Perovskite; Phosphors; Sodium; Stability; Color rendering index; Emission efficiencies; High power efficiencies; Oxidation and reduction; Passivation effect; Photoluminescence quantum yields; Ultra-violet light; White light emitting device; Light emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067106985

The retailer recycled old products from customers, and the manufacturer remanufactured the recycled old products. The effects of different parameter values on the stability and utility of the dynamic price game model were determined through analysis and numerical simulation. Results found that an increasing customer loyalty to the direct marketing channel decreased the stable region of the manufacturer’s price adjustment and increase that of the retailer. The stable region of the system shrank with an increase of CER and the retailer’s service level, which expanded with return rates. The dynamic system entered into chaos through flip bifurcation with the increas of price adjustment speed. In the chaotic state, the average utilities of the manufacturer and retailer all declined, while that of the retailer declined even more. Changes to parameter values had a great impact on the utilities of the manufacturer and retailer. By selecting appropriate control parameters, the dynamic system can return to a stable state from chaos again.

Intensified extreme weather and climate events driven by climate change may increase related disaster susceptibility. This may interact with exposed and vulnerable socioeconomic systems to aggravate the impacts and impede progress towards regional development. In this study, debris flow risk under climate change was assessed by an integrated debris flow mechanism model and an inclusive socioeconomic status evaluation. We implemented the method for a debris flow-prone area in the eastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China. Based on the analysis of three general circulation models (GCMs)-Beijing Climate Center Climate System Model version 1 (BCC_CSM), model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate- Earth System, version 5 (MIROC5, and the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4)-the water-soil process model was applied to assess debris flow susceptibility. For the vulnerability evaluation, an index system established from the categories of bearing elements was analyzed by principle component analysis (PCA) methods. Our results showed that 432 to 1106 watersheds (accounting for 23% to 52% of the study area) were identified as debris-flow watersheds, although extreme rainfall would occur in most of the area from 2007 to 2060. The distributions of debris flow watersheds were concentrated in the north and transition zones of the study area. Additionally, the result of the index and PCA suggested that most areas had relatively low socioeconomic scores and such areas were considered as high-vulnerability human systems (accounts for 91%). Further analysis found that population density, road density, and gross domestic production made great contributions to vulnerability reduction. For practical mitigation strategies, we suggested that the enhancement of road density may be the most efficient risk reduction strategy. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Mechanism model; Rainfall-induced debris flow; Risk reduction management","climate change; debris flow; disaster management; extreme event; general circulation model; rainfall; risk assessment; socioeconomic status; strategic approach; watershed; Beijing [China]; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067258984

This paper describes a controlled synthesis of cake-like porous TiO2 photocatalyst with surface-localized doping of copper and cobalt by using a well-defined MIL-125(Ti) metal organic framework as template precursor. The series of the modified TiO2 photocatalysts present the improved activity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction with water vapor. It is found that 1%Cu-doped TiO2 shows an enhanced behavior for breaking C=O bonds. In this case, the outcomes are primarily CO and CH4, yielding up to 135.94 and 127.05 μmol, respectively, under the irradiation of simulated sunlight for 3 h. The performance can be further improved by incorporating trace cobalt. Besides the improved property for CO and CH4 production, the selectivity also shifts to high-value hydrocarbons (C2+). The yields for C2H6 and C3H8 can be up to 267.60 and 10.07 μmol, respectively, by using 0.02%Co-1%Cu/TiO2. Our in situ Fourier transform infrared spectra together with theoretical calculations indicate that efficient charge separation on copper and cobalt ions is achieved. This altered charge behavior leads to the generation and enrichment of methyl radicals on the surface of cobalt ions, giving rise to the production of C2+ hydrocarbons.

A change in the concentration of soil DOM leads to changes in the soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools and the emergence of potential pollution. Many studies have reported that the concentrations of soil DOM could be significantly influenced by land management practices. However, the results obtained from these studies are inconsistent, and the effects of environmental factors on the responses of DOM concentrations to such management practices remain unclear. The aims of this study were to: (1) synthesize the available datasets and elucidate the general patterns of changes in soil DOM concentrations in response to different land management practices; and (2) probe how the responses of DOM concentrations to management practices were affected by environmental factors (e.g., altitude, climate, and soil properties). Data from 942 observations in 184 publications were collected, integrated, and statistically analyzed. The meta-analysis result shows that overall, N fertilization, liming, organic amendment addition, and vegetation cover significantly increased the concentrations of soil DOM, whereas tillage decreased DOC concentrations. The magnitude of all positive and negative effects was driven by implemented management practices. Generally, a threshold range might exist for the application rate and duration of the management measures that could cause significant changes in DOM concentrations. In addition, DOC concentrations were more responsive to N fertilization and liming than were DON concentrations, indicating that the changes in the two variables were not correlated in each management practice. The results also indicate that the responses of DOM concentrations to management practices could be regulated by the altitude, climate (e.g., mean annual temperature and precipitation), and soil property factors (e.g., total C, total N, C:N ratio, clay content, and initial soil pH). In conclusion, our study suggests that in order to maintain proper soil DOM concentrations in an ecosystem, not only the type and implementation of management practices but also the local environmental factors should be considered when proposing a land management plan. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","DOC; DON; Environmental factors; Land management practices; Meta-analysis","Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Dissolution; Environmental management; Land use; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Organic carbon; Soils; Dissolved organic carbon; Dissolved organic matters; Dissolved organic nitrogen; Environmental factors; Land management practices; Mean annual temperatures; Meta analysis; Positive and negative effect; Soil pollution; best management practice; concentration (composition); dissolved organic carbon; dissolved organic matter; dissolved organic nitrogen; environmental factor; land management; meta-analysis; pH; soil carbon; soil property; vegetation cover",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062482651

Most cotton fields in this region are drip irrigated with plastic film mulch. However, few studies have tested the performance of the DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) model on cotton under film-mulched drip irrigation. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the modified CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton model and determine the genetic coefficients of cotton using data from different irrigation treatments conducted at the irrigation experiment station in Bayingol Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture, Korla, China. Based on the selected genetic coefficients, the model was calibrated using field experiment datasets in 2016 and validated using datasets in 2015. The simulation results of soil water content, leaf area index, phenological period and cotton yield were compared with their corresponding measurements. Absolute relative error (ARE) of seeding emergence date, flowing date, maturity date and cotton yield simulated by the original model were 5.8%, 7.3%, 5.0% and 70.6%, respectively, while those of the modified model were 1.7%, 1.1%, 1.1% and 0.1%, respectively. Simulated leaf area index agreed well with the field observations with the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) &gt; 0.739, the index of agreement (d) &gt; 0.910 and the root mean square error (RMSE) &lt; 0.965. Simulated soil water content in the 20–40 cm soil layer were generally consistent with the measured values with R 2 = 0.724, d = 0.639 and RMSE = 0.087 cm 3 /cm 3 , while the simulated soil water content in the 40–60 cm was slightly worse than the observations with R 2 = 0.708, d = 0.519 and RMSE = 0.109 cm 3 /cm 3 . Overall, the modified CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton model can be used as a practical tool to simulate the cotton growth under film-mulched drip irrigation in this region.

However, the majority of passengers lean to find local drivers, but querying a remote cloud server leads to an unnecessary communication overhead and an increased response delay. Recently, fog computing is introduced to provide local data processing with low latency, but it also raises new security and privacy concerns because users' private information (e.g., identity and location) could be disclosed when these information are shared during carpooling. While they can be encrypted before transmission, it makes user matching a challenging task and malicious users can upload false locations. Moreover, carpooling records should be kept in a distributed manner to guarantee reliable data auditability. To address these problems, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving carpooling scheme using blockchain-assisted vehicular fog computing to support conditional privacy, one-to-many matching, destination matching, and data auditability. Specifically, we authenticate users in a conditionally anonymous way. Also, we adopt private proximity test to achieve one-to-many proximity matching and extend it to efficiently establish a secret communication key between a passenger and a driver. We store all location grids into a tree and achieve get-off location matching using a range query technique. A private blockchain is built to store carpooling records. Finally, we analyze the security and privacy properties of the proposed scheme, and evaluate its performance in terms of computational costs and communication overhead. © 2014 IEEE.","Blockchain; Carpooling; Fog computing; Security and privacy; User matching","Authentication; Blockchain; Cloud computing; Cryptography; Data privacy; Edge computing; Fog; Location; Servers; Traffic congestion; Vehicles; Carpooling; Communication overheads; Computational costs; Conditional privacies; Private information; Secret communications; Security and privacy; User Matching; Fog computing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052832203

Thus, low-carbon development is an important measure to solve economic, energy and environmental problems. To analyse low-emission development, this paper clarifies the evolutionary characteristics of CO2 emissions and the decoupling relationship between GDP and CO2 emissions based on the latest available data from 2000 to 2015. The results indicate that CO2 emissions of Pingdingshan and Changzhi are higher in the same year. The ratios from coal consumption accounting for the total CO2 emissions are clearly bigger than from other energy types and industrial processes. Changzhi, Luoyang and Pingdingshan have reached their peaks. Five cities have experienced strong decoupling after 2010, 13 cities present weak decoupling, 4 cities present growth connection, and 7 cities show growth negative decoupling. It can be concluded that a relatively smaller proportion of industry and strict policy implementations of coal reduction are the main factors in inhibiting the decoupling. So the proportion of coal purification should be increased firstly. Then, the energy consumption structure should be changed from the traditional coal consumption structure to coal, oil and gas. Lastly, economic means can be used to control CO2 emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Decoupling analysis; Emission intensity; Per capita CO2 emissions","Agglomeration; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal industry; Economics; Energy utilization; Urban growth; CO2 emissions; Decoupling analysis; Emission intensity; Energy consumption structure; Environmental problems; High energy consumption; Low-carbon development; Policy implementations; Industrial emissions; agglomeration; carbon emission; economic growth; emission control; environmental economics; urban economy; Changzhi; China; Henan; Luoyang; Pingdingshan; Shanxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063990395

However, China is a vast territory, and the spread of regional economic development is extremely uneven. Therefore, the responsibility for emission reductions undertaken by each region cannot be allocated equally. In response to this problem, this study proposes an emission permit allocation model that is built from the perspective of efficiency and energy conservation and emission reduction (ECER) technology. Compared with other models, the model proposed in this study has two innovations. First, the model allows central decision makers to adjust the emission reduction index under various conditions and for various reasons. This further allows the total emissions reduction amounts to be adjusted. Second, the proposed model could also allocate emission permits from the perspective of ECER technology. An empirical study on the allocation of SO2 emission permits at provincial level in China shows the following: (a) The overall ECER level in China is low, and there are significant differences in ECER efficiency in different regions. (b) Significant differences in ECER technologies exist in different regions of China. In particular, the ECER technology standards in China’s northeast region are far below the national average. (c) Each province’s emission reduction targets should be reasonably set, based on actual production conditions. If excessive emission reduction targets are set, it becomes unreasonably difficult to complete the emission reduction task. © The Author(s) 2019.","efficiency; emission permits; energy saving and emission reduction; metafrontier; technology gap",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071322418

The empirical results showed that high-tech industry, FDI, population and carbon emissions have spatial dependence and spatial agglomeration effects. High-tech industries, FDI and population have a spatial spillover effect on carbon emissions.

Cement production being the most energy- and emission-intensive activity in concrete manufacture, the partial replacement of cement clinker with supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), which require less intensive processing, is the effective approach. Due to the unbalanced source distribution of commonly-used SCMs, e.g. fly ash (FA) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), this study analyzed the substitution of Portland cement (PC) in mortar and concrete mixes with up to 40% of the highly-reactive pozzolanic diatomaceous earth (DE) with abundant deposit in western United States and many other countries, aiming to provide an alternative SCM with local availability in many regions of limited FA and GGBFS supply. The influence of DE on the density, compressive strength, workability, soundness, and environmental impacts of the production of a mix was studied at different substitution levels in binary, ternary, and quaternary systems. DE-containing mixes showed improved strength development and early properties suitable for general applications. The approach of life-cycle assessment quantified the influence of DE on environmental impacts from material production, processing, and transportation in mortar or concrete manufacture. Substitution of PC with DE at 30 wt% resulted in over ∼30% lower global warming potential and energy use as well as appreciably reduction in air pollutant emissions. The use of DE as SCMs in concrete is promising, worth the consideration regarding availability and cost. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Diatomaceous earth; Global warming potential; Green concrete; High early strength; Life-cycle assessment; Material efficiency","Air pollution; Blast furnaces; Compressive strength; Concretes; Energy utilization; Fly ash; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Lime; Materials handling; Mechanical properties; Mortar; Portland cement; Processing; Slags; Diatomaceous earth; Global warming potential; Green concrete; High early strength; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Material efficiency; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063346096

However, the interaction between soil water and carbon in deep soil (&gt;1 m below surface) remains poorly understood. The present study used the chronosequence approach to investigate water extraction and carbon input by roots to a depth of 25.2 m in 8-, 11-, 15-, 18-, and 22-year-old afforested apple (Malus pumila Mill.) orchard stands in a sub-humid region of the Chinese Loess Plateau. Three long-term cultivated farmlands were used as a benchmark of soil water and carbon status before land use change. Measurements showed that the apple trees accessed deep soil water reserves by growing deep roots, with the resulting desiccated soil possibly stimulating apple trees to extend their roots into deeper, moister soil. Accordingly, soil water content in the root zone decreased progressively with increasing stand age. For example, the roots of apple trees in the 22-year-old stand extended to 23.2 m below the soil surface and extracted 1530 ± 43 mm deep soil water. Consequently, carbon input from root biomass correlated well with the water storage loss in deep soil (R 2 = 0.88). Deep roots accounted for 49 ± 22% of the total root biomass and contributed 0.44 ± 0.15 Mg C ha −1 yr −1 to the deep soil. However, the roots of apple trees did not significantly change the soil organic carbon content in the root zone possibly because there was limited root biomass per unit soil depth and because soil water content in the root zone gradually decreased. These findings demonstrate the importance of deep soil in regulating water and carbon cycles, advancing our understanding of interactions among water, roots, and carbon in this zone. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon sequestration; Deep root; Deep soil; Root water uptake; Soil water storage","Biomass; Carbon capture; Cultivation; Farms; Forestry; Fruits; Land use; Organic carbon; Soil moisture; Carbon sequestration; Deep roots; Deep soils; Root-water uptake; Soil water storage; Extraction; organic carbon; soil organic matter; soil water; carbon; water; afforestation; biomass; carbon sequestration; chronosequence; land use change; soil organic matter; soil water; water storage; water uptake; Article; biomass; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; chronosequence; controlled study; cultivated land; desiccation; extraction; land use; Malus pumila; nonhuman; orchard; particle size; plant root; priority journal; soil depth; soil moisture; soil water content; water absorption; agriculture; biomass; carbon sequestration; chemistry; ecosystem; Malus; physiology; plant root; soil; China; Loess Plateau; Malus pumila; Malus x domestica; Agriculture; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Ecosystem; Malus; Plant Roots; Soil; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063185959

To investigate these potential issues, five instruments reporting BC were compared in well-mixed smoke during the FIREX laboratory campaign in 2016, including two filter-based absorption instruments; one in situ absorption instrument; a laser-induced incandescence instrument; and a thermal-optical instrument. BB aerosols were generated using fuels common to wildfires in the Western US in a relatively controlled environment, with BC concentrations ranging from roughly 10–100 μg m−3 (55 total fires). Applying the Bland-Altman graphical approach, systematic biases and proportional biases were identified between the selected reference instrument (in situ absorption) and the other four instruments. BC emission factors (EFBC) derived from the thermal-optical instrument, laser-induced incandescence instrument, and filter-based absorption instruments were, on average, 83%, 39% and 66%, greater than the in situ absorption instrument, respectively. To understand why these differences exist, principal component analysis combined with a K-means clustering algorithm was implemented to group different fires into three clusters based on several co-dependent fire-related parameters (modified combustion efficiency (MCE), single scattering albedo (SSA) at 870 nm, organic carbon/elemental carbon ratio (OC/EC ratio), and absorption Ångström exponents (AAE)); clusters are nominally referred to as “Black”, “Mixed”, and “Brown” based on the mean SSA and AAE values for each. The best agreement among all instruments was observed for the “Black” cluster (mean EFBC ratio = 1.89, for the fires with mean SSA = 0.31 and AAE = 1.44); this agreement worsened for the “Mixed” (mean EFBC ratio = 2.94, for the fires with mean SSA = 0.80 and AAE = 1.92) and “Brown” clusters (mean EFBC ratio = 3.12, for the fires with mean SSA = 0.96 and AAE = 2.50), likely due to the increased presence of externally (or internally) mixed aerosols that altered the chemical and optical properties of the aerosols. In general, the discrepancies observed among the BC instruments from this work agree with or slightly exceed the ones from previous ambient and laboratory studies. Care should be taken when interpreting different BC measurements in BB smoke because large artifacts can occur due to co-emitted materials. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"Aerosols; Fires; Optical instruments; Optical properties; Organic carbon; Principal component analysis; Smoke; Biomass burning emissions; Combustion efficiencies; Controlled environment; Laser induced incandescence; Measurement techniques; Organic carbon/elemental carbon ratios; Reference instruments; Single scattering albedo; K-means clustering; black carbon; carbon; fuel; organic carbon; absorption; aerosol property; albedo; biomass burning; black carbon; emission; instrumentation; laboratory method; measurement method; absorption; aerosol; albedo; Article; artifact; biomass; biomass burning; combustion; comparative study; incandescence; modified combustion efficiency; optics; priority journal; single scattering albedo; wildfire; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062861663

To reduce the residential energy consumption, relevant policies and measures have been formulated in different places. However, due to the lack of adequate information in the process of policy formulation, the effectiveness of most energy-saving policies for residential buildings seems to be unsatisfactory. Although previous studies have analyzed the energy consumption for a single building or for the whole construction industry at the national level, few of them investigated the life-cycle energy consumption of residential buildings at the city level. Since municipal governments are the key implementers for the reduction of urban energy consumption, a city-level analysis on the energy consumption of residential buildings is highly needed for the policy making. To fill the research gap, this paper develops a life-cycle dynamic simulation model to fully reveal the characteristics of energy consumption of residential buildings at the city level. This easy-to-use model is validated by a case study of Beijing, which demonstrates its applicability and capability to help analyze multiple indicators of residential energy consumption and the dynamic trends of these indicators for municipal governments. Furthermore, the model can be used under the condition of limited input data, and can provide the situation analysis and simulation results of energy consumption of urban residential buildings for facilitating the policy making by municipal governments. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy consumption; Life cycle; Residential buildings; Simulation model; System dynamics","building; carbon emission; construction industry; life cycle analysis; numerical model; policy making; residential energy; residential location; simulation; urban area; article; building industry; China; energy consumption; government; life cycle; management; simulation; building industry; city; housing; Beijing [China]; China; carbon; Beijing; Carbon; Cities; Construction Industry; Housing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063913649

Thirty-five experts have been interviewed for prioritizing four categories of CEVs including electric, gas, methanol and ethanol vehicles from both the national and provincial perspectives. Results demonstrate that electric vehicles represent the highest ranking, followed by gas, methanol and ethanol vehicles.

On their own, these experiments are often small in scale and highly localized, embodying a piecemeal approach to urban development and climate governance. In this paper, I examine the relationship between urban experimentation and policy mobilities to understand how these projects have broader significance for climate governance and urban development. Drawing together empirical data from a multisited case study of smart grid experiments in Austin, Texas; Boulder, Colorado; and Chicago, Illinois, I show how governmental rationalities are mobilized, mutated, and transmitted in the processes of urban learning, extrospection, and consultation. While the imperative of cities to respond to climate change is ever more central to urban politics and governance, I find that the logics of experimentation are tied to specific governmental rationalities and norms of conduct that embed limited notions of citizen involvement and engagement in policy. The paper outlines how three elements of an Austin smart grid model—users as test-bed, test-bed as platform, and test-bed as epistemology—reinforce these logics and rationalities. The implications for urban climate and energy governance are outlined stressing three synergies between urban experiments and policy mobilities approaches. © The Author(s) 2018.","experimentation; policy mobilities; Smart grid; test-bed; urban governance","energy planning; experimental study; governance approach; policy analysis; smart grid; urban area; urban development; Austin [Texas]; Boulder; Chicago; Colorado; Illinois; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059080038

It would be a mistake, however, to assume that public support for decarbonization can be gained automatically by pointing out threats from climate change, particularly in light of the role coal plays in the local and national economy and in energy security. In this article we search for factors affecting public support for a coal phase-out in media content. According to the theory of agenda setting, the media establishes problems calling for solutions and influences public perceptions of the (un)importance of those problems. We illustrate this case on the example of the Czech Republic. The paper demonstrates that Czech media has cultivated a discursive environment in which coal mining is separated from coal combustion, neglecting the inevitable interconnection of these two processes; coal consumption is not characterized as an environmental problem; and the economic problems of private companies more easily become public problems, making future coal phase-out policies harder to implement. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agenda setting; Coal mining; Czech Republic; Decarbonization; Discourse; Media","Climate change; Coal; Coal mines; Decarbonization; Energy security; Agenda settings; Coal mining; Czech Republic; Discourse; Media; Coal combustion; climate change; coal mining; consumption behavior; energy use; European Union; future prospect; media role; Czech Republic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062340044

Focusing on the perennial grass Elymus elymoides, a native species common to sagebrush steppe communities in the Western United States, we asked if seed and seedling traits could predict field establishment. We collected seeds from 34 populations from the western Great Basin. In greenhouse studies, we measured variation in seed and seedling characteristics of wild populations and one cultivar. We also quantified abiotic conditions at the collection location and asked if these characteristics predicted survival and other fitness metrics at five planting sites. Planting sites were all near-monocultures of the invasive annual grass Bromus tectorum, and all sites experienced similar, below-average precipitation during the experiment. Phenotypic traits were strongly correlated with performance across all sites, with remarkably high predictive power. Seeds from populations with longer roots, larger seeds and earlier emergence were significantly more likely to survive the first growing season (R2 = 0.66, p &lt; 0.0001). In contrast, while some abiotic variables at the collection location (e.g. 30-year average summer precipitation and fall minimum temperatures) were associated with field performance at some sites, abiotic variables explained less variation in performance than traits (average R2 = 0.22). Despite the low predictive power of abiotic variables, populations that performed best at each field site were from locations with climate variables similar to planting sites. Synthesis and applications. The best seed sources for restoration of Elymus elymoides in invaded sites were populations with longer roots, larger seeds and earlier emergence. These easily measured traits were strong predictors of survival in disturbed field sites. While the most successful populations were found in areas with similar abiotic conditions as planting sites, there was phenotypic variation even among populations originating from locations with similar conditions. Thus, our results indicate that abiotic conditions are important considerations when selecting seeds, but these conditions may not sufficiently predict which populations will establish. Understanding population differences in seedling functional traits can improve predictions of restoration success. © 2019 The Authors.

Over the past few decades in northern Alaska, emergent macrophytes have increased in cover and density, coincident with increased air and water temperature, active layer depth, and nutrient availability. Unraveling the covarying climate and environmental controls influencing long-term change trajectories is paramount for advancing our predictive understanding of the causes and consequences of warming in permafrost ecosystems. Within a climate-controlled carbon flux monitoring system, we evaluate the impact of elevated nutrient availability associated with degraded permafrost (high-treatment) and maximum field observations (low-treatment), on aquatic macrophyte growth and methane (CH4) emissions. Nine aquatic Arctophila fulva-dominated tundra monoliths were extracted from tundra ponds near Utqiaġvik, Alaska, and placed in growth chambers that controlled ambient conditions (i.e., light, temperature, and water table), while measuring plant growth (periodically) and CH4 fluxes (continuously) for 12 weeks. Results indicate that high nutrient treatments similar to that released from permafrost thaw can increase macrophyte biomass and total CH4 emission by 54 and 64%, respectively. However, low treatments did not respond to fertilization. We estimate that permafrost thaw in tundra wetlands near Utqiaġvik have the potential to enhance regional CH4 efflux by 30%. This study demonstrates the sensitivity of arctic tundra wetland biogeochemistry to nutrient release from permafrost thaw and suggests the decadal-scale expansion of A. fulva-dominant aquatic plant communities, and increased CH4 emissions in the region were likely in response to thawing permafrost, potentially representing a novel case study of the permafrost carbon feedback to warming. ©2019.

Therefore, we weathered pressure treated lumber for 18 months in five different climates across the continental United States. Copper release was quantified every month and local weather conditions were recorded continuously to determine the extent to which local climate regulated the release of copper from this nano-enabled product during its use phase. Two distinct release trends were observed: In cooler, wetter climates release occurred primarily during the first few months of weathering, as the result of copper leaching from surface/near-surface areas. In warmer, drier climates, less copper was initially released due to limited precipitation. However, as the wood dried and cracked, the exposed copper-bearing surface area increased, leading to increased copper release later in the product lifetime. Single-particle-ICP-MS results from laboratory prepared MCA-wood leachate solutions indicated that a) the predominant form of released copper passed through a filter smaller than 0.45 micrometers and b) released particles were largely resistant to dissolution over the course of 6 wks. Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) testing was conducted on nonweathered and weathered MCA-wood samples to simulate landfill conditions during their end-of-life (EoL) phase and revealed that MCA wood released <10% of initially embedded copper. Findings from this study provide data necessary to complete a more comprehensive evaluation of the environmental and human health impacts introduced through release of copper from pressure treated lumber utilizing life cycle assessment (LCA). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate; Copper nanoparticles; Life cycle assessment; Micronized copper azole; Single-particle ICP-MS","Copper deposits; Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; Leachate treatment; Leaching; Life cycle; Lumber; Mass spectrometers; Nanotechnology; Weathering; Wood preservation; Climate; Copper nanoparticles; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Micronized copper azoles; Single particle; Copper; copper; copper; dissolution; environmental conditions; inductively coupled plasma method; leaching; life cycle analysis; nanomaterial; surface area; weathering; Article; chemical modification; climate; controlled study; cooling; dissolution; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; leaching; life cycle assessment; lifespan; nonhuman; precipitation; pressure; priority journal; surface area; trend study; United States; weathering; wood; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062463649

Averaged across all eleven metros, residential energy conservation mandates could reduce residential CO 2 emissions in 2030 by an average of 30 percent over and above 2010 levels. In terms of implementation, residential conservation standards were found to be goal-effective, cost-effective, scale-effective, and in the case of new construction standards, reasonably resistant to local political pushback. Local compact growth programs do not perform as well. If accompanied by aggressive efforts to get drivers out of their cars, compact growth programs could reduce auto-based 2030 CO 2 emissions by as much as 25 percent over and above any emissions reductions attributable to higher fuel economy standards. Unaccompanied by modal diversion programs, the stand-alone potential for local compact growth programs to reduce auto-based CO 2 emissions falls into a more modest range of 0 to 7 percent depending on the metropolitan area. Based on past performance, local compact growth programs are also likely to have problems in terms of their goal- and scale-efficiency, and their potential to incur political pushback. © The Author(s) 2017.","energy conservation mandates; greenhouse gas reduction; infill development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061843197

The OPO technology is an old technology, but still an excellent choice as light source for PA spectroscopy. The advantages are their molecular specificity due to large wavelength tunability (1.5 to 5μ), high energy output, cost-effectiveness and compactness [1]. The tunability of OPOs together with PA allow for multi-gas detection of several components with common signal processing and data analysis. MIR OPOs can operate in different configurations both pulsed and continuous wave (CW). The pulsed operation results in high peak power, potentially nonlinear absorption effects and a normalized noise equivalent absorption that is not extreme. We demonstrate a novel miniaturized PA trace gas analyzer platform integrated with a MIR OPO targeting the major market opportunity of environmental monitoring and breath analysis [2,3]. We demonstrate that a miniaturized photoacoustic spectroscopic (PAS) cell can be excited resonantly with the MIR OPO by adjusting the laser pulse repetition rate to match the acoustic resonance of the PAS cell. The application of the gas sensor for real time environmental measurements and breath analysis is demonstrated using three samples of gas concentration; 100 ppmV of methane (CH4), 100 ppmV of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and approximately 1000 ppmV ammonia (NH3) in atmospheric air with a humidity of 40% [3]. A gas flow rate of 300 ml/min through the PAS cell was applied for the three samples. These gases are well-known environmental trace gases and biomarkers in exhaled breath. The gases cause environmental degradation through their effects on soil acidification, eutrophication, and stratospheric ozone depletion. The presence of ammonia in the environment is mainly due to the degradation of animal waste, industrial processes and diesel exhaust. NO2 is a toxic gas and a regulated air pollutant that possess a serious risk for human health. Monitoring them in human breath is also particularly relevant as they are potential cancer biomarkers.

Various national and provincial level authorities are aggressively promoting renewable energy expansion, resulting in new geographies of renewable energy. The expansion of renewable energy, particularly large-scale projects, is contingent upon access to natural resources. However, areas that have high natural resource endowment for renewable energy, often have other overlapping uses of natural resources, including livelihoods and biodiversity. And renewable energy projects located in these areas compete with these other multiple uses of natural resources, often leading to unintended consequences. This study employs ethnographic methods to analyse the case of local opposition to a 113 MW wind power project, located in the Western Ghats of India. India, an emerging economy, is the fourth largest producer of wind energy worldwide and is expanding the share of renewable energy through national as well as provincial level policies. The Western Ghats are a designated UNESCO world heritage site for their exceptional biodiversity and the wind power project conflicted with natural resource-based livelihoods of indigenous populations and threatened their subsistence agricultural practices along with posing a threat to the ecology of the landscape. As a result, local activists protested against the wind power project and this contestation was animated and influenced by a variety of public, civic and private actors and institutions across scale. This paper uses insights from political ecology and energy geography to shed light on the interaction between these multiple actors and how this interaction mediated the contestations around renewable energy. It focuses on the micropolitics of this contestation to highlight the social and political processes that underpin the transition to sustainable energy. It sheds light on local struggles and contestations around renewable energy projects in conjunction with national and global commitments and shows how contestations around renewable energy in the Global South are distinct from the largely prevalent NIMBY approaches in the developed countries. This study contributes to global debates around governing renewable energy, particularly in developing countries. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062804893

We document 286 L. catta that were held in illegal captive conditions in Madagascar. Coastal tourist destinations are ""hot spots"" for sightings. Many of the L. catta reported were in businesses (49%) and were perceived to be held captive for the purpose of generating income (41%). Infant/juvenile L. catta were overwhelmingly observed annually in December (41%) and may suffer high mortality rates given that they are not weaned during this month of the year. Population growth modeling suggests that known capture rates may be sustainable in all but small populations of 500 individuals and when infants/juveniles are targeted. However, of the seven remaining populations of L. catta with more than 100 individuals, only one is known to contain more than 500 animals, and we present evidence here that infants/juveniles are targeted. Moreover L. catta face significant other threats including habitat loss, bushmeat hunting, and climate change. Several actions could reduce the illegal capture and ownership of L. catta in Madagascar such as tourist behavior change initiatives, enforcement of laws, and alternative livelihoods for local people.

Bromeliads have high diversity throughout the Neotropics, but they have been negatively affected by habitat loss and fragmentation, climate change, invasive species, and commercialization for ornamental purpose. These plants provide direct benefits to the human society, and they also form microecosystems in which accumulated water and nutrients support the communities of aquatic and terrestrial species, thus maintaining local diversity. We performed a systematic review of the contribution of bromeliads to ecosystem services across their native geographical distribution. We showed that bromeliads provide a range of ecosystem services such as maintenance of biodiversity, community structure, nutrient cycling, and the provisioning of food and water. Moreover, bromeliads can regulate the spread of diseases, and water and carbon cycling, and they have the potential to become important sources of chemical and pharmaceutical products. The majority of this research was performed in Brazil, but future research from other Neotropical countries with a high diversity of bromeliads would fill the current knowledge gaps and increase the generality of these findings. This systematic review identified that future research should focus on provisioning, regulating, and cultural services that have been currently overlooked. This would enhance our understanding of how bromeliad diversity contributes to human welfare, and the negative consequences that loss of bromeliad plants can have on communities of other species and the healthy functioning of the entire ecosystems. © 2019 The Authors.

We use East Asia as a case study to estimate the importance of national environmental policies in terms of reduction in fossil fuel carbon emissions (FFCO 2 ). We show that the flagship policies of China, Japan, South Korea and Mongolia in the 2010s were generally beneficial in terms of slowing down FFCO 2 growth rates. When flagship polices were enacted, annual FFCO 2 growth rate has either slowed down by 1% (South Korea), 5% (Mongolia), 8% (China) or even resulted in a decline (Japan) comparing to prior periods. We find that the 12th Five-Year Plan (12th FYP) of China had the strongest footprint in FFCO 2 emission dynamics across East Asia in 2010s. The recent slowest rate of FFCO 2 growth across East Asia (2011–2015) temporally corresponds to the 12th FYP. This regional pattern of FFCO 2 dynamics is driven by decrements in annual growth of FFCO 2 , coal use and cement production of China (all ˜8% per yer decrease) during the 12th FYP. Using compound periodical growth of FFCO 2 emissions, we provide two baseline projections of emission distribution in East Asia, by assuming that all policies are enacted (policy-on) or not (policy-off) in the future. The projections show that policies were beneficial since policy-on scenario results in 24%, 80%, 166% less FFCO 2 emissions than in policy-off scenario in East Asia by 2020, 2025 and 2030 respectively. This progress is yet insufficient for reaching NDC goals by 2030. Even in policy-on scenario in 2030, East Asian countries would either experience insufficient decline of FFCO 2 like Japan (-13% of FFCO 2 comparing to pledged -17%) or increase of FFCO 2 like South Korea (11%) and Mongolia (4%) comparing to 2010 level. For China, due to lack of economy-independent goals, we were unable to assess NDC target compliance. We demonstrate that China will remain as the major FFCO 2 emitter of EA in near future in any projection. For China, the highest emission cluster will remain at the Eastern Provinces with the strongest power generation demand. These provinces would be responsible for 43% and 52% of FFCO 2 emissions in East Asia in policy-off and policy-on scenarios. We concluded that the current efforts of national flagship environmental policies are beneficial but not sufficient for reaching ambitious carbon reduction goals like Paris Agreement. This study once again underlined the necessity in the supranational framework that may control the carbon abatement goals in East Asia. Without the supranational framework, achievements in carbon emission reductions are strongly hindered by the socioeconomic environment and the regional (or sectoral) emphasis of carbon reduction activities within a national economy. © 2019 The Authors","Carbon abatement; Carbon emissions; East Asia","carbon; carbon dioxide; cement; coal; fossil fuel; Article; carbon footprint; China; combustion; energy consumption; environmental policy; Japan; Mongolia; priority journal; South Korea; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063549158

One such technology is warm mix asphalt (WMA) which reduces the mixing and compaction temperatures of the pavement materials leading to less energy consumption, fewer emissions, better workability, and reduced aging. One of the WMA techniques is foaming of bitumen which works on the concept of injecting cold water into the asphalt binder in order to create foam. In this study, conducted in the Rajasthan state of India, tests were conducted to adjudge the strength and moisture susceptibility of foamed bitumen-treated reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP). Eighty-four percent RAP was mixed with 15% stone dust and 1% active filler; and trials were conducted to determine the optimum percentage of foamed bitumen and water to be injected. Indirect tensile strength tests (wet and dry) were conducted and the results were found to be within satisfactory ranges. Tensile strength ratio was also calculated and established to be under permissible limits. This study shows the utilization of reclaimed asphalt pavements as a sustainable measure for road construction having fewer adversities on the environment by re-using the old pavement materials. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2019.","Foam bitumen; ITS; Moisture susceptibility; RAP; Sustainable road construction; TSR; WMA",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068174452

The aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of global climate change on carbon balance of plant communities of South Asia. To achieve this objective, the spatial model of global carbon cycle developed by the Computing Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS CC) was used to calculate the impact of industrial CO2 emissions as well as the main causes of carbon losses in the investigated region (deforestation and soil erosion) on the dynamics of carbon accumulation in the humus and phytomass of forest ecosystems. India was selected as a model country to assess and compare the compensatory functions of plant communities. On the basis of the spatial mathematical model of the global carbon cycle in the biosphere, changes in CO emissions as a result of burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and soil erosion associated with improper land use in South Asia were estimated. The impact of deforestation and soil erosion on climate change in South Asia is forecast up to the year 2060. A comparison of regulatory functions of different types of plant communities was performed for the study area. The calculations data revealed some regularities occurring in the ecosystems of South Asia under the impact of CO2 emissions, deforestation, and soil erosion due to improper land use. Mathematical modelling has shown the dependence of growth of humus and phytomass of vegetation on the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Quantitative forecast of the dynamics of the ecosystem characteristics of plant communities depending on the growing region has been performed. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

This study assesses the climate impact of Finnish air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions from 2000 to 2010, as well as future emissions until 2030. We consider both emission pulses and emission scenarios. The pollutants included are SO2, NOx, NH3, non-methane volatile organic compound (NMVOC), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), CO, CO2, CH4 and N2O, and our study is the first one for Finland to include all of them in one coherent dataset. These pollutants have different atmospheric lifetimes and influence the climate differently; hence, we look at different climate metrics and time horizons. The study uses the global warming potential (GWP and GWP), the global temperature change potential (GTP) and the regional temperature change potential (RTP) with different timescales for estimating the climate impacts by species and sectors globally and in the Arctic. We compare the climate impacts of emissions occurring in winter and summer. This assessment is an example of how the climate impact of emissions from small countries and sources can be estimated, as it is challenging to use climate models to study the climate effect of national policies in a multi-pollutant situation. Our methods are applicable to other countries and regions and present a practical tool to analyze the climate impacts in multiple dimensions, such as assessing different sectors and mitigation measures. While our study focuses on short-lived climate forcers, we found that the CO2 emissions have the most significant climate impact, and the significance increases over longer time horizons. In the short term, emissions of especially CH4 and BC played an important role as well. The warming impact of BC emissions is enhanced during winter. Many metric choices are available, but our findings hold for most choices. © 2019 Author(s).",,"aerosol composition; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; carbon emission; climate effect; greenhouse gas; organic carbon; temperature effect; volatile organic compound; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067261352

Understanding plant-climate interactions and the impact of climate change, rising CO 2 , land use change, deforestation and fire on vegetation has become a major challenge for ecologists. Therefore, developing the capacity to project vegetation change is of critical importance if we are to mitigate and efficiently adapt to climate change impacts. The lack of an accurate representation of different vegetation types and ecosystem processes at regional scale is a main source of uncertainty in Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs). This manifests in a lack of key growth forms such as bamboo, lianas and mangroves and biome types such as savanna which are essential components of ecosystems in South Asia. Plant communities like mangroves and bamboos, despite covering just small areas, account for high carbon sequestration whereas lianas can decrease carbon sequestration capacity of host trees. Here, we review the current state of vegetation modeling for South Asia and we propose a research agenda for an improved representation of biome diversity in DGVMs. We account for both the traditional plant functional type (PFT) approach and for the functional trait (FT) approach that considers growing knowledge on plant-trait variability and eco-evolutionary principles of different plant communities. We argue that an adequate representation of different vegetation types and growth forms characteristic of South Asian biomes is necessary in DGVMs for robust assessments of climate change impacts on their distribution, diversity and carbon budget. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","aDGVM; Biomes; Climate change; Diversity; Dynamic global vegetation model; Functional traits; PFT; Savanna; South Asia","Bamboo; Budget control; Carbon; Climate models; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Land use; Vegetation; aDGVM; Biomes; Diversity; Functional traits; Savanna; South Asia; Vegetation model; Climate change; carbon; biodiversity; biome; climate change; climate effect; functional morphology; global change; savanna; vegetation dynamics; bamboo; biodiversity; biome; carbon cycle; climate change; deciduous plant; dynamic global vegetation model; evergreen rain forest; forest; grassland; liana; mangrove; nonbiological model; nonhuman; plant community; priority journal; Review; savanna; scrub; South Asia; thicket forest; thorny forest; tropical rain forest; vegetation; South Asia; Bambusa; Rhizophoraceae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063619308

Lepus yarkandensis is an oases-dependent Near Threatened species that lives in fragmented oasis habitats in the Taklimakan Desert, China. We investigated the geological and climatic impacts on its geographical differentiation, demographic history and influence of Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles on the evolutionary history of L. yarkandensis. Further, studied the impact of climatic oscillation based modification on phylogeography, distribution and diversification pattern of Yarkand hare by using Cytb (1140 bp), MGF (592 bp) and SPTBN1 (619 bp) markers. Ecological niche modeling (ENM) revealed the evolutionary history of this species in response to climate change during the Quaternary. Paleodistribution modeling was used to identify putative refugia and estimate their historical distributions. Results: Both historical demographic analyses and climatic niche modeling revealed strong effects of glacial climate changes, suggesting recurrent range contractions and expansions. The EBSP results indicated clear population expansion of L. yarkandensis since the Pleistocene. In the ""early Pleistocene"", the demographic expansion continued from 0.83 MYA to the last glacial period. The ENM analysis supported a wide distribution of Lepus yarkandensis at high altitudes during the last interglacial (LIG) period. During the last glacial maximum (LGM), the suitable climate was reduced and restricted to the western part of the Taklimakan Desert. Conclusions: Inland aridification, oasis evolution and river flow played major roles in the population differentiation and demographic history of Yarkand hares. Historically, the large, continuous oases in the Taklimakan Desert contained a viable and unique population of L. yarkandensis. The fragmented desert environment might have caused low gene flow between individuals or groups, thus leading to predominant genetic differentiation. The Pleistocene climatic cycles triggered the diversification and expansion of this species during cold and warm periods, respectively, leading to multiple colonization events within the Taklimakan Desert. These events might be due to the expansion of the Taklimakan Desert during the Middle Pleistocene. Yarkand hare previously occupied vast areas at low and intermediate altitudes in Xinjiang, Gansu, Shanxi, Henan and Shaanxi Provinces in China. The past aridification, climate change-induced oasis modifications, changes in river volumes and flow directions, and human activities all affected the population demography and phylogeography of the Yarkand hare. © 2019 The Author(s).","Arid Northwest China; Climate oscillations; Historical demography; Oasis change; Range shift; Taklimakan Desert; Yarkand hare","climate change; colonization; demographic history; desert; ecological modeling; fossil record; glacial-interglacial cycle; historical perspective; lagomorph; niche partitioning; oasis; phylogeography; Pleistocene; range expansion; China; Gansu; Henan; Shanxi; Taklimakan Desert; Xinjiang Uygur; Animalia; Leporidae; Lepus yarkandensis; Mammalia; mitochondrial DNA; animal; Bayes theorem; China; classification; ecosystem; evolution; genetic variation; genetics; haplotype; hare; phylogeny; phylogeography; species difference; theoretical model; time factor; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Biological Evolution; China; DNA, Mitochondrial; Ecosystem; Genetic Variation; Haplotypes; Hares; Models, Theoretical; Phylogeny; Phylogeography; Species Specificity; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066825913

We tackled the issue using three different approaches: 1) measuring carbon dioxide exchange above and below canopy with the eddy covariance technique, 2) modelling the photosynthesis of the tree canopy based on shoot chamber measurements, and 3) upscaling the forest floor photosynthesis using biomass estimates and available information on the annual cycle of photosynthetic capacity of those species. The studied ecosystem was generally a weak sink of carbon but the sink strength showed notable year-to-year variation. Total ecosystem respiration and photosynthesis indicated a clear temperature limitation for the carbon exchange. However, the increase in photosynthetic production was steeper than the increase in respiration with temperature, indicating that warm temperatures increase the sink strength and do not stimulate the total ecosystem respiration as much in the 4-year window studied. The interannual variation in the photosynthetic production of the forest stand mainly resulted from the forest floor vegetation, whereas the photosynthesis of the tree canopy seemed to be more stable from year to year. Tree canopy photosynthesis increased earlier in the spring, whereas that of the forest floor increased after snowmelt, highlighting that models for photosynthesis in the northern area should also include snow cover in order to accurately estimate the seasonal dynamics of photosynthesis in these forests. © 2019 The Author(s)","Eddy covariance; Net ecosystem exchange; Sink limitation","aboveground biomass; annual variation; canopy; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; coniferous tree; eddy covariance; forest floor; net ecosystem exchange; photosynthesis; snow cover; source-sink dynamics; subarctic region; temperature effect; treeline; vegetation cover; Finland; Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061962528

Buildings can create a sense of community and add to the character of neighborhoods and cities. They can also support communities by either directly contributing to the infrastructure requirements or indirectly by reducing their demands and creating supply and treatment systems, thus increasing capacity in community energy, water treatment and stormwater systems for others. They can also reduce wastage by recapturing heat lost through inefficient systems, sewers, and by using municipal waste as a fuel source. Buildings can use a lot of energy delivered by conventional energy sources. The reduction potential for their high energy (and water) demand always represents an opportunity to decrease the potential impacts on municipal infrastructure. It is also a significant part of the challenge to reduce or cut emissions, mitigate the effects of climate change and save on resources. The paper explains how buildings can mitigate such impacts while also acting as contributors to the infrastructure. The examples demonstrate various urban and building related design concepts combined with some essential aspects of costs and savings incurring in sustainable buildings and communities. When buildings act as infrastructure they can benefit not just the developer, occupant or owner, they can also spread those benefits to the neighborhood and community and much further-to the entire planet. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Climate change; Intelligent buildings; Water treatment; Built environment; Conventional energy sources; Increasing capacities; Municipal infrastructure; Reduction potential; Sense of community; Stormwater systems; Sustainable building; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068751472

Therefore, the π-extension of BMeSA at the 4-position reveals a strong overlap in the HOMO and a minimal overlap in the LUMO. Consequently, π-extended BMeSA derivatives exhibit longer absorbance and emission wavelengths in the order of the electron-donating abilities of their substituents at the 4-position, which is based on a decrease in an absolute HOMO-level-dependent HOMO-LUMO gap in accordance with the nodal arrangement.

The heat loads were assessed for two types of detonation engine: pulse and rotating detonation. The results were compared to experimental data published in the literature. The procedure undertaken is based on an experimental investigation of heat transfer behind a single detonation wave that was conducted using a detonation tube. Fast response thermocouples were used to measure hot gas side wall temperature and this enabled the researchers to obtain values of heat flux behind a detonation wave propagating through gaseous, homogeneous, stationary mixtures of various compositions and initial pressures. Two mixtures were studied: H2-O2 and CH4-O2. In the case of the hydrogen-oxygen mixture a theoretical investigation was also conducted, where heat flux was obtained on the basis of inviscid CFD calculations supplied with an analytical model of Sichel and David. Numerical results include the expansion wave as well as the influence of wall temperature on the detonation chamber wall heat loads. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Detonation; Detonative propulsion; Heat transfer; Pulse detonation engine; Rotating detonation engine","Aircraft engines; Combustion chambers; Detonation; Heat flux; Heat transfer; Mixtures; Propulsion; Shock waves; Thermal load; Thermocouples; Detonation chambers; Detonation engines; Detonation propagation; Experimental investigations; Hydrogen-oxygen mixtures; Numerical results; Theoretical investigations; Wall temperatures; Pulse detonation engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064832775

Thus, energy saving in buildings is a key factor of addressing climate change and associated environmental issues of Hong Kong. In January 2017, the Environment Bureau of Hong Kong Special Administration Region Government (HKSARG) published ""Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2030+"" which set target to reduce our carbon intensity by 65-70% by 2030 compared with the 2005 level. With this ambitious vision, the whole community have to further endeavour to achieve energy conservation with concrete supporting measures.

Transportation is a key component of that system, as it accounts for a significant portion of the delivered cost. One of the most critical factors affecting transportation cost is the interrelationship between feedstock sources and facility locations, including plant and off-plant transfer / storage facilities. At the same time, biomass energy sustainability is sensitive to the performance of each component in the entire process. The main goal of this study is to build a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that uses region-specific data to minimize sustainable transportation costs. This consists of economic, environmental, and societal factors. The upstream air emissions as a result of residues collection at the forest, transloading, and transportation by truck or multimodally (truck and rail), which include greenhouse gases (GHG), particulate matter (PM), and nitrogen oxides (NOx), are calculated and included in the analysis. The model was tested on a case study that evaluated transportation costs for nine alternative plant locations in the state of Wisconsin. The results revealed that when equally weighed, external (social and environmental) costs accounted for a considerable portion of total transportation cost (approximately 26–37%). The study also shows that total upstream GHG and air emissions increased as the plant capacity increased, due to the longer transportation distances, but per unit emissions decreased. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","air emissions; biomass; external costs; transportation","Air pollution; Biomass; Chemical industry; Costs; Greenhouse gases; Integer programming; Location; Nitrogen oxides; Sustainable development; Transportation; Truck transportation; Trucks; Air emissions; Alternative plant locations; Biomass transportations; External costs; Mixed integer linear programming model; Social and environmental; Sustainable transportation; Transportation analysis; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059587946

For comparative purposes, planktonic and sessile populations of L. reuteri HFI-LD5 and L. rhamnosus HFI-K2 were each exposed to fasting-state gastric fluid (FSGF, pH 2.0) for 2 h, fasting-state intestinal fluid (FSIF, pH 7.5) for 6 h, and simulated colonic fluid (SCoF, pH 7.0) for 24 h. Planktonic cell numbers of L. reuteri HFI-LD5 declined from 6.6 log10 CFU/mL to 3.2 log10 CFU/mL and L. rhamnosus HFI-K2 from 6.6 log10 CFU/mL to undetectable levels after exposure to FSGF. Limited loss in viability was observed when free-floating cells were exposed to FSIF and SCoF. Sessile populations of both strains survived and recovered from the sequential exposure to all three gastric fluids despite observed detachment of biofilm biomass and a temporary decrease in metabolic activity to below detection limits, as recorded by changes in whole-biofilm CO2 production rates. The planktonic cell-focused gut microbiome-related research has most likely caused an underestimation in the overall survival ability of microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract.

Conversely, the chemical composition of the dust particles and their role as coagulation partners impact the abundance of particulate air pollution. This results in a change in the aerosol direct radiative effect that we interpret as an anthropogenic radiative forcing associated with mineral dust-pollution interactions. Using the ECHAM/MESSy atmospheric chemistry climate model (EMAC), which combines the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy) with the European Centre Hamburg (ECHAM) climate model, including a detailed parametrisation of ageing processes and an emission scheme accounting for the chemical composition of desert soils, we study the direct radiative forcing globally and regionally, considering solar and terrestrial radiation. Our results indicate positive and negative forcings, depending on the region. The predominantly negative forcing at the top of the atmosphere over large parts of the dust belt, from West Africa to East Asia, attains a maximum of about-2 W m-2 south of the Sahel, in contrast to a positive forcing over India. Globally averaged, these forcings partially counterbalance, resulting in a net negative forcing of-0:05 W m-2, which nevertheless represents a considerable fraction (40 %) of the total dust forcing. © 2019 Author(s).",,"aerosol; aging; atmospheric pollution; chemical composition; climate modeling; coagulation; dust; parameterization; radiative forcing; East Africa; West Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066853898

Household water filters and higher-efficiency biomass-burning cookstoves have been widely promoted to improve water quality and reduce fuel use, but there is limited evidence of their health effects when delivered programmatically at scale. Methods and findings In a large-scale program in Western Province, Rwanda, water filters and portable biomass-burning natural draft rocket-style cookstoves were distributed between September and December 2014 and promoted to over 101,000 households in the poorest economic quartile in 72 (of 96) randomly selected sectors in Western Province. To assess the effects of the intervention, between August and December, 2014, we enrolled 1,582 households that included a child under 4 years from 174 randomly selected village-sized clusters, half from intervention sectors and half from nonintervention sectors. At baseline, 76% of households relied primarily on an improved source for drinking water (piped, borehole, protected spring/ well, or rainwater) and over 99% cooked primarily on traditional biomass-burning stoves. We conducted follow-up at 3 time-points between February 2015 and March 2016 to assess reported diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs) among children &lt;5 years in the preceding 7 days (primary outcomes) and patterns of intervention use, drinking water quality, and air quality. The intervention reduced the prevalence of reported child diarrhea by 29% (prevalence ratio [PR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59–0.87, p = 0.001) and reported child ARI by 25% (PR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60–0.93, p = 0.009). Overall, more than 62% of households were observed to have water in their filters at follow-up, while 65% reported using the intervention stove every day, and 55% reported using it primarily outdoors. Use of both the intervention filter and intervention stove decreased throughout follow-up, while reported traditional stove use increased. The intervention reduced the prevalence of households with detectable fecal contamination in drinking water samples by 38% (PR 0.62, 95% CI 0.57–0.68, p &lt; 0.0001) but had no significant impact on 48-hour personal exposure to log-transformed fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations among cooks (β = −0.089, p = 0.486) or children (β = −0.228, p = 0.127). The main limitations of this trial include the unblinded nature of the intervention, limited PM2.5 exposure measurement, and a reliance on reported intervention use and reported health outcomes. Conclusions Our findings indicate that the intervention improved household drinking water quality and reduced caregiver-reported diarrhea among children &lt;5 years. It also reduced caregiver-reported ARI despite no evidence of improved air quality. Further research is necessary to ascertain longer-term intervention use and benefits and to explore the potential synergistic effects between diarrhea and ARI. © 2019 Kirby et al.",,"drinking water; rain; water; drinking water; adult; air pollution; air quality; Article; biomass; child; cluster analysis; contamination; controlled study; cooking; diarrhea; fecal contamination; female; follow up; health care facility; health care personnel; health care survey; health education; household; human; intervention study; major clinical study; male; malnutrition; particulate matter; pneumonia; prevalence; randomized controlled trial; respiratory tract infection; Rwanda; sanitation; water quality; water supply; acute disease; devices; diarrhea; indoor air pollution; preschool child; prevention and control; respiratory tract infection; water management; Acute Disease; Adult; Air Pollution, Indoor; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; Cooking; Diarrhea; Drinking Water; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Household Articles; Humans; Male; Respiratory Tract Infections; Rwanda; Water Purification; Water Quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067173829

On the other hand, in the case of cementless concrete, it is essential to observe the strength change at the initial stage of curing and to measure the precise strength because there is a risk of damage and collapse of the structure due to the sudden drop in strength of the concrete during or after construction. In this study, wave mode decomposition method was used to estimate the early-age strength of alkali activated concrete. Experiments were carried out to observe that the shape of the wave measured by each sensor changes as the internal temperature of the concrete rises due to internal hydration heat following the insertion of the embedded piezoelectric sensor module into the specimen immediately after the concrete pouring. As the time elapsed, it was observed that the arrival time and amplitude of the wave were changing. So it was confirmed that the early-age strength of concrete can be estimated through this study. © 2019 IEEE.","Alkali Activated Slag Concrete; Early-age Strength; Embedded Piezoelectric Sensor; Wave Mode Decomposition","Electric power transmission networks; Electric sensing devices; Greenhouse gases; Piezoelectric devices; Piezoelectric transducers; Piezoelectricity; Risk assessment; Slags; Smart city; Smart power grids; Alkali-activated concretes; Alkali-activated slag concretes; Early age strengths; Embedded piezoelectric sensors; Greenhouse gas reductions; Internal temperature; Life expectancies; Wave modes; Concretes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076082832

Traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) may be an important exposure in the development of childhood asthma. However, the burden of childhood asthma attributable to TRAP is poorly documented. Using a land-use regression (LUR) model, we estimated the childhood (birth-18 years old) population exposure to the following three air pollutants in Bradford, UK: Particulate Matter equal or less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5), Particulate Matter equal or less than 10 micrometers in diameter (PM10) and Black Carbon (BC). We assigned exposures at the lowest census tract level: the ‘output area’. We extracted national and local childhood asthma incidence rates from the literature and used meta-analytic exposure-response functions to calculate the relative risk, population attributable fraction of childhood asthma in association with each pollutant and the number of childhood asthma cases attributable to each pollutant. We investigated the impacts of reducing air pollutants at each output area to comply with the World Health Organization's (WHO) air quality guidelines. At the output area level, the annual mean PM2.5, PM10 and BC concentrations were 10.40 µg/m3, 16.63 µg/m3 and 1.07 × 10−5 m−1, respectively. Depending on the pollutant, the estimated number of attributable childhood asthma cases varied between 279 and 612 annually, representing between 15% and 33% of all cases in the city. Between 7% and 12% of annual childhood asthma cases were specifically attributable to TRAP. Compliance with the WHO air quality guidelines prevented up to 29 cases. Using national versus local baseline childhood asthma incidence rates with differing underlying asthma definitions resulted in up to 322% as many attributable cases. Air pollution is estimated to cause a large, but preventable, childhood asthma burden. The burden of disease varied depending on the pollutant selected. © 2018 Tongji University and Tongji University Press","Air pollution; Black carbon; Burden of disease; Childhood asthma; Particulate matter; Traffic",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055041754

The microbial communities within these highly dynamic sediments frequently shift between oxic and anoxic states, and hence are less stratified than those in cohesive (muddy) sediments. A major question is, therefore, how these communities maintain metabolism during oxic–anoxic transitions. Here, we show that molecular hydrogen (H2) accumulates in silicate sand sediments due to decoupling of bacterial fermentation and respiration processes following anoxia. In situ measurements show that H2 is 250-fold supersaturated in the water column overlying these sediments and has an isotopic composition consistent with fermentative production. Genome-resolved shotgun metagenomic profiling suggests that the sands harbour diverse and specialized microbial communities with a high abundance of [NiFe]-hydrogenase genes. Hydrogenase profiles predict that H2 is primarily produced by facultatively fermentative bacteria, including the dominant gammaproteobacterial family Woeseiaceae, and can be consumed by aerobic respiratory bacteria. Flow-through reactor and slurry experiments consistently demonstrate that H2 is rapidly produced by fermentation following anoxia, immediately consumed by aerobic respiration following reaeration and consumed by sulfate reduction only during prolonged anoxia. Hydrogenotrophic sulfur, nitrate and nitrite reducers were also detected, although contrary to previous hypotheses there was limited capacity for microalgal fermentation. In combination, these experiments confirm that fermentation dominates anoxic carbon mineralization in these permeable sediments and, in contrast to the case in cohesive sediments, is largely uncoupled from anaerobic respiration. Frequent changes in oxygen availability in these sediments may have selected for metabolically flexible bacteria while excluding strict anaerobes. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"hydrogen; silicate; hydrogenase; nickel-iron hydrogenase; nitric acid derivative; nitrite; RNA 16S; sulfate; anoxia; Article; bacterial fermentation; bacterial gene; bacterial genome; carbon mineralization; chemical composition; concentration (parameter); fermentation; Gammaproteobacteria; genetic profile; genome resolved shotgun metagenomic profiling; hydrogenotrophic sulfur reducer; metagenomics; microbial community; microbial respiration; nitrate reducer; nitrite reducer; nonhuman; organisms by metabolism; priority journal; sediment; Woeseiaceae; anaerobic bacterium; bacterium; carbon cycle; classification; genetics; hypoxia; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; oxidation reduction reaction; sea; sediment; Bacteria; Bacteria, Anaerobic; Carbon Cycle; Fermentation; Gammaproteobacteria; Geologic Sediments; Hydrogen; Hydrogenase; Hypoxia; Metagenomics; Microbiota; Nitrates; Nitrites; Oceans and Seas; Oxidation-Reduction; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sulfates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062831847

Climate mitigation and adaptation studies have long emphasized the link between global change and local action, and recent climate community scenarios have been developed with cross-scale application in mind. Conceptually, global scenarios have been proposed as ‘boundary conditions’ on regional and local scenarios. However, while the concept is compelling, to date we have found only one formal proposal (by Schweizer and Kurniawan) of what it might mean from a scenario development perspective. That proposal used cross-impact balances (CIB), which offer a promising route to formalization of cross-scale scenario analysis. In this paper we also apply CIB, but allow for weak, rather than zero, cross-scale interactions. We formalize the concept of weak interactions by extending CIB analysis to allow for metastable states, which are stable under small disturbances. We propose an algorithm for identifying metastable states and for combining states that become connected when small disturbances are present. Arguing that large-scale scenarios can be applied as boundary conditions when they are metastable under the influence of processes at smaller scales, we demonstrate how a simplified CIB can replace a full multi-scale CIB when a metastable scenario kernel is adopted at large scale. © 2019","Boundary condition; CIB; Cross-scale; Metastability; Simulated annealing","Boundary conditions; Climate change; Climate mitigations; Cross-scale; Meta-stable state; Metastabilities; Scale interactions; Scenario development; Small disturbances; Weak interactions; Simulated annealing; algorithm; boundary condition; conceptual framework; scenario analysis; simulated annealing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063043128

We then conducted future projections of the impacts and reductions until 2050 based on multiple future scenarios of domestic forestry, wood, and energy use. An impact assessment method involving characterization, damage assessment, and integration with a monetary unit was used, and the results were expressed in Japanese yen (JPY). We found that environmental impacts from paper consumption, such as climate change and urban air pollution, were significant and accounted for 56% to 83% of the total environmental impacts between 1970 and 2013. Therefore, reductions of greenhouse gas, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur oxide emissions from paper production would be an effective measure to reduce the overall environmental impacts. An increase in wood use for building construction, civil engineering, furniture materials, and energy production could lead to reductions of environmental impacts (via carbon storage, material substitution, and fuel substitution) amounting to 357 billion JPY in 2050, which is equivalent to 168% of the 2013 levels. Particularly, substitution of nonwooden materials, such as cement, concrete, and steel, with wood products in building construction could significantly contribute to impact reductions. Although an increase of wood consumption could reduce environmental impacts, such as climate change, resource consumption, and urban air pollution, increased wood consumption would also be associated with land-use impacts. Therefore, minimizing land transformations from forest to barren land will be important. © 2018 by Yale University","climate change; industrial ecology; land use; life cycle assessment (LCA); material flow analysis (MFA); material substitution","Air pollution; Concrete products; Damage detection; Economics; Energy utilization; Environmental impact assessments; Forestry; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Life cycle; Nitrogen oxides; Wood; Wooden construction; Building construction; Industrial ecology; Land transformation; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Material flow analysis; Material substitutions; Resource consumption; Urban air pollution; Climate change; atmospheric pollution; building construction; climate change; energy use; environmental impact assessment; industrial ecology; land use change; life cycle analysis; material flow analysis; nitrogen oxides; Air Pollution; Concrete; Economics; Forestry; Fuels; Greenhouse Gases; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046542127

Using the northeastern U.S. as a test case, we develop a framework to systematically sub-select reliable models for use in climate change studies in the region. Model performance over the historical period is evaluated first for a wide variety of standard and process metrics including large-scale atmospheric circulation features that drive regional climate variability. The inclusion of process-based metrics allows identification of credible models in capturing key processes relevant for the climate of the northeastern U.S. Model performance is then used in conjunction with the assessment of redundancy in model projections, especially in summer precipitation, to eliminate models that have better performing counterparts. Finally, we retain some mixed-performing models to maintain the range of climate model uncertainty, required by the fact that model biases are not strongly related to their respective projections. This framework leads to the retention of 16 of 36 CMIP5 GCMs that (a) have a satisfactory historical performance for a variety of metrics and (b) provide diverse climate projections consistent with uncertainties in the multi-model ensemble (MME). Overall, the models show significant variations in their performance across metrics and seasons with none emerging as the best model in all metrics. The retained set reduces the number of models by more than one half, easing the computational burden of using the entire CMIP5 MME, while still maintaining a wide range of projections for risk assessment. The retention of some mixed-performing models to maintain ensemble uncertainty suggests a potential to narrow the ranges in temperature and precipitation. But any further refinement should be based on a more detailed analysis of models in capturing regional climate variability and extremes to avoid providing overconfident projections. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Climate change; Digital storage; Risk assessment; Uncertainty analysis; Atmospheric circulation; Computational burden; Global climate model; Historical performance; Model uncertainties; Multi-model ensemble; Regional climate changes; Summer precipitation; Climate models; atmospheric circulation; climate change; climate modeling; CMIP; global climate; identification method; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; risk assessment; seasonal variation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064502827

We decorated the surface of the WPMs by maltodextrin through the Maillard reaction in wet condition and investigated the influence of the reaction time on the characteristics of the particles including the colloidal stability. The pH of the WPM-maltodextrin mixture rapidly decreased from 8 to ≈7.36 during the first 60 min of the reaction, causing a glycation extent of 36%. Longer durations (≥6 h) had smaller effects on the glycation extent and extensively decreased the L* parameter of the mixture. Infra-red spectroscopy confirmed that maltodextrin reacted with whey proteins through its anomeric region. It was found by gel electrophoresis that long reaction periods (≥12 h) caused polymerization of the glycoproteins. As well, long reaction times (≥6 h) formed compact aggregates, reducing the fluoresce emission intensity of WPMs. We found that a reaction duration of 1 h, which did not cause aggregation (based on atomic force microscopy images), and increased the microenvironmental hydrophilicity of fluorophores in the WPM particles, significantly increased the colloidal stability of the particles at pH 4.0. © 2019","Fluorimetry; Hydrophilicity; Maillard reaction; Maltodextrin; Whey protein microgel",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060905820

However, a long-term view of this interaction requires a great amount of computational time. In this work a cost-effective methodology is proposed to surpass this shortcoming and estimate bed level evolution. The technique is relied on an objective criterion to assess spectral wave time series of wave height, period and direction and identify the wave conditions that contribute to the initiation of sediment movement. After implementing the so-called Shields criterion, the full wave climate is reduced to two classes of representative wave conditions: the over-critical ones, mainly responsible for long-term erosion, and the sub-critical wave conditions. By applying a well-known process-based model, the representative wave conditions are used as input for the wave-current-sediment transport simulation and rates of bed level changes are obtained, on the basis of which the long-term effects of waves on beach erosion are estimated. Taking into account that erosion is a threatening phenomenon along the sandy beaches of Mediterranean Sea, the present method is demonstrated at a sandy coast of Sitia Bay, Crete. The bed levels derived from the proposed methodology and the full time series are compared. The results indicate reasonable agreement at the selected locations with deviations under 7%, and conformity of the tendency of seabed evolution, rendering the new methodology a useful tool. © 2018 Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences","Beach erosion; Bed level evolution; Shields criterion; Sitia-Crete coast; Wave/current modelling","beach erosion; modeling; sediment transport; wave climate; wave height; wave-current interaction; Aegean Islands; Crete [Greece]; Greece",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059536937

CLC results in streams of pure carbon dioxide and condensable steam, both of which are produced without significant energy consumption. Preparation of suitable oxygen carriers is crucial for the long-term operation of a CLC process. Nickel and iron oxides (NiO and Fe2O3) are promising materials for CLC. NiO is highly reactive, but it has issues with carbon deposition during reduction and with particle agglomeration in its unsupported state. Although Fe2O3 has a slower reactivity, it is an inexpensive oxygen carrier. In this study, alumina aerogel-supported NiO and Fe2O3 were fabricated for methane CLC. The loadings of NiO and Fe2O3 were optimized to obtain good activity and stability during cyclic methane CLC operation. Compared with pure metal oxide oxygen carriers, the supported NiO and Fe2O3 oxygen carriers demonstrated high reduction-oxidation rates and superior physical stability. X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy studies suggest that there was a good interaction between NiO and Fe2O3, with high mesoporous surface area support contributing to excellent performance during the CLC process. When calculated based on grams of pure metal oxide, the oxygen capacity of the supported metal oxides was comparable to that of the pure metal oxides. The nature of the fuel affected CLC's activity and stability: NiO was fully reduced to metallic nickel with methane; Fe2O3 was reduced to mixed Fe3O4 and FeO phases. The preparation of alumina aerogel and the fabrication of NiO and Fe2O3 oxygen carriers that support using such alumina are discussed in detail. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Aerogels; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Energy utilization; Fabrication; Hematite; Magnetite; Metals; Methane; Oxygen; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermogravimetric analysis; Carbon deposition; Chemical-looping combustion process; Clean energy generation; Mesoporous surfaces; Particle agglomerations; Physical stability; Pure carbon dioxide; Reduction-oxidation; Nickel oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068004050

Researchers are using various climate models to assess the impacts and identifying relevant alternative adaptation strategies to mitigate climate change. In India, rice is the major cereal crop grown and is influenced due to climate change and variability, inadequate water supply, labour shortage and methane emissions from rice ecosystems. This necessitates adoption action and upscaling of key adaption strategies like direct seeded rice (DSR) using validated data from rice growing areas in India. The study used experimental data of 2010–2014 and field survey data of DSR and non-DSR farmers collected during 2014. Results show that DSR method has incurred less tillage and labour costs by eluding puddling and transplantation by labour. Large-scale adoption of DSR was observed during 2012–2015 in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. This was mainly due to the delayed monsoon and water supply, reduction in cost of cultivation, capacity building of stakeholders and their active involvement in awareness and training programmes.

The challenge posed to federal countries participating in international climate agreements through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is that successful implementation requires buy-in from their subnational governments. However, subnational climate action may not be aligned with the political priorities of the national government and could either undermine or support commitments made through the agreement. To explore these dynamics, we review the incoherence between international commitments, national and subnational policies of Canada and the United States, relying on case studies of investments in low-carbon energy and emissions outcomes. Political and policy incoherence has flowed in both directions. Both countries have seen periods of federal government action, which have been undermined by subnational inaction or opposition. Similarly, both countries have seen periods of federal government inaction, which has placed the onus on subnational governments. Our analysis enables a greater understanding about how the dynamics of federalist political systems influence policy, thus the energy investment and emissions outcomes of national commitments to international agreements. The implications of our findings for other federalist political systems are discussed. We suggest that during national leadership voids, subnational governments can counteract the associated negative policy outcomes by implementing climate policies that support low-carbon technologies and reducing emissions. This type of system supports the development of a coordinated strategy among subnational governments in achieving international goals through cooperative federalism via subnational policy compacts. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","climate policy; energy innovation; greenhouse gas emissions; international commitments","carbon emission; emission control; environmental policy; federal system; greenhouse gas; innovation; policy implementation; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Canada; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062485477

To generate consistent estimates of broad-scale spatially continuous spring plant phenology at northern European latitudes (&gt; 50° N) from 2000 to 2016, we used a novel vegetation index, the plant phenology index (PPI), derived from MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. To obtain realistic and strong estimates, the phenology trends and their relationships with temperature and precipitation over the past 17 years were analyzed using a panel data method. We found that in the studied region the start of the growing season (SOS) has on average advanced by 0.30 day year −1 . The SOS showed an overall advancement rate of 2.47 day °C −1 to spring warming, and 0.18 day cm −1 to decreasing precipitation in spring. The previous winter and summer temperature had important effects on the SOS but were spatially heterogeneous. Overall, the onset of SOS was delayed 0.66 day °C −1 by winter warming and 0.56 day °C −1 by preceding summer warming. The precipitation in winter and summer influenced the SOS in a relatively weak and complex manner. The findings indicate rapid recent phenological changes driven by combined seasonal climates in northern Europe. Previously unknown spatial patterns of phenological change and relationships with climate drivers are presented that improve our capacity to understand and foresee future climate effects on vegetation. © 2019, The Author(s).","Climate sensitivity; Northern European latitudes; Plant phenology index (PPI); Remote sensing; Spring phenology trend","climate change; Europe; plant development; season; temperature; Climate Change; Europe; Plant Development; Seasons; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062153855

Insight into the roles of reactive sites in nanomaterials is significant for understanding and implementing the design principles of nanocatalysts. Recently, the essential role of defects, including vacancies, reconstructed defects, and doped non-metal (or metal)-defect-based motifs, have been widely demonstrated to promote the diverse electrochemical processes (e.g., O2 [or CO2] reduction reactions and H2 [or O2] evolution reactions). Nevertheless, the in-depth exploration of the underlying defect electrocatalytic mechanism is still in its infancy. This review summarizes the state-of-the-art defect engineering strategies for designing highly efficient electrochemical nanocatalysts with special emphasis on the correlation between defect structures and electrocatalytic properties. Finally, some perspectives on the challenges and future research directions in this promising area are presented. Electrocatalytic energy conversion technologies have been widely considered a clean and sustainable way to alleviate the reliance on fossil fuels. The development of efficient and affordable electrocatalysts plays a key aspect in energy conversion processes by lowering the reaction kinetic barriers and thus boosting the efficiency and selectivity of diverse electrochemical reactions (e.g., oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions and oxygen and carbon dioxide reduction reactions). Recently, defect engineering has emerged as a new strategy for tailoring the electronic structures and interface coordination; however, the role of “defect”-related sites in as-designed electrocatalysts has not yet been fully understood. In this review, we will shed light on the recent advances in tailoring nanomaterials from the aspects of constructing defect-based motifs as active sites for versatile electrochemical energy conversions as well as their underlying mechanism on structure-property correlations.

Fungi constitute an important component of soil microorganism communities. They play an important role in biodiversity maintenance, community assembly, and ecosystem functioning, and differ from many macroorganisms in many traits. Here, we examined soil fungal communities in Chinese temperate, subtropical, and tropic forests using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the fungal ITS1 region. The relative effect of late Quaternary climate change and contemporary environment (plant, soil, current climate, and geographic distance) on the soil fungal community was analyzed. The richness of the total fungal community, along with saprotrophic, ectomycorrhizal (EM), and pathogenic fungal communities, was influenced primarily by the contemporary environment (plant and/or soil) but not by late Quaternary climate change. Late Quaternary climate change acted in concert with the contemporary environment to shape total, saprotrophic, EM, and pathogenic fungal community compositions and with a stronger effect in temperate forest than in tropic–subtropical forest ecosystems. Some contemporary environmental factors influencing total, saprotrophic, EM, and pathogenic fungal communities in temperate and tropic–subtropical forests were different. We demonstrate that late Quaternary climate change can help to explain current soil fungal community composition and argue that climatic legacies can help to predict soil fungal responses to climate change. © 2019 The Authors.

Federal standards for fleet-averaged vehicle GHG emission rates and their corresponding corporate average fuel economy standards cap GHG emissions of the US light-duty vehicle fleet. In addition, two key policies aim to encourage a future fleet transition to alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) technologies: (1) incentives that treat AFVs favorably in the federal GHG standard, and (2) state zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) policy, which mandates AFV sales in some states. While each of these AFV policies can encourage AFV adoption, we show that net GHG emissions increase when both policies are present simultaneously. Specifically, we estimate changes in life cycle GHG emissions and gasoline consumption, relative to a pure federal fleet GHG standard (without AFV incentives or mandates), resulting from the introduction of (1) AFV incentives in federal fleet GHG policy, (2) state ZEV mandates, and (3) the combination of the two. We find that under fairly general conditions the combined AFV policies produce higher GHG emissions than either policy alone. This result is a consequence of state mandates increasing AFV sales in the presence of federal incentives that relax the fleet GHG standard when AFVs are sold. Using AFV sales projections from the Energy Information Administration and the California Air Resources Board, we estimate that the combined policies produce an increase on the order of 100 million tons of CO2 emissions cumulatively for new passenger cars sold from 2012 through 2025 relative to a pure GHG standard. AFV incentives in the GHG standard conflate policy goals by encouraging AFV adoption at the cost of higher fleet GHG emissions, and they permit even higher fleet GHG emissions when other policies, such as the ZEV mandate, increase AFV adoption. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"Alternative fuels; Fleet operations; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Life cycle; Particulate emissions; Sales; Alternative fuel vehicles; California Air Resources Board; Corporate average fuel-economy standards; Energy Information Administration; Life-cycle GHG emissions; Light duty vehicles; Light-duty vehicle fleet; Transportation sector; Greenhouse gases; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; technology adoption; transport vehicle; transportation policy; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064711999

Under calm conditions largest direct exhaust PM2.5 diesel concentrations tend to accumulate at two preferred heights: higher ones at 200–225 cm due to truck and buses aerodynamics, and lower ones at 130–160 cm due to light vehicles. Obtained flows indicate that exhaust emissions are transported to these heights via vortices generated by vehicular traffic. The lower height vortices transporting PM2.5 direct diesel emissions place children aged between 7 and 15 at a higher acute exposure risk due to their stature. Also, the hourly averaged PM2.5 concentrations tend to accumulate nearer to the roadside. This information was obtained using a specially designed electromechanical near-surface atmospheric profiler equipped with a PM2.5 measurement instrument, a thermistor and a sonic anemometer installed on a sidewalk. Using signal analysis techniques, coherent flows of direct PM2.5 emissions and thermal information were obtained.

Sustainability means how the system can provide electricity with high reliability, minimum cost, and at the same time also low emissions. Electricity planning in the power generation side is an essential phase that an appropriate scenario formula is developed to Figure out the best electricity supply in the future. This study presents an analysis and recommendation of strategies in order to plan sustainable electricity supply of East Kalimantan electricity system up to year 2038. The methodology used is modeling to describe how supply and demand of electricity works in the area followed by simulations to get the picture of impacts the series of scenarios in the future. LEAP (Long-range Energy Alternative Planning) as one of the tool that is able to assess sustainability is chosen as instrument to develop model and simulate it. The scenario developed is a representation of a strategy that combines the selection of types of plants, economic dispatch methods and types of low emission generating technologies, especially the Ultra Super Critical (USC) Coal Fired Power Plant and renewable energy.

Students enrolled in the course completed a baseline questionnaire about their diets in early fall quarter and then again at follow-up, about 6 months later at the end of the winter quarter. The control group consisted of freshmen enrolled in a different course series entitled “Evolution of the Cosmos and Life” (Cosmos cluster). The instruction in the Food cluster included lecture material on general environmental science and life cycle analyses of food, an analysis of a reading comparing the environmental footprint of various types of meats, and classroom exercises to calculate the environmental footprint of typical foods. The Cosmos cluster instruction included climate change, but no information about food. While the two groups were statistically indistinguishable at baseline, throughout the period of the study, Food cluster students decreased (a) their overall dietary carbon footprint for a 2000-kcal normalized diet by 7% (p = 0.062), (b) the beef component of their dietary carbon footprint by 19% (p = 0.024), and (c) their reported ruminant consumption by 28% (p &lt; 0.001). At follow-up, the overall dietary footprints for Food cluster students were 4153 and 5726 g CO2-eq/day for female and male students, respectively, compared to 4943 and 6958 g CO2-eq/day for female and male Cosmos students. In the Food cluster, both genders decreased their reported ruminant meat consumption by about a serving per week, while reported ruminant meat consumption increased for males in the control group. Modest, voluntary dietary changes such as those observed in this study could play an important role in mitigating climate change. Extrapolated across the entire US population, the difference in dietary carbon footprint observed between the Food cluster and control group would amount to 33% of the reduction required for the 2013 President’s Climate Action Plan (2013). © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Emission control; Life cycle; Meats; Reduction; Students; Sustainable development; Dietary changes; Environmental footprints; Environmental science; Freshman course; Lecture materials; Life cycle analysis; Meat consumption; Public universities; Carbon footprint; carbon footprint; climate change; diet; environmental assessment; food consumption; questionnaire survey; student; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064825557

Furthermore, a comprehensive economic evaluation is carried out for the proposed system and payback period, as well as unit cost of produced power, are reported as the main economic parameters. The influence of main decision variables including packing factor, chimney height and collector radius is investigated on the power generation and economic performance. Moreover, the economic assessment of proposed system is carried out for five selected cities in Iran. Based on the results, packing factor always optimizes the economic performance, whereas the lowest payback period is obtained for packing factors between 0.3 and 0.5.

Therefore, the sea ice surface (SIS) albedo parameterization of the coupled regional climate model HIRHAM-NAOSIM was examined against broadband surface albedo measurements performed during the joint ACLOUD (Arctic CLoud Observations Using airborne measurements during polar Day) and PASCAL (Physical feedbacks of Arctic boundary layer, Sea ice, Cloud and AerosoL) campaigns, which were performed in May-June 2017 north of Svalbard. The SIS albedo parameterization was tested using measured quantities of the prognostic variables surface temperature and snow depth to calculate the surface albedo and the individual fractions of the ice surface subtypes (snow-covered ice, bare ice, and melt ponds) derived from digital camera images taken on board the Polar 5 and 6 aircraft. The selected low-altitude (less than 100&thinsp;m) flight sections of overall 12 flights were performed over surfaces dominated by snow-covered ice. It was found that the range of parameterized SIS albedo for individual days is smaller than that of the measurements. This was attributed to the biased functional dependence of the SIS albedo parameterization on temperature. Furthermore, a time-variable bias was observed with higher values compared to the modeled SIS albedo (0.88 compared to 0.84 for 29 May 2017) in the beginning of the campaign, and an opposite trend towards the end of the campaign (0.67 versus 0.83 for 25 June 2017). Furthermore, the surface type fraction parameterization was tested against the camera image product, which revealed an agreement within 1&thinsp;%. An adjustment of the variables, defining the parameterized SIS albedo, and additionally accounting for the cloud cover could reduce the root-mean-squared error from 0.14 to 0.04 for cloud free/broken cloud situations and from 0.06 to 0.05 for overcast conditions. © Author(s) 2019.",,"airborne survey; albedo; climate modeling; cloud cover; model validation; regional climate; sea ice; surface temperature; temperature effect; Arctic Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068139912

The research conducted a questionnaire of stakeholders in the construction and implementation sectors. The questionnaire showed that there are many problems that limit the trend towards the application of green buildings in Iraq, which is the problem of this research. The results of the analysis of the questionnaire revealed the presence of 26 problems, the most important of which is the weakness of the concept of green buildings in the society in general and the refusal of change and move towards the adoption of green buildings when constructing buildings in Iraq by 93.7%. In addition, the most important factors affecting the inability to move towards green buildings are the legal, technical, design, planning, financial, intellectual, functional, technological, construction and sustainability factors. The research aims to prepare a future vision and proposals to address the problems and factors that affect the weak demand for green buildings in Iraq. These proposals might be legal, technical, design, planning, financial, strategic and technical, that could help decision-makers and those interested in the construction and environment sectors to prepare drafts, codes and decisions for the transformation to green buildings.

Collectively, four HKH countries have commercially feasible hydropower potential of nearly 190 GW. However, only one-third of this potential has actually been tapped so far. Nepal and Pakistan have tapped 2% and 12%, respectively, of their hydropower potential. The current hydropower supply has not been able to fulfill the electricity demand in the region, where 26–37% of the rural population is living without access to electricity, and future demand for electricity is likely to increase sharply. There are several economic, social, technical, environmental, ecological and political challenges to hydropower production in the HKH countries. Despite these challenges, hydropower remains an important option for achieving renewable energy goals in the region. To achieve these goals, we suggest capitalizing on emerging opportunities such as large hydropower development using a ‘smart approach’ micro-hydropower promotion, energy trade, and regional cooperation for collective energy development programs. © 2019 The Authors","Energy policy; Hindu Kush Himalayan region; Hydropower; Regional cooperation; Renewable energy","Climate change; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Planning; Sustainable development; Carbon intensity of energies; Clean Development Mechanism; Climate change mitigation; Hindu Kush Himalayan region; Hydropower; Non-renewable energy resources; Regional cooperation; Renewable energies; Hydroelectric power",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063074309

However, with the main driver for progressing EV technology being the reduction of carbon emissions, consideration of how a dynamic charging system would impact these emissions is required. This study presents a demand-side management method for allocating resources to charge EVs dynamically considering the integration of local renewable generation. A multi-objective optimisation problem is formulated to consider individual users, an energy retailer and a regulator as players with conflicting interests. A 19% reduction in the energy drawn from the power grid is observed over the course of a 24 h period when compared with a first-come-first-served allocation method. This results in a greater reduction in CO2 emissions of 22% by considering the power grid's make-up at each time interval. Furthermore, a 42% reduction in CO2 emissions is achieved compared to a system without local renewable energy integration. By varying the weights assigned to the players' goals, the method can reduce overall demand at peak times and produce a smoother demand profile. System fairness is shown to improve with an average Gini coefficient reduction of 4.32%. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

In recent decades, changes in the cryosphere have been well documented in many high-mountain regions. While there are some benefits from snow and ice loss, the negative impacts, including from glacier lake outburst floods and variations in glacier runoff, are generally considered to far outweigh the positive impacts, particularly if cultural impacts are considered. In international climate policy, there has been growing momentum to address the negative impacts of climate change, or ‘Loss and Damage’ (L&D) from climate change. It is not clear exactly what can and should be done to tackle L&D, but researchers and practitioners are beginning to engage with policy discussions and develop potential frameworks and supporting information. Despite the strong impact of climate change on the mountain cryosphere, there has been limited interaction between cryosphere researchers and L&D. Therefore, little work has been done to consider how L&D in the mountain cryosphere might be conceptualized, categorized, and assessed. Here, we make a first attempt to analyze L&D in the mountain cryosphere by conducting a systematic literature review to extract L&D impacts and examples from existing literature. We find that L&D is a global phenomenon in the mountain cryosphere and has been more frequently documented in the developing world, both in relation with slow and sudden onset processes. We develop a categorization of L&D, making distinctions between physical and societal impacts, primary and secondary impacts, and identifying seven types of L&D (including L&D to culture, livelihoods, revenue, natural resources, life, and security). We hope this conceptual approach will support future work to understand and address L&D in the mountain cryosphere. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change impacts; Loss and damage; Mountain cryosphere; Risks",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052064410

However, weatherization adoption rates remain low. Previous research suggests that social norms and energy-related interactions within a community have greater influence on households’ weatherization adoption decisions than financial incentives. Therefore, an increased understanding of how social factors can be leveraged to encourage more households to weatherize is needed. This paper describes a hybrid simulation model on households’ weatherization adoption decisions in an urban community. The simulation model integrates a building energy simulation model with an agent-based model that is embedded in a social network to represent the interactions, adaptations, and decision making of individual households over time. The model is demonstrated for several experimental scenarios for a residential block in the City of Des Moines, Iowa. Results indicate that social connectedness, community leaders, and delivery mechanisms for weatherization assistance all have a significant impact on household weatherization adoption. These results provide insight into the potential of policy interventions to increase weatherization adoption. © 2019, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","agent-based model; building energy simulation; decision analysis; social network; weatherization","Climate change; Computational methods; Decision making; Decision theory; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Historic preservation; Housing; Simulation platform; Social networking (online); Adoption decision; Agent-based model; Building energy simulations; Delivery mechanism; Financial incentives; Policy intervention; Residential building; weatherization; Autonomous agents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071431987

The reducing substances such as carbon matter and pyrite could cause relatively high chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the raw kaolin, resulting in low quality kaolin products. In this study, narrow range classification and calcination were investigated to evaluate decreasing COD on coal-series kaolin from the Hubei Province. The kaolin and roasting products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and thermogravimetry–differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) analyses. The results showed that the COD value in kaolin ore (19,252 µg/g) was largely concentrated in the size fraction of – 150 to + 60 μm. The optimum conditions for reducing COD were identified to be – 74 to + 60 μm at a roasting temperature of 450 °C, and the COD value decreased from 27517 to 585 µg g−1.

CBM reservoirs are known as low to ultra-low permeability reservoir and thus the fracturing stimulation is commonly required for commercial gas production from coal seams. This article reviews the main components, rheology, friction pressure, and proppant transport characteristics of the guar-based fracturing fluid, and its field applications. Meanwhile, both advantage and disadvantage for CBM fracturing treatment were comprehensively analyzed. Guar-based fracturing fluid is composed of guar gel, and various additives, mainly crosslinker and breaker. As a complex mixture, the effectiveness of guar-based fracturing fluid is not only closely related to the concentration of various chemical additives but also influenced by fluid-coal interactions at the in situ reservoir conditions. The gel residual due to low flowback rate can potentially damage the formation and hinder the effectiveness of gas production. The formation damages include impacts on gas adsorption, diffusion, and transport in CBM reservoirs. Coal matrix has a strong adsorption capacity for guar-based fluids and is likely to have a sorption induced matrix swelling and reduce the effective permeability. Hence, it is necessary to develop more efficient breakers to increase flowback of guar-based fracturing fluid. The long-term engineering practice shows that the fracturing effect of guar-based fracturing fluid is quite different in field applications at different operation sites. Therefore, the mechanisms of the impact of guar gel on the methane flow in coal should be further studied, and it is important to determine the applicability and improving performance of the guar-based fracturing fluid for site specified application based on the reservoir pressure, temperature, hydrological environment, structural geology and other unique reservoir properties. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Coalbed methane; Field application; Guar-based fracturing fluid; Limitations; Rheology","Additives; Coal; Coal bed methane; Coal deposits; Coal industry; Diffusion in liquids; Elasticity; Firedamp; Fracturing fluids; Gas adsorption; Greenhouse gases; Hydraulic fracturing; Methane; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Rheology; Structural geology; Transport properties; Adsorption capacities; Coalbed methane reservoir; Development and utilizations; Effective permeability; Engineering practices; Field application; Limitations; Ultra-low permeability reservoirs; Low permeability reservoirs",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063695159

Yet, the effects of altering temperature regimes on SOC mineralization remain poorly understood in forest plantations converted from natural forests. Forest conversion is extensive and could have major impact on SOC dynamics, so that this knowledge limits our ability of predicting the consequences of such land use change on carbon cycling. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a 360-day incubation experiment under constant and varying temperature regimes for soils of a natural forest and a Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantation. Results showed that SOC mineralization was greater in the forest plantation soil than in the natural forest soil in both temperature treatments, possibly due to greater labile SOC in the forest plantation soil by 27–28%. The results suggested that replacing natural forests with forest plantations may increase CO 2 emission via the mineralization of SOC. In the natural forest soil, SOC mineralization was greater in the varying temperature treatment relative to the constant temperature treatment but no difference was found in the forest plantation soil. Moreover, temperature sensitivity (Q 10 ) of SOC mineralization was greater in the natural forest soil than the Chinese fir soil for the 0–180 day of the incubation. The difference in the response to the two temperature treatments between the two forest soils which was accompanied by difference in soil microbial communities. It was likely that soil microbes of the closed-canopy natural forest were less adapted to temperature fluctuations than soil microbes of the forest plantation soil as the canopy was rarely closed. Our results highlight that soil incubation experiments need to take temperature fluctuations into consideration to more accurately reflect SOC dynamics in the field, especially when evaluating the impacts of replacing natural forests with forest plantations on soil carbon dynamics. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Incubation; Microbial biomass carbon (MBC); PLFAs; Soil organic carbon; Subtropical forest; Temperature fluctuation","Bacteria; Climate change; Dynamics; Land use; Mineralogy; Organic carbon; Soils; Temperature distribution; Incubation; Microbial biomass carbon; PLFAs; Soil organic carbon; Subtropical forests; Temperature fluctuation; Forestry; climate effect; coniferous tree; forest ecosystem; forest soil; microbial activity; mineralization; organic carbon; plantation forestry; soil chemistry; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; soil temperature; subtropical region; China; Cunninghamia lanceolata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062863552

Faced with mounting international and domestic pressures, China has made great efforts to curb CO 2 emissions. To formulate targeted regional reduction plans, the features and characters of provincial carbon intensity should be carefully evaluated. In this study, the existence of convergence in China's carbon intensity and possible technological factors that may influence the convergence, are carefully investigated by building a united framework and employing dynamic spatial panel approach. The estimation results verify that there is significant spatial correlation in China's provincial carbon intensity. There is also evidence that the three different types of convergence (i.e., stochastic convergence, σ-convergence and β-convergence) exist during the sample period of 2000–2016. Moreover, among the technological factors of conditional β-convergence, indigenous innovation activity is most critical. Not all foreign innovations stem from the inflow of foreign direct investment and trade exert a positive effect on carbon intensity reduction. Besides, it is estimated that the spatial spillovers effects from neighboring provinces are important to carbon intensity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon intensity; Convergence; Dynamic spatial panel approach; Technological factors","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Stochastic systems; Carbon intensity; Carbon intensity reductions; Convergence; Convergence characteristics; Dynamic spatial; Foreign direct investments; Spatial correlations; Technological factors; Carbon; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; convergence; emission control; environmental economics; foreign direct investment; innovation; panel data; spatial analysis; trade; Article; carbon footprint; carbon utilization; China; conceptual framework; convergent evolution; economic aspect; economic status; environmental monitoring; gross national product; industrialization; policy; priority journal; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062505863

The international initiative ""4 per 1000"" aims at implementing practical actions on increasing soil carbon storage in soils under agriculture. This requires a fundamental understanding of the soil carbon changes across the globe. Several studies have suggested that the global soil organic carbon stocks (SOCS) have decreased due to global warming and land cover change, while others reported SOCS may increase under climate change and improved soil management. To better understand how a changing climate, land cover, and agricultural activities influence SOCS across large extents and long periods, the spatial and temporal variations of SOCS were estimated using a modified space-for-time substitution method over a 150-year period in the state of Wisconsin, USA. We used legacy soil datasets and environmental factors collected and estimated at different times across the state (169,639 km2) coupled with a machine-learning algorithm. The legacy soil datasets were collected from 1980 to 2002 from 550 soil profiles and harmonized to 0.30 m depth. The environmental factors consisted of 100-m soil property maps, 1-km annual temperature and precipitation maps, 250-m remote-sensing (i.e., Landsat)-derived yearly land cover maps and a 30-m digital elevation model. The model performance was moderate but can provide insights on understanding the impacts of different factors on SOCS changes across a large spatial and temporal extent. SOCS at the 0-0.30 m decreased at a rate of 0.1 ton ha-1 year-1 between 1850 and 1938 and increased at 0.2 ton ha-1 year-1 between 1980 and 2002. The spatial variation in SOCS at 0-0.30 m was mainly affected by land cover and soil types with the largest SOCS found in forest and wetland and Spodosols. The loss between 1850 and 1980 was most likely due to land cover change while the increase between 1980 and 2002 was due to best soil management practices (e.g., decreased erosion, reduced tillage, crop rotation and use of legume and cover crops). © 2019 by the authors.","4 per 1000; Best management practice; Carbon pool; Carbon sink; Climate change; Industrial revolution","Agronomy; Climate change; Crops; Forestry; Global warming; Land use; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Organic carbon; Remote sensing; 4 per 1000; Best management practices; Carbon pool; Carbon sink; Industrial revolutions; Soils",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068193483

However, different from currently deployed centralized power sources, renewables are categorized as one kind of intermittent energy sources, and the scale of renewables is small and scattered. In the recent literature, the architecture of virtual power plant was proposed to replace the current smart grid in the future. However, the energy sharing concept and the uncertainties of intermittent energy sources will cause the short-term energy management for the virtual power plant much more complicated than the current centralized control energy management for traditional power generation system. We thus propose a hierarchical day-ahead power scheduling system for virtual power plant in this work to tackle the complex short-term energy management problems. We first collect electricity consumption data from smart appliances used in households and predict power-generating capacity of renewable energy sources at the prosumer level. Then, the proposed hierarchical power scheduling system is employed to schedule the usage of electricity for the customers by considering the efficiency of the use of distributed renewables. Notably, charging management of a moving electric vehicle is also considered in the proposed power scheduling mechanism. In addition, a real-time power tracking mechanism is presented to deal with the forecast errors of volatile renewable power generation, electricity load, and moving electric vehicle charging, and the maximal usage of renewables and reduction of the burden on community virtual power plants during time period of peak load can be achieved accordingly. The experimental results show that the proposed day-ahead power scheduling system can mitigate the dependency on traditional power generation effectively, and balance peak and off-peak period load of electricity market. © The Author(s) 2019.","data mining; optimization; power scheduling; renewables; Virtual power plant","Charging (batteries); Cost reduction; Data mining; Electric power plants; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Energy management; Energy management systems; Optimization; Power markets; Scheduling; Solar energy; Wind power; Electric vehicle charging; Intermittent energy source; Power generating capacity; Power generation systems; Power Scheduling; Renewable power generation; Renewables; Virtual power plants; Smart power grids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065519400

A visualized and constant-volume gas-solid coupling system is introduced here to investigate the influence of CO2 sorption on the physical and mechanical properties of coal. Being able to keep a constant volume and monitor the sample using a camera, this system offers the potential to improve instrument accuracy and analyze fracture evolution with a fractal geometry method. This paper provides all steps to perform a uniaxial compression experiment with a briquette sample in different CO2 pressures with the gas-solid coupling test system. A briquette, cold-pressed by raw coal and sodium humate cement, is loaded in high-pressure CO2, and its surface is monitored in real-time using a camera. However, the similarity between the briquette and the raw coal still needs improvement, and a flammable gas such as methane (CH4) cannot be injected for the test. The results show that CO2 sorption leads to peak strength and elastic modulus reduction of the briquette, and the fracture evolution of the briquette in a failure state indicates fractal characteristics. The strength, elastic modulus, and fractal dimension are all correlated with CO2 pressure but not with a linear correlation. The visualized and constant-volume gas-solid coupling test system can serve as a platform for experimental research about rock mechanics considering the multifield coupling effect. © 2019 Journal of Visualized Experiments.","Carbon dioxide sorption; Coal briquette; Environmental science; Environmental Sciences; Fractal dimension; Issue 148; Real-time image monitoring; Uniaxial compression","carbon dioxide; coal; atmosphere; chemistry; metabolism; Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Coal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068956445

So in order to prevent dustdamages, to a certain extent, dust prediction and simulation should be deemed vital. For this purpose, regional-scale simulations are compared in this study, by means of WRF-Chem using five emission schemes. Based on the model outputs, satellite imagery, and backtrajectory analysis, it is shown that the dust particles transfer from Iran into Iraq. Furthermore, over Ilam province (south-west of Iran), the comparison of the surface concentration from different model outputs shows the results depend on the considered dust emission scheme. In general, it can be stated that choosing different dust emission schemes has a significant effect on the output of the model. Shao schemes have high sensitivity to the land surface data and the low resolution of this data in the Middle East causes some errors in dust flux simulation in the region.

Integrating environmental performance into an industry level supply chain is indeed a challenging task due to the absence of standardized methodology. This paper presents a methodological approach for sustainable construction material sourcing by highlighting the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The proposed approach is then adopted to 12 case construction materials and products which are commonly used in to Hong Kong, and the hotspots for existing sourcing of the selected materials and products are identified while the GHG emissions are assessed based on their sourcing locations. Alternative scenarios for sourcing are identified based on a decision matrix developed according to this methodological approach. The results demonstrate that sustainable sourcing of the 12 selected materials and products by adopting the alternative scenarios can reduce 28% of the total GHG emissions compared to the base scenarios. As the scope of emission reduction for resource-scarce high-density city like Hong Kong is limited, sustainable sourcing of materials may significantly influence the emission reduction target of the construction industry. The proposed approach can help underpin sustainable sourcing of materials which can be effectively adopted in other regions to enhance the sustainability performance of the industry. © 2019","Construction industry; Construction materials; Greenhouse gases; Sourcing approach; Sustainability sourcing","Building materials; Construction industry; Emission control; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Supply chains; Emission reduction targets; Environmental performance; Materials and products; Methodological approach; Sourcing approach; Sustainability performance; Sustainable construction; Sustainable supply chains; Sustainable development; construction industry; construction material; emission control; emission inventory; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; sustainability; sustainable development; article; building industry; carbon footprint; Hong Kong; China; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062214429

Here, we assembled and quantitatively analysed 54 most representative Holocene successions categorized into five climatic and geomorphological regions. These were defined along a longitudinal transect across temperate Europe, i.e. West Carpathians, Bohemian Massif, West Continental, Atlantic France, and Atlantic England. We found a clear east-west gradient in the Holocene dynamic of land snail assemblages, correlating mainly with the changes in strictly forest species richness. Representation of these species increased towards the east in accordance with known position of glacial refugia in the Carpathian Mountains. The West Carpathians acted as a unique refugium, expressing the highest temporal stability of Holocene snail assemblages, with a sharp increase in strictly forest species richness already in the Early Holocene. In contrast, Atlantic regions, characterized by low elevation and low topographical heterogeneity, were always poor in number of strictly forest species with no or only shallow increase of their richness in the Holocene climatic optimum. Further reduction in the second half of the Holocene, along with the increase of strictly open-country species richness correlates with higher human impact on mollusc faunas in lowland and flat regions. These factors can explain the previously reported impoverishment of modern western European forest fauna and have apparently also contributed to regional diversity patterns throughout the Holocene. Among the regions, we found three types of successional trajectories in the composition changes of Holocene molluscs, mirroring the above mentioned east-west gradient, with the West Carpathians having the most distinctive fauna. Our results show that distance from glacial refugia, landscape topography, and also human impact importantly shaped the species richness dynamic and successional pathways of Holocene land-snail fauna across temperate Europe. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Continental scale; Diversity changes; Gastropod shells; Landscape topography; Paleogeography; Woodland fauna","anthropogenic effect; fauna; gastropod; heterogeneity; Holocene; mollusc; paleogeography; refugium; shell; snail; species richness; succession; topography; transect; woodland; Europe; Gastropoda; Mollusca; Stylommatophora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063367312

To help attribute causes of historical peak-flow changes, it is important to separate basins by characteristics that have different influences on peak flows. We analyzed historical trends by basin type: minimally altered basins, regulated basins (substantial reservoir storage but low urbanization), and urbanized basins (with low reservoir storage). Although many peak-flow magnitude changes were found in the last century across the conterminous United States, the trend magnitude and direction vary strongly by basin type and region. In general, there was a low percentage of significant increases and decreases for minimally altered basins while many regulated basins had significant decreases and the limited number of urbanized basins with long-term record showed a high percentage of increases. For urbanized basins, which are concentrated in the Northeast and Midwest, trend magnitude was significantly correlated with the amount of basin urbanization. For all basins regardless of type, parts of the Northeast quadrant of the U.S. had high concentrations of basins with large and significant increases while parts of the Southwest quadrant had high concentrations of basins with large and significant decreases. Basin regulation appears to have heavily influenced the decreasing trends in the Southwest quadrant; there were many large decreases for this basin type despite overall increases in heavy precipitation in this area. Changes over time in the number of 2-per-year and 1-per-5-year peaks over threshold are consistent with changes in the magnitude of annual peak flows. © 2019","Flood flows; Regulation; Trends; United States; Urbanization","Hydrology; Mathematical models; Flood flow; Regulation; Trends; United States; Urbanization; Floods; climate effect; concentration (composition); flooding; flow regulation; historical record; threshold; trend analysis; urbanization; Midwest; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063992739

Given the proclamation of a far-reaching national green growth strategy that requires a shift in public and private investments, this paper addresses the need for empirical estimates on the environmental consequences of FDI inflows into Korea. Using a simultaneous equations model the impacts of FDI inflows are decomposed into direct as well as indirect scale, composition, and technique effects. Thereby, the analysis utilizes panel data on six air pollutants in 16 Korean provinces and self-governing cities for the period 2000 to 2011. The estimation results show that FDI inflows concurrently stimulate regional economic growth and reduce air pollution intensities. However, the total level of air emissions mostly remains unchanged. While confirming the findings of the existing national level research on the FDI-growth relationship in Korea, the results are partly contrary to the respective earlier findings on the FDI-environment nexus. Given Korea's high level of development paired with the aforementioned impact on economic growth and air pollution intensities, foreign investments are, therefore, regarded as one potential pillar to achieve the goals of the green growth strategy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Decomposition analysis; Foreign direct investments; Green growth; Republic of Korea","Economics; Investments; Pollution control; Regional planning; Strategic planning; Decomposition analysis; Environmental consequences; Foreign direct investments; Green growths; Regional air pollution; Regional economic growths; Republic of Korea; Simultaneous equations model; Air pollution; atmospheric pollution; decomposition analysis; economic growth; emission control; foreign direct investment; green revolution; panel data; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064951264

Following documented protocols, 106 selected radiocarbon dates from peat beds from transgressed valley floor, upper estuarine and back-barrier lagoonal settings were first listed individually, then screened in ensemble on quantified age-depth position and inshore palaeotidal setting. The database contains 50 SLIPs and 56 upper limiting data points spanning a depth range of −34 to −1.5 m. The dates in the database originate from dedicated sea-level research, which kept surface elevation and sampling depth uncertainty small, and sampling of basal-peat beds was favoured, keeping compaction uncertainties small too. The SLIPs cover an age-range of 8.8–3.0 ka BP and are available from Greater Rotterdam and its near offshore. For upper limiting data points, the coverage extends offshore, tracing the Rhine palaeovalley, and reaches back to 11.5 ka BP. The age-depth data density and spatial concentration of subsets of dates allow to perform Bayesian radiocarbon calibration and to reduce temporal uncertainty by 25% for the average sample (1σ age uncertainty ≈ 75 cal. yr), when depth position and rates of relative sea-level rise (RSLR)are used to assign sequence order. Between 8.0–4.5 ka BP, rates of RSLR gradually decreased from 9 to 1 mm/yr. In the millennium before, rates of RSLR were much higher, on average 10 mm/yr, and marked by a sea-level jump between 8.45–8.2 ka BP. A two-phased nature of this jump starts to be resolved, with local magnitudes of 1.7 ± 0.6 m (1σ, first phase)and 0.2 ± 0.2 m (second phase), corresponding to globally-averaged jumps of 2.5 m ± 0.9 m for the first and 0.3 ± 0.3 m for the second phase. For the pre-9 ka BP period, only offshore upper limiting data points are currently available. Until new offshore data are gathered, trends of RSLR before 9 ka BP can only be estimated, fed with global insights in post-glacial eustasy, regional estimates regarding rates of glacio-isostatic adjustments and tectonic subsidence, and sedimentary geological interpretations of scattered basal-peat presence. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Europe; Holocene; Netherlands; Radiogenic isotopes; Rhine-Meuse; Sea-level changes; Sea-level jump","Database systems; Offshore oil well production; Peat; Europe; Holocenes; Netherlands; Radiogenic isotopes; Rhine-Meuse; Sealevel change; Sea level; calibration; coastal lagoon; concentration (composition); database; glacioeustacy; Holocene; isotopic analysis; paleoenvironment; Postglacial; radiocarbon dating; sampling; sea level change; uncertainty analysis; Netherlands; Rhine-Meuse Delta; Rotterdam; South Holland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065515803

The ""formal""representation of reagents is a problem-specific, herein designed standardization protocol of compounds, unlike typical structure curation rules in chemoinformatics. For example, heteropolymers are represented by the two partner reagents, whereas homopolymers are depicted as formal ""heteropolymers""with identical partners. The key rule proposed here is to choose ""formal""monomers such as to minimize the number of marked atoms, involved in bonds being formed or changing bond order. Accordingly, carbonyl compounds are rendered as the less-stable vinyl alcohol tautomer, following the same formalism as in olefin polymerization, to minimize the total number of formal polymerization mechanisms and herewith provide the most general framework encompassing a maximum of polymerization processes. ISIDA (in silico design and data analysis) fragment counts with special status given to the ""marked atoms""participating in the polymerization process were combined using ""mixture""strategies to generate the final polymer descriptors. Three predictive models based on SVR (support vector regression) are discussed here. After reproducing results of Katritzky et al. with a local model applicable only to linear homo/heteropolymers, an epoxy resin-specific model applicable to both linear and network forms was built. Eventually, the general model applicable to all these families was constructed. In 12 × repeated 3-fold cross-validation challenges, it displayed the highest accuracy of Q2 = 0.920, RMSE = 34.3 K over the training set of 270 polymers, and R2 = 0.779, RMSE 35.9 K for an external test set of 119 polymers. GTM (Generative Topographic Mapping) analysis produced a 2D map of ""polymer chemical space"", highlighting the various classes of polymers included in the study and their relationship with respect to Tg values.

Data sources included an 18-item multiple choice Climate Science Knowledge Assessment Instrument (CSKAI), interviews investigating students’ content knowledge and perspectives related to climate change, and drawings examining how students saw climate change in relation to their own lives. We interpreted learners’ sociocultural activities as having implications for: (1) the kinds of scientifically-informed climate change ideas they brought to the classroom; (2) the sources of climate change information they perceived as trustworthy; and (3) the extent to which they viewed climate change as problematic, or as having potential connections to their lives. Findings also suggested that students’ engagement with media within and beyond their school-based learning experiences–even prior to formal instruction on climate change–appeared to most strongly inform their ideas about climate change. We concluded that viewing students’ climate change understandings as a product of the unique sociocultural activities in which they are already participating may provide a valuable foundation for planning science learning experiences that resonate personally with students. © 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adolescence; children’s drawings; Climate change; global warming; science education; sociocultural analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002156951

Existing research on mode sharing suggests that sharing schemes face difficulties to move beyond a specific group of early adopters. To gain insights into the characteristics of and perceived barriers for those who adopt e-cargo bike sharing and those who do not, we investigated four groups: active members, inactive members, potential members, and uninterested non-members. We analyzed survey data (n = 301) from members and non-members of an e-cargo bike sharing scheme in the city of Basel, Switzerland, to explore differences in current transportation patterns and sociodemographic characteristics among the four groups. Using a mixed-methods approach, we employed a multilevel regression model to analyze quantitative data. We also applied a qualitative coding system to investigate open-ended survey questions. We found that the present scheme is more likely to attract men, cyclists, and young people; however, other groups were interested.

Nevertheless, an appropriate analysis is highly time-consuming due to the lack of tools. In this process, the first step is to establish the baseline energy status of the area of study. Only with this knowledge, in particular of the residential sector (main CO2 emissions contributor in cities), is it possible to plan for a low carbon economy. In this context, the ENERGIS tool will support energy planners by mapping energy demand of the residential sector at different scales, as a first step towards CO2 emissions calculation. To do so, a nationally validated Energy Performance Certification (EPC) tool has been automated, its results at building level mapped and aggregated at different scales. By basing the proposed platform on EPC calculation methodologies supported by the Energy Performance Directive of Buildings (EPBD 2010/31/EU), the ENERGIS platform achieves two main goals: It aids in the implementation of energy directives and energy actions by offering an easy to use tool to identify areas in need and, secondly, it promotes the EPBD, by making use of one of its main instruments to measure energy performance: The EPCs. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Environmental protection; Housing; Intelligent buildings; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Building levels; Decision support tools; Energy performance; Low carbon economy; Public authorities; Regional levels; Residential sectors; Support energy; Decision support systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068769553

In Latin American cities, spatial dynamics, urban fabrics and territorial distribution, among others, are not always considered when plans are developed. The cities of Ecuador, particularly Cuenca, show processes of dispersion as a result of their own growth disconnected from urban centers, which is evidenced by the high rate of use of the private vehicle per capita and implies a high consumption of fossil energy and environmental pollution. Additionally, urban fabrics affect the functioning and social dynamics of a city and therefore have a direct relationship with planning. With this background, this project seeks to identify and categorize different urban fabrics in the city of Cuenca using a visual methodology that takes into account street and block patterns; patterns of parcelization and land use; building form, scale and placement on lots; street and parking design; and typical relationships between ""green"" and ""gray"" landscape components. As a result, eighteen urban fabrics were identified in the city, with different challenges and opportunities for sustainability. The produced knowledge allowed the generation of sustainable and resilient planning recommendations and opened a wide field of possibilities for future research. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Climate change; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent buildings; Land use; Sustainable development; Block patterns; Environmental pollutions; Latin americans; Private vehicles; Social dynamics; Spatial dynamics; Sustainable planning; Urban centers; Urban growth",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068788353

It is also known that improving city design and transportation networks could reduce carbon emissions more than replacing all fossil fuels with renewable energies. With this background, it seems fundamental to focus on the systemic relationship between urban forms and travel choices behaviours. In the case of the city of Cuenca (Ecuador,) in the last 5 years, more than 70 mono-functional urbanization and condos, many of them being gated-communities, have been built outside the urban limits. These form of urbanization is supported both by public and private promoters. Due to this situation, this research project seeks to determine the relationship between the location of these urbanizations and condos, with the travel choice behaviour of users. Geographic information systems, Q methodology, travel diaries and qualitative methods where used for data collection and spatial representation. Three discourses were found, people who preferred the proximity to nature and open spaces, other who gave more importance to efficient mobility and the last ones for whom security was the most important aspect.

Many governments and the decision makers have recognized the requirement of resilient flood management policies and strategies for sustainable urban development. During the recent decades, various conceptual framework of flood risk assessment and management emerged and they in turn questioned the characterization of resilience in flood risk management. More recently, research on flood risk management and spatial planning have demonstrated a common discussion platform appreciating the concept of flood resilience in policy and strategy making. However, assessment and operationalization of flood resilience is often questionable due to its conceptual vagueness. The present work is a review of the plurality views of flood resilience. Resilience thinking has moved the focus of flood risk assessment towards vulnerability. Flood resilience embeds the incorporation of spatially distributed land use policies and regulations which are a must for the management of flood vulnerability. Spatial planning reflecting flood resilience becomes vital when managing the uncertainty incorporated with flood risk management. However, the operationalization and legitimacy of the importance of the combined role of spatial planning and flood risk management with stakeholder acceptance still remains implicit and weak. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Climate change; Decision making; Flood control; Land use; Risk assessment; Risk management; Urban growth; Conceptual frameworks; Flood management; Flood risk assessments; Flood risk management; Flood vulnerabilities; Rapid urban development; State-of-the art reviews; Sustainable urban development; Floods",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068158443

The perfusion range between these thresholds was termed the “penumbra,” and restitution of flow above the functional threshold was able to reverse the deficits without permanent damage. In further experiments, the dependency of the development of irreversible lesions on the interaction of the severity and the duration of critically reduced blood flow was established, proving that the lower the flow, the shorter the time for efficient reperfusion. As a consequence, infarction develops from the core of ischemia to the areas of less severe hypoperfusion. The translation of this experimental concept as the basis for the efficient treatment of stroke requires methods by which regional flow and energy metabolism can be repeatedly investigated to demonstrate penumbra tissue, which can benefit from therapeutic interventions. Positron emission tomography allows the quantification of regional cerebral blood flow, the regional oxygen extraction fraction, and the regional metabolic rate for oxygen. With these variables, clear definitions of irreversible tissue damage and of critically hypoperfused but potentially salvageable tissue (i.e. the penumbra) in stroke patients can be achieved. However, positron emission tomography is a research tool, and its complex logistics limit clinical routine applications. Perfusion-weighted or diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is a widely applicable clinical tool, and the “mismatch” between perfusion-weighted and diffusion-weighted abnormalities serves as an indicator of the penumbra. Also computed tomography angiography and computed tomography perfusion imaging can be used to detect areas suspicious of penumbra. The findings with both methods should be validated by positron emission tomography measurements. Several studies included the selection of patients for intravenous thrombolysis on the basis of a perfusion-weighted imaging–diffusion-weighted imaging mismatch or computed tomography perfusion studies. A meta-analysis of several mismatch-based thrombolysis studies of delayed treatment from the DIAS, DIAS-2, DEDAS, EPITHET, and DEFUSE trials revealed increased recanalization. However, this analysis did not confirm an improvement in clinical outcome with delayed thrombolysis. Randomized controlled trials that did enroll patients based on the presence of a target mismatch on multimodal imaging demonstrated a higher benefit of revascularization treatment by comparison with those who did not and demonstrated for the first time that revascularization treatment for occlusion of an internal carotid artery (ICA) or a proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) was still beneficial from 6 to 24 h after onset among patients in whom the clinical examination and the multimodal brain imaging indicate a persistent penumbra. On this background, the yield of imaging for the selection of patients for a revascularization therapy will be discussed. © 2019 World Stroke Organization.","Acute stroke therapy; mismatch; penumbra; therapeutic window; thrombectomy; thrombolysis","alteplase; placebo; blood clot lysis; brain blood flow; brain ischemia; brain perfusion; clinical effectiveness; computed tomographic angiography; diffusion weighted imaging; disease severity; energy metabolism; human; image analysis; internal carotid artery occlusion; metabolic rate; middle cerebral artery occlusion; positron emission tomography; priority journal; revascularization; Review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063905945

In PEMFCs, cathode catalysts are crucial for overall performance and durability due to kinetically slow oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). Because platinum (Pt), a state-of-the-art ORR catalyst, is rare and expensive, the development of high-performance platinum metal group (PGM)-free catalysts is highly desirable for future fuel cell technologies. Among the various PGM-free catalyst formulations, metal and nitrogen co-doped carbon (M-N-C, M: Fe, Co, or Mn) catalysts have exhibited encouraging activity and stability in acidic media for ORR and possess great potential to replace Pt in the future. Therefore, based on our extensive experience in the field of ORR catalysis, this review will comprehensively summarize the basic principles in the design and synthesis of M-N-C catalysts for durable, inexpensive, and high-performance PEMFCs with an emphasis on Co- and Mn-N-C catalysts to avoid Fenton reactions between Fe2+ and H2O2, which can generate free radicals and lead to the degradation of catalysts, ionomers, and membranes in PEMFCs. Furthermore, template-free 3D hydrocarbon frameworks as attractive precursors to advanced M-N-C catalysts will be discussed to significantly enhance intrinsic ORR activities in acidic media. In addition, long-term performance durability of M-N-C cathodes will be discussed extensively to provide potential solutions to enhance catalyst stability in PEMFCs. Finally, this review will provide an overall perspective on the progress, challenges, and solutions of PGM-free catalysts for future PEMFC technologies.

Many core research institutions or scholars are also from the United States. There are four major areas in this field: the research on the low-carbon and energy utilization of agricultural waste, the influence of agricultural waste emissions, the material and energy flow of agricultural waste and the prevention and control of agricultural waste pollution. As time progresses and with the development of environment, economy and society, the popular research topics in different stages vary, but on the whole, the research on agricultural waste management has emerged in the early stage. With the change of global natural resource conditions and political and economic background, there are more space for the future. We believe that research on greenhouse gas emission reduction from agricultural waste management based on specific social policies is extremely urgent, and will be of great significance in reducing agricultural greenhouse gas emission. © 2019","Agricultural waste management; CiteSpace; Emerging trends; Scientometric review; Visualizing information","Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Research and development management; Agricultural greenhouse; Citespace; Emerging trends; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Material and energy flows; Prevention and controls; Scientometrics; Visualizing information; Waste management; agricultural emission; literature review; research; trend analysis; visualization; waste management; agricultural waste; air pollution control; anaerobic digestion; bibliometrics; biofuel production; biomass; carbon footprint; carbon utilization; China; climate change; energy conservation; energy cost; environmental policy; food security; land use; priority journal; renewable energy; Review; solid waste; sustainable development; United States; waste management; water quality; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063099816

In addition, understanding of emissions embodied in trade (EET) at intermediate and final stages is crucial for allocation of emission responsibilities in a fair manner.

Based on thin sections, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) image analysis and cathodoluminescence (CL), a comprehensive analysis of the sedimentology, petrography, diagenesis and reservoir quality of the Oligocene sandstone reservoirs of the Xiaganchaigou (E 3 ) Formation in the Lengdong area, Qaidam Basin, are studied. The sandstones in the Lengdong area are classified as argillaceous sandstone, silty sandstone, fine sandstone, medium sandstone, pebbly sandstone, conglomeratic sandstone and conglomerate based on their grain sizes, degrees of sorting, and matrix contents. Five sedimentary facies were identified in the Xiaganchaigou Formation (E 3 ) of the Lengdong area, Qaidam Basin: distributary channel, interdistributary bay, mouth bar, central bar and distal sand sheet facies. Their major diagenetic processes include compaction, carbonate cementation and feldspar and calcite cement dissolution. The porosity and permeability values of the fine sandstone, conglomerate, and conglomeratic sandstone are the highest, followed by those of the medium sandstone and silty sandstone, and the argillaceous sandstone and pebbly sandstone have the lowest porosity and permeability values. The diagenetic sequence in the study area ranges from the eodiagenesis B stage to the mesodiagenetic A stage. Compaction has significantly reduced the primary porosity. Carbonate cements, mainly calcite cements, occlude pores by precipitating in intergranular and intragranular spaces. Dissolution largely contributes to increasing the secondary porosity. The well-sorted and relatively coarser-grained sandstones that formed in higher-energy sedimentary facies (distributary channel, mouth bar and central bar) have a better reservoir quality than the poorly sorted, clay-rich sandstones that formed in low-energy environments (interdistributary bay and distal sand sheet). Based on the comprehensive analysis of petrographic data, diagenesis and sedimentary facies, the reservoir in the Lengdong area is classified into three types: type A, type B and type C. Type A, located in the center of the study area, is the most favorable reservoir, while type C sandstone is the last to consider when looking for a good reservoir. This study can guide hydrocarbon exploration in the Lengdong area, as well as in northwestern China and similar areas throughout the world. © 2018, The Author(s).","Diagenesis; Lengdong area; Oligocene; Petrography; Qaidam Basin; Reservoir quality; Sedimentary facies; Xiaganchaigou Formation","Calcite; Cements; Clay minerals; Compaction; Dissolution; Feldspar; Hydrocarbons; Petrography; Petroleum prospecting; Porosity; Quality control; Sand; Scanning electron microscopy; Sedimentology; Diagenesis; Lengdong area; Oligocene; Qaidam basin; Reservoir quality; Sedimentary facies; Xiaganchaigou Formation; Sandstone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055491184

Understanding the nexus of energy and water may help to minimize energy and water consumption and reduce environmental emissions. However, the interlinkages between water and energy have not received adequate attention. To address this gap, this paper disaggregates and quantifies the energy consumption of the entire water cycle process in Beijing. The results of this study show that total energy consumption by water production, treatment and distribution, end use, and recycled water reuse amounts to 55.6 billion kWh of electricity in 2015, or about 33% of the total urban energy usage. While water supply amount increased by only 10% from 2005 to 2015, the related energy consumption increased by 215% due to water supply structural change. The Beijing municipal government plans to implement many water saving measures in the area from 2016 to 2020, however, these policies will increase energy consumption by 74 million kWh in Beijing. This study responds to the urgent need for research on the synergies between energy and water. In order to achieve the goal of low-energy water utilization in the future, water and energy should be integrated in planning and management. © 2019, Science Press Springer-Verlag.","Beijing; energy consumption; integrated planning; water supply; water-energy nexus",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066995693

Excessive turnover counts great loss to any organization of the world. This comprehensive study included from the birth of turnover research up to till date. Also, by this approach, authors find the necessities of conceptualizing the integrated employee retention strategies, problems and gaps of failures. It is observed that at present the young employees from Generation Y (Millennial) are not contented with their profession and have a tendency of leaving the job with and without valid reasons. Most of the employees from Generation Y directly or indirectly opted for voluntary resignation for better opportunities or self-employment. It is also found that there are essences of frustration about Generation Y from employees and employers’ perspectives. Considering the demoted images, some communities even trying to change their retention approaches whereas merely, these types of in general efforts cannot be a solution against these prospective and forthcoming major stakeholders for future workplaces. This review of literature and qualitative investigation conceptualize the significant events of the former and ongoing century related to the turnover of employees. More specifically, this investigation stress on different generational cohorts and recent observations which merge simultaneously with concurrent investigations on Generation Y through an integrated approach. Most of the study on turnover was carried out on western context and perspectives, whereas turnover problems exist all over the world. Another remarkable factor was the rate of turnover is significant in private sector than public sectors; whereas the private sector got significant stakes for the development of any country. Every organization got earnest desires to get the best output and lesser turnover to avoid brain drain, to save excessive turnover costs, and to retain experience staffs. It has become very much important for any organization to keep constant productivity and output through retention. It is found that employees who are satisfied with their job have better retention, companionship with fellow staff members, and produce a higher quality of work. Earlier concentration was given only towards the fulfilment of intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors as a part of Job satisfaction of employee. Whereas through this investigation it is found that besides motivational approaches there are necessities to formulate retention friendly strategies which include servant leadership, management initiative, soft HRM, work life balance, ethical climates. To fulfil target group practical requirements, these viable requirements are the vital instruments for Generation Y retention, which required to be integrated as strategic solutions. This guidance for practical users and academic researchers became essential to fight against the global storms of Generation Y turnover to combat overt and covert losses due to frequent turnover. © 2019, Allied Business Academies.

It uses research on climate change mitigation in China and India to explore how government agencies seek to overcome challenges of limited capacity and competing priorities by bundling climate change together with more immediate priorities and thereby developing a coalition with an interest in achieving these objectives. The article is based on interviews conducted in China and India, as well as analysis of themes covered in the growing body of literature on the domestic politics of climate change mitigation. In both countries we found that pragmatic approaches leveraging what already exists made significant progress in putting energy efficiency on the agenda, strengthening institutional presence (in India) and delivering improvements in energy efficiency (in China). Yet, we also found that the use of these tactics had significant limitations. While there was probably no other way that the policy space given to climate change mitigation could have increased so rapidly, there are significant side effects that arise as a result of the traction gained by these initial policy approaches. While bundling raised the profile of energy efficiency, it also created perverse incentives that highlight the need to consider the long-term effect on the interests, capacity and sustainability of informal coalitions. We highlight the need to take account of both the short- and long-term effects of thinking and working politically, and the challenges of doing so when the outcomes are unpredictable and inherently difficult to assess. © The Authors 2018.

However, the rapid recombination of charge carriers and deficient reactive sites, as two major obstacles, severely hampers the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity. Herein, a desirable surface halogenation strategy to address the aforementioned concerns over a Sillén-related layer-structured photocatalyst Bi2O2(OH)(NO3) (BON) is demonstrated. The surface halogen ions that are anchored on the Bi atoms by replacing surface hydroxyls on the one hand facilitate the local charge separation, and, on the other hand, activate the hydroxyls that profoundly boost the adsorption of CO2 molecules and protons and facilitate the CO2 conversion process, as evidenced by experimental and theoretical results collectively. Among the three series of BON-X (X = Cl, Br, and I) catalysts, BON-Br shows the most substantially enhanced CO production rate (8.12 µmol g−1 h−1) without any sacrificial agents or cocatalysts, ≈73 times higher than that of pristine Bi2O2(OH)(NO3), also exceeding that of the state-of-the-art photocatalysts reported to date. This work presents a surface polarization protocol for engineering charge behavior and reactive sites to promote photocatalysis, which shows great promise to the future design of high-performance materials for clean energy production. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A growing body of evidence links climate-related risk to the extent and the persistence of rural poverty in these environments. Stochastic shocks erode smallholder farmers’ long-term livelihood potential through loss of productive assets. The resulting uncertainty impedes progress out of poverty by acting as a disincentive to investment in agriculture – by farmers, rural financial services, value chain institutions and governments. We assess evidence published in the last ten years that a set of production technologies and institutional options for managing risk can stabilize production and incomes, protect assets in the face of shocks, enhance uptake of improved technologies and practices, improve farmer welfare, and contribute to poverty reduction in risk-prone smallholder agricultural systems. Production technologies and practices such as stress-adapted crop germplasm, conservation agriculture, and diversified production systems stabilize agricultural production and incomes and, hence, reduce the adverse impacts of climate-related risk under some circumstances. Institutional interventions such as index-based insurance and social protection through adaptive safety nets play a complementary role in enabling farmers to manage risk, overcome risk-related barriers to adoption of improved technologies and practices, and protect their assets against the impacts of extreme climatic events. While some research documents improvements in household welfare indicators, there is limited evidence that the risk-reduction benefits of the interventions reviewed have enabled significant numbers of very poor farmers to escape poverty. We discuss the roles that climate-risk management interventions can play in efforts to reduce rural poverty, and the need for further research on identifying and targeting environments and farming populations where improved climate risk management could accelerate efforts to reduce rural poverty. © 2018","Insurancesocial protection; Poverty trap; Production technology; Resilience; Risk","agricultural production; agricultural technology; climate change; extreme event; government; institutional reform; insurance system; investment; livelihood; poverty alleviation; risk assessment; rural area; smallholder; stochasticity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041202395

One effort to reduce the adverse impact is to promote environmentally friendly transportation systems, including the concept of bicycle sharing. The use of bicycle does not cause any pollution, thus becoming a potential solution in reducing greenhouse gases. The city of Surakarta has been a tourist destination in which a lot of tourist attractions are popular among the tourist, therefore Surakarta is one of the suitable cities to apply the concept of bicycle-sharing. The purpose of this research is to establish the model and determine the probability of choosing the mode between the bicycle and the pedicab in the tourist attractions in Surakarta City, Central Java, Indonesia. The data was collected by interview and questionnaire to 289 respondents who were the visitors of Benteng Vastenburg and Surakarta Palace or Keraton Surakarta. The variables examined in this research are cost, travel time, and comfort. The amount of each variable can be estimated with the equation: Usp-b = 1.028 - 0.000099 (Bsp - Bb) - 0.245 (Wsp - Wb) + 1.954 (Csp - Cb). Where Usp-b is the utility difference between bicycle and pedicab, Bsp is the cost of bicycle, Bb is the cost of pedicab, Wsp is the travel time of bicycle, Wb is the travel time of pedicab, Csp is the comfort level of biicycle and Cb is the comfort level of pedicab. From the data analysis, the highest probability of people o use bicycle is obtained when the cost of the pedicab is high, the traveling time of the bicycle is normal, the traveling time of the pedicab is too long, and the comfort of bicycle is high, with probability of 95.16%.

Some studies have reviewed the effects of N deposition on plant species diversity; however, all studies addressed the effects of N deposition on plant community focused on species richness in specific ecosystem. There is a need for a systematic meta-analysis covering multiple dimensions of plant diversity in multiple climate zones and ecosystems types. Our goal was to quantify changes in species richness, evenness and uncertainty in plant communities in response to N addition across different environmental and experimental contexts. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of 623 experimental records published in English and Chinese journals to evaluate the response of terrestrial plant diversity to the experimental N addition in China. Three metrics were used to quantify the change in plant diversity: species richness (SR), evenness (Pielou index) uncertainty (Shannon index). Important Findings: Results showed that (i) N addition negatively affected SR in temperate, Plateau zones and subtropical zone, but had no significant effect on Shannon index in subtropical zones; (ii) N addition decreased SR, Shannon index and Pielou index in grassland, and the negative effect of N addition on SR was stronger in forest than in grassland; (iii) N addition negatively affected plant diversity (SR, Shannon index and Pielou index) in the long term, whereas it did not affect plant diversity in the short term. Furthermore, the increase in N addition levels strengthened the negative effect of N deposition on plant diversity with long experiment duration; and (iv) the negative effect of ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) addition on SR was stronger than that of urea (CO(NH2)2) addition, but the negative effect of NH4NO3 addition on Pielou index was weaker than that of CO(NH2)2 addition.

RESULTS: The reduction of volatile solids (VS) was 77% at 45 °C TPAD-1 and 72% at 55 °C TPAD-II. The accumulation of ammonia and volatile fatty acids (VFAs; propionic acid) were observed to be below the inhibitory range (&gt;3000 mg L−1), whereas the methane (CH4) production (45 °C, 3.55 ± 0.47 L CH4 L−1 day−1; 35 °C, 1.44 ± 0.12 L CH4 L−1 day−1) remained considerably higher in TPAD-I than TPAD-II. Furthermore, the TPAD-II system suffered from certain degree of instability due to high level of total VFAs (6087 ± 1578 mg L−1), low buffering capacity, increased level of total NH3 (2982 ± 219 mg L−1) and free NH3 (246 ± 25 mg L−1), and relatively reduced CH4 production (1.69 ± 0.1 L L−1 day). The bacterial and archaeal population of the TPADs investigated by 454 pyrosequencing and Illumina sequencing showed, in both TPAD systems, a bacterial community dominated by Firmicutes, followed by Bacteriodetes, Proteobacteria, Synergistetes and Actiniobacteria. The archaeal community was dominated by Methanimicrobia (74–84% Methanosarcina) and Methanobacteria (15–27% Methanobacterium). A progression from genus Clostridium to Coprothermobacter and Tepidanaerobacter, and Methanocarcina to Methanothermobacter and Methanobacterium was observed in TPAD-II.

In order to facilitate the progress, government departments are supposed to adopt a motivating or punitive policy to make guidance for downstream carbon emissions reduction. This study determined and verified the evolutionarily stable strategies ESSs) of government departments and individuals whose carbon emissions exceeded the initial carbon allowance (CEEICA individuals) by using the evolutionary game and numerical simulation methods, respectively. The findings show that the ESS of government departments is always a punitive policy during the variation of strategies of CEEICA individuals. The ESS of CEEICA individuals is an active plan when the added cost (the difference between emissions reduction cost and trading earning) is less than the carbon tax; otherwise, it is a passive plan. Furthermore, the rate of convergence can be significantly influenced by the probabilistic distances between initial strategies and the ESSs. On the basis of these findings, this study suggested implementing a “punishment first, motivation-supplemented” policy, and developing a stable operational mechanism for a personal carbon trading market. © 2019 by the author.

This study focuses on the height growth response of sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) to counteracting effects of fostering and interfering changes under contrasting climatic conditions with special attention to the xeric limit zone of this species. Materials and Methods: Twenty-eight sites were selected along a climatic gradient from the humid region in southwest Hungary to the continental-semiarid region in northeast Hungary where neighbouring old and young sessile oak stands were available for pair-wise comparison of height growth. While these young stands developed entirely in the significantly changed atmospheric conditions, the older trees lived only a part of their life time in such changed environment. The Ellenberg quotient (EQ) was used for describing climate aridity. Stand top height in each pair of old and young stands was measured to calculate the relative stand top height using yield tables of sessile oak for Hungary. Additionally, stand densities of old stands were measured. To demonstrate the height growth differences of old and young stands their relative stand top heights were compared as functions of EQ and stand density. Results: The relative top heights of the young stands were significantly higher than of the older stands, which means that the overall growing conditions were better in the last 30-35 years due to atmospheric changes than the mean conditions during the lifetime of old stands. Although extreme drought events associated with climate change caused reduced stand density due to periodic tree mortality at the xeric limit of sessile oak, the synergetic effect of all atmospheric changes was still sufficient enough to accelerate height growth. Conclusions: There has been an acceleration of height growth during the last decades despite the increased frequency of droughts. It cannot be concluded that height growth acceleration will continue in the future since climate models show an increasing tendency of dry extremes in Hungary that may overrule the positive fostering effect of atmospheric changes. © 2019 by the Croatian Forest Research Institute.","Climate change; Height growth; Quercus petraea (Matt.)

Although specialty treatment programs are uniquely positioned to deliver prevention care to children of adult clients, these programs may have limited capacity to implement prevention and early intervention care services, particularly in racial and ethnic minority communities. We merged data from program surveys and client records collected in 2015 to examine the extent to which program capacity factors are associated with the odds of delivering prevention and early intervention services for children of adult clients attending outpatient SUD treatment in low-income minority communities in Los Angeles County, California. Our analytic sample consisted of 16,712 clients embedded in 82 programs. Our results show that 85% of these programs reported delivering prevention care services, while 71% of programs delivered early intervention services. Programs with organizational climates supporting change and those that served a high number of clients annually were more likely to implement both prevention and early intervention practices. Programs accepting Medicaid payments and serving clients whose primary drug was marijuana were more than three times as likely to implement prevention services. Overall, our findings suggest both program- and client-level characteristics are associated with delivering preventive care offered to children of adult clients receiving SUD treatment in communities of color. As Medicaid has become a major payor of SUD treatment services and marijuana use has been legalized in California, findings identify capacity factors to deliver public health prevention interventions in one of the nation’s largest public SUD treatment systems. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Implementation; Leadership; Prevention services; Program capacity; Substance use disorder treatment","California; child; child health care; child of impaired parents; drug dependence; female; human; male; middle aged; Child; Child Health Services; Child of Impaired Parents; Female; Humans; Los Angeles; Male; Middle Aged; Substance-Related Disorders",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066050757

Actual—so called constitutive—emissions are then calculated from prevailing temperature and radiation. However, various abiotic and biotic stressors such as ozone, extreme radiation and temperature conditions, as well as wounding e.g., from insect feeding, can lead to de-novo emissions of stress-induced BVOCs (sBVOCs) that may excel constitutive emissions by more than an order of magnitude. These emissions often have a considerable different compound composition and are short-lived but can prolong under continuous stress for quite some time. Thus, they may easily have a large impact on overall regional BVOC emissions. However, sBVOCs are generally not considered in models since up to date no consistent mechanism has been proposed. This manuscript suggests a new mechanism based on the finding that sBVOCs originate from a handful of biosynthetic pathways which synthesize compounds in the groups of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and green leave volatiles, as well as methyl salicylate, ethanol/acetaldehyde, methanol/formaldehyde, and acetone. Isoprene is also considered but since it is often constitutively emitted, the specific role of stress induction is difficult to determine for this compound. A function is proposed that describes the production of all de-novo sBVOCs sufficiently well and scales with stress intensity. It is hypothesized that the response delay and the form of the function is specific for the production pathway and valid for ozone as well as wounding (herbivory) induced stress. Model parameters are then derived from pooled literature data based on a meta-analysis of suitable induction-response measurements of different plant species. The overall emission amount derives from the intensity and frequency of the stress impulse. We present a number of literature studies that are used to parameterize the new model as well as a selection of evaluations for single- and multiple-stress inductions. Furthermore, coupling and interaction with constitutive emission models as well as limitations and possible further developments are discussed. © Copyright © 2019 Grote, Sharma, Ghirardo and Schnitzler.","BVOCs; herbivory; induced emissions; modeling; oxidative stress; ozone impact; wounding",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077654146

Research suggests that ESS tend to increase grid emissions, but some speculate that retail rate design could lessen its impact. This paper tests that theory. In this analysis, we pair five years of historic data from ISO New England (ISO-NE) and the PJM Interconnection with 15 commercial building load profiles to reveal how different rate designs influence emissions from ESS. We find that demand and energy charges can be configured to lessen the emissions impact of ESS in some markets and reduce net system emissions in others. Minimizing different types of demand charges requires different quantities of ESS dispatch: some can be minimized in hours while others require days. Time-varying energy charges increase dispatch compared to flat charges because the ESS is used for demand charge management and energy arbitrage. Separately, time-varying energy charges reduce emissions per MW h-stored compared to flat charges, all else equal. Unfortunately, a rate design that minimizes emissions in one market might increase emissions if implemented in another. This confounds the creation of universal solutions and highlights the need for approaches tailored to specific markets. © 2019","CO2 emissions; Demand charge management; Energy storage; Rate design","Commerce; Costs; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Emission control; Energy storage; Office buildings; Sales; CO2 emissions; Commercial building; Energy arbitrages; Energy storage systems; PJM Interconnection; Reducing emissions; Retail rate design; Universal solutions; Storage management; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; demand-side management; design; electricity; emission control; energy storage; retailing; New England; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061782046

We combine several complementary analytical methods applied to the same unheated and heat treated material to ensure data consistency in order to establish a comprehensive study on heat-induced changes in bone. We applied quantitative powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and Infrared-coupled Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA-FTIR), and we correlated the analytical results with empirical indicators such as crystallinity indices (CI and IRSF) and bone colour changes after burning. At temperatures from 700 °C onwards after 30 min of heating, a considerable recrystallization reaction from bioapatite to hydroxyapatite occurred. FTIR revealed that there are no or only minor amounts of hydroxyl-ions in original bone mineral which in consequence should be referred to “carbonate-hydro-apatite” rather than hydroxyapatite. Thermal treatment induced a pronounced increase of crystallite size and an increase of hydroxyl groups in the apatite lattice accompanied by a depletion of water and reduction of carbonate contents during incineration. Thus, the heat treatment at temperatures ≥700 °C leads to the recrystallization of bioapatite to hydroxyapatite. Above 800 °C buchwaldite is formed from the Na component within the bone mineral. Moreover, we found that the transformation reaction involving crystallite growth mainly sets in after organic matrix compounds and their residues have been combusted and the apatite grains get into direct contact. The information in this work, obtained by a combination of analytical methods which are typically applied and approved to determine bone cremation temperatures, can help to better understand changes in complex biomaterials during heating. In particular, the knowledge from this study can be applied to assess the cremation conditions of archaeological bone finds. As changes in the bone mineral state are not only dependent on temperature but also on time, care must be taken to deduce a defined temperature which cremated bone finds were exposed to. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bioapatite; Bioarchaeology; Calcination; Carbonated apatite; Crystallinity index; Forensic science; Rietveld method",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065722384

In this study, we use plume intercepts from the Wintertime INvestigation of Transport, Emission and Reactivity (WINTER) campaign to estimate the oxidation rates of SO2 under wintertime conditions and the factors that determine SO2 removal. Observations suggest that OH governs the rate SO2 oxidation in the eastern United States during winter. The range of mean oxidation rates during the day from power plants were 0.22–0.71%/hr, producing SO2 lifetimes of 13–43 days, if SO2 consumption is assumed to occur during 10.5 hr of daylight in cloudless conditions. Though most nighttime rate measurements were zero within uncertainty, there is some evidence of nighttime removal, which suggests alternate oxidation mechanisms. The fastest nighttime observed SO2 oxidation rate was 0.25±0.07%/hr, producing a combined day/night SO2 lifetime of 8.5–21 days. The upper limit of the oxidation rate (the mean+1σ of the fastest day and night observations) is 16.5%/day, corresponding to a lifetime of 6.1 days. The analysis also quantifies the primary emission of sulfate from power plants. The median mole percentage of SO4-2 from observed plumes was 1.7% and the mean percentage sulfate was 2.8% for intercepts within 1 hr of transit to power plants. The largest value observed from close intercepts was over 7% sulfate, and the largest extrapolated value was 18%, based on intercepts further from their source and fastest observed oxidation rate. ©2019.

Throughout these changes, fog frequency exhibited a consistent north-south trend, with maxima in southern latitudes. We analyzed seven decades of meteorological data and five decades of air pollution data to determine the most likely drivers changing fog, including temperature, dew point depression, precipitation, wind speed, and NOx (oxides of nitrogen) concentration. Climate variables, most critically dew point depression, strongly influence the short-term (annual) variability in fog frequency; however, the frequency of optimal conditions for fog formation show no observable trend from 1980 to 2016. NOx concentration, which has a decreasing north-south concentration gradient, declined continuously over this period, consistent with the long-term temporal and spatial trends in fog. As development in the Central Valley increased direct particle and other pollutant emissions from 1930 to 1970, fog frequency increased. Following the Clean Air Act, particle emissions quickly declined, and NOx emissions declined steadily, reducing the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) available for fog formation. As a precursor of ammonium nitrate aerosols, which are efficient CCN, we used NOx measurements and emission trends as a proxy for the CCN trend. We conclude that while the short-term fog variability is dominantly driven by climate fluctuations, the longer-term temporal and spatial changes in fog have been driven by changes in air pollution. For conditions close to the dew point, a decrease in fog of 5 days/year per 10 parts per billion NOx decrease occurred across the Central Valley. ©2019. American Geophysical Union.

(Nature 562:259-262, 2018) analyses the climate impact of forest management in the European Union, considering both biogeochemical (i.e., greenhouse gases, GHG) and biophysical (e.g., albedo, transpiration, etc.) effects. Based on their findings, i.e. that additional net overall climate benefits from forest management would be modest, the authors conclude that the EU ""should not rely on forest management to mitigate climate change"". We first explain that most of the additional EU GHG mitigation effort by 2030 is expected to come from emission reductions and only a very small part from forestry, even when forest bioenergy is allowed for. Nevertheless, the inclusion of forest management in climate change mitigation strategies is key to identifying the country-specific optimal mix, in terms of overall GHG balance, between strategies focused on conserving and/or enhancing the sink and strategies focused on using more wood to reduce emissions in other GHG sectors. Then, while acknowledging the importance that biophysical effects have on the climate, especially at the local and seasonal scale, we argue that the net annual biophysical climate impact of forest management in Europe remains more uncertain than the net CO2 impact. This has not been adequately emphasized by Luyssaert et al. (2018), leading to conclusions on the net overall climate impact of forest management that we consider premature and applied to a partially biased perception of European policy towards forestry and climate change. To avoid further confusion in the debate on how forestry may contribute to mitigating climate change, a more constructive dialogue between the scientific community and policy makers is needed. © 2019 The Author(s).","Bioenergy; Biophysical effects; EU climate target; Forest mitigation; GHG emissions","bioenergy; biophysics; climate change; climate effect; emission inventory; environmental policy; European Union; forest ecosystem; forest management; greenhouse gas; mitigation; Europe",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067315042

However, there is still very little understanding of the factors that influence household-level mitigation and adaptation action. From a review of literature, we identified the factors that potentially influence climate mitigation and adaptation actions of households, which we then tested using survey data from 622 households in Nuevo Leon, Mexico. Nuevo Leon is a major emitter of greenhouse gasses and is a state where climate-related disasters are recurrent and expected to increase in frequency and severity. Results from ordinal regression analyses showed that perceived knowledge and financial self-efficacy greatly influenced the extent of household-level action taken. To a lesser extent, the age and educational level of the respondent also affected action. Respondents pointed out the need to know about different aspects of climate change. An implication of our study is the value of recognizing the importance of perceptions, as mitigation and adaptation actions are shaped by perceptions of climate change alongside socio-demographic characteristics. This may have significant implications for policies and campaigns promoting household-level action to increase resilience to climate change. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate and development; Climate change awareness; Climate change beliefs; Household action; Mexico; Perceived knowledge",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066975661

The synergetic implementation of both goals forms a central challenge particularly for the building stock. There is evidence that damage to buildings due to extreme weather events (e.g. heavy rain, fluvial flooding, hail, summer heat) steadily increase. Therefore, several national strategies and action plans in European member states formulate requirements for climate-adapted modernisation and retrofitting of existing residential buildings. The paper explores the conflicts between the two named goals at the building level, since building energy saving measures are unfortunately not in any case consistent with the goal of increased climate adaptation, as they undesirably increase the vulnerability of buildings. For this purpose, the paper first deals with the structural design of selected building types, which have been refurbished in order to optimize their energy efficiency. Second, it analyses and evaluates the physical vulnerability of existing buildings against extreme weather events.

This paper proposes a method for reservoir operation associated with climate-change projections aimed at ensuring the sustainability of agricultural water supply. The method is applied to the Aidoghmoush reservoir in East Azerbaijan province (Iran) employing climate-change projections for 2040–2069, and compares the future-period results with those calculated for the baseline period (1971–2000). The water-supply system depending on the Aidoghmoush reservoir is simulated using the climate-change projections. The water-supply system simulations are ranked with two multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods according to their suitability for satisfying agricultural water demands and sustain cropping patterns. These are the multi-criteria optimization and compromise resolution (VIKOR) and the Fuzzy Order Weighted Average (FOWA) MCDM methods. The MCDM methods identify the best water-supply management alternatives for climate-change adaptation. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change adaptation strategies; Decision-making criteria; FOWA method; Multi-criteria decision making; VIKOR method; Water evaluation and planning (WEAP)","Agriculture; Decision making; Multiobjective optimization; Reservoirs (water); Water management; Water supply; Water supply systems; Climate change adaptation; Decision making criteria; FOWA method; Multi criteria decision making; VIKOR method; Climate change; adaptation; adaptive management; agriculture; climate change; multicriteria analysis; sustainability; water demand; water supply; East Azerbaijan; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068579343

In the atmosphere they undergo oxidation, mainly through reactions with ·OH and NOx to produce nitro- and oxygenated (oxy-) derivatives. In this study, we developed a new method for the detection of particle-bound PAHs, nitro-PAHs and oxy-PAHs using direct infusion into an atmospheric pressure photoionisation high-resolution mass spectrometer (APPI-HRMS). Method optimisation was done by testing different source temperatures, gas flow rates, mobile phases and dopants. Samples were extracted with methanol, concentrated by evaporation and directly infused in the APPI source after adding toluene as dopant. Acquisition was performed in both polarity modes. The method was applied to target analysis of seasonal PM2.5 samples from an urban background site in Padua (Italy), in the Po Valley, in which a series of PAHs, nitro- and oxy-PAHs were detected. APPI-HRMS was then used for non-target analysis of seasonal PM2.5 samples and results compared with nano-electrospray ionisation (nanoESI) HRMS. The results showed that, when samples were characterised by highly oxidised organic compounds, including S-containing compounds, like in summer samples, APPI did not bring any additional information with respect to nanoESI in negative polarity (nanoESI(-)). Conversely, for winter samples, APPI(-) could detect a series of aromatic and poly-aromatic compounds, mainly oxidised and nitrogenated aromatics, that were not otherwise detected with nanoESI. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","APPI-MS; HRMS; NanoESI-MS; PAH derivatives; PM2.5; Urban background","Aromatization; Atmospheric pressure; Electrospray ionization; Extraction; Flow of gases; Mass spectrometry; Oxidation; Photoionization; Urban growth; APPI-MS; HRMS; Nano-ESI; PM2.5; Urban background; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; methanol; organic compound; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; toluene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; aerosol; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric pressure; background level; detection method; ionization; mass spectrometry; oxidation; PAH; particulate matter; sulfur compound; urban atmosphere; aerosol; air pollution; air sampling; Article; atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry; concentration process; controlled study; electrospray mass spectrometry; evaporation; flow rate; gas flow; Italy; nanoanalysis; particulate matter; process optimization; summer; temperature; urban area; winter; aerosol; air pollutant; analysis; atmosphere; atmospheric pressure; environmental monitoring; mass spectrometry; procedures; Chile; Italy; Maipo Valley; Padova; Padua; Po Valley; Veneto; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Atmosphere; Atmospheric Pressure; Environmental Monitoring; Italy; Mass Spectrometry; Particulate Matter; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062696834

The commitment under the Paris Agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has indirectly forced many countries to support the efforts for RE generation. This energy transition from unsustainable fossil fuels to RE was demonstrated by the promulgation of various laws and policies at national, regional and international levels. Aligned with that, Malaysia has also taken several measures in mitigating climate change impacts and accelerating RE development. Thus, this study focuses on the importance of RE generation as part of the climate mitigation regime with reference to the Renewable Energy Act 2011 (Act 725). This study adopts a black-letter approach through statute analysis. Throughout this paper, it was suggested that the Renewable Energy Act 2011 failed to address climate change issues properly. Therefore, this paper calls for a reform to incorporate climate change mitigation and sustainable development in the existing law. © Penerbit UMT.","Climate change; Environment; Law; Renewable energy; Sustainable development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072162790

Aerosols sampling for molecular marker study was conducted from June 2015 to May 2016 at Xieyang Island in the northern South China Sea (SCS), to learn the impact of outflow from Indo-China Peninsular (ICP) and South China (SC). Xieyang Island was under the influence of air masses from ICP and SC nearly 70% of the year. Levels of anhydrosugars were higher during October to early March. They were lower in April and May, although biomass burning events in ICP were most intensive and half of air masses back trajectories passed through ICP in this period. Significant correlations between levels of anhydrosugars, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, n-alkanes, high molecular weight n-fatty acids and terephthalic acid were observed, suggesting co-emissions of these compounds. Source types of aerosol primary organic matter (POM) tracked by these markers, namely open burning of municipal wastes, fossil fuel combustion, higher plant emissions and biomass burning, largely contributed in fall and winter with SC to be an important source region. However, levels of sugar alcohols (a group of biogenic aerosol tracers) were higher in warm seasons with ICP and SCS to be the main source regions, and were poorly correlated with levels of other molecular markers. Carbon preference index of n-alkanes also increased in warm seasons, indicating enhanced higher plant wax emissions. It suggested that there was a close link between biogenic emissions of sugar alcohols (or n-alkanes) and the growing activities of related organisms. Besides continental outflow, there were marine sources of steranes, hopanes (fossil sources tracers) and mannitol (a sugar alcohol), since their levels were higher for aerosol samples basically influenced by air masses originated from SCS. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosol molecular markers; Continetal outflow; Indo-China Peninsula; Source apportionment; South China; South China Sea","Biogeochemistry; Fatty acids; Fossil fuels; Paraffins; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Polyols; Tracers; Waste incineration; Continetal outflow; Indo-China Peninsula; Molecular marker; Source apportionment; South China; South China sea; Aerosols; alkane; benzo[a]pyrene; benzo[b]fluoranthene; benzo[ghi]perylene; benzo[k]fluoranthene; benz[a]anthracene; chrysene; dibenz[a,h]anthracene; fatty acid derivative; fossil fuel; hopanoid; molecular marker; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; prednisolone; pyrene; sugar; sugar alcohol; terephthalic acid; aerosol; air mass; biogenic emission; biogeochemistry; biomarker; biomass burning; chemical composition; chemical compound; fossil fuel; marine environment; organic matter; outflow; source apportionment; aerosol; Article; atmosphere; biogeochemistry; biomass; chemical composition; climate; combustion; molecular weight; municipal waste; priority journal; South China Sea; Southeast Asia; Soxhlet extraction; vascular plant; China; China; Guangxi Zhuangzu; India; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; Xieyang Island; Embryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062970103

Moreover, its effect as source of intense radiation is significant as soon as locally rich mixtures occur, especially at in-creased pressure. This motivates the need to better understand soot formation and oxidation in turbulent, pressurised environment in order to prevent its emission as much as possible. A detailed understanding of the underlying processes can be gained when correlating sophisticated CFD modelling with well-defined validation experiments at technical conditions. LII has proven to be a valuable diagnostic to quantitatively monitor soot distributions inside combustion processes. However, application to pressurized gas turbine combustors has rarely been published for several reasons. Here, we present trends for soot distributions inside at technical combustor operated between 4 and 20 bar at realistic geometries and flow rates. Considerations on tackling typical challenges at technical conditions are presented. The resulting time-averaged soot distributions serve to determine positions of soot formation and oxidation as well as quantification of soot concentrations under the highly challenging technical conditions of the study. In general, soot concentrations were found to be relatively low. In combination with data derived independently from the present work, involving the application of other diagnostics (OH and kerosene distributions as well as temperatures), a good validation data set is available to support soot modellers. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"Aircraft engines; Combustors; Computational fluid dynamics; Dust; Combustion pro-cess; Laser induced incandescence; Realistic geometry; Soot concentration; Soot distributions; Soot measurement; Technical conditions; Validation data; Soot",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065713852

Such an approach, although increasingly promoted, remains only loosely defined and requires further development in order to effectively integrate different interventions at landscape level. In particular, it is important to understand the possible interactions between different landscape interventions at local level—where they are intended to have effect—and the challenges associated with them. Inspired by the complexity of policy mix analysis, this article seeks to shed light on these interactions by analysing how different policies and measures for reducing deforestation and degradation have played out in a jurisdiction with wide-ranging actors and interventions aimed at shaping their behaviour. Focusing on smallholders, we examine the Sustainable Landscapes Pilot Programme in São Félix do Xingu, looking at how different policies interact—categorising interactions as “complementary,” “mutually reinforcing” (synergistic), “in conflict,” “interdependent,” and/or “redundant”—and explain how proponents of this pilot programme seek to integrate them. Most analysis is based on primary data collected through quantitative (i.e., random stratified sampling and surveys) and qualitative (i.e., observation and focus groups) methods. The São Félix do Xingu case shows that understanding effects of different policies and measures on people's behaviour requires a deeper look at local perceptions and reactions to such policies and measures, something most studies on the topic have overlooked. Ultimately, the heterogeneity and complexity of social practices that permeate landscapes must be recognised in order to integrate diverse measures to reduce deforestation. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","behaviour change; Brazilian Amazon; landscape approach; policyscape","climate change; deforestation; environmental policy; landscape; perception; smallholder; Amazonia; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062349806

Since power enterprises are the main participants in the NCET market and PRT market, the integrated effect of the NCET market and PRT market on power enterprise profit and the regional environment is one of the major issues that needs to be taken into consideration. Based on system dynamics (SD) theory, we propose an NCET-PRT simulation model for power enterprises in Chongqing. Through analyzing parameters of carbon trading price, free ratio, and emission trading prices, 12 different simulation scenarios are configured for sensitivity analysis. Based on the simulation results, the following observations can be obtained: (1) NCET and PRT can effectively promote the performance of enterprises' carbon emissions reduction and regional pollutant emission reduction but will have a minor negative impact on the industrial economy at the same time; (2) The trading mechanism is interactive; if the carbon emissions trading (NCET) mechanism is implemented separately, the emission of pollutants will be reduced significantly. However, the implementation of pollution rights trading (PRT) alone cannot significantly reduce CO2 emissions; (3) At an appropriate level, NCET and PRT can be enhanced to achieve a maximum emissions reduction effect at a minimum economic cost. © 2019 by the authors.","Nationwide carbon emissions trading (NCET); Pollution rights trading (PRT); Power enterprise; System dynamics (SD)","carbon emission; emissions trading; environmental economics; integrated approach; market conditions; national planning; performance assessment; pollution tax; China; Chongqing; Jiaxing; Zhejiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067306508

As the concentration of dissolved CO2 increases in unsaturated brine, the density increases and the system may ultimately become unstable, and it may initiate convection. In this article, we study the stability of convection in an anisotropic horizontal porous layer, where the solute is assumed to decay via a first-order chemical reaction. We perform linear and nonlinear stability analyses based on the steady-state concentration field to assess neutral stability curves as a function of the anisotropy ratio, Damköhler number and Rayleigh number. We show that anisotropy in permeability and solutal diffusivity play an important role in convective instability. It is shown that when solutal horizontal diffusivity is larger than the vertical diffusivity, varying the ratio of vertical to horizontal permeabilities does not significantly affect the behaviour of instability. It is also noted that, when horizontal permeability is higher than the vertical permeability, varying the ratio of vertical to horizontal solutal diffusivity does have a substantial effect on the instability of the system when the reaction rate is dominated by the diffusion rate. We used the Chebyshev-tau method coupled with the QZ algorithm to solve the eigenvalue problem obtained from both the linear and nonlinear stability theories. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

In this process, the GBIG bicarbonate crystallization regenerates the amino acid sorbent at ambient temperature, and the CO2 is subsequently released by mild heating (120 °C) of the GBIG bicarbonate crystals, which results in quantitative regeneration of GBIG. The cyclic capacities measured from multiple absorption-regeneration cycles are in the range of 0.2-0.3 mol CO2/mol amino acid. The regeneration energy of this hybrid solvent/solid-state approach is 24% and 40% lower than the regeneration energy of benchmark industrial sorbents monoethanolamine and sodium glycinate, respectively.

It was anticipated that this new semibulky derivative should favor the HS state and undergo SCO at a lower temperature range. During this study, six crystalline forms of 1 were prepared by controlling the crystallization conditions. Thus, when reagents are combined in CH3CN, an equilibrium mixture of cis and trans isomers is established that favors the latter below 311 K. The trans isomer can be isolated exclusively as a mixture of solvates, LS trans-1·2CH3CN and HS trans-1·4CH3CN, by cooling CH3CN solutions to-20 °C with the former being favored at high concentrations and short crystallization times. Subsequently, vapor diffusion of Et2O into CH3CN solutions of pure trans-1·2CH3CN gives solvate-free HS trans-1. Subjecting trans-1·2CH3CN to vacuum at room temperature gives microcrystalline trans-1·CH3CN, identified by elemental analysis and its distinct powder X-ray diffraction pattern. If an isomeric mixture of 1 is subject to room-temperature vapor diffusion, then a crystalline mixture of HS isomers cis-1 and trans-1 is obtained. Finally, slowly cooling hot acetonitrile solutions of isomeric mixtures of 1 to room temperature gives large prisms of HS co-1, a species with both cis and trans isomers in the unit cell. The complexes trans-1, trans-1·CH3CN, cis-1, and co-1 undergo SCO below 250 K while trans-1·xCH3CN (x = 2, 4) solvates do not undergo SCO before desolvation.

In this work, we assessed the potential effect of heavy metals and environmental variables on the CO2 assimilation (A) and the stomatal conductace (gS) of Ligustrum lucidum, a common urban tree in Mexico City. We compared two sites with contrasting pollution levels: 1) city centre (PPI-C, high pollution level); and 2) south of the city (CU-SW; low pollution level). At each site, we measured 1) phsysiological traits (A and gS); 2) environmental variables (photosynthetically active radiation, PAR; air temperature, TA; vapor pressure deficit, VPD; concentration of atmospheric CO2); and 3) morphological leaf characteristics (stomatal size and density). Concentration of the heavy metals Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Fe, and Zn was determined in washed (internal metals) and unwashed (external plus internal metal) leaves at both sites. CO2 assimilation at CU-SW was higher than at PPI-C. PAR had the greatest effect on A; whereas TA and VPD had the greatest effect on gS. Regarding heavy metals, although we found no significant differences in internal concentrations between sites, we found a lower stomatal density at PPI-C, which may indicate a response of the species to the local pollution conditions. This characteristic might be benefitial for the species, allowing it to maintain optimal physiological conditions by reducing the assimilation of pollutants. Our results suggest that L. lucidum is a well adapted species for the urban environment. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Air temperature; CO2 concentration; Photosynthetically active radiation; Physiological responses; Pollutants; Urban vegetation","air temperature; assimilation efficiency; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); heavy metal; photosynthetically active radiation; pollutant; shrub; stomatal conductance; urban area; vapor pressure; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]; Ligustrum lucidum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066294945

When tackling retrofitting projects, the issue of scale becomes essential as sometimes this can determine the sustainability of the project. Therefore, a comprehensive approach is essential to ensure effective decision-making. A platform has been designed within the EU funded OptEEmAL project to support stakeholders in this process, providing functionalities that can automatically model and evaluate candidate retrofitting alternatives considering their priorities, targets and boundary conditions. A core element of this platform is the evaluation framework deployed which implements a multi-criteria decision-making approach to transform the priorities of stakeholders into quantifiable weights used to compare the alternatives. As a result, more informed decisions can be made by the stakeholders through a comprehensive evaluation of the candidate retrofitting scenarios. This paper presents the approach followed to develop and integrate this evaluation framework within the platform as well as its validation in a controlled environment to ensure its effectiveness. © 2019 by the authors.","District; Energy effciency; Evaluator; Indicators; Optimisation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068147544

However, a detailed study concerning its energy consumption and corresponding CO 2 emission characteristics, including emission trajectory, spatial distribution and driving forces at the whole sectoral scale is still lacking. In order to fill these research gaps, this study first uncovers the CO 2 emission trajectory of China's pharmaceutical industry and then identifies the key driving forces of its emission growth by utilizing an extended Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method. The results show that the total emission increased from 23.03 Mt in 2000 to 55.34 Mt in 2016. The consumptions of electricity, raw coal and heat were three major CO 2 emission sources. From the provincial perspective, the top 5 provinces emitted 51.77% of the total CO 2 emission in 2016, of which Shandong province was the biggest emitter, followed by Jiangsu, Jilin, Inner Mongolia and Ningxia. The analysis of relevant driving forces reveals that production scale effect was the most prominent factor of CO 2 emission growth and investment intensity also contributed to CO 2 emission growth. Conversely, energy intensity and R&amp;D efficiency were the main contributors of CO 2 emission reduction. Mitigation measures are finally proposed by considering the Chinese realities, including improving pharmaceutical industrial structure, promoting cleaner production strategy, encouraging rational R&amp;D and investment activities, optimizing energy structure and initiating capacity-building efforts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China's pharmaceutical industry; Driving forces; Energy-related CO2 emission; Governance","Emission control; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Investments; Cleaner production; CO2 emission reduction; CO2 emissions; Driving forces; Governance; Industrial structures; Mitigation measures; Pharmaceutical industry; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063315233

Cycling vibration is responsible for the cyclists’ perception of (dis)comfort. How asphalt pavement's surface characteristics relate to cycling comfort, however, remains undiscovered. In this study, the cycling vibration intensity on 46 sections of 24 urban roads was tested using a dynamic cycling comfort measure system while the cyclists’ perception of vibration was identified via questionnaires; the cycling comfort was then defined based on the cycling vibration. To record the accurate pavement-tyre interface under a stable environment, a total of 19 pavement sections were scanned using a 3D digital camera. These 3D models were then 3D printed, which are used to conduct the pressure film test using a self-developed pavement-tyre interface test system. Three ranges of pressure films were adopted to characterize the pavement-tyre interface via 9 parameters, namely contact area (A c ), unit bearing area (B u ), stress intensity (S i ), stress uniformity (S u ), kurtosis (S ku ), spacing (Sp a ), maximum peak spacing (Sp max ), radius ratio (R r ) and fractal dimension (F d ), in consideration of the area characteristics, pressure amplitude, peak spacing and shape of the interface. Finally, the significant interface parameters were identified, and the regression model between interface parameters and cycling comfort was established. Results show that the cycling vibration was described to be ‘very comfortable’ when the human exposure to vibration level (a wv ) was less than 1.78 m/s 2 ; ‘comfortable’ when the a wv was between 1.78 m/s 2 and 2.20 m/s 2 ; and ‘uncomfortable’ when the a wv was greater than 2.20 m/s 2 . The average stress on rear wheel-pavement interface is higher than that of the front wheel. B u-0.6 , Sp a-0.6 , and F d-0.6 are significant to cycling vibration. The 2LW pressure film is recommended for use to measure the bicycle pavement-tyre interface. The recommended interface characteristics are less than 7 mm 2 of the unit bearing area, 6 mm of average spacing and 2.38 of fractal dimension. Finally, dense asphalt mixture performs better in providing cycling comfort than the gap-graded asphalt mixture. Results of this study contribute to current knowledge on bike lane comfort and pavement design, the findings should be interested in cyclists, transport planners, and road authorities. © 2019","3D scanning and 3D printing; Asphalt pavement; Cycling comfort; Pavement-tyre interface; Pressure film; Vibration","3D printers; Asphalt pavements; Bicycles; Fractal dimension; Mixtures; Regression analysis; Surveys; Tires; Wheels; 3-D printing; Cycling comfort; Environment benefits; Interface characteristic; Interface parameters; Pressure films; Surface characteristics; Vibration; Asphalt mixtures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063314739

The global livestock sector contributes to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission, but on the other hand, it can also deliver a significant share of the necessary mitigation effort. One of the most significant greenhouse gas is methane. Mitigation methods for the methane emissions in cattle can be classified as short and long term. Short-term methods imply increase of production per animal, reduction of number of animals and feeding optimization, while long-term methods imply genetic evaluation and selection based on methane emission variation. Prerequisite for genetic evaluation is selection of optimal indicators and models with high accuracy and easy applicability in routine Animal Recording. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate different models for methane emission estimation in dairy cows based on Animal Recording data. The results obtained indicate that data from regular Animal Recording could be used in estimation of methane emission of dairy Simmental cows enabling the population analysis and genetic evaluation of dairy cattle for methane emission. Given the very high variability determined in estimated methane emission values regarding the used statistical models and aiming high accuracy of genetic evaluation it is recommended to define estimation models for body weight, dry matter intake and methane emission based on parameters (type traits and testday records) of particular dairy cattle population. The stated will enable genetic evaluation of dairy cattle for methane emission as well as selection of cows with lower methane emission intensity. Finally, this will lead to environmentally sustainable milk production. © 2019, Faculty of Agriculture in Osijek.

Six scenarios were developed – reference case, NDC, global 2 °C and three scenarios where CO2 emissions of all model regions converged in 2050 based on criteria of GDP/capita, emissions intensity of GDP and per capita emissions. The analysis shows that emission rights allocation schemes influence the total energy system development costs, long-term electricity generation requirements, and share of renewables especially solar PV generation to meet the 2 °C target. The model runs also show that solar-PV is the single most important generation technology for decarbonisation of India's power sector. Limiting the share of solar-PV generation can lead to 20% reduction in total electricity generation and increase system costs substantially for 2050. Further, the results also indicate that India may have 200–215 GW of stranded coal generation assets in 2050 in the low carbon scenarios. Our analysis suggest that India is one of those countries which are at the development stage and also highly risked with the lock-in in carbon emitting infrastructure especially coal-based generations unless action taken in the near-term. © 2019 International Energy Initiative","Burden sharing; India's NDC; Stranded assets; TIAM-UCL","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Cost benefit analysis; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Burden sharing; Climate change mitigation; Electricity generation; Generation technologies; India's NDC; Low-carbon technologies; Stranded assets; TIAM-UCL; Electric power generation; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electricity generation; emission inventory; energy market; Gross Domestic Product; photovoltaic system; solar power; sustainable development; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064460209

The availability of high mountainous regions appropriately covered with snow can provide a susceptible field for winter tourism. This research is applied-developmental in nature aimed to locate and identify the appropriate areas and points for the construction of ski resorts in Isfahan province. For positioning and identifying the susceptible areas for the construction of ski resorts, the Isfahan's high areas over than 2300 m were taken into account which were identified by applying analytic functions technique and satellite images. For locating, 7 measures including height, slope degree, temperature, snow depth, distance from the residential areas, infrastructure facilities and accessibility to communication roads were used. Besides, the statistical data obtained from 21 synoptic stations including that of Isfahan as well as nearby stations of Borujen, Saman, Si Sakht and Yasuj were also used. As per the obtained maps, Fereydunshahr, Semirom and a part of Chadegan were of high capability for the construction of ski resorts and winter tourism, respectively. In addition, the near distance between several villages and towns located close to these regions not only can play an effective role in the economic variety and development of these regions but also can significantly assist the management and maintenance of the ski resorts which should be deemed as a very important issue for the survival of such ski resorts. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

While housing is commonly built near America's busiest roadways, we know little about the application of mitigation measures that could reduce residents’ exposure to transportation-related pollution. This paper assesses the high-traffic roadway proximity of new housing in San Jose (California) and mitigation measures by public and private sector actors. We studied San Jose's 39 largest residential developments approved between 2008 and 2016. We examined project approval documents; visited development sites; measured proximity using geographic information systems (GIS); assessed aerial and Google Street View imagery; and collected data on green building certifications. Many of these developments were near freeways or major highways; about 4% of new housing units were within 500 feet of a high-traffic roadway, and 45% of new units were within 1500 feet of such roads. Public and private sector actors implemented limited mitigation measures. California's state government updated its building energy code and constructed soundwalls along some freeways. Some real estate developers also included green building features that may improve indoor air quality. But, there were no local regulations specifically guiding residential development along high-traffic roadways. In general, public and private sector mitigation measures were limited and uncoordinated.

This study characterized and modelled SOC stocks at two soil depth intervals, topsoil (0–30 cm) and subsoil (30–100 cm), based on both legacy and recent data from 7245 agricultural soil profiles and using environmental drivers (climate, agricultural practices and soil properties) for agricultural soils in Catalonia (NE Spain). Generalized Least Square (GLS) and Geographical Weighted Regression (GWR) were used as modelling approaches to: (i) assess the main SOC stock drivers and their effects on SOC stocks; (ii) analyse spatial variability of SOC stocks and their relationships with the main drivers; and (iii) predict and map SOC stocks at the regional scale. While topsoil variation of SOC stocks depended mainly on climate, soil texture and agricultural variables, subsoil SOC stocks changes depended mainly on soil attributes such us soil texture, clay content, soil type or depth to bedrock. The GWR model revealed that the relationship between SOC stocks and drivers varied spatially. Finally, the study was only able to predict and map topsoil SOC stocks at the regional scale, because controlling factors of SOC stocks at the subsoil level were largely unavailable for digital mapping. According to the resulting map, the mean SOC stock value for Catalan agriculture at the topsoil level was 4.88 ± 0.89 kg/m 2 and the total magnitude of the carbon pool in agricultural soils of Catalonia up to 30 cm reached 47.9 Tg.

However, such information is either limited or not available for many tropical species, making it difficult to incorporate climate change into conservation planning for most tropical species. Here, we used correlative ecological niche models to assess potential distributional responses of 3 rangerestricted West African birds, Timneh Parrot (Pscittacus erithracus timneh), Ballman's Malimbe (Malimbus ballmanni), and White-necked Rockfowl (Picathartes gymnocephalus), to global climate change. We used primary biodiversity occurrence records for each species obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, eBird, and VertNet; for environmental data, we used climatic variables for the present and future, the latter characterized by 2 IPCC representative concentration pathways (4.5, 8.5) future emissions scenarios and 27 general circulation models for a 2050 time horizon. We found broad present-day potential distributions with respect to climate for all 3 species. Future potential distributions for Ballman's Malimbe and White-necked Rockfowl tended to be stable and closely similar to their present-day distributions; by contrast, we found marked climate change-driven potential range loss across the range of Timneh Parrot. Our results suggest that impacts of climate change on the present distributions of West African birds will in some cases be minimal, but that individual species may respond differently to future conditions. Thus, to optimize conservation of these species, and of bird diversity in general, we recommend that regional-To-national species conservation action plans incorporate climate change adaptation strategies for individual species; ecological niche models could provide an informative baseline information for this planning and prioritization. © American Ornithological Society 2019.

In this framework, the “4 per 1000” initiative invites partners implementing practical actions to reach a SOC stock annual growth of 4‰. For the first time, we assessed the achievement of 4‰ objective in Mediterranean agricultural soils, aiming at (i) analyzing a representative data collection assessing edaphoclimatic variables and SOC stocks from field experiments under different managements in arable and woody crops, (ii) providing evidence on SOC storage potential, (iii) identifying the biophysical and management variables associated with SOC storage, and (iv) recommending a set of mitigation strategies for global change. Average storage rates amounted to 15 and 80 Mg C ha−1 year−1 × 1000 in arable and woody crops, respectively. Results show that application of organic amendments led to significantly higher SOC storage rates than conventional management, with average values about 1.5 times higher in woody than in arable crops (93 vs. 63 Mg C ha−1 year−1 × 1000). Results were influenced by the initial SOC content, experiment duration, soil texture, and climate regime. The relatively lower levels of SOC in Mediterranean soils, and the high surface covered by woody crops, may reflect the high potential of these regions to achieving significant increases in SOC storage at the global scale. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","4 per 1000 initiative; Carbon sequestration; Carbon storage; Climate change mitigation; Cropping systems; Mediterranean climate","agricultural soil; carbon sequestration; climate change; cropping practice; data assimilation; Mediterranean environment; soil amendment; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil quality; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059760336

To assess all of these benefits, a multiobjective index, assigning a weight to each of these problems, is proposed here. The multiobjective index is applied to two test cases: (1)the AC 13-bus distribution system, and (2)the AC–DC hybrid distribution system including a solid state transformer, which separates the AC microgrid from DC microgrid. Distributed generation with two generation power outputs is located at each node of the systems to provide a new configuration. Then, the multiobjective index is computed for each configuration.

Meanwhile, the microclimate of semi-closed spaces between buildings has direct and indirect consequences on heat transfer through building envelopes. This study demonstrates how courtyard configuration can modify the climate and external air temperature and how the microclimate condition can be considered for functionally accurate calculation of heat loss and thermal loads of buildings. Based on the experimental and computational results, increasing the courtyard's depth by restricting the sky view factor (SVF) and the heat exchange with courtyard's outside at low levels, creates the individual microclimate. The thermal environment of this middle space is affected more than outside by surrounding rooms and the thermal properties of the building walls. The findings, which are limited to experimental cases in the Hanover climate region, propose to consider the temperature of courtyard depending on its aspect ratio and glazing percentage with a temperature correction factor (F x , Heat load ) between 0.9 to 2.2. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aspect ratio (H/W); Courtyard microclimate; Heat transfer through building envelope; Temperature correction Factor","Atmospheric temperature; Energy utilization; Flow patterns; Heat transfer; Solar buildings; Thermal load; Accurate calculations; Accurate prediction; Building energy consumption; Building envelopes; Computational results; Courtyard microclimate; Microclimate conditions; Temperature correction factor; Aspect ratio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063411851

The aim of this paper is to investigate the use of data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to enhance the development of LCZs, complement the existing data sources, and improve the accuracy of the maps. Various features were derived from the OSM database and combined with seasonal LCZ maps. Therefore a methodology was developed and tested for Hamburg, Germany, using a fuzzy approach and then a weighted combination method was applied to combine the inputs from OSM with each of the seasonal LCZ maps. The results showed that improvements can be achieved for certain classes, either in terms of accuracy, e.g. rectifying the misclassification of agricultural areas as heavy industry, or representation on the map, e.g. a more detailed water network. The approach developed is flexible and allows for knowledge about which data sources are more reliable as inputs to the combination and weighting process. © 2019","Local climate zones; OpenStreetMap; Remote sensing; Volunteered geographic information; World urban database and access portal tools (WUDAPT)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063993677

Nuclear lamins form dense network at the nuclear periphery and play a substantial role in chromatin organization, transcription regulation and in organization of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Here, we show that TPR, the protein located preferentially within the nuclear baskets of NPCs, associates with lamin B1. The depletion of TPR affects the organization of lamin B1 but not lamin A/C within the nuclear lamina as shown by stimulated emission depletion microscopy. Finally, reduction of TPR affects the distribution of NPCs within the nuclear envelope and the effect can be reversed by simultaneous knock-down of lamin A/C or the overexpression of lamin B1. Our work suggests a novel role for the TPR at the nuclear periphery: the TPR contributes to the organization of the nuclear lamina and in cooperation with lamins guards the interphase assembly of nuclear pore complexes. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Image analysis; Lamina; Lamins; Nuclear pore complex; Nucleus; Super-resolution imaging; TPR; Translocated promoter region","lamin A; lamin B1 protein; lamin C; nuclear protein; nucleoporin; unclassified drug; lamin A; lamin B; lamin B1; LMNA protein, human; nucleoporin; oncoprotein; small interfering RNA; TPR protein, human; Article; cell nucleus membrane; cellular distribution; complex formation; controlled study; female; human; human cell; immunofluorescence microscopy; immunoprecipitation; intracellular signaling; nuclear lamina; nuclear pore; protein depletion; protein expression; protein localization; antagonists and inhibitors; gene expression regulation; genetics; HeLa cell line; metabolism; molecular imaging; nuclear lamina; signal transduction; ultrastructure; Gene Expression Regulation; HeLa Cells; Humans; Lamin Type A; Lamin Type B; Molecular Imaging; Nuclear Envelope; Nuclear Lamina; Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; RNA, Small Interfering; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061583604

Understanding how species distributions will change with future climate change is thus critical for conservation planning. Impacts on oceanic islands are potentially major given the disproportionate number of endemic species and the consequent risk that local extinctions might become global ones. In this study, we use species climate envelope models to evaluate the current and future potential distributions of Azorean endemic species of bryophytes, vascular plants, and arthropods on the Islands of Terceira and São Miguel in the Azores archipelago (Macaronesia). We examined projections of climate change effects on the future distributions of species with particular focus on the current protected areas. We then used spatial planning optimization software (PRION) to evaluate the effectiveness of protected areas at preserving species both in the present and future. We found that contractions of species distributions in protected areas are more likely in the largest and most populated island of São Miguel, moving from the coastal areas towards inland where the current protected areas are insufficient and inadequate to tackle species distribution shifts. There will be the need for a revision of the current protected areas in São Miguel to allow the sustainable conservation of most species, while in Terceira Island the current protected areas appear to be sufficient. Our study demonstrates the importance of these tools for informing long-term climate change adaptation planning for small islands. © 2019 Ferreira et al.

Destructive sampling can cause contact with air which will influence the redox state. Hence, assessing redox conditions in soil is challenging. Redox sensitive reactions like the degradation of organic contaminants will change water chemistry and geophysical properties. We explored geophysical techniques ERT and SIP to observe the degradation processes of Propylene Glycol (PG), a de-icing chemical used at airports. Two laboratory experiments were performed to monitor changes caused by PG degradation: 1) 3D ERT was measured, every week, in four sand tanks. One rich in oxides. 2) SIP was measured, every three days, in twenty-six oxides rich sand columns. In both experiments PG was applied just above the water table. ERT - When iron and manganese oxides were available, degradation reduced resistivity. When oxides were unavailable, the electrical resistivity increased, most likely due to methane production which reduced water saturation. SIP - An increase of the real conductivity was associated with the metal ions release but independent of the frequency. Also an increase of phase angle and imaginary conductivity at frequencies below 1Hz that precede the ion release was observed in the water. © 81st EAGE Conference and Exhibition 2019.

The development of deposits contributes to a developed system of cracks in the surrounding rocks. Fluid supply to fractured reservoirs occurs through the channels of deep faults. Prolonged winter freezing of rocks inhibits the release of gases into the Earth's atmosphere. The accumulation of hydrocarbon gases in the near-surface cavities creates risks of gas emissions, fires and explosions. Prediction and rapid diagnosis of gas emissions is based on planetary observations from satellites of ozone concentration in the atmosphere. V.L. Syvorotkin experimentally showed a causal relationship between hydrogen degassing and the formation of ""Ozone Holes"". Satellite measurements of ozone concentrations in the atmosphere allow daily monitoring of hydrogen degassing sites from the Earth's surface. The state of the soil surface in the areas of deep degassing is determined by secondary features. These are griffins, soil emissions, ring-shaped structures of gray soil (falling fertility), and hummocks of specific morphology. Such hummocks are formed as a result of the vital activity of ""Hydrogen bacteria"" and are markers of gas emission on the ground. In combination, methane with hydrogen is capable of detonation at concentrations ranging from 1%. The danger increases in the presence of iron-containing minerals that can catalyze the oxidation reaction. Preventive measures are proposed to prevent the sudden release of flammable gases: by drilling a network of control waste wells with a depth of 100 to 200 meters. Such wells are similar to ventilation wells in areas of coal mining. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Bacteria; Degassing; Earth atmosphere; Geology; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen; Morphology; Ozone; Soils; Wall rock; Causal relationships; Fractured reservoir; Iron-containing minerals; Oxidation reactions; Ozone concentration; Preventive measures; Ring shaped structures; Satellite measurements; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068901276

The results from the PSM model revealed that adoption of row planting technology has a positive and significant impact on per capita consumption and on crop income per hectare. Covariates are well balanced and the impact estimate is insensitive to unobserved selection bias indicating that the estimates are a pure effect of the row planting technology. Marginal benefit of row planting is increasing with higher propensity of the farmer to adopt the climate smart planting technology.

To explore the impacts of increasing AOC on the SOA formation, a severe air pollution episode from 3 to 8 October 2015 with high O3 and PM2:5 concentrations is simulated using the WRF-Chem model. The model performs reasonably well in simulating the spatial distributions of PM2:5 and O3 concentrations over BTH and the temporal variations in PM2:5, O3, NO2, OC, and EC concentrations in Beijing compared to measurements. Sensitivity studies show that the change in AOC substantially influences the SOA formation in BTH. A sensitivity case characterized by a 31 % O3 decrease (or 36 % OH decrease) reduces the SOA level by about 30 % and the SOA fraction in total organic aerosol by 17 % (from 0.52 to 0.43, dimensionless). Spatially, the SOA decrease caused by reduced AOC is ubiquitous in BTH, but the spatial relationship between SOA concentrations and the AOC is dependent on the SOA precursor distribution. Studies on SOA formation pathways further show that when the AOC is reduced, the SOA from oxidation and partitioning of semivolatile primary organic aerosol (POA) and coemitted intermediate volatile organic compounds (IVOCs) decreases remarkably, followed by those from anthropogenic and biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Meanwhile, the SOA decrease in the irreversible uptake of glyoxal and methylglyoxal on the aerosol surfaces is negligible. © 2019 Author(s).",,"aerosol composition; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); formation mechanism; organic carbon; oxidation; ozone; volatile organic compound; China; Jingjinji",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066877408

Also, some compounds are carcinogenic. Atmospheric nitrogen oxides (NOx) are also a source of tropospheric ozone, thus creating diseases in human respiratory systems. Therefore, controlling VOCs and NOx is essential for the welfare of local citizens and incoming 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou. Here, we recorded daily average concentrations for 55 different VOCs species and NOx in 2017. For each VOC, we calculated the ozone formation potential, the propene equivalent concentration and the secondary organic aerosol formation potential. We used the Weather Research and Forecast coupled with Community Multi-scale Air Quality models to assess the regional transport and local sector contributions for VOCs and NOx. Results show that ethylene contributed over 16% of total ozone generated from VOCs, followed by M/P-xylene and toluene. M/P-Xylene, toluene and n-hexane were the top 3 VOCs species that generated ozone fastest. Benzene, toluene and ethylbenzene generated most secondary organic aerosols. The annual regional transport rate is 45% for VOCs and 22% for NOx. Local industry produced 28% VOCs, while local traffic contributed 64% NOx. Overall, ground-level ozone could be reduced by controlling VOCs emissions first and then controlling NOx emissions. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Local sector contribution; Ozone formation potential; Propene equivalent concentration; Regional transport; Secondary organic aerosol formation potential; Volatile organic compounds and NOx",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058424938

According to the Italy's draft National Energy and Climate Plan, in 2030 the flexibility of the national power system will mainly come from increased electricity storage capacity and smart charge of electric vehicles. In this paper we study the potential of district heating as a further option. Through a simulation model, we analyse how district heating would interact with the Italian power system if part of the heat generation is based on an intelligent and controlled use of electricity. Results show that, depending on the installed capacity of power-to-heat generation and on the heat storage capacity, district heating can accommodate overgeneration to a relatively modest but interesting extent.

Yet, adaptation requires identifying and prioritizing among the diverse aspects of a site’s significance, as not all sites can be simultaneously adapted due to financial and human capital constraints. Developing a measurement framework that can ascertain the relative significance between sites necessitates the collaboration of multiple perspectives, including experts who set policy and on-the-ground managers who must translate policy into practice while accounting for the management preferences of associated communities. This paper explores if a values-based process enables co-production of knowledge related to the significance of archeological sites. Specifically, this paper examines the influences of a workshop—conducted with diverse archaeological experts working for the U.S. National Park Service—on knowledge co-production and documents the extent of changes in experts’ opinions using a pre–post survey design. Findings suggest that the values-based approach applied during the workshop can have a positive impact on knowledge co-production among experts. Changes were found in experts’ perceptions of the importance of various considerations influencing archaeological site prioritization, as well as of the extent to which uncertainties challenge archaeological preservation. This paper presents novel findings about the importance of knowledge co-production in relation to coastal archaeological site preservation and climate adaptation in the U.S. Prioritization considerations and challenges of various uncertainties assessed in this study can provide valuable insights for progress in climate change policy for cultural heritage both in the U.S and globally. © 2019, The Author(s).","Climate change adaptation; Prioritization; Social learning; Uncertainties; Values-based approach","adaptive management; archaeology; climate change; knowledge; learning; prioritization; uncertainty analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069431394

However, the effects of climate change and rising CO 2 levels on the terrestrial carbon stock of the arid region of China remain unclear. In this study, we used three climate reanalysis datasets to drive an arid ecosystem model (AEM), which we used to assess uncertainties in spatial climate datasets. All simulations suggest that the arid region of China acted as a carbon sink (0.20–0.34 Pg C) from 1980 to 2014. However, we found large uncertainties in the spatial pattern of carbon stocks during this period, especially in northern Xinjiang and western Inner Mongolia. These uncertainties are related to changes in precipitation. To reduce the uncertainty of carbon stock assessment results in the arid region of China, efforts should be implemented to improve the reliability of climate data in northern Xinjiang and western Inner Mongolia. Specifically, China's policy makers should pay close attention to climate change and ecosystem health in southwestern Xinjiang. According to our study, this area experienced significant decreases in precipitation and increases in temperature from 1980 to 2014. The severe ecosystem degradation that occurred will very likely continue into the future. In addition, the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) dataset may overestimate ecosystem carbon sinks as this dataset overestimates the increase in precipitation in the arid region of China. Therefore, it is advisable to be cautious when using the CFSR dataset in ecological studies in northern Eurasian dryland areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Arid; Arid ecosystem model (AEM); Carbon stock; Climate change","Arid regions; Carbon; Climate models; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Uncertainty analysis; Arid; Arid ecosystems; Carbon stocks; Climate forecasts; Data-set analysis; Ecological studies; Ecosystem degradation; Rapid climate change; Climate change; carbon; arid region; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; climate change; data set; ecosystem modeling; Article; atmosphere; carbon sink; carbon stock; China; climate change; controlled study; data analysis; desert; ecosystem health; environmental policy; environmental temperature; nonhuman; precipitation; priority journal; simulation; China; Nei Monggol; Xinjiang Uygur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062545207

In this paper, the decomposition analysis method based on input and output (IO-SDA) was applied to decompose the CO 2 emissions change of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 1997 to 2012 into five driving factors: population, carbon emission efficiency, production structure, final use structure and per capita regional GDP, and then the final use structure factor was further analyzed. The results show that: (1) the population and per capita regional GDP promote the CO 2 emissions of all regions; Carbon emission efficiency is the biggest offsetting factor; The effect of final use structure changes on the growth of CO 2 emissions in Beijing and Hebei remains unchanged. The effect on Tianjin was from 0.7Mt offset to 0.8Mt promotion. (2) Urban household consumption is the most important factor offsetting CO 2 emissions in Beijing. Investment and export are the most important final use types for promoting the growth of CO 2 emissions in Tianjin and Hebei, with the contribution of 95.78% and 88.09%, respectively.

In this work, the surface structures of Li-rich oxides have been successfully reconstructed via a facile strategy utilizing hydrothermal glucose carbonization and the subsequent reduction procedure. Surface microstructure and chemical state analyses reveal that the reconstruction process involves roughening of the surface connects with the extraction of lithium ions and the reduction of Mn ions as well as the formation of a spinel phase due to the distortion of oxygen anions or the presence of oxygen deficiencies. The reconstructed Co-free Li-rich oxide using 0.025 g of glucose exhibits superior electrochemical performance. Its maximum discharge capacities are 237 and 193 mAh/g at 100 and 600 mA/g, respectively, and their corresponding capacity retention ratios are higher than 93% at the 100th cycle. Furthermore, reconstructing the surface structure also enhances the discharge capacity and cycling performance of Co-containing Li-rich cathodes.

These conjectures are supported by general arguments which are not specific to the electroweak theory, and so if they are true for neutrinos they will also be true for simplified models. In this paper we produce such a simplified model in which the neutrino wave function, including its entanglement with the source particle and the environment, can be calculated explicitly in quantum field theory. It exhibits neutrino oscillation, which is reduced at late times by decoherence due to interactions of the source with the environment. One simple lesson from this model is that only the difference between the environmental interactions before and after neutrino emission can reduce the amplitude of neutrino oscillations. The model will be used to test the conjectures in a companion paper. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067309580

However, studies of changes in forest cover have yielded unclear and largely unpredictable results. Here we compile a comprehensive and spatially distributed database of forest-management studies worldwide, to assess the factors that control streamflow response to forest planting and removal. We introduce a vegetation-to-bedrock model that includes seven key landscape factors in order to explain the impacts of forest removal and planting on water yield. We show that the amount of water stored in a landscape is the most important factor in predicting streamflow response to forest removal, whereas the loss of water through evaporation and transpiration is the most important factor in predicting streamflow response to forest planting. Our findings affect model parameterizations in climate change mitigation schemes (involving, for example, afforestation or deforestation) in different geologic and climate regions around the world, and inform practices for the sustainable management of water resources. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"retraction notice",Retracted,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067878480

These areas of deformed crust are the foundations on which the region's principal source rocks are deposited, preserved or are later fragmented and destroyed.

To address this, we used stable isotope (C, N, and H) analyses of food sources and macroinvertebrates from 15 streams in New Brunswick (Canada) and assessed how different catchment conditions arising from the gradient in forest management intensity affect the contribution of autochthonous resources to these food webs. Aquatic primary production contributed substantially to the biomass of invertebrates in these headwater streams, especially for scrapers and collector-gatherers (25–75%). However, the contribution of algae to food webs decreased as forest management intensity (road density and associated sediments, water cations/carbon, and dissolved organic matter humification) increased, and as canopy openness decreased. This trend was probably due to an increase in the delivery of organic and inorganic terrestrial materials (dissolved and in suspension) in areas of greater harvesting intensity and road density, which resulted in more heterotrophic biofilms. Overall, results suggest that, despite the presence of riparian buffers, forest management can affect stream food web structure via changes in energy flows, and that increased protection should be directed at minimizing ground disturbance in areas with direct hydrological connection to streams and at reducing dissolved and particulate matter inputs from roads and stream crossings in catchments with high degrees of management activity. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","algae; allochthony; benthic macroinvertebrate; forest harvesting; road; stable isotope analysis","alga; allochthony; benthos; biomass; catchment; community structure; food; food web; forest management; harvesting; headwater; isotopic analysis; macroinvertebrate; management practice; primary production; resource use; road; stable isotope; stream; Canada; New Brunswick; algae; Invertebrata; animal; Canada; food chain; forest; invertebrate; river; Animals; Canada; Food Chain; Forests; Invertebrates; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066626383

Here we developed a new synthesis procedure that controls certain defects in pure nZnO that are theorized to contribute to the n-type conductivity of the material. Interestingly, this procedure created defects that reduced the nanoparticle band gap to ∼3.1 eV and generated strong emissions in the violet to blue region while minimizing the defects responsible for the more commonly observed broad green emissions. Several characterization techniques including thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman, photoluminescence, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry were employed to verify the sample purity, assess how modifications in the synthesis procedure affect the various defects states, and understand how these alterations impact the physical properties. Since the band gap significantly decreased and a relatively narrow visible emissions band was created by these defects, we investigated utilizing these new nZnO for bioimaging applications using traditional fluorescent microscopy techniques. Although most nZnO generally require UV excitation sources to produce emissions, we demonstrate that reducing the band gap allows for a 405 nm laser to sufficiently excite the nanoparticles to detect their emissions during live-cell imaging experiments using a confocal microscope. This work lays the foundation for the use of these new nZnO in various bioimaging applications and enables researchers to investigate the interactions of pure nZnO with cells through fluorescence-based imaging techniques. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","bioimaging; cancer; defects; fluorescence; photoluminescence; Raman; toxicity; ZnO nanoparticles","Defects; Energy gap; Fluorescence; Fluorescence imaging; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; II-VI semiconductors; Laser excitation; Mass spectrometry; Metal nanoparticles; Photoluminescence; Thermogravimetric analysis; Toxicity; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Zinc oxide; Bio-imaging; Biomedical technologies; cancer; Characterization techniques; Fluorescent microscopy; Raman; Synthesis procedure; Uv excitation sources; ZnO nanoparticles; nanoparticle; zinc oxide; chemistry; fluorescence microscopy; human; infrared spectroscopy; Jurkat cell line; X ray photoemission spectroscopy; Humans; Jurkat Cells; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Nanoparticles; Photoelectron Spectroscopy; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Zinc Oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070025978

One option to reduce processing time is to shorten the austenitizing cycle by applying high heating rates and minimum holding times. However, due to the high heating rates, the analysis of their influences on the formation kinetics of austenite and its crystallographic parameters is challenging. Thus, this work concentrates on the in situ analysis of the austenitization process by means of high-energy X-ray diffraction to study a range of heating rates applied to ferritic–pearlitic and soft annealed initial microstructures. The transformation kinetics from ferrite/pearlite and soft annealed state to austenite, the cementite dissolution behavior and the homogeneity of the freshly formed austenite were analyzed. The results indicate three distinct steps of austenite formation independent of initial microstructure and heating rate: (1) nucleation of carbon-rich austenite at cementite–ferrite interfaces, (2) growth of austenite phase fraction accompanied by a reduction of the carbon content, until reaching the mean carbon content of the steel, followed by growth of the austenite grain size, (3) regarding austenite homogeneity, the combination of austenitization temperature and initial microstructure are the main influencing factors. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"Austenitic transformations; Carbides; Cost reduction; Ferrite; Heating; Heating rate; Microstructure; Pearlitic transformations; Austenite formation; Austenite grain size; Austenitization temperatures; Cementite dissolution; Crystallographic parameters; High energy x-ray diffraction; Initial microstructures; Transformation kinetics; Austenite",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063565982

Considering the multiple interactions mediated by VOCs and their impact on a plant's reproductive success and survival, they can be a crucial weapon in plant-plant competition. However, this particular role of VOCs is underrepresented in the literature. Mechanisms by which volatiles can mediate plant competition can be direct or indirect. Direct mechanisms include establishing a neighbour's identity and status to select adequate responses, avoiding attack through chemical camouflage,and affecting competitor's seed germination or growth through VOC-mediated allelopathy. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and can be seen as part of a continuum. In this review, we present evidence from the literature to illustrate these roles and indicate how they could influence competition in plant communities. We propose new research avenues to test if and how these mechanisms affect competitive outcomes and suggest that, in addition to morphological traits, future competition studies should also incorporate data on plant-volatile emissions and measure their effects on the surrounding plants and other trophic levels. This information would allow us to understand competition from a broader perspective by acknowledging the existence of multiple (possibly coexisting)competition strategies and the role of other trophic levels in shaping competitive outcomes. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Allelopathy; Associational resistance; Competition; Kin recognition; Priming; VOCs","allelopathy; competition (ecology); germination; growth; kin recognition; plant community; reproductive success; trophic level; volatile organic compound",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064739792

As climate change progresses, increased loss and risk related to extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones, could motivate insurers to withdraw from certain markets. In some regions, such a withdrawal represents an emergent risk that, when coupled with increasing populations and other climate change impacts, could leave local governments and ratepayers particularly vulnerable. This paper investigates such a scenario and its ramifications in the context of a region particularly vulnerable to climate change, through an exploration of the degree that consideration of emergent risks, such as loss of insurance, and the potential application of insurance alternatives influence Queensland local government risk management. The study finds little appreciation amongst government officials of emergent risk implicit in extreme weather events such as cyclones, little understanding of the nuances of risk transfer mechanisms beyond familiar traditional insurance and disaster funding mechanisms, and by default, a lack of appreciation of the relationship between the two. A lack of resource and leadership with respect to emergent risk, and an absence of dialogue between insurance brokers and local government concerning climate change risk arise as the main reasons for this result. This research is significant because it challenges current local government risk management practice through an exploration of the risks inherent in the process itself. This has potential social, economic and ecological ramifications in drawing attention to aspects of possible “uninsurability” and prospects of alleviation thereto. Further research is recommended to consider the insurance industry's part in this study's findings in order to inform current industry practice and thinking and further enlighten the causes of local government disengagement in this critical area. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Australia; Catastrophe bond; Climate change; Emergent risk; Insurance; Local government; Risk management; Risk transfer mechanism","article; attention; climate change; disaster; drawing; funding; government employee; human; human experiment; hurricane; insurance; leadership; Queensland; risk management; thinking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062288444

In the tropical realm, fine-grained particles produced in shallow water and transported off-bank by tidal, wind-driven, and cascading density currents are a major source for transport and deposition by currents. Sediment production is especially high during interglacial times when sea level is high and is greatly reduced during glacial times of sea-level lowstands. Reduced sedimentation on carbonate contourite drifts leads to early marine cementation and hardened surfaces, which are often reworked when current strength increases. As a result, reworked lithoclasts are a common component in carbonate drifts. In areas of temperate and cool water carbonates, currents are able to flow across carbonate producing areas and incorporate sediment directly to the current. The entrained skeletal carbonate particles have variable bulk density and shapes that lower the prediction of transport rates in energy-based transport models, as well as prediction of current velocity based on grain size. All types of contourite drifts known in clastic environments are found in carbonate environments, but three additional drift types occur in carbonates because of local sources and current flow diversion in the complicated topography inherent to carbonate systems. The periplatform drift is a carbonate-specific plastered drift that is nearly exclusively made of periplatform ooze. Its geometry is built by the interaction of along-slope currents and downslope currents, which deliver sediment from the adjacent shallow-water carbonate realm to the contour current via a line source. Because the periplatform drift is plastered on the slopes of the platforms it is also subject to mass gravity flow and large slope failures. At platform edges, a special type of patch drift develops. These hemiconal platform-edge drifts also contain exclusively periplatform ooze but their geometry is controlled by the current around the corner of the platform. At the north-western end of Little and Great Bahama Bank are platform-edge drifts that are over 100 km long and up to 600 m thick. A special type of channel-related drift forms when passages between carbonate buildups or channels within a platform open into deeper water. A current flowing in these channels will entrain material shed from the sediment producing areas. At the channel mouth, the sediment-charged current deposits its sediment load into the deeper basin. With continuous flow, a submarine delta drift is built that progrades into the deep water. The strongly focused current forming the delta drift, is able to rework coarse skeletal grains and clasts, making this type of carbonate drift the coarsest drift type. © 2019 The Authors.

This situation entails a highly combinatorial optimization problem with a complex computational solution, even for small instances. Several studies have addressed such a situation, minimizing travel times as the main objective. However, the growing trend toward the development of sustainable transport operations requires that the design of the network also considers the emissions of toxic gases that result from combustion, which leads to a new variant of this type of problem, called the pollution transit network design problem. In this paper, the problem is formulated as a biobjective mathematical programming model. Complex problem instances are proposed for this problem, and by using a multi-objective genetic algorithm, we approach the unimodal and bimodal version of the problem by taking into account the elastic demand between buses and cars. By using the proposed mathematical programming model and the genetic algorithm for small and large problem instances, respectively, we show that the generated pollutant emissions are drastically reduced without increasing travel times or costs. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biobjective optimization; Genetic algorithms; Mathematical programming model; Minimization of GHG emission; Transit network","Combinatorial optimization; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouse gases; Mathematical programming; Pollution; Traffic control; Transportation routes; Travel time; Urban transportation; Bi-objective optimization; Combinatorial optimization problems; Computational solutions; GHG emission; Mathematical programming models; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Transit network design; Transit networks; Complex networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066077704

This paper presents a techno-economic analysis of off-grid PV LED road lighting systems for northern, central and southern regions of Turkey. Road lighting calculations are conducted using DIALux software for M4 and M5 road lighting classes to obtain optimal LED luminaires, pole sizes, and spacings. Among the obtained LED powers, load profiles are created using real lighting hours of operation of the selected regions. And then, the required PV-battery systems are optimized using HOMER software. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed for future projections considering possible increases in electricity prices and decreases in component cost of the PV systems. The results showed that the levelized COE of the off-grid PV LED road lighting systems vary between 0.229 and 0.362 $/kWh for M4, and 0.254–0.359 $/kWh for M5 road lighting class, depending on the solar potential of the region. And, the total NPC of the entire lighting installation per km vary between 24296 and 29123 $ for M5, and 33225–44318 $ for M4 road lighting class. According to the results, the systems are infeasible under current conditions in Turkey. Nonetheless, they have the added benefits of contributing to the reduction of CO 2 emissions. Moreover, future projections show that the systems can be feasible if the declining trend in PV system costs continues and electricity prices increase. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","DIALux; HOMER; LED; Off-grid; Photovoltaic systems; Road lighting","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Light emitting diodes; Lighting fixtures; Photovoltaic cells; Roads and streets; Sensitivity analysis; DIALux; HOMER; Off-grids; Photovoltaic systems; Road lighting; Economic analysis; cost analysis; electricity generation; electricity supply; future prospect; photovoltaic system; solar power; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064167362

Pre-emptive assessments of the capacity for threatened species to adapt to climate change are essential for choosing appropriate management actions that minimise extinction risk. Here, we use species traits and range metrics linked to ecological performance to assess the capacity to respond to climate change of 342 plant species, listed as threatened under IUCN-compatible criteria in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW). Traits capturing variation in phenology, morphology, physiology and geographic range were used to assess species’ response(s) to four factors likely to influence their climate change response: Reproduction, Movement Capability, Abiotic Niche Specialisation, and risk spreading across Spatial Coverage. Assessment scores were combined into high, medium and low rankings based on two complementary approaches for assessing climate change risk: (i) fully precautionary, where species were classified as high risk if any one of the four response factors was high; and (ii) integrative, combining scores across all four response factors to assign an overall risk ranking. 84% of threatened species assessed had a high risk ranking for at least one response factor, whereas 30, 55 and 15% of species were ranked high, medium or low respectively, based on our integrative measure of risk. Importantly, basic information for at least one trait for an additional 237 threatened plants in NSW was not available, despite thorough searching across 727 resources. This lack of fundamental baseline data for threatened plants may have wide-ranging implications for their management, including an inability to assess their response capacity to threats, and plan accordingly. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptive capacity; Conservation management; Global change; Life history traits; Threatened species; Vulnerability","adaptive management; climate change; conservation management; endangered species; global change; life history trait; physiology; Red List; risk assessment; vulnerability; Australia; New South Wales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065240459

Thus, they are key actors in reaching the 1.5 °C goal under the Paris Agreement. However, the possible contribution and position of households in climate policies is neither well understood, nor do households receive sufficiently high priority in current climate policy strategies. This paper investigates how behavioral change can achieve a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in European high-income countries. It uses theoretical thinking and some core results from the HOPE research project, which investigated household preferences for reducing emissions in four European cities in France, Germany, Norway and Sweden. The paper makes five major points: First, car and plane mobility, meat and dairy consumption, as well as heating are the most dominant components of household footprints. Second, household living situations (demographics, size of home) greatly influence the household potential to reduce their footprint, even more than country or city location. Third, household decisions can be sequential and temporally dynamic, shifting through different phases such as childhood, adulthood, and illness. Fourth, short term voluntary efforts will not be sufficient by themselves to reach the drastic reductions needed to achieve the 1.5 °C goal; instead, households need a regulatory framework supporting their behavioral changes. Fifth, there is a mismatch between the roles and responsibilities conveyed by current climate policies and household perceptions of responsibility. We then conclude with further recommendations for research and policy. © 2019 The Authors","Behavioral wedge; Climate change; Climate policy; Deep decarbonisation; Greenhouse gases; Household decision-making; Mitigation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062274467

However, current palaeoclimate records suggest an earlier onset of industrial-era warming. Here, we combine observational data, multiproxy palaeo records and climate model simulations for a formal detection and attribution study. Instead of the traditional approach to the annual mean temperature change, we focus on changes in temperature seasonality (that is, the summer-minus-winter temperature difference) from the regional to whole Northern Hemisphere scales. We show that the detectable weakening of temperature seasonality, which started synchronously over the northern mid–high latitudes since the late nineteenth century, can be attributed to anthropogenic forcing. Increased greenhouse gas concentrations are the main contributors over northern high latitudes, while sulfate aerosols are the major contributors over northern mid-latitudes. A reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution is expected to mitigate the weakening of temperature seasonality and its potential ecological effects. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Air pollution; Climate models; Greenhouse gases; Sulfur compounds; Annual mean temperatures; Anthropogenic forcing; Anthropogenic warming; Climate model simulations; Detection and attributions; Northern Hemispheres; Temperature differences; Traditional approaches; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064752969

In particular, we explore the influence of induced optimal mitigation, given the 2-degree warming-increase target, on the effectiveness of adaptation. Although adaptation alone may not be able to tackle all the risks of climate change, it remains a benefit-cost effective option. Our results show that China's optimal adaptation strategy can avoid, on average, 28% of climate damage over the entire simulation horizon. With respect to the reduction of adverse climate effects, the effect of a policy mix of both adaptation and mitigation does not appear to be “1 + 1 ≥ 2” despite the combination strategy is still the better option compared to adaptation or mitigation alone. Robustness analysis reveals that the choice of time scales is important for policy effectiveness assessment, and the discount rate tells most of the story.

Agricultural management practices, such as nitrogen (N) fertilization and aerated irrigation (AI), have significantly increased crop yields by improving soil water and fertilizer availability, and have been widely adopted in recent years. However, the interactive impact of different growing seasons and management practices in the greenhouse on GHG emissions is unclear. This greenhouse study was conducted during Spring and Autumn cultivation periods in Yangling, China with five N application rates (0, 50, 150, 200,250 kg ha −1 ) and two irrigation methods (AI and conventional irrigation [CK]). The results indicated that AI and N application both increased tomato yield, but also increased soil CO 2 and N 2 O emissions. The temperature was 4 °C higher during Spring cultivation than during Autumn cultivation, which significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased soil emissions of CO 2 , N 2 O, and net GHG by 10.6%, 43.8%, and 12.3%, respectively. However, the yield in Spring cultivation only increased by 5.1% (P &gt; 0.05). Thus, among the selectable cultivation seasons, the cooler season (Autumn) along with AI and 200 kg N ha −1 , was recommended to farmers to avoid adverse effects of a warming environment. AI and 150 kg N ha −1 in Spring cultivation could be recommended as an alternative measure to local farmers. Our results suggest that in a future warmer climate, reducing nitrogen fertilizer rate in conjunction with the use of AI will remain important practices for maintaining crop yield while reducing soil net GHG emissions. There is an urgent need to transform current management practices to offset the negative impacts of climate change. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aerated irrigation; Greenhouse gas emissions; Growing seasons; N fertilizer; Yield","Carbon dioxide; Crops; Fruits; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Irrigation; Nitrogen fertilizers; Soil moisture; Agricultural management practice; Cultivation periods; Greenhouse tomatoes; Growing season; Management practices; N fertilizers; Nitrogen fertilizer rate; Yield; Cultivation; carbon dioxide; nitrogen fertilizer; carbon emission; crop plant; crop yield; fertilizer; gas exchange; global warming; greenhouse gas; growing season; irrigation; nitrogen; adverse outcome; aerated irrigation; agricultural procedures; agricultural worker; Article; autumn; carbon footprint; China; climate change; conventional irrigation; gas exchange; greenhouse gas; harvest; human; irrigation (agriculture); nitrous oxide emission; priority journal; soil pollution; spring; tomato; tropic climate; China; Shaanxi; Yangling; Lycopersicon esculentum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062806260

Hence, it is critical to select green roof plants that can survive water-deficits, particularly in climates with hot and dry summers. Shrubs are perennial plants which can be drought resistant and may be suitable for green roofs. However, studies about survival and health of shrubs are limited. The aim of this study was to determine whether plant climate of origin aridity, drought response and water use strategies could be used to select shrubs which can survive on green roofs that experience water-deficit. We selected 15 shrub species from a range of climates (dry, mesic and wet) and planted them together in 20 replicate green roof modules with 130 mm deep substrate. We monitored substrate water contents, plant minimum water potentials (ψ min ), health (visual score), percentage survival and related survival with their turgor loss point (ψ tlp ) and water use strategies (evapotranspiration rates in a related glasshouse experiment). We also determined whether plants could recover after dry periods by rewatering after the summer. Mean gravimetric soil water content decreased to approximately 5% after summer drought, which resulted in mortality. Overall, survival ranged between 10% and 100% for the 15 species. However, survival was not related to their ψ tlp or water use strategies. While shrubs from more arid climates had lower ψ min in response to dry substrates, this did not result in greater survival and health. Following rewatering, only four shrub species resprouted. Hence, as plant drought response, water use strategy and climate of origin were not strongly related to survival, we suggest survival on green roofs is likely to be determined by a combination of physiological traits. Emergency irrigation for shrubs growing on green roofs in hot and dry climates is recommended during summer to keep them alive. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Drought tolerance; Green roof; Mediterranean; Recovery; Survival; Water use","Agronomy; Drought; Health; Physiological models; Plants (botany); Recovery; Soil moisture; Substrates; Water supply; Drought tolerances; Green roof; Mediterranean; Survival; Water use; Roofs; water; drought resistance; evapotranspiration; resource availability; roof; shrub; soil water; urban ecosystem; water content; water use; Article; climate; desert; drought stress; evapotranspiration; gravimetry; green chemistry; leaf turgor potential; mortality; nonhuman; plant; plant response; priority journal; scoring system; shrub; summer; survival; water content; angiosperm; desert climate; drought; environmental protection; growth, development and aging; longevity; metabolism; physiology; Victoria; Conservation of Natural Resources; Desert Climate; Droughts; Longevity; Magnoliopsida; Victoria; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062013578

Therefore, this research focus on the comprehensive evaluating method of addressing the inner influencing principle of technological specification mentioned in new subsidy scheme on the technological development direction of BEBs. The evaluation indicators in the method include cost-benefit and electricity consumption rate and for different size BEBs. The scenario of maximum subsidy obtaining target based on the optimal install battery estimation is set up; then, the potential direction of the BEBs market penetration was investigated. The cost-benefit and energy consumption estimating models are set up to examine the economics of all size BEBs and the difference between BEBs and equivalent conventional bus. Furthermore, the potential positive and negative effects of the technological requirements in the subsidy scheme are investigated The results show that normal-charging BEBs, the market for light-duty BEBs will shrink greatly owing to significant reduction in the subsidy amounts. However, the market penetration of 12 m BEB will increase significantly. LFP batteries will dominate the normal-charging heavy-duty BEB market in near and medium term, but NCM–type traction batteries will gradually be dominating the energy storage market for normal-charging BEBs owing to increasing demands in terms of the energy density of traction batteries. However, the market penetration of fast-charging-type BEBs will growth more rapidly than ever before due to the great increasing in its cost-benefit. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","All electric range; Battery electric bus; Battery specific energy; Charge rate; Energy consumption rate; Fast charge","Battery electric vehicles; Buses; Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Electric automobiles; Electric energy storage; Energy utilization; Secondary batteries; Urban transportation; Charge rate; Electric bus; Electric range; Energy consumption rates; Fast charges; Specific energy; Charging (batteries)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062852287

Underlying this question is the premise that to combat climate change, carbon emissions must be radically reduced. Technological change alone will not be sufficient: lifestyles must also change. Whereas mainstream strategies generally address the challenge of reducing carbon emissions through reviewing consumption, approaching it through the lens of how we use our time, in particular, leisure time, may be a promising complementary avenue. Design/methodology/approach: The paper brings together three areas of research that are hitherto largely unlinked: subjective wellbeing/happiness studies, studies on how we use our time and studies on low-carbon lifestyles. Findings: The paper shows that low-carbon leisure activities conducive to high subjective wellbeing include social activities such as spending time in the home with family and friends, and physical activities that involve challenge such as partaking in sports. However, depending how they are done, some such activities may induce high carbon emissions, especially through travel. Therefore, appropriate local infrastructure, such as local sports and community centres, is required, along with facilities for active travel. Policymaking developed from a time-use perspective would encourage investment to support this. Originality/value: Win–win opportunities for spending leisure time engaged in activities conducive to high subjective wellbeing in low carbon ways are identified. This is done by bringing three research topics together in a novel way. © 2019, Angela Druckman and Birgitta Gatersleben.","Carbon emissions; Carbon footprint; Flow; Leisure; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067597391

In this paper we aimed to evaluate the multi-service nature of ecosystem services (ES) supply in the dunes of the Italian Adriatic coast within Natura 2000 (N2K) sites. We i) identified ES indicators and assessed the supply capacity (Climate regulation, Protection from wind and aerosol, Erosion regulation, Recreation and Tourism and Existence value of biodiversity) of natural dune ecosystems of European conservation concern; ii) upscaled this data to create an inventory of ES supply for all dune N2K sites in the study area; iii) explored the trade-offs among ES; and iv) summarized and spatially compared the overall multi-service value of the N2K sites. The study provides a method for quantifying the role of N2K sites in supplying benefits for our society. We found that the multi-service capacity of coastal dunes is uneven within sites and within administrative regions. This variability is related to both ecological (e.g. distribution, ecological integrity, extent and conservation status of dune habitats) and administrative (e.g. local implementation of the Habitats Directive) characteristics of the analysed area. ES are not coupled as several sites with high values for one ES show very low values for others. The results suggest that conservation actions should favour restoration of the natural dune zonation, since this underpins multi-service ES supply. The approach can distinguish regions with high ES values and regions where the paucity of protected areas represents a gap in ES supply, fact that offers an incentive to enhance the protection strategy but also suggests an urgent need to improve the N2K network by enlarging existent sites and including new ones. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Adriatic coast; Coastal dunes; Conservation network; Ecosystem services assessment; Ecosystem services mapping; Habitats Directive","Biodiversity; Conservation; Economic and social effects; Forestry; Adriatic; Coastal dune; Conservation actions; Conservation status; Ecological integrity; Ecosystem services; Habitats directives; Protection strategy; Ecosystems; assessment method; beach; dune; ecosystem service; mapping; nature conservation; aerosol; article; biodiversity; climate; habitat; human; quantitative analysis; seashore; tourism; zonation; Adriatic Coast [Italy]; Italy; Mediterranean Coast [Italy]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062697172

The second aim is to evaluate if these changes are dependent on the convective scheme used. For this purpose, the regional climate model Modèle Atmosphérique Régional (MAR) was forced by two general circulation models (NorESM1-M and MIROC5) with five convective schemes (namely: two versions of the Bechtold schemes, the Betts-Miller-Janjić scheme, the Kain-Fritsch scheme, and the modified Tiedtke scheme) in order to assess changes in future precipitation quantities/distributions and associated uncertainties. In a warmer climate (using RCP8.5), our model simulates a small increase of convective precipitation, but lower than the anomalies and the interannual variability over the current climate, since all MAR experiments simulate a stronger warming in the upper troposphere than in the lower atmospheric layers, favoring more stable conditions. No change is also projected in extreme precipitation nor in the ratio of convective precipitation. While MAR is more sensitive to the convective scheme when forced by GCMs than when forced by ERA-Interim over the current climate, projected changes from all MAR experiments compare well. © 2019 by the authors.","Belgium; Climate change; Convective scheme; Precipitation; Regional modeling","Climate change; Precipitation (chemical); Precipitation (meteorology); Uncertainty analysis; Belgium; Convective precipitation; Convective scheme; Extreme precipitation; General circulation model; Interannual variability; Regional climate modeling; Regional model; Climate models; climate change; climate modeling; convective system; general circulation model; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; spatial distribution; Belgium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068818774

The package provides functions for shadowrelated calculations in the urban environment, namely shadow height, shadow footprint and Sky View Factor (SVF) calculations, as well as a wrapper function to estimate solar radiation while taking shadow effects into account. All functions operate on a layer of polygons with a height attribute, also known as ""extruded polygons"" or 2.5D vector data. Such data are associated with accuracy limitations in representing urban environments. However, unlike 3D models, polygonal layers of building outlines along with their height are abundantly available and their processing does not require specialized closed-source 3D software. The present package thus brings spatio-temporal shadow, SVF and solar radiation calculation capabilities to the open-source spatial analysis workflow in R. Package functionality is demonstrated using small reproducible examples for each function.

However, few studies have considered the role of multiple biotic and abiotic factors in shaping trait variation and spectra. In this study, we determined seven leaf traits of 66 Solidago canadensis populations, and quantified the relative contributions of climate, soil properties, native plant diversity, and S. canadensis-community interactions (in total 16 factors) to leaf trait variation and spectrum with multimodel inference. Results: Overall, the seven leaf traits had high phenotypic variation, and this variation was highest for leaf dry matter content and lowest for leaf carbon concentration. The per capita contribution of climate to the mean leaf trait variation was highest (7.5%), followed by soil properties (6.2%), S. canadensis-community interactions (6.1%), and native plant diversity (5.4%); the dominant factors underlying trait variation varied with leaf traits. Leaf production potential was negatively associated with leaf stress-tolerance potential, and the relative contributions to this trade-off followed in order: native plant diversity (7.7%), climate (6.9%), S. canadensis-community interactions (6.2%), and soil properties (5.6%). Climate, diversity, soil, and interactions had positive, neutral or negative effects. Conclusions: Climate, soil, diversity, and interactions contribute differentially to the leaf trait variation and economics spectrum of S. canadensis, and their relative importance and directions depend on plant functional traits. © 2019 The Author(s).","Climate; Invader-community interactions; Invasive plants; Multimodel inference; Native plant diversity; Soil properties","angiosperm; climate effect; community response; functional role; invasive species; native species; soil property; species diversity; Solidago canadensis; climate; ecosystem; plant leaf; soil; Solidago; Climate; Ecosystem; Plant Leaves; Soil; Solidago",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067227212

This research aims to explore the mechanism of changes in PM 2.5 emissions, which are the key airborne pollutants causing haze. Furthermore, it quantifies the impacts of CO 2 emissions reduction activities on PM 2.5 emissions reduction. This study takes aggregate PM 2.5 emissions instead of PM 2.5 concentration index as the research object. Based on an extended kaya identity, LMDI approach is first performed to decompose the changes of PM 2.5 emissions during 1998–2014, taking into consideration the synergistic effect of carbon emissions on PM 2.5 emissions. Furthermore, following LMDI decomposition, this study adopts the econometric methods to quantify the synergistic effect of CO 2 emissions reduction on PM 2.5 emissions reduction over the period 1999–2014. The empirical results are as follows: (1) the LMDI decomposition results specify that the synergistic emissions reduction accounts for the most of the reduction in PM 2.5 emissions. In addition, energy intensity changes also contribute to the reduction in PM 2.5 emissions; (2) by contrast, it is found that the economic development effect is the main factor resulting in the increase of PM 2.5 emissions, while the contributions of the energy emission intensity effect and population effect to PM 2.5 emissions changes are relatively little; (3) all the models show CO 2 emissions reduction activities will significantly contribute to PM 2.5 emissions reduction; (4) for every 10,000 t increase in CO 2 emissions reduction, PM 2.5 emissions reduction will increase by 3.3 t, and the potential for synergistic emissions reduction of PM 2.5 differs distinctly among different provinces; (5) technological progress and population density positively influence PM 2.5 emissions reduction, while coal consumption rate has a negative impact on PM 2.5 emissions reduction, in addition, there is an inverted U-shaped curve relationship between per capita GDP and PM 2.5 emissions reduction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; CO 2 emissions; LMDI; PM 2.5 emissions; Synergistic emissions reduction","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Population statistics; China; CO2 emissions; Coal consumption rate; Emissions reduction; Global climate changes; LMDI; Population densities; Technological progress; Emission control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063636511

The primary purpose of this paper is to comprehensively assess the multilane separate freeway at Huludao Toll Station in Liaoning Province, China. Based on the configuration and segmentation of the freeway near a toll station, a six-step guidance strategy is designed to adapt to the separate organization mode. Five conventional traffic scenarios are designed in the Vissim platform for comparative analysis between different guidance strategies. To investigate the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) environment, a microscopic testbed is established with cooperative car-following and lane-changing models using theMATLAB platform. The numerical simulation results show that the guidance strategy significantly improves efficiency and safety, and also reduces emissions and fuel consumption. Meanwhile, pre-guidance before toll channels outperforms the scenario only applied with guidance measures after toll plaza. Compared to conventional conditions, the assessment of pollutant emissions and fuel consumption also embodies the superiority of the other five scenarios, especially in the sections of toll plaza and channels with the lowest efficiency and safety level.

When these batteries are considered exhausted for its EV application, they can still provide value in other less demanding uses, known as the Second Life (SL). A potential SL for EV batteries is the behind the meter space, providing benefits to prosumers and the grid. Nevertheless, the main barrier for the deployment of a SL battery market oriented to prosumers connected to the distribution system is the quantification of the economic value of those benefits and its relation with different operating conditions and tariff scenarios. This paper proposes a methodology to estimate the value of SL batteries that takes into account the degradation state at the end of the First Life (FL) and the potential operating conditions for the Second Life. A case study involving a typical residential prosumer in California is presented to illustrate the methodology. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Commerce; Housing; Mass transportation; Battery markets; Degradation state; Different operating conditions; Distribution systems; Economic values; Low carbon energies; Operating condition; Second life batteries; Secondary batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072331842

For the two ions, the presence of hydrocarbonate strongly limits the pH variations by its buffering properties and reduces the rates of Al dissolution by corrosion. Removal of the two cations was then shown to require longer treatment times and larger amounts of dissolved aluminium. Whereas the local pH gradients near the electrode surface with HCO 3 − free water was previously shown to allow local formation of stable Zn and Fe hydroxides, which actively contribute to their elimination, the presence of hydrocarbonate nearly suppresses this positive phenomenon, resulting in far less efficient EC treatment. Whereas removal of zinc cations from carbonated water can be considered as their simple adsorption on the Al flocs, Fe 2+ ions are oxidized to Fe(OH) 3 by air oxidation after their adsorption. Use of an overall adsorption model allowed quantitative comparison of the EC treatments, with very different adsorption parameters for the two metal studied. © 2019","Divalent iron; Electrocoagulation; Hydrogencarbonate ion; Water treatment; Zinc",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062700541

Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) related emissions, which are significant in Brazil, are excluded from trading in the analysis, for two main reasons: (i) in an effort to closely align with existing provisions of the EUETS and (ii) to encourage other sectors of the economy to broaden their mitigation effort to comply with national climate targets. As a result, the relatively decarbonised electricity sector and the energy-intensive sectors in Brazil adopt ambitious targets under the proposal. The effects of the proposal are examined under three scenarios: a national ETS policy, a bilateral cooperation, and a global cooperation. Results show that a domestic ETS reduces emissions and promotes technological substitution towards alternative energy for both participants. Cooperation scenarios imply lower emission reductions in Brazil compared to a domestic ETS, where importing allowances from Europe is more cost-effective. For Europe, cooperating with Brazil has very limited impact on further mitigation. The global scenario sees both regions opt to acquire carbon permits from other regions where abatement costs are lower. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Brazil; Cooperation; EPPA6; ETS; Europe; Paris Agreement","Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Emission control; Forestry; Land use; Brazil; Cooperation; Electricity generation; Emissions Trading Scheme; Energy-intensive sectors; EPPA6; Europe; Land use change and forestries; International trade; abatement cost; economic policy; emission inventory; emissions trading; energy policy; environmental policy; land use; land use change; Brazil; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061739214

Then comparative analysis is carried out within each class to achieve comprehensive benefits evaluation.

A decrease in the fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤2:5 lm (PM2:5) concentration may lead to a substantial benefit for human health. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to quantify the relative contributions four factors: emission reductions, changed meteorology, population growth, and a change in baseline mortality rates to the reduced PM2:5-related mortality (PM2:5-mortality) during the 2013–2017 period and evaluate the importance of emission controls for human health protection in China. METHODS: The integrated exposure–response function was adopted to estimate the chronic health effects of PM2:5. The annual PM2:5 concentrations were estimated from chemical transport model simulations combined with surface observations for 2013 and 2017. Relative contributions to PM2:5-mortality from emission reductions and the three factors were individually quantified through scenario analysis. RESULTS: The estimated total PM2:5-mortality in China was 1.389 million [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.005 million, 1.631 million] in 2013 but was substantially reduced to 1.102 million (95% CI: 0.755 million, 1.337 million) in 2017. Emission controls contributed 88.7% to this reduction in PM2:5-mortality, while changed meteorology, the change in baseline mortality rates, and population growth during 2013–2017 contributed 9.6, 3.8, and −2:2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of the Action Plan has significantly reduced the PM2:5 concentration in regions of China where population density is high, dominating the decline in PM2:5-mortality during 2013–2017. However, the health burden of PM2:5 pollution in China is still extremely high compared with that in other developed countries. An aggressive air pollution control strategy should be implemented in densely populated areas to further reduce the health burden. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4157. © 2019, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Here we present a method to spatially track and map the migration of plant-derived carbon (C) through roots into the rhizosphere and surrounding soil using laser ablation-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (LA-IRMS). We used switchgrass microcosms containing soil from field plots at the Kellogg Biological Station (Hickory Corners, Michigan, USA) which have been cropped with switchgrass since 2008. We used a 13CO2 tracer to isotopically label switchgrass plants for two diel cycles and tracked subsequent movement of labeled C using the spatially specific (&lt; 100 µm resolution) δ13C analysis enabled by LA-IRMS. This approach permitted assessment of variable C flow through different roots and enabled mapping of spatial variability of C allocation to the rhizosphere. Highly 13C-enriched C (consistent with production during the 13CO2 application period) extended ≈ 0.5–1 mm from the root into the soil, suggesting that the majority of recent plant-derived C was within this distance of the root after 48 h. Tracking the physical extent of root exudation into the rhizosphere can help evaluate the localization of plant-microbe interactions in highly variable subsurface environments, and the use of the isotopic label can differentiate freshly fixed C (presumably from root exudates) from other types of subsurface C (e.g., plant necromass and microbial turnover). The LA-IRMS technique may also serve as a valuable screening technique to identify areas of high activity for additional microbial or geochemical assays. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Although the processes of runoff and sediment detachment and transport are well recognized, the effects of vegetation restoration on organic C loss through soil erosion are not fully understood within a given landscape. This study conducted a synthesis from 66 sites to evaluate the effects of vegetation restoration on annual C loss induced by soil erosion across the key areas of the ‘Grain for Green’ Program (GGP) in the Loess Plateau, China. The results showed that vegetation restoration has significantly reduced the annual C loss in sediment and from runoff. Since 2000, a total of 8.6 × 10 6 ha degraded land has been converted to forests, shrubs and grasslands under the GGP, which has reduced runoff by 1.5 × 10 9 m 3 and is associated with 7.3 × 10 3 Mg C; furthermore, lost sediment has reduced by 348.7 Tg, which is associated with 1.8 Tg C per year, across the Loess Plateau. In the zone with a mean annual precipitation (MAP) &lt; 550 mm, the degraded lands that have been converted to grasslands and shrubs have reduced more soil and water losses than have the lands that have been converted to forests; additionally, in the zone with a MAP &gt;550 mm, the degraded lands that have been converted to forests have less soil erosion than do the lands that have been converted to grasslands and shrubs. Moreover, C loss induced by soil erosion was mainly affected by plant cover, soil porosity, slope, land-use change, and rainfall intensity on the Loess Plateau. This study suggests that optimal vegetation restoration measures should be adopted based on local conditions to reduce C loss induced by soil erosion. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Ecological restoration; Land-use change; Organic carbon loss; Runoff; Sediment","Ecology; Erosion; Forestry; Land use; Landforms; Organic carbon; Porosity; Restoration; Runoff; Sediments; Soils; Vegetation; Ecological restoration; Land-use change; Loess plateau of chinas; Mean annual precipitation; Runoff and sediments; Soil and water loss; Terrestrial ecosystems; Vegetation restoration; C (programming language); carbon emission; carbon sequestration; grassland; land use change; organic carbon; precipitation intensity; restoration ecology; runoff; sediment transport; shrub; soil carbon; soil erosion; terrestrial ecosystem; China; Loess Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063421976

Stakeholders advocate regional governance for the European grid expansion, which may evolve into a pan-European governance and is key to developing integrated, hybrid offshore projects. However, such projects are still scarce. We thus analyze the governance of the North Sea offshore grid expansion using the dimensions of level, implementation obligation, and implementation discretion. Our exploratory approach identifies five challenges. The challenges relate to 1) the interaction of the European and regional levels; 2) the interaction of the national and regional levels; 3) the participation of non-European Union countries; 4) the dependence of regional planning on national development plans, which consider national interests; and 5) the interaction of cost allocation and European financing for Projects of Common Interest. The recent Clean Energy Package proposal extensively reforms the regulation of the European power system. The Package is part of the Energy Union strategy and focuses on the energy and climate policies’ governance and the power system operation. Thus, regional governance of offshore expansion is largely unaltered, and our identified challenges remain unaddressed. © 2019 The Authors","Expansion planning; Governance; Offshore grid; Regional cooperation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061563995

To shed new light on this question, we present a detailed study of the slope and bump strength of the attenuation law in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628 at the resolved spatial scale of 325 pc. To do so, we have modelled a broad multiwavelength data set from the ultraviolet (UV) to the infrared (IR) with the state-of-the-art SED fitting code cigale, including SWIFT UVOT data for which we have developed a new optimized reduction pipeline. We find that the median dust attenuation curve of NGC 628 is fairly steep, but not as steep as the SMC curve, and has a sub-MW-type UV bump. We observe intriguing variations within the galaxy, with regions of high AV exhibiting a shallower attenuation curve. We argue that the flattening of the curve is due to a dominance of absorption over scattering events at higher AV. No trend between the bump strength and the IRAC 8.0 μm emission was found. However, this does not necessarily rule out polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as the main contributors to the UV bump. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.","dust, extinction; galaxies: individual: NGC 628; galaxies: ISM; techniques: image processing; ultraviolet: ISM",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072264947

In the meantime, several studies have evaluated regional strategies for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. Although these studies propose scenarios that meet the climate policy pledges, most of them are based on measures that have not been commercially demonstrated yet, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). The aim of this work is to develop a low-carbon scenario for the energy sector in Sao Paulo, Brazil (whose emissions are significant at the regional and national level) until 2050 and to verify if a proven, technology-based approach meets the current policy goals. Although the analysis is based on a developing country, Sao Paulo state is the most developed region in Brazil. Consequently, the analysis presented in this work may be replicated in other regional settings, with distinct development stages, which demand increasing energy futures. In the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, energy demand increases 2.6% per year until 2050, and emissions consequently increase 2.8% per year, reaching 235 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (tCO2). If four alternatives proposed in the low-carbon (LC) scenario were implemented, 28% of the BAU emissions would be avoided. However, even with this LC scenario, Sao Paulo would not meet the state pledge, remaining 44% above the policy emission cap. This result means that more audacious measures are needed to achieve an effective result. Such measures must push the current technical, scientific, and industrial knowledge and may require a biodiesel share over 20% in diesel blend, extensive increases in renewable energy supply, CCS, and bioenergy associated with CCS. Finally, we suggest some key points to apply this analysis in other regions, considering their own energy mix. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Brazil; CDM; Energy sector; Renewable sources; Stabilization wedges","alternative energy; bioenergy; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; emission control; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; scenario analysis; technological development; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053560197

Light-induced axial CO2diffusion along the stem due to woody tissue photosynthesis may lead to equivocal estimates of stem respiratory coefficients during the dormant season, which are generally used to estimate maintenance respiration throughout the year. Context: Stem CO2 efflux (EA) does not reflect respiratory rates of underlying tissues. Recent research has focused on the significance of CO2 transport via the transpiration stream. However, no studies have yet addressed the potential role of light-induced axial CO2 diffusion on EA during the dormant season when there is no transpiration. Aims: This study investigated to which extent woody tissue photosynthesis and axial diffusion of respired CO2 affect EA during the dormant season. Methods: EA was measured in a stem cuvette on dormant oak trees in a growth chamber at constant temperature. Different rates of axial CO2 diffusion were induced by woody tissue photosynthesis by means of illuminating stem sections at varying distances from the stem cuvette, while light was excluded from the remainder of the tree. Results: Axial diffusion of respired CO2 led to reductions in EA of up to 22% when the stem section closest to the cuvette was exposed to light. Conclusion: Dormant-season efflux-based estimates of stem respiration might be biased by axial diffusion of respired CO2, particularly in open forest stands with sufficient light penetration. Consequently, this may lead to ambiguous estimates of dormant season EA coefficients (Q10 and EA_0) generally used to estimate maintenance respiration throughout the year. © 2019, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Internal CO2 transport; Maintenance respiration; Quercus robur L; Stem CO2 efflux; Woody tissue photosynthesis","carbon dioxide; carbon flux; deciduous tree; diffusion; light effect; photosynthesis; seasonal variation; stem; Quercus robur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065569526

We aimed to comparatively assess the impact of land use change on labile pools and dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) in two land uses (Urochloa pastures and Eucalyptus forestry) relative to the native reference ecosystem (Brazilian woodland savanna, the cerradão), as a function of soil depth and season. For three replicated study sites, each of them including a control area of the native vegetation (Cerrado) and two land uses (Pasture, Eucalyptus), we sampled soil from 0 to 2 m depth in both dry and wet seasons. We quantified dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC), estimated the microbial quotient (MBC/SOC) and DOC/SOC ratio, and evaluated C dynamics by assessing soil basal respiration and the metabolic quotient (qCO2). Compared with Cerrado, DOC, MBC and MBC/SOC decreased in both Pasture and Eucalyptus. Differences between land uses vanished below 30 cm soil depth. Seasonality affected most analyzed variables, with lower values for DOC, DOC/SOC and qCO2, and slightly higher values for MBC and MBC/SOC in the wet season. In the dry season qCO2 increased in the Eucalyptus topsoil as compared to Cerrado, suggesting higher stress in the microbial community and/or lower decomposition efficiency in Eucalyptus. Overall, our results show that cerradão conversion to pastures and Eucalyptus plantations negatively affects labile pools and dynamics of SOC, with the effects surpassing a strong spatial and seasonal variability in the soil response to land conversion. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cerrado; Dissolved organic carbon; Eucalyptus plantation; Microbial biomass carbon; Soil microbial activity; Urochloa pasture","carbon cycle; carbon emission; cerrado; dissolved organic carbon; land use change; microbial activity; microbial community; pasture; savanna; soil carbon; soil depth; soil organic matter; woodland; Eucalyptus; Urochloa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066922131

Previous studies indicated the importance of metal emissions from Indonesian wildfires. However, metal emission profiles from Indonesian wildfires have not been quantified well yet. To address this issue, we analyzed metals and metalloids emitted from combustion experiments of peat and vegetation growing over peatland in Indonesia. The analyzed elements include Mg, Al, Ca, V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Se, Sn, and Pb. The emission ratios of aerosol particles emitted from combustion of the ombrotrophic peat and vegetation agreed within a factor of few, regardless of the variability in the elemental compositions of the original fuel. In both cases, the emission ratios of Ca were the highest, followed by crustal elements Fe and Al. The concentration ratios of crustal and biogenic elements (Fe/Al and Zn/Fe) were found to be a useful metric to infer dominant fuel types. Namely, the concentration ratio of Fe/Al was high (6.2 ± 4.4) for peat combustion particles, while the value was lower (1.9 ± 1.3) when plant burning was conducted. The emission ratios of the metals were combined with an existing emission inventory to estimate the emission rates of the analyzed metals. The emission rates of carcinogenic metals, such as Cr and Ni, were estimated to be 0.02 and 0.013 Gg/year, respectively. The analysis also indicated that the peatland burning could be one of the important sources of atmospheric Fe in the region. ©2019. American Geophysical Union.

Integrating torrefaction and pyrolysis is a feasible and promising technology that converts biomass into fuels or chemicals. Understanding of the relevant process designs and mechanisms is favorable to the cohesion and optimization of these two processes and the innovation of reactors for commercial-scale biorefineries. First, biomass properties and their corresponding pyrolysis behaviors have been discussed in consideration of the challenge presented by complex biomass structures that limit the in-depth research on torrefaction or pyrolysis. Second, torrefaction fundamentals are illustrated in detail, and many kinetic models with comprehensive mechanism schemes, such as pseudo-mechanistic model and one-, two-, or multi-step models, are summarized.

Prices of $25 and $50 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions cause electricity emissions reductions of 17% and 22% from present levels, respectively. This suggests significant electricity sector emissions reductions can be achieved quickly from a modest carbon tax, and diminishing reductions occur when increasing from $25 to $50. The model captures short run effects via operational changes at existing U.S. power plants, mostly by switching production from coal to natural gas. A state-level analysis yields the following conclusions: (1) states which reduce the most emissions are high coal-consumers in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions, (2) 15 states increase emissions after carbon policy because they increase natural gas consumption to offset coal consumption decreases in neighboring states, and (3) a flat per-capita rebate of tax revenue leads to wealth transfers across states. © 2019 by the author.","Carbon tax; Climate change; Electricity markets; Energy economics; Energy policy","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Coal; Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Emission control; Energy policy; Gas plants; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Power markets; Carbon taxes; Coal consumption; Electricity industry; Electricity sector; Emissions reduction; Energy economics; Natural gas consumption; Operational changes; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066940468

Previous experimental studies in cloud chambers and idealized numerical simulations demonstrated that CSNT is a significantly more effective precipitation enhancer than the traditional NaCl. Here, CSNT and NaCl seeding agents are incorporated into the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model microphysics with explicate treatment of aerosol. Our results show that CSNT is a profoundly more effective precipitation enhancer in the case of arid climate characterized with low humidity. The accumulated surface precipitation in the arid test was 1.4 times larger if CSNT seeding agent was used instead of NaCl. The smallest difference in the effectiveness between CSNT and NaCl was observed in the maritime case due to their similar activation properties at high values of relative humidity. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate zones; Cloud seeding; Precipitation enhancement; Seeding material; Weather modification; WRF","Aerosols; Precipitation (meteorology); Sodium chloride; Titanium dioxide; Weather forecasting; Weather modification; Activation property; Precipitation enhancement; Seeding materials; Sodium chloride (NaCl); Surface precipitation; Three dimensional modelling; United Arab Emirates; Weather research and forecasting; Cloud seeding; aerosol; climatic region; cloud seeding; experimental study; precipitation (climatology); relative humidity; three-dimensional modeling; weather forecasting; weather modification; Serbia; Thailand; United Arab Emirates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068864631

Fugitive dust that primarily originates from soils through the action of wind and anthropogenic activities is recognized to be a major source of urban PM. However, it remains challenging to quantify and parameterize fugitive dust emission from various sources due to a lack of observation data. In this study, a portable wind erosion system, PI-SWERL, was applied to characterize the dynamics and magnitude of PM10 and PM2.5 (particles smaller than 10 μm and 2.5 μm respectively) emissions from several possible sources in Nanjing, a typical large city in the Yangtze River Delta economic regions, East China. Results indicate that aerodynamic suspension and abrasion were two major physical mechanisms responsible for fugitive dust emissions, with varying characteristics by location. Changes of emission characteristics and quantities were primarily associated with differences in the supply of fine particles available for wind erosion, controlled by source-specific surface characteristics and anthropogenic disturbances. Construction sites and unpaved roads were identified as two significant sources, with total emission rates of 95.85 (56.97) and 57.22 (32.62) kg s−1 respectively for PM10 (PM2.5) at a friction velocity of 0.82 m s−1. These values were up to five times the amounts of PM emitted from arable lands and woodlands, and 1–2 orders of magnitude greater than those from paved roads, grasslands and bare lands. These data demonstrate the importance of construction sites and unpaved roads as local PM sources which might be significant in policy making for air quality management strategies and prioritization of emission control targets in an urban area. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Fugitive dust; Nanjing; PI-SWERL; PM10; PM2.5","Air quality; Dust control; Emission control; Erosion; Particulate emissions; Quality control; Quality management; River pollution; Anthropogenic disturbance; Atmospheric particulate matter; Emission characteristics; Fugitive dust; Fugitive dust emissions; Nanjing; PM10; PM2.5; Urban growth; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; dust; emission; particle size; particulate matter; prioritization; quantitative analysis; urban atmosphere; air pollution; arable land; Article; China; dust; forest; grassland; particulate matter; priority journal; surface property; wind erosion; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]; Yangtze Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063640770

The economic model is based on the calculations of the net present value, considering multiple capacities of biomethane production (ranging from 50 to 500 m3/h) and alternative scenarios based on the variation in subsidies, the selling price of biomethane, and the net revenues from the treatment of organic waste. The environmental analysis quantifies the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions obtained by natural gas vehicles fueled by biomethane. The economic and environmental results encourage energy change that can be achieved by municipalities that support the transformation of natural resources into green fuels. Across 15 Italian municipalities, the potential biomethane production varies from 80.4 million m3/year to 102.8 million m3/year, with an overall net present value ranging from 135 to 187 million €. In addition, the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions varies from 127 to 162 thousand-ton CO2eq/year.

The watersheds of Glacier Bay contain significant glacier cover (tidewater and land-terminating) and strong spatial gradients in topography, land cover, and precipitation. The physical complexity and variability of the region produce a variety of hydrological regimes, including rainfall-, snowmelt-, and icemelt- dominated responses. The purpose of this study is to characterize the recent historical components of freshwater runoff to Glacier Bay and quantify the potential hydrological changes that accompany the worst-case climate scenario during the final decades of the 21st century. The historical (1979-2015) mean annual runoff into Glacier Bay is found to be 24.5 km3 yr-1, or equivalent to a specific runoff of 3.1myr-1, with a peak in July, due to the overall dominance of snowmelt processes that are largely supplemented by ice melt. Future scenarios (2070-2099) of climate and glacier cover are used to estimate changes in the hydrologic response of Glacier Bay. Under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5, the mean of five climate models produces a mean annual runoff of 27.5 km3 yr-1, 3.5myr-1, representing a 13% increase from historical conditions. When spatially aggregated over the entire bay region, the projection scenario seasonal hydrograph is flatter, with weaker summer flows and higher winter flows. The peak flows shift to late summer and early fall, and rain runoff becomes the dominant overall process. The timing and magnitudes of modeled historical runoff are supported by a freshwater content analysis from a 24-year oceanographic conductivity- temperature-depth (CTD) dataset from the U.S. National Park Service's Southeast Alaska Inventory and Monitoring Network (SEAN). The hydrographs of individual watersheds display a diversity of changes between the historical period and projection scenario simulations, depending upon total glacier coverage, elevation distribution, landscape characteristics, and seasonal changes to the freezing line altitude. © Author(s) 2019.",,"ablation; fjord; freshwater; glacial hydrology; hydrograph; hydrological change; hydrological modeling; hydrological response; peak flow; runoff; seasonal variation; snowmelt; spatial resolution; watershed; Alaska; Glacier Bay; Glacier Bay National Park; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067243319

The timing as well as the magnitude of these emissions matters, as the short term climate warming impact of methane is up to 120 times that of CO 2 . This study uses estimates of CO 2 and methane emissions associated with different upstream operations to build a deterministic model of GHG emissions from conventional and unconventional gas fields as a function of time. By combining these emissions with a dynamic, techno-economic model of gas supply we assess their potential impact on the value of different types of project and identify stranded resources in various carbon price scenarios. We focus in particular on the effects of different emission metrics for methane, using the global warming potential (GWP) and the global temperature potential (GTP), with both fixed 20-year and 100-year CO 2 -equivalent values and in a time-dependent way based on a target year for climate stabilisation. We report a strong time dependence of emissions over the lifecycle of a typical field, and find that bringing forward the stabilisation year dramatically increases the importance of the methane contribution to these emissions. Using a commercial database of the remaining reserves of individual projects, we use our model to quantify future emissions resulting from the extraction of current US non-associated reserves. A carbon price of at least 400 USD/tonne CO 2 is effective in reducing cumulative GHGs by 30–60%, indicating that decarbonising the upstream component of the natural gas supply chain is achievable using carbon prices similar to those needed to decarbonise the energy system as a whole. Surprisingly, for large carbon prices, the choice of emission metric does not have a significant impact on cumulative emissions. © 2019","Cost of carbon; Emission metric; Global warming potential; Methane emissions; Upstream natural gas","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Extraction; Gas industry; Gas supply; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Methane; Natural gas well production; Stabilization; Supply chains; Cumulative emissions; Deterministic modeling; Global temperatures; Global warming potential; Life cycle emissions; Methane emissions; Natural-gas production; Techno-economic model; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; methane; natural gas; assessment method; carbon emission; climate effect; environmental economics; gas production; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane; natural gas; price dynamics; Article; biofuel production; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; cost; DYNAAMO model; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; environmental temperature; field emission; gas field; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; metric system; nonbiological model; offshore oil industry; priority journal; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062808103

Adaptation and mitigation strategies aimed at improving resiliency and sustainability of urban areas are highly related to the utilization of these surfaces. The current trends demonstrate the lack of a systemic approach able to integrate multiple possible functions and avoid sub-optimal solutions by considering the physical and morphological characteristics of the urban environment. For example, in cities, conflicts are arising between the surface uses for renewable energy production, urban agriculture, and green solutions. This study aims at systematizing the existing approaches and proposing a novel method to support the effective application of these solutions. In particular, an analytical procedure is presented to support the integration of different surface uses aiming at the maximization of throughputs, while avoiding conflicts. The method has been tested in a district in Bolzano (Italy) and it is replicable in areas with different morphological characteristics and climate conditions. The final configuration, in which several solutions have been systematically applied and integrated, demonstrate the potentialities of the proposed approach. Outdoor thermal comfort in the district is improved, with a reduction of Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) up to-5.8 °C, by simultaneously guaranteeing the production of renewable energy through solar active systems, and the preservation and expansion of existing green areas. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agriculture; Intelligent buildings; Solar energy; Analytical procedure; Mitigation strategy; Morphological characteristic; Outdoor thermal comfort; Renewable energies; Suboptimal solution; Urban agricultures; Urban environments; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068737378

Ridesharing reduces both the individual cost of car travel (through cost splitting) and road travel times (by decreasing congestion). This may trigger a number of behavioral changes among transportation users, including: making less detours to avoid congestion (route choice effect), switching from public transit and active modes to the car (modal shift effect), travelling longer distances (distance effect), and relocating further from the urban center (relocation effect). Taking Paris region as a case study, this research applies an integrated transportation/land-use model to evaluate several ridesharing scenarios and quantify the four rebound effects. The overall rebound effect is found to be substantial, cancelling out from 68 to 77% of CO2 emission reductions and from 52 to 73% of aggregated social benefits (including congestion, air quality, CO2 emissions, noise) expected from ridesharing. This is primarily the result of the modal shift effect, supplemented as ridesharing develops by the distance effect.

How to identify and implement more sustainable biofuel production alternatives, and how to overcome economic challenges for their implementation, is a matter of debate. In this study, the environmental impacts of alternative approaches to biofuel production (i.e., first, second, and third generation biofuels), with a focus on biodiversity and ecosystem services, were contrasted to develop a set of criteria for guiding the identification of sustainable biofuel production alternatives (i.e., those that maximize socioeconomic and environmental benefits), as well as strategies for decreasing the economic barriers that prevent the implementation of more sustainable biofuel production systems. The identification and implementation of sustainable biofuel production alternatives should be based on rigorous assessments that integrate socioeconomic and environmental objectives at local, regional, and global scales. Further development of environmental indicators, standardized environmental assessments, multi-objective case studies, and globally integrated assessments, along with improved estimations of biofuel production at fine spatial scales, can enhance the identification of more sustainable biofuel production systems. In the short term, several governmental mandates and incentives, along with the development of financial and market-based mechanisms and applied research partnerships, can accelerate the implementation of more sustainable biofuel production alternatives. The set of criteria and strategies developed here can guide decision making towards the identification and adoption of sustainable biofuel production systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity; Bioenergy; Biofuel; Climate change; Ecosystem service; Microalgae; Renewable energy","Biodiversity; Biofuels; Climate change; Decision making; Economics; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Bio-energy; Ecosystem services; Energy production systems; Environmental assessment; Environmental indicators; Environmental objectives; Micro-algae; Renewable energies; Sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062629020

Alternatively, in RLs with spatially localized feedback (SLF), the gain region is placed between two scattering surfaces [2]. Spatial modes of RLs have been previously characterized in devices with SDF [3, 4] but not yet in RLs with SLF. Here, we analyse the the spatial emission of individual RL modes supported by SLF, observing specific intensity patterns for each considered lasing wavelength. The investigated RLs consist of a dye doped polymer film with random defects at polymer/air interfaces, see [2] for fabrication details. A simplified view of our experimental set-up is given in Fig. 1(a). The film is pumped by a ns-pulsed laser at 532 nm shaped in a stripe line with 50 μm width (x direction) and 3 mm length (z direction). The two scattering surfaces between polymer and air, located at the ends of the striped pump, provide optical feedback and act as output couplers [5]. The diverging beam exiting the RL from one scattering surface is collected by a convex lens (CL) with 5 cm focal length, in order to image emission in the x-y plane orthogonal to the z direction.

Focusing on urban areas, the problem of congestion, combined with the need to reduce emissions into the atmosphere and increase road safety, has led national and European administrations to develop initiatives to support the so-called ""soft mobility"" (i.e., the mobility of pedestrians, cyclists). On the other hand, the introduction of autonomous vehicles will lead to significant changes in the interaction between traffic flow and infrastructure. Given this premise, the aim of this paper consists of modelling the interaction between urban space and autonomous vehicles mobility to explore possible benefits deriving by their market penetration. In detail, the paper presents a network design problem able to optimally identify which links of the road network can be considered superfluous in an autonomous vehicle scenario and, therefore, can be eliminated, to reuse them for the soft mobility. A case study is presented to show the proposed network design approach. © 2019 IEEE.","autonomous vehicles; network design; urban mobility; urban spatial planning","Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Motor transportation; Pedestrian safety; Roads and streets; Traffic control; Urban planning; Emissions into the atmosphere; Market penetration; Network design; Network design problems; Road network; Spatial planning; Transport policy; Urban mobility; Autonomous vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074952028

To date, however, no analyses have focused on the economic costs and benefits of pursuing less carbon-intensive urban growth in sub-Saharan African cities. This is significant as the perception that low-carbon urban development is more expensive than higher-carbon alternatives can be enough to preclude consideration of opportunities for more sustainable development, especially in highly resource-constrained contexts. This paper examines the validity of this perception through an economic appraisal of the scope for low-carbon development in Kigali, Rwanda. We find that the city of Kigali could theoretically invest 0.6% of its GDP each year for 10 years in economically attractive mitigation measures. This would generate annual energy savings equivalent to 1.5% of its GDP and reduce city-scale emissions by 39% by 2032 (relative to business-as-usual trends). The economic case for urban climate action is therefore substantial, and although the city is in some ways unique, this suggests that promising opportunities also exist in other sub-Saharan African cities. However, few national or local governments in the region have the political will and institutional capabilities necessary to realise this mitigation potential. We also find that although potentially significant in the short to medium term, these economically attractive measures would not be sufficient to decouple economic development and greenhouse gas emissions in Kigali in the longer term. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","cities; climate change; climate change mitigation; environmental economics; greenhouse gas emissions; sub-Saharan Africa","carbon emission; climate change; economic analysis; economic development; emission control; energy conservation; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; Gross Domestic Product; perception; Kigali; Kigali City; Rwanda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057471579

The geological record of past subduction earthquakes offers a method for assessing the location, frequency and approximate magnitude of subduction earthquakes to underpin seismic and tsunami hazard assessments. We review evidence of Holocene coseismic coastal deformation and tsunamis at 22 locations along the margin. A consistent approach to radiocarbon age modelling is used and earthquake and tsunami evidence is ranked using a systematic assessment of the quality of age control and the certainty that the event in question is an earthquake. To identify possible subduction earthquakes, we use temporal correlation of earthquakes, combined with the type of earthquake evidence, likely primary fault source and the earthquake certainty ranking. We identify 10 past possible subduction earthquakes over the past 7000 years along the Hikurangi margin. The last subduction earthquake occurred at 520–470 years BP in the southern Hikurangi margin and the strongest evidence for a full margin rupture is at 870–815 years BP. There are no apparent persistent rupture patches, suggesting segmentation of the margin is not strong. In the southern margin, the type of geological deformation preserved generally matches that expected due to rupture of the interseismically locked portion of the subduction interface but the southern termination of past subduction ruptures remains unresolved. The pattern of geological deformation on the central margin suggests that the region of the interface that currently hosts slow slip events also undergoes rupture in large earthquakes, demonstrating different modes of slip behaviour occur on the central Hikurangi margin. Evidence for subduction earthquakes on the northern margin has not been identified because deformation signals from upper plate faults dominate the geological record. Large uncertainties remain in regard to evidence of past subduction earthquakes on the Hikurangi margin, with the greatest challenges presented by temporal correlation of earthquake evidence when working within the uncertainties of radiocarbon ages, and the presence of upper plate faults capable of producing deformation and tsunamis similar to that expected for subduction earthquakes. However, areas of priority research such as improving the paleotsunami record and integration of submarine turbidite records should produce significant advances in the future. © 2019 The Authors","Coastal subsidence; Hikurangi; Marine terrace; Paleoearthquake; Subduction margin; Tsunami deposit","Deformation; Faulting; Tsunamis; Hikurangi; Marine terrace; Paleoearthquake; Subduction margin; Tsunami deposits; Earthquakes; correlation; deformation; earthquake rupture; geological record; Holocene; interface; slip; subduction; subsidence; uncertainty analysis; Hikurangi; New Zealand; North Island; Northland",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063859102

The photovoltaic performance of carbon-based PSCs, however, has been progressing slowly in spite of an impressive efficiency when they were first reported. One of the major obstacles is that the hole transport materials developed for state-of-the-art Au-based PSCs are not suitable for carbon-based PSCs. Here, we develop a low-temperature, solution-processed Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT)/graphene composite hole transport layer (HTL), that is compatible with paintable carbon-electrodes to produce state-of-the-art perovskite devices. Space-charge-limited-current measurements reveal that the as-prepared P3HT/graphene composite exhibits outstanding charge mobility and thermal tolerance, with hole mobility increasing from 8.3 × 10 −3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 (as-deposited) to 1.2 × 10 -2 cm 2 V -1 s -1 (after annealing at 100 °C) - two orders of magnitude larger than pure P3HT. The improved charge transport and extraction provided by the composite HTL provides a significant efficiency improvement compared to cells with a pure P3HT HTL.

However, most current research addresses resilience and climate adaptation at either the national or the household scale; very little is known about community-scale interventions. We interviewed 934 community members in six communities in southeastern Nigeria about sources of climate risk and community-based actions for climate change adaptation. We found these communities contained multiple active and engaged groups that have implemented a wide range of interventions to reduce climate risk, most of which are seen as effective by community members. Flooding was the most common form of risk in this region, but drought, windstorms, and irregular rainy seasons are also frequent, implying that effective climate adaptation will have to be sensitive to multiple types of risk. Structural interventions (constructing roads, bridges, etc.) were the most common type of intervention, suggesting that communities are capable of marshalling considerable organizational and human power for adaptation efforts, even in the absence of external assistance. Efforts to boost community resilience and adaptation to climate change would benefit from first understanding what community actions are currently underway, and working with the groups implementing these actions to support and extend them. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Community adaptation; Flooding; Nigeria; Resilience","adaptive management; climate change; community resource management; disaster management; drought; flooding; questionnaire survey; risk perception; storm damage; Nigeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067305236

Arguably, improving rural livelihoods and preserving Sub-Saharan Africa's forests may only be attained through radical transformations in the governance and utilisation of forests. Some aspects increasing climate change vulnerability in Sub-Saharan Africa include the region's education and skills development inadequacies and lack of sustainable governance systems. Consequently, Africa will soon become home to 50% of the world's illiterate population. Reforming educational curriculums to include entrepreneurship and climate change studies has the potential to reduce climate change vulnerability. However, challenges exist in developing and implementing pertinent curriculums and education policies since many African governments have problems in sufficiently funding and investing in education and skills development systems. Through an analysis of research articles, case studies and policy briefs, this paper explored how an Information and Communications Technology (ICT) based Polycentric Climate Change and Entrepreneurship Education Framework can be used to improve forestry governance, increase rural incomes and promote inclusive education. Using such a Framework, it is possible for non-state actors, rather than governments to teach agroforestry, entrepreneurship and climate change studies to rural communities, secondary schools and universities using digital media platforms. The paper shows that SDG 13 (combat climate change and its impacts) and SDG 15 (sustainably manage forests) can be addressed simultaneously if policy makers and practitioners focus on reducing the costs of telecommunications and the internet as that would reduce the costs for tablets and mobile phones and enable improved access to information and practice on Ecosystem Based Adaptation (EBA) and microforesty schemes like Komaza in rural areas. © 2019 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Within destination systems, tourism businesses have been encouraged to take proactive steps to prepare for climate change, but in many destinations, adaptation has been limited. In this Regional Spotlight, findings from a series of qualitative interviews with representatives from businesses in two Great Lakes destinations are used to highlight some of the major challenges facing the region's tourism sector in terms of climate change. Results support findings of existing research that tourism businesses are strongly aware of how they are impacted by weather and climate. Conversely, though many interviewees were able to discuss how their businesses could be affected by climate change, they showed little concern that it would present new challenges and expressed a belief that it could be beneficial in some cases. Common barriers to proactive climate change action include limited resources, lack of knowledge of options, and a belief that action is unnecessary. The results of this study suggest that future work focused on how to build stronger public-private partnerships between policymakers, destination marketing organizations (DMOs), researchers, and tourism professionals in the Great Lakes, and perhaps other destinations, could help: (1) build awareness of potential novel or nonlinear impacts of climate change among tourism professionals, and (2) increase the availability of scientific information that meets their decision-making needs; subsequently, also leading to more effective destination-based climate change management strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Barriers to adaptation; Business adaptation; Climate change; Climate change perceptions; Qualitative research; Tourism management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059611866

Information on major ions was used to conduct the ionic balance and to evaluate sea salt and non-sea salt contributions; furthermore, the study on metals concentration allowed to distinguish the contribution of anthropic sources while their chemical behaviour (solubility and leachability) was considered in order to highlight the presence of different chemical forms. In the period of interest (June 2015), daily averages PM concentrations were below the limit of 25 μg/m3 for PM2.5 and 50 μg/m3for PM10; moreover, for both fractions, the most abundant ionic species was SO42−followed by NO3−. Ionic balance indicated that non-sea salt contribution accounted for the great part of Ca2+, SO42− and K+ while secondary inorganic aerosol accounted for about 5% of total ionic fraction. As expected, the most abundant metal was zinc (about 41 ng/m3 and 44 ng/m3in PM2.5 and PM10, respectively), while cadmium, copper and lead were at very low concentrations, in the range of 0.01–0.47 ng/m3; leachability reached values of 40% for copper in both PM fractions, in contrast with zinc that showed the lowest leachability, corresponding to 6% for PM2.5 fraction. The study on air masses trajectories indicated a change on ionic composition and chemical properties, varying from a condition with air masses coming from Eastern Europe, characterised also by higher concentrations of both PM2.5 and PM10, a prevalence of secondary aerosol and metals showing minor solubility and leachability, to a condition with air masses coming from North-west region, with characteristics opposed to the previous ones. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Air masses trajectories; Ionic balance; Labile fraction; Metal concentrations; Soluble fraction","ammonia; cadmium; calcium ion; chloride ion; copper; lead; magnesium ion; nitrate; nitrogen dioxide; oxalic acid; potassium ion; sodium ion; sulfate; zinc; aerosol composition; air mass; anthropogenic source; chemical composition; concentration (composition); ionic composition; particulate matter; solubility; urban area; chemical composition; controlled study; Italy; leaching; particulate matter; secondary organic aerosol; solubility; urban area; Campania [Italy]; Italy; Naples; Napoli [Campania]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065736966

They are based on nature-like nature environmental-engineering technologies. They are generally complex natural-anthropogenic systems structurally consisting of dynamic components such as climate, soils, water sources, and agricultural plants. From the standpoint of synergetics, each component is an open, non-linear (multivariant and irreversible), non-equilibrium self-organizing system. Climate characteristics are prone to the most drastic change while being of utmost importance for agriculture. Many scientists have found that climate is changing towards warming. In general, climate is a self-organizing system featuring considerable weather fluctuations while staying integral and able to exist in different variants. It is therefore extremely important to study such fluctuations as well as general climate change in different regions. It is this climate change that directly affects different aspects of regional economy. Of special interest are the forecasts of climate-related effects on meliorated land. Today's weather forecasts are reliable within 5 days. This is why it is proposed to base forecasts on a probabilistic approach. Perennial historical weather data can be used to calculate and evaluate possible developments. Having a wide range of development computations, one can analyze these situations for other economic (economy-, environment-, or technology-related) purposes to choose the best option. Probabilistic research into the need for meliorated land in the European part of the Russian Federation has been carried out under a Grant of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation (2017). We have developed various options for crop farming in the meliorated areas of European Russia for various climates (hot, normal, and mild climates; dry, normal, and humid climates). This approach can be used to generate other options or any combination thereof. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Energy efficiency improvements, leading to lower fuel consumption, are therefore of considerable interest to policymakers trying to achieve low-carbon travel. However, it is well established that higher miles per gallon efficiencies can, by reducing the costs of travel, lead to some level of increased personal travel: the so-called ‘rebound effect’. This paper describes an empirical study to measure the size and also the variability in this effect at the provincial level and what this variability implies for a carbon tax policy. This rebound effect is quantified using a two-stage Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) model. A backfire effect (i.e. the rebound is ≫100%) is observed in urban passenger transport, with disparities in the size of the rebound effect ranging from 114% to 153% among China's provinces. The differences in economic development as well as related differences in consumers' behavior, especially in the behavior of “marginal consumers”, have contributed to this heterogeneity, with a larger carbon tax (more than 110Yuan/tonne) needed in richer provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong and Fujian in order to bring about similar levels of carbon reductions nationwide. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon tax; CO2 rebound effect; Heterogeneity; Urban passenger transport","Carbon; Consumer behavior; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy security; Energy utilization; Carbon taxes; Economic development; Empirical studies; Energy efficiency improvements; Heterogeneity; Passenger transport; Passenger transportation; Rebound effect; Urban transportation; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic development; emission control; energy use; environmental economics; pollution tax; urban transport; China; Guangdong; Jiangsu; Zhejiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068068032

We propose to explore SOC changes by monitoring the dynamics of soil labile organic carbon (LOC); namely if LOC could be largely retained in soils rather than respired rapidly, the SOC would be ready to be sequestered. The effects of the two major functional groups of plants, that is, canopy trees and understory plants, on SOC accumulation were then illustrated with this LOC-based approach. The characteristics of LOC and SOC of topsoils (0–20 cm) in a field manipulation experiment with 5-yr treatments of understory removal and tree girdling in both a young and a mature Eucalyptus plantations were examined. The concentration and potential turnover time of soil LOC were used to indicate the state of vegetation-induced C accumulation in soils, which were estimated by a sequential fumigation-incubation procedure. Soil natural abundances of 13C and 15N were measured to reflect the proportion of newly retained LOC in soils. We found that, in the young plantation, understory removal did not significantly affect both soil LOC and SOC concentrations, but significantly increased the potential turnover time of soil LOC. In contrast, in the mature plantation, understory removal significantly decreased soil LOC and SOC concentrations, but did not significantly alter the potential turnover time of soil LOC. However, tree girdling did not significantly affect SOC concentration, soil LOC concentration, or potential turnover time in either the young plantation or the mature plantation. These results demonstrated that understory plant-derived C was one of the major components of LOC pool in topsoils, and it may be readily mineralized in the young plantation but accumulated as an important fraction of SOC in the mature plantation. This study suggests that the LOC-based approach is potentially useful in monitoring SOC changes and improves our understanding of how plant functional groups and soil fertility status could jointly affect LOC and SOC dynamics. In considering the great contribution of understory plants to SOC processes, we propose that understory plants should be maintained in subtropical plantation ecosystems. © 2019 The Authors.","active C pool; C turnover rate; natural isotope abundance; plant functional groups; soil C accumulation; soil fertility; subtropical plantations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068168448

The dual-injection mode, which incorporates direct-injection with port-fuel-injection, is considered to be an effective approach to reduce PN emissions. In this study the combustion, gaseous and particulate emission characteristics under different direct-injection ratios in a dual-injection gasoline engine were investigated. The results show that dual-injection increases the peak of in-cylinder pressure curves and makes the heat release curves shift towards an earlier region. The dual-injection mode yields a notable CO reduction while there is a slight increase in NOx emission. Dual-injection can significantly reduce the PN emission compared with GDI engines. As the direct-injection ratio decreases, the PN concentration continuously declines. The peak of size distributions curves for dual-injection tends to shift towards the smaller diameter region, showing the ability to generate particles in smaller size.

These emissions have a significant impact on regional air quality, especially in China where car ownership is growing rapidly. However, the contribution of evaporative emissions to secondary aerosol (SA) is not clear in an air pollution complex in which a high concentration of SO2 and NH3 was present. In this study, the effects of SO2 and NH3 on SA formation from unburned gasoline vapor were investigated in a 30 m3 indoor smog chamber. It was found that an increase in SO2 and NH3 concentrations (0-151 and 0-200 ppb, respectively) could linearly promote the formation of SA, which could be enhanced by a factor of 1.6-2.6 and 2.0-2.5, respectively. Sulfate was most sensitive to the SO2 concentration, followed by organic aerosol, which was due not only to the acid catalytic effect, but was also related to the formation of organic sulfur-containing compounds. In the case of an increasing NH3 concentration, ammonium nitrate increased more significantly than organic aerosol, and nitrogen-containing organics were also enhanced, as revealed by the results of positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis. New particle formation (NPF) and particle size growth were also significantly enhanced in the presence of SO2 and NH3. This work indicates that gasoline evaporative emissions will be a significant source of SA, especially in the presence of high concentrations of SO2 and NH3. Meanwhile, these emissions might also be a potential source of sulfurand nitrogen-containing organics. Our work provides a scientific basis for the synergistic emission reduction of secondary aerosol precursors, including NOx, SO2, NH3, and particularly VOCs, to mitigate particulate matter (PM) pollution in China. © 2019 The Author(s).",,"aerosol; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); evaporation; formation mechanism; petroleum; point source; volatile organic compound; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067700980

The program of CP2K in combination with the semi-empirical method PM3 is utilized for the MD simulations. The simulations show that the formation of molecular hydrogens (H2) is different than previous studies, in particular, different than compact PAHs. At high temperatures, linear PAHs tend to open aromatic rings and convert the sp3 C-C or sp2 C=C bonds to sp C≡C bonds by removing H2; i.e. polyynes are formed in such process. Besides polyynes, PAHs attached with sp-bonded polyyne chains are commonly observed at high temperatures. We notice that due to the addition of flexible tails (polyynes), the ring-polyyne molecules do not dissociate for a long period of time at high temperatures. Such structures facilitate the molecules to survive in the harsh environment of the interstellar medium. In addition, the ring-polyyne structures induce dipole moments that could, in principle, be detected by radio astronomy. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.","astrochemistry -molecular processes; ISM: molecules; methods: laboratory: molecular; photodissociation region (PDR).",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067965367

Green space has been deemed to be effective in mitigating PM pollution; however, few studies have examined its effectiveness at the neighborhood scale. In this study, the authors probe the contributions from different landscape components in the green space (i.e., tree, grass), as well as the spatial scale of planning on fine PM (PM2.5) concentrations in urban neighborhoods. PM2.5 data including 37 samples from five megacities were collected from the National Environmental Monitoring Centre in China. Results showed that, neighborhood green space greatly contributed to the spatial variation in PM2.5. The total green space coverage, tree coverage, and grass coverage were all negatively correlated with PM2.5 concentration (p &lt; 0.05). The higher green space coverage the site had, the lower the daily mean, daily minimum, and daily maximum of PM2.5 concentration were there. Tree coverage, in particular, was effective in reducing the PM2.5 concentrations, and, more importantly, its effectiveness was more significant with the higher ambient PM2.5 level. According to the examination on the effect of spatial scale, the capability for a neighborhood green space to attenuate PM2.5 pollution would be vanished when its size smaller than 200 m, and would be maximized when its size within 400–500 m. These results will contribute to the evidence-based design and management of green space to mitigating urban PM pollution. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Fine particulate matter; Green space; Measured data; Neighborhood","Air quality; Forestry; Health risks; Pollution control; Airborne particulate matters; Environmental Monitoring; Evidence-based designs; Fine particulate matter; Green spaces; Measured data; Neighborhood; PM2.5 concentration; Particles (particulate matter); concentration (composition); greenspace; megacity; neighborhood; particulate matter; pollution control; spatial variation; urban design; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064153366

We use biogeochemical data from profiling floats and 26-year bottle samples off Bermuda to provide the first evidence for a mechanism that allows for heterotrophy in the presence of oxygen accumulation in the lower euphotic zone (50–100 m) during the stratified season. After the spring bloom, surface waters that are enriched in oxygen and organic matter, but low in nitrate, are subducted and transported along the seasonal isopycnals that progressively displace downward. Due exclusively to this downward displacement, a positive 50- to 100-m depth-integrated O2 anomaly appears (1,688 ± 545 mmol O2/m2) from mid-May to mid-October. Neglecting this effect of isopycnal displacement would suggest an excess of biological productivity over remineralization at 50–100 m (344 ± 330 mmol O2/m2). Yet, when these changes are differenced, significant along-isopycnal oxygen consumption (−1,344 ± 537 mmol O2/m2) is identified. After accounting for mixing, net biological-driven oxygen consumption is still found (−827 ± 509 mmol O2/m2), which indicates heterotrophy. Remineralization of sinking and suspended organic matters at 50–100 m could support 90 ± 67% of the heterotrophic demand. Our analysis also shows that the spread in the biological-driven oxygen sink is linked to the strength of isopycnal displacement that modulates the supply of nutrients and organic matters. This along-isopycnal transport and heterotrophy in the lower euphotic zone reduces carbon export at 100 m and helps to resolve previously noted imbalances between surface biological productivity and total organic carbon export. ©2019.

Three years (2015-2017) of wintertime (January) surface PM2:5 (fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 μ m) observations from more than 1600 sites were assimilated hourly using the updated three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) system. In the control experiment (without assimilation) using Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China 2010 (MEIC-2010) emissions, the modeled January averaged PM2:5 concentrations were severely overestimated in the Sichuan Basin, central China, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta by 98-134, 46-101, 32-59 and 19-60 μg m-3, respectively, indicating that the emissions for 2010 are not appropriate for 2015-2017, as strict emission control strategies were implemented in recent years. Meanwhile, underestimations of 11-12, 53-96 and 22-40 μg m-3 were observed in northeastern China, Xinjiang and the Energy Golden Triangle, respectively. The assimilation experiment significantly reduced both high and low biases to within ±5 μg m-3. The observations and the reanalysis data from the assimilation experiment were used to investigate the year-to-year changes and the driving factors. The role of emissions was obtained by subtracting the meteorological impacts (by control experiments) from the total combined differences (by assimilation experiments). The results show a reduction in PM2:5 of approximately 15 μg m-3 for the month of January from 2015 to 2016 in the North China Plain (NCP), but meteorology played the dominant role (contributing a reduction of approximately 12 μg m-3). The change (for January) from 2016 to 2017 in NCP was different; meteorology caused an increase in PM2:5 of approximately 23 μg m-3, while emission control measures caused a decrease of 8 μg m-3, and the combined effects still showed a PM2:5 increase for that region. The analysis confirmed that emission control strategies were indeed implemented and emissions were reduced in both years. Using a data assimilation approach, this study helps identify the reasons why emission control strategies may or may not have an immediately visible impact. There are still large uncertainties in this approach, especially the inaccurate emission inputs, and neglecting aerosol-meteorology feedbacks in the model can generate large uncertainties in the analysis as well. © 2019 Author(s).",,"aerosol; concentration (composition); emission; emission inventory; meteorology; particulate matter; weather forecasting; winter; China; Sichuan Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066841845

The empirical method utilises the incoming solar radiation and the relationship between a function of relative humidity and vapour pressure deficit. The empirical method overestimated ET o by 21.4%, on a yearly basis, 27.0% for the winter period and 16.3% for the summer period, compared with the estimations of the American Society of Civil Engineers Penman Monteith (ASCE PM) (2005) method. Various meteorological variables included in the energy and the aerodynamic term of the ASCE PM (2005) method were investigated with respect to altitude. The increasing trend of incoming solar radiation combined with the decreasing trend of relative humidity, both with respect to altitude were the main causes for the underestimation of the empirical radiation method. The empirical method was adjusted for high-altitude climatic conditions by multiplying the values by the ratio of the atmospheric pressure corresponding to the altitude of the station to the atmospheric pressure at sea level. The adjusted values were overestimated by 3.4% compared to the estimations of the ASCE PM (2005) method (higher overestimation: 9.1% and lower overestimation: 0.8%). The value of 0.073mmh-1 was considered as the upper limit for the satisfactory performance of the empirical method. The root mean square error (RMSE) values ranged from 0.038 to 0.054mmh-1 and the R 2 values ranged from 0.95 to 0.97. The values of the wind speed and vapour pressure deficit (not included in the empirical method) were divided into intervals and the RMSE values between the values of the estimations of the empirical method and the values of the estimations of the ASCE PM (2005) were calculated for each interval. The RMSE values calculated for the intervals of the values of the wind speed ranged from 0.036 to 0.065mmh-1 and were satisfactory. The vapour pressure deficit values &lt;2.5 kPa also yielded satisfactory RMSE values and accounted for 96.1% of the data. © 2019, Indian Academy of Sciences.","Altitude; high-altitude meteorology; reference evapotranspiration","altitude; climate conditions; empirical analysis; estimation method; evapotranspiration; relative humidity; seasonal variation; solar radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063364893

This unstructured data is commonly observed in community science programs. Often the objective is to apply these data to estimate a long-term concentration, which is achieved using a temporal adjustment to correct for the irregular sampling. Temporal adjustments leverage information from a stationary continuous reference monitor, in combination with short-term monitoring data, to estimate long-term pollutant concentrations. We assess the performance of temporal adjustment approaches to predict long-term pollutant concentrations using data representing unstructured sampling. A series of monitoring campaigns are simulated from air pollution data obtained from regulatory monitoring networks in four different cities (Paris, France; Taipei, Taiwan; Toronto, Canada; and Vancouver, Canada) for eight different pollutants (CO, NO, NO x , NO 2 , O 3 , PM 10 , PM 2.5 , and SO 2 ). These simulated campaigns have randomized monitoring locations and sampling times to simulate the irregular nature of crowd sourced or mobile monitoring data. The number of consecutive samples reported, and selection of the reference monitor used to adjust observations, are varied in this study. The accuracy of estimates is assessed by comparing the estimated long-term concentration to the observed long-term concentration from the complete regulatory monitoring dataset. This study found that a common temporal adjustment applied in research performed significantly worse than other adjustments including a Naïve Temporal Approach where no data adjustment occurred. Increasing the sample size improved the accuracy of estimates, which showed decreasing benefit with increased sample lengths. Lastly, controlling for land use conditions of the reference monitor did not consistently improve the long-term estimates, which suggests that land use pairing of mobile and reference monitors does not significantly influence the predictive power of temporal adjustment approaches. Temporal adjustments can reduce the error in long-term concentration estimates of air pollution using incomplete data, but this benefit cannot be assumed across all approaches, pollutants or sampling programs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Community science; Mobile monitoring; Stationary monitoring; Temporal adjustments","carbon monoxide; nitric dioxide; nitric oxide; ozone; sodium ion; sulfur dioxide; unclassified drug; accuracy assessment; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); environmental monitoring; estimation method; land use change; observational method; pollution monitoring; sampling; temporal variation; air monitoring; air pollution; air sampling; Article; Canada; particulate matter; simulation; Taiwan; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; France; British Columbia; Canada; France; Ile de France; Paris; Taipei; Taiwan; Vancouver [British Columbia]; Ville de Paris; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Canada; Environmental Monitoring; France; Paris; Particulate Matter; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063613361

Yet only a handful of studies have estimated selection on scent in natural populations and no study has quantified the relative importance of pollinators and other agents of selection. In the fragrant orchid Gymnadenia conopsea, we used electroantennographic data to identify floral scent compounds detected by local pollinators and quantified pollinator-mediated selection on emission rates of 10 target compounds as well as on flowering start, visual display and spur length. Nocturnal pollinators contributed more to reproductive success than diurnal pollinators, but there was significant pollinator-mediated selection on both diurnal and nocturnal scent emission. Pollinators selected for increased emission of two compounds and reduced emission of two other compounds, none of which were major constituents of the total bouquet. In three cases, pollinator-mediated selection was opposed by nonpollinator-mediated selection, leading to weaker or no detectable net selection. Our study demonstrates that minor scent compounds can be targets of selection, that pollinators do not necessarily favour stronger scent signalling, and that some scent compounds are subject to conflicting selection from pollinators and other agents of selection. Hence, including floral scent traits into selection analysis is important for understanding the mechanisms behind floral evolution. © 2019 The Authors.

However, immense discrepancies between political commitments and governmental action remain. Combined national climate commitments fall far short of the Paris Agreement's 1.5/2°C targets. Similar political ambition gaps persist across various areas of sustainable development. Many therefore argue that actions by nonstate actors, such as businesses and investors, cities and regions, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), are crucial. These voices have resonated across the United Nations (UN) system, leading to growing recognition, promotion, and mobilization of such actions in ever greater numbers. This article investigates optimistic arguments about nonstate engagement, namely: (a) “the more the better”; (b) “everybody wins”; (c) “everyone does their part”; and (d) “more brings more.” However, these optimistic arguments may not be matched in practice due to governance risks. The current emphasis on quantifiable impacts may lead to the under-appreciation of variegated social, economic, and environmental impacts. Claims that everybody stands to benefit may easily be contradicted by outcomes that are not in line with priorities and needs in developing countries. Despite the seeming depoliticization of the role of nonstate actors in implementation, actions may still lead to politically contentious outcomes. Finally, nonstate climate and sustainability actions may not be self-reinforcing but may heavily depend on supporting mechanisms. The article concludes with governance risk-reduction strategies that can be combined to maximize nonstate potential in sustainable and climate-resilient transformations.

MFMs raise funds from member countries through “burden sharing” arrangements, and these funds are disbursed as grants to finance environmental projects around the world. These projects are impure public goods, as they help achieve global (public) objectives like climate change mitigation, and they also generate local (private) benefits for recipient countries. This paper constructs a model of MFMs and explores how impure public goods influence burden sharing arrangements. I design an optimal burden sharing mechanism and show how resultant environmental quality and welfare are affected by the choice of grant allocations. Counterintuitively, grant reallocations can be redistributive, Pareto improving, or immiserating, and these results are shaped by the initial distribution of grants and by substitute and complement relationships between private and public consumption. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Burden sharing; Environmental agreements; Impure public goods; Joint production; Public goods","Climate change; Environmental regulations; Pollution control; Burden sharing; Climate change mitigation; Environmental projects; Environmental quality; Global public goods; Joint production; Public goods; Sharing mechanism; Finance; climate change; cost analysis; environmental economics; environmental quality; global perspective; public goods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049695545

Ground based MAX-DOAS measurements were performed from April 2013 to February 2017. The MAX-DOAS measurements of NO2 and HCHO vertical column densities (VCDs) are used to validate OMI satellite observations over Nanjing. We developed a new technique to assemble the source contribution map using backward trajectory analysis. The age weighted backward propagation approach is applied to the MAX-DOAS measurements of NO2 and HCHO to reconstruct the spatial distribution of NO2 and HCHO over the Yangtze River Delta during summer and winter time. The reconstructed NO2 fields show a distinct agreement with OMI satellite observations. However, due to the short atmospheric lifetime of HCHO, the backward propagated HCHO data does not show a strong spatial correlation with the OMI HCHO observations. The result shows the MAX-DOAS measurements are sensitive to the air pollution transportation in the Yangtze River Delta, indicating the air quality in Nanjing is significantly influenced by regional transportation of air pollutants. Our results provide a better understanding of the transportation and sources of pollutants in over the Yangtze River Delta as well as the effect of emission control measures during large international event, which are important for the future design of air pollution control policies. © OSA 2019 © 2019 The Author(s)",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Emission control; Hyperspectral imaging; Light absorption; Nitrogen oxides; Optical sensors; Rivers; Satellites; Backward trajectory analysis; Differential optical absorption spectroscopy; Emission control measures; Long term observations; Regional transportation; Satellite measurements; Satellite observations; Vertical column densities; River pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085697206

A private firm in Rwanda is distributing forced-draft pellet-fed semigasifier cookstoves and fuel pellets.

We observed &gt;90% reductions in most pollutant emission factors/rates from pellet stoves compared to baseline stoves. Pellet stoves performed far better than gasifier stoves burning unprocessed wood, and consistent with ISO tiers 4 and 5 for PM2.5 and CO, respectively. Pellet stoves were generally clean, but performance varied; emissions from the dirtiest pellet tests matched those from the cleanest traditional stove tests. Our real-time data suggest that events occurring during ignition and the end of testing (e.g., refueling, char burnout) drive high emissions during pellet tests. We use our data to estimate potential health and climate cobenefits from stove adoption. This analysis suggests that pellet stoves have the potential to provide health benefits far above previously tested biomass stoves and approaching modern fuel stoves (e.g., LPG).

These are addressed in detail in this update. There are three cases worth noting here. First, the High Court found that in determining policy on fracking, it was important to consider scientific evidence including the effects on climate change. The Court found that the government had failed to do just this after a judicial review brought by anti-fracking campaigners. It is probable that the High Court’s judgment will make it possible for future judicial review claimants to raise climate change as a reason to object to planning permission for fracking sites (see Stephenson v Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, below). Second, Friends of the Earth brought a judicial review of the Secretary of State’s decision to publish a revised version of the National Planning Policy Framework on the grounds that the decision was flawed as it had not been subject of a Strategic Environmental Assessment. The Court refused the application and held that the revised National Planning Policy Framework did not require a strategic environmental assessment within the meaning of the governing legislation and was a voluntary measure. Third, in Shirley, the appellant appealed a decision of the High Court refusing an application for judicial review of the respondent’s refusal to call in a planning application for a housing development of some 4,000 homes near Canterbury. It was argued on appeal that in line with their duties under the Air Quality Standards Regulation 2010, the respondent was obligated to call in the application. This was rejected. The Court found that the respondent had a broad discretion and the wording of the Regulation was not such as to demand a call in. It is notable, however, that during the case the High Court found that the Air Quality Directive does require Member States to adopt an air quality plan if the Regulations on limit values are breached. Internationally, the European Parliament has taken bold action in March. The European Parliament resolved to impose a regulation to limit CO2 emissions for cars and vans by 2030. The Parliament further resolved to ban single-use plastic such as plates, cutlery and straws by 2021.

How consumers alter their spatial distribution, grazing activities, and functional morphology in response to climate stress can determine whether their effects on plants intensify or relax. Few studies have considered multiple consumer response metrics to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning the resulting changes in consumer− plant interactions. Here, we tested how drought stress influences the interaction between the dominant consumer, the fungal-farming periwinkle snail Littoraria irrorata, and a foundational plant, cordgrass Spartina alterniflora, in a southeastern US salt marsh. In a 4 mo field experiment, we maintained moderate snail densities in mesh control chambers and clear plastic climate chambers that simulated drought by elevating temperatures and drying soils. Monitoring revealed that snails more often congregated on cordgrass stems than leaves in climate chambers than in controls. Image analyses indicated that this behavioral shift corresponded to snails inflicting shorter, but more numerous, fungal-infested scars on cordgrass leaves, and causing less plant damage in climate chambers than controls. Coincident with their net reduction in grazing, snails maintained longer radulae, whose central teeth were blunter and lateral teeth were sharper, in climate chambers compared to controls. These results suggest that under drought, snail radulae may experience less frictional wear and that, at intermediate densities, snail−cordgrass interactions relax. Together with prior research showing that at high densities, snails can denude cordgrass during drought, we conclude that con-Saltmarsh snails (top left) stressed by drought conditions show reduced radula wear and shifts in tooth morphology (e.g. sharper lateral teeth; bottom right), suggesting that fewer resources are invested in maintaining the grazing apparatus. Climate change is expected to increase drought stress. © The authors 2019.","Climate change; Coastal wetland; Herbivory; Littorariairrorata; Spartinaalterniflora","climate change; coastal wetland; drought stress; functional morphology; fungus; grass; grazing; herbivory; morphology; saltmarsh; snail; spatial distribution; United States; Gastropoda; Littoraria irrorata; Spartina; Spartina alterniflora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067559485

It can reduce emissions from the production of electricity from coal, and reduce global warming. Therefore, this paper is a study of the energy management of hybrid renewable energy sources suitable for the load of the central sports stadium in Chaiyaphum province. The Homer Pro is used to analyze the size of a system with integrated renewable energy sources, including solar energy and wind power generation. It also analyzes the economics of the system and analyzes the size and cost of the system with the appropriate battery energy storage system. The simulation results show that grid connections (On-Grid) can save cost more than Off-Grid systems. Due to the Off-Grid system, the cost of the battery is large and expensive. So, with the on-grid system, it is more than worth the investment and can sell the electric power back to the electrical system. However, the Off-Grid system also has advantages for remote areas, and it is useful for systems with small loads. When the price of the battery decreases, Off-Grid systems will play an important role in smart grid systems. © 2019, Greater Mekong Subregion Academic and Research Network, Asian Institute of Technology.","Energy management; Energy storage system; Hybrid renewable energy sources; Solar energy; Wind energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066037127

The aim of this work is to evaluate the impact of a new innovative wastewater treatment technology on the water quality of the Leite River, Lithuania. The Leite River basin receives wastewater from the Leitgiriai agglomeration; it is then released into a channel, which is 73 m away from the river. During the implementation of the BSR Interreg project “Water emissions and their reduction in village communities in the Baltic Sea Region as pilots (VillageWater),” the ineffective Leitgiriai wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was reconstructed in September and October of 2017. Water samples from Leite River were collected in 2010–2018 in three locations: near the Kulynai, Leitgiriai, and Sausgalviai villages in Lithuania. The results show that the wastewater treatment efficiency is statistically higher than that before the reconstruction of the WWTP. The treated wastewater (before and after reconstruction) is released from the Leitgiriai WWTP into the surface water (channel), which flows into the Leite River. The highest concentrations (according to all examined indicators) have been observed in the channel and in the Leite River 500 m after the release point before the reconstruction. All differences are statistically significant (p < 0.05). According to the 2018 values, the water quality of the Leite River did comply with the good ecological status/potential class indicators near the Leitgiriai village. After the Leitgiriai WWTP reconstruction, the wastewater treatment efficiency increased two times on average. Therefore, the Leite River water quality near Leitgiriai improved. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N); Biogenic material; BOD7 value; Chemical/nutrient; Nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N); Total nitrogen (Nt); Total phosphorus (Pt); Wastewater treatment plant","biochemical oxygen demand; biogenic material; chemical analysis; concentration (composition); environmental assessment; environmental impact assessment; implementation process; microbiology; nitrate; nitrogen; parameter estimation; phosphorus; reconstruction; river pollution; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; water quality; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Lithuania; analysis; biochemical oxygen demand; chemistry; environmental monitoring; Lithuania; microbiology; procedures; river; standards; waste water; water management; water pollutant; water quality; Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis; Environmental Monitoring; Lithuania; Rivers; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification; Water Quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065402286

Air pollution is an environmental and social problem, as it leads to a number of harmful effects on human health, ecosystems, the environment and the climate. Air pollution constitutes the greatest environmental health risk in the city of Pristina. Air pollutants are emitted from anthropogenic and natural sources; they can be transported or formed over long distances and can affect large areas. Some air pollutants float in the environment for long periods and can accumulate in the environment and in the food chain, affecting humans and animals not only through air intake but through water and food intake too. Air pollution is a complex problem that poses multiple challenges in terms of management and mitigation. Effective action to reduce the impact of air pollution requires some good understanding of the sources that cause it, as well as knowledge of the daily status of air quality and its impact on humans and ecosystems. In this research paper, we carried out the monitoring of the air quality in terms of it being polluted with SO 2 in the municipality of Pristina for the months March and June 2017. Air quality analyses have been taken from the SO 2 measurements made in these two months, through monitoring stations.

Moreover, the relationship between the hydrogen flammability limit, engine knock and hydrogen energy substitution was explored. Measurements were done at three engine loads (30%, 60%, 100%) while maintaining constant the engine speed (2400 rpm) whereas the engine knock was detected through an in-house non-invasive system. According to the experimental measurements, backfire took place at hydrogen concentration higher than the downward flammability limit. The maximum hydrogen energy substitutions were 80%, 60%, and 40% corresponding to engine loads of 30%, 60%, and 100%, respectively. The maximum reduction of diesel consumption was 54.2% with respect to 100% diesel operation at 30% of engine load and 80% of hydrogen energy substitution. Brake fuel conversion efficiency decreased as hydrogen addition increased for all the engine loads tested. This decrease may be mainly caused by the steam formation during the hydrogen combustion. Brake specific CO2 carbon dioxide emissions were reduced in most cases whereas the effect on brake specific NO emissions was dependent on engine load. At low engine load, a reduction in NO emissions was observed as hydrogen addition increased. Opacity was reduced in all cases and demonstrated the instability of operation near to the backfire region at 100% of engine load. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Alternative fuel; Diesel; Dual fuel; Engines; Hydrogen","Alternative fuels; Brakes; Carbon dioxide; Diesel engines; Direct injection; Dual fuel engines; Engines; Flammability; Global warming; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Ignition; Reduction; Brake fuel conversion efficiency; Carbon dioxide emissions; Diesel; Direct injection diesel engines; Dual-fuels; Experimental investigations; Hydrogen diesel dual fuels; Performance and emissions; Combustion knock",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064894144

The Minamata Convention on Mercury (United Nations Environment Program, 2017), commits signing countries to control anthropogenic mercury emissions and reduce human exposure. Human biomonitoring (HBM) programs, are the most straight-forward approaches to get information on the actual exposure levels in the population and assess over time. We report here the results of a HBM study in a nationwide cross-section of Spanish adults (18–65y) as baseline values obtained before the Minamata Convention entered into force. Subsequent follow-ups will show if the Convention has been successful. The study includes 1880 blood samples, 1704 urine samples and 577 hair samples from all Spanish regions collected and analysed under a strictly quality controlled and quality assured protocol. The EU-DEMOCOPHES project demonstrated that fish and seafood are the major sources of mercury exposure and that the Spanish as well as the Portuguese populations have higher levels than other European countries. The data from the present study confirms this pattern at national level and that inhabitants in coastal regions have higher values than from inland regions. The geometric mean (GM) for blood is 6.35 μg Hg/l, in urine is 1.11 μg Hg/l and for hair is 1.91 μg Hg/g. In an international comparison these values are not exceptional. Spanish concentrations fall into the group of Easter Mediterranean populations. Although information on gender, age, occupational sector, geographical area, sampling period and frequency of fish consumption is reported in the tables, the purpose of this paper has not been to analyse the determinants of exposure in detail but to provide baseline data for future assessments and for regional authorities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Blood; Fish consumption; Hair; Human biomonitoring; Mercury; Minamata convention; Spain; Urine","Blood; Fish; Mercury (metal); Fish consumption; Hair; Human biomonitoring; Minamata convention; Spain; Urine; Quality control; creatinine; mercury; mercury; biomonitoring; blood; elderly population; fish; food consumption; hair; mercury (element); urine; adult; Article; atomic absorption spectrometry; biological monitoring; blood level; controlled study; creatinine urine level; female; fish; geometry; hair level; human; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; limit of quantitation; male; mercury blood level; mercury hair level; mercury urine level; middle aged; population research; Portuguese (citizen); priority journal; quality control; questionnaire; Spaniard; urine level; blood; chemistry; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; hair; metabolism; pollutant; Spain; statistics and numerical data; urine; Spain; Adult; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Hair; Humans; Male; Mercury; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063081939

However, it is widely recognized that well intended intervention to address one of these sustainability objectives in isolation can undermine other objectives. This paper presents a framework to efficiently identify spatial development strategies that provide the best outcomes against multiple objectives. The framework has been applied to London (UK) to identify strategies that can simultaneously: (i) minimize exposure to future heat wave events; (ii) minimize the risk from flood events; (iii) minimize transport emissions; (iv) minimize urban sprawl; (v) maximize brownfield development; and, (vi) prevent development of greenspace that is recognized as important to wellbeing. Prioritizing each objective in isolation leads to considerably different spatial planning structures, exposing conflicts between many objectives. These include tradeoffs between urban heat risk and transport emissions; and also previously undocumented conflicts between minimizing flood and heat risks. Allowing greater flexibility in development density is shown to provide benefits in terms of heat risk reduction, whilst not significantly affecting mitigation objectives. The framework is shown to significantly improve upon the London Spatial Development Strategy for the objectives analyzed. Further analysis identifies optimal spatial strategies to achieve a Low Carbon, Low Risk or Low Density city - however, these cannot be simultaneously maximized. This work shows there are difficult, and often irreconcilable, choices to be made in the spatial planning of sustainable cities. Spatial search and optimization tools strengthen the evidence-base for planning. Rapid identification of development strategies that satisfy, and minimize conflicts between, multiple objectives helps planners to develop strategies that simultaneously improve urban sustainability and reduce the risks from natural hazards. © 2019 The Authors","Climate risk; Greenhouse gas emissions; Optimization; Spatial planning; Tradeoffs; Urban sustainability","carbon emission; greenhouse gas; greenspace; optimization; spatial planning; sustainable development; trade-off; urban area; England; London [England]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062844697

Furthermore, transportation is one of the major sources of energy consumption and air pollution emissions. For this reason, this paper estimated CO2 emissions by the bottom-up method, and presented spatiotemporal patterns by spatial autocorrelation methods from transportation during the period 2006 to 2016. It further analyzed the impact factors of CO2 emissions in the Pearl River Delta by the Logarithmic Mean Divisa Index (LMDI) decomposition method. The results indicated that from 2006 to 2016, total CO2 emissions increased year by year. Guangzhou and Shenzhen were the major contributors to regional transportation CO2 emissions. From the perspective of different transport modes, intercity passenger transport and freight transport have always been dominant in the past 11 years. The results indicated that aviation transport was the largest contributor, and that travel by road was the second one. The CO2 emissions generated by rail and water transport were much lower than those from aviation. Private cars became the main source of urban passenger transport CO2 emissions, and their advantages kept increasing. The results indicated that the spatial agglomeration trend feature was negatively correlated, and the further the distance, the more similar the attributes. The cumulative contribution values of population, economic development, transport intensity, energy intensity and energy structure were all positive values, while the cumulative contribution values of transport structure and emission factor were negative. The findings of this study offer help for the scientific understanding of those CO2 emissions from transportation, and for adopting effective measures to reduce CO2 emissions and for the development of green transportation. © 2019 by the authors.","CO2 emissions; Influencing factors; LMDI Method; Pearl River Delta; Transportation","Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Freight transportation; Gems; River pollution; Rivers; Transportation; CO2 emissions; Decomposition analysis; Influencing factors; LMDI Method; Pearl River delta; Regional transportation; Spatial autocorrelation methods; Spatiotemporal patterns; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067408677

However, exposure during sleep may be significant in the long-term to the integrated individual exposure. This study aimed to assess the exposure during sleep, focusing on a multi-pollutant approach (comfort parameters, carbon dioxide – CO2, carbon monoxide – CO, formaldehyde (CH2O), total volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter – PM2.5 and PM10 – and ultrafine particles, particle number concentrations – PNC - and lung deposited surface area - LDSA). For that, the air quality during sleep (in real conditions) was monitored using real-time devices in 12 bedrooms of urban (Lisbon and Vila Franca de Xira) and rural (Ponte de Sor) areas of Portugal for one night. Volunteers were smokers and non-smokers. Considering the Portuguese legislation for indoor air quality (IAQ), 67% of the bedrooms registered CO2 levels above the limit value, while CH2O, VOC, PM10 and PM2.5 thresholds were exceeded in 30, 100, 36, and 45% of cases, respectively. Regarding ultrafine parameters, LDSA and PNC ranged from 7.3 to 95.2 μm2/cm3 and from 0.6 to 4.8 × 103/cm3, respectively. Even with no smoking indoors, smokers’ bedrooms were found to have significant higher levels of CO, CH2O, PM2.5, PM10 and LDSA than non-smokers’ bedrooms, showing the effect of thirdhand smoke, exhalation of pollutants after smoking and infiltration on the degradation of the air quality in the bedroom. A recent new model of real-time monitor was also used for a wide set of IAQ parameters. Its performance to measure PM2.5 and CO2 was assessed, showing its applicability in real conditions. Although often neglected, these micro-environments should be considered in the integrated individual exposure to air pollutants and further studied. Main findings of the work: Several pollutants (CO2, PM, VOCs and CH2O) exceeded the guidelines during sleep; smokers are exposed to higher levels of CO, CH2O, PM, and LDSA than non-smokers while sleeping. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Exposure; Indoor air quality; Sleep; Smoking; Ultrafine particles","Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Sleep research; Smoke; Volatile organic compounds; Exposure; Indoor air quality; Sleep; Smoking; Ultrafine particle; Indoor air pollution; carbon monoxide; formaldehyde; volatile organic compound; carbon dioxide; formaldehyde; volatile organic compound; air quality; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; comparative study; formaldehyde; indoor air; particulate matter; pollution exposure; sleep; smoking; volatile organic compound; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; Article; comparative study; environmental exposure; environmental impact assessment; environmental temperature; exhalation; human; humidity; lung deposited surface area; nonsmoker; particle size; particulate matter; passive smoking; Portuguese (citizen); respiratory tract parameters; sleep; sleep quality; smoking; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; environmental monitoring; indoor air pollution; Portugal; smoking; statistics and numerical data; Lisboa [Portugal]; Lisbon; Portugal; Vila Franca de Xira; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Air Pollution, Indoor; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Monoxide; Environmental Monitoring; Formaldehyde; Humans; Non-Smokers; Particulate Matter; Portugal; Smokers; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063323543

The Two-tailed Pasha, Charaxes jasius (Linnaeus, 1767), is a Mediterranean butterfly with only sporadic historical records in Madrid, Spain's most central province, where the host plant is uncommon and winters are colder than in most parts of the butterfly's range. We show the first evidence of juvenile stages of the species in two towns of north-central Madrid and compile records of C. jasius from Madrid over the past four decades. Our results suggest that, in the absence of widespread host plants, C. jasius is using suburban ornamental plantings of its host plant to colonise a region which may be becoming more climatically suitable. © 2019 Pensoft Publishers.

GLIDER consists in the deployment of 3 ocean autonomous and mobile platforms, a Sea glider (Kongsberg), a Sailbuoy (Offshore Sensing) and a Wave Glider (Maritime Robotics), fitted with a well proven suite of sensors to collect chemical, physical and biological data of the ocean space. The aim is to increase the sampling of high quality marine environmental data and provide more flexible sampling schemes. These state-of-the-art platforms can move in space, provide long-term and real-time monitoring, and in addition reduce costs and CO2 emission compared to other traditional measurement approaches. A data management e-platform has been developed along with scientists and consultants to ensure a high integration of the collected data. The e-platform will allow to manage the data from storage approach, to visualization tools, and finally to allow interpretation and use for different end users. We have successfully deployed the three vehicles fitted with sensors from March to September 2018 in the Lofoten - Vesterålen area along the Norwegian coast above the Arctic circle (67°16'48″N 14°24'00″E ) with the objective to get a better understanding of the ecosystem during the spawning period of the Atlantic cod. The data collected revealed that the autonomous vehicles provide scientific information of a completely undisturbed ecosystem unlike what is collected from traditional research vessels from which instruments are deployed. The survey provided significant gain on the understanding on the dynamic and timing of biological events over large spatial and temporal scale. Furthermore, we have successfully assimilated data in real time into oceanographic model in order to improve the forecast. Currently, data are being analyzed to understand the ecosystem from the primary production to zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish and sea mammals. Analysis will offer i) baseline data on a large spatial scale ii) professional solutions to industry operating in the marine environment iii) scientific data for improving knowledge in ecosystem functioning and structure and iv) input data into existing models (oceanography, weather and ecology). © 2019 IEEE.","e-data platform; Gliders; marine ecosystem; ocean modelling; Sensors","Arctic vehicles; Data visualization; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Fish; Forestry; Mammals; Marine industry; Oceanography; Offshore oil well production; Ships; Space platforms; Ecosystem functioning; Large spatial scale; Marine environmental datum; Oceanographic models; Offshore monitoring; Real time monitoring; Scientific information; Underwater vehicles; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081207685

In the paper, the method, the data sources, a conceptual foundation for the data analysis, and an application in a spatial pattern analysis of CO2 emission for China are described. For the development of CHRED 2.0, the strict control of data quality and computing processes plays an important role in providing accurate data, highlightting the characteristics of high accuracy, direct verification, and indirect validation of essential data, mature and reliable mapping methods, and the precise spatial location of longitudinal and latitudinal data. The trial application of the China High Resolution Emission Gridded Data Version 2.0 proves its superiority in terms of reliability and suitability at the macro scale as well as at provincial-, city-, prefecture- and county-level CO2 emission estimations, spatial distribution analysis, and emission reduction plan making. The system is superior because the high-definition accuracy can split emissions between neighbor provinces, cities or counties, and the emission responsibility can be correctly allocated. Thus, the emission reduction plan and countermeasure can be established and taken in an environmentally rational and viable way. © 2019 ISEIS All rights reserved.","Carbon dioxide; China; CHRED 2.0; Emission; Fine resolution gridded data","carbon emission; census; data acquisition; data quality; database; emission control; mapping method; model validation; policy making; spatial analysis; spatial resolution; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066927098

In this paper, we argue that the role of discourses has been overlooked in the literature on carbon lock-in. We argue that discourses are both part of lock-in mechanisms and, using the concept of discursive turning points, important factors in explaining change. This implies that we need to carefully investigate the dominant discourses that constitute and justify the very technologies, institutions and behaviors of the status quo. For the case of the German energy transition, we demonstrate the importance of discursive turning points for overcoming carbon lock-in, based on a literature review. Germany's long-standing lock-in of fossil fuels and nuclear power was undermined by the rise of the energy transition discourse. This discourse transitioned from a very marginal position to dominance through a number of factors, winning against the energy mix discourse. Over time the energy transition discourse became de-radicalized. Coal has been able to defend its role in the German energy mix in the name of affordability and energy security. While renewables continue to grow, this happens alongside a remaining carbon lock-in. We conclude that discursive lock-in and discursive turning points are useful analytical tools that help to explain how the transition to renewable energies unfolds. In future research, the interaction between discursive lock-ins and other types of lock-in should be investigated.

Oaks are known for limited barriers to gene flow among closely related species. Here, we use Quercus as a living laboratory in which to pursue a fundamental question in plant evolution: Do environmental gradients restrict or promote genetic exchange between species?. Methods: We focused on two North American oaks, the rare Quercus dumosa and the widespread Q. berberidifolia. We sampled intensively along a contact zone in California, USA. We sequenced restriction site-associated DNA markers and measured vegetative phenotype. We tested for genetic exchange, the association with climate, and the effect on phenotype. Results: There is evidence for genetic exchange between the species. Admixed plants are found in areas of intermediate climate, while less admixed plants are found at the extremes of the climatic gradient. Genetic and phenotypic patterns are out of phase in the contact zone; some plants display the phenotype of one species but are genetically associated with another. Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that a strong climatic gradient can promote genetic exchange between species. The overall weak correlation between genotype and phenotype in the contact zone between the species suggests that genetic exchange can lead to the breakdown of trait combinations used to define species. This incongruency predicts ongoing problems for conservation of Q. dumosa, with implications for conservation of other oaks. © 2019 Botanical Society of America","climate; drought; genomic; hybridization; phenotype; population; RADseq; rare","climate change; deciduous tree; drought; environmental conditions; gene flow; genetic analysis; genetic marker; genomics; hybridization; phenotype; rare species; California; United States; Quercus; Quercus berberidifolia; Quercus dumosa; California; climate; gene flow; genetic marker; genetics; hybridization; oak; California; Climate; Gene Flow; Genetic Markers; Hybridization, Genetic; Quercus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067623468

In recognition of this, Section 72 of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, requires Local Development Plans (LDPs) to include policies to ensure ‘that all new buildings avoid a specified and rising proportion of the projected greenhouse gas emissions from their use, calculated on the basis of the approved design and plans for the specific development, through the installation and operation of LZCGT's.’ This study utilises data collected from 5 Scottish Local Authorities who were early adopters of this policy and examines LZCGT uptake in a randomly selected sample of new domestic buildings and the impact the use of these technologies have on CO2 emission reduction.

Open-path analyzer design allows such measurements with power consumption 10–150 times below present closed-path technologies, helping to considerably expand the global coverage and improve the estimates of gas emissions and budgets, informing the remote sensing and modeling communities and policy decisions, all the way to IPCC reports. Broad-band nondispersive infrared devices have been used for open-path CO 2 and H 2 O measurements since the late 1970s, but since recently, a growing number of new narrow-band laser-based instruments are being rapidly developed. The new design comes with its own challenges, specifically: (a) mirror contamination, and (b) uncontrolled air temperature, pressure and humidity, affecting both the gas density and the laser spectroscopy of the measurements. While the contamination can be addressed via automated cleaning, and density effects can be addressed via the Webb-Pearman-Leuning approach, the spectroscopic effects of the in situ temperature, pressure and humidity fluctuations on laser-measured densities remain a standing methodological question. Here we propose a concept accounting for such effects in the same manner as Webb et al. proposed to account for respective density effects. Derivations are provided for a general case of flux of any gas, examined using a specific example of CH 4 fluxes from a commercially available analyzer, and then tested using “zero-flux” experiment. The proposed approach helps reduce errors in open-path, enclosed, and temperature- or pressure-uncontrolled closed-path laser-based flux measurements due to the spectroscopic effects from few percents to multiple folds, leading to methodological advancement and geographical expansion of the use of such systems providing reliable and consistent results for process-level studies, remote sensing and Earth modeling applications, and GHG policy decision-making. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","CH 4; CO 2; eddy covariance; flux; GHG; laser; N 2 O; NH 3; O 3; open-path; spectroscopic effects","ammonia; carbon dioxide; eddy covariance; flux measurement; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrous oxide; ozone; spectroscopy; trace gas; carbon dioxide; nitrous oxide; analysis; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; gas; humidity; laser; procedures; spectroscopy; temperature; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Gases; Humidity; Lasers; Nitrous Oxide; Spectrum Analysis; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064690747

As a consequence of EU Directives setting mandatory renewable energy targets up to 2020, member states are boosting renewable energy and bioenergy production. The use of wood biomass for bioenergy production can entail important benefits, including improved energy security due to a smaller dependence on fossil fuel supply, mitigation of climate impact, and revitalization of rural economies connected to new job opportunities. Nevertheless, bioenergy production also involves environmental and socio-economic concerns. The environmental, economic, and social sustainability of bioenergy production needs to be assessed through a set of multicriteria indicators. In this study, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was used to explore the environmental performance of bioenergy production in an Alpine area of Northern Italy. In particular, the environmental impacts of a wood-based bioenergy plant utilizing local residues from wood industries and forestry operations were investigated. The amount of CO 2 -eq emissions (0.25 kg CO 2 -eq kWh −1 ) and the fossil demand (0.09 kg oil-eq kWh −1 ) calculated for the investigated bioenergy plant resulted lower than the values characterizing fossil fuels-based power plants. Yet, the environmental performance of the investigated bioenergy plant was affected by the consumption of methane, still used in the plant to cover peak loads. The results showed that the use of local wood biomass in the investigated Alpine area is a desirable option for recycling wood residues while supporting heat and electricity production. The findings of this study can support local managers and policy makers committed to plan and implement renewable energy strategies and circular economy patterns. In addition, they can be useful to assess the potential upscale of this bioenergy option at regional and national level considering the availability of wood residues (from forestry and industrial sector) while verifying possible operational constraints at larger scales. Future studies could also integrate environmental accounting with other assessment methods exploring the economic profitability and social desirability of wood-based bioenergy production in mountain areas characterized by low population density and large forest cover. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Environmental accounting; Environmental performance; Wood biomass","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Economics; Energy policy; Energy security; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Forestry; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Population statistics; Sustainable development; Timber; Bio-energy; Environmental accountings; Environmental performance; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mandatory renewable energy targets; Operational constraints; Renewable energy strategies; Wood biomass; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062687537

The impact of ship power models on marine emissions inventories has garnered little attention, with most inventories employing simple, load-factor-based models to estimate ship power consumption. The availability of more expansive ship activity data provides the opportunity to investigate the inventory impacts of adopting complex power models. Furthermore, ship parameter fields can be sparsely populated in ship registries, making gap-filling techniques and averaging processes necessary. Therefore, it is important to understand of the impact of averaged ship parameters on ship power and emission estimations. This paper examines power estimation differences between results from two complex, resistance-based and two simple, load-factor-based power models on a baseline inventory with unique ship parameters. These models are additionally analyzed according to their sensitivities toward average ship parameters. Automated Identification System (AIS) data from a fleet of commercial marine vessels operating over a 6-month period off the coast of the southwestern United States form the basis of the analysis. To assess the inventory impacts of using averaged ship parameters, fleet-level carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are calculated using ship parameter data averaged across ship types and their subtype size classes. Each of the four ship power models are used to generate four CO2 emissions inventories, and results are compared with baseline estimates for the same sample fleet where no averaged values were used. The results suggest that a change in power model has a relatively high impact on emission estimates. They also indicate relatively little sensitivity, by all power models, to the use of ship characteristics averaged by ship and subtype. Implications: Commercial marine vessel emissions inventories were calculated using four different models for ship engine power. The calculations used 6 months of Automated Identification System (AIS) data from a sample of 248 vessels as input data. The results show that more detailed, resistance-based models tend to estimate a lower propulsive power, and thus lower emissions, for ships than traditional load-factor-based models. Additionally, it was observed that emission calculations using averaged values for physical ship parameters had a minimal impact on the resulting emissions inventories. ©, This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

The mining and processing of bitumen to produce synthetic crude oil, and the waste products associated with this activity, lead to significant emissions of gaseous and particle air pollutants. Deposition of pollutants occurs locally (i.e., near the sources) and also potentially at distances downwind, depending upon each pollutant’s chemical and physical properties and meteorological conditions. The Joint Oil Sands Monitoring Program (JOSM) was initiated in 2012 by the Government of Canada and the Province of Alberta to enhance or improve monitoring of pollutants and their potential impacts. In support of JOSM, Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) undertook a significant research effort via three components: the Air, Water, and Wildlife components, which were implemented to better estimate baseline conditions related to levels of pollutants in the air and water, amounts of deposition, and exposures experienced by the biota. The criteria air contaminants (e.g., nitrogen oxides [NOx], sulfur dioxide [SO2], volatile organic compounds [VOCs], particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter &lt;2.5 μm [PM2.5]) and their secondary atmospheric products were of interest, as well as toxic compounds, particularly polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), trace metals, and mercury (Hg). This critical review discusses the challenges of assessing ecosystem impacts and summarizes the major results of these efforts through approximately 2018. Focus is on the emissions to the air and the findings from the Air Component of the ECCC research and linkages to observations of contaminant levels in the surface waters in the region, in aquatic species, as well as in terrestrial and avian species. The existing evidence of impact on these species is briefly discussed, as is the potential for some of them to serve as sentinel species for the ongoing monitoring needed to better understand potential effects, their potential causes, and to detect future changes. Quantification of the atmospheric emissions of multiple pollutants needs to be improved, as does an understanding of the processes influencing fugitive emissions and local and regional deposition patterns. The influence of multiple stressors on biota exposure and response, from natural bitumen and forest fires to climate change, complicates the current ability to attribute effects to air emissions from the industry. However, there is growing evidence of the impact of current levels of PACs on some species, pointing to the need to improve the ability to predict PAC exposures and the key emission source involved. Although this critical review attempts to integrate some of the findings across the components, in terms of ECCC activities, increased coordination or integration of air, water, and wildlife research would enhance deeper scientific understanding. Improved understanding is needed in order to guide the development of long-term monitoring strategies that could most efficiently inform a future adaptive management approach to oil sands environmental monitoring and prevention of impacts. Implications: Quantification of atmospheric emissions for multiple pollutants needs to be improved, and reporting mechanisms and standards could be adapted to facilitate such improvements, including periodic validation, particularly where uncertainties are the largest. Understanding of baseline conditions in the air, water and biota has improved significantly; ongoing enhanced monitoring, building on this progress, will help improve ecosystem protection measures in the oil sands region. Sentinel species have been identified that could be used to identify and characterize potential impacts of wildlife exposure, both locally and regionally. Polycyclic aromatic compounds are identified as having an impact on aquatic and terrestrial wildlife at current concentration levels although the significance of these impacts and attribution to emissions from oil sands development requires further assessment. Given the improvement in high resolution air quality prediction models, these should be a valuable tool to future environmental assessments and cumulative environment impact assessments. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Under the framework of the RES-Directive, EU Member States have adopted national renewable energy action plans including sectorial targets for electricity, heating and cooling, and transport. While the RES-Directive outlines the methodology for calculating the renewable energy shares for electricity, heating and transport, it does not offer any indications on how to account for renewable cooling. Due to the lacking methodological guidelines, Member States can currently not report renewable cooling and cooling does therefore not play a role for target achievement. At the same time, the energy demand for cooling is growing rapidly and the inclusion of renewable cooling can potentially have a large impact on the renewable energy shares that Member States report. Based on an overview of available cooling technologies, this article explores various strategies for including cooling in the RES-Directive and investigates the impact on target achievement. We find that the potential impact of including cooling is considerable and conclude that ambitious minimum efficiency requirements are needed in order to maintain the ambition of the RES-Directive and to stimulate the development of policies to support low-carbon cooling technologies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cooling technologies; Heating and cooling; Renewable cooling; Renewable Energy Directive","Public policy; Cooling technology; Efficiency requirements; Heating and cooling; Methodological guidelines; Policy framework; Policy implications; Potential impacts; Renewable energies; Cooling; alternative energy; cooling; demand analysis; energy policy; European Union; policy development; strategic approach; technology adoption; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061575910

The German Sustainable Building Council (DGNB) is striving to make a significant contribution to the achievement of the national targets defined in the Paris Agreement in order to limit global warming to well below 2°C. The key to achieving these targets for the building sector lies in fostering climate neutral operation of new construction and, even more challenging, in realizing a carbon neutral building stock by 2050. With the discussion paper for a new format of the German Energy Code ""GEG 2050"" claiming the introduction of a ""Building Emissions Law 2050"", DGNB has started a much-needed debate on shifting the focus of performance metrics from ""primary energy demand"" to ""CO2-emissions"". In order to translate the requirements into building practice and to make their implementation assessable and measurable, the DGNB has developed a ""Framework for Carbon Neutral Buildings and Sites"", which includes three main parts: 1. Carbon Accounting Rules defining consistent calculation rules for buildings and sites, 2. Carbon Disclosure Rules with specific rules regarding the type and the content of the communication towards the customer and 3. Carbon Management Rules establishing a roadmap to carbon neutral building operation (""Klimaschutzfahrplan"") that demonstrates a net zero carbon balance by latest 2050, using a linear trajectory to zero from today onwards.

We aim to disentangle spatially the effect of climatological and non-climatological drivers on ecosystem service supply and trends. Therefore, we explored time series of three ecosystem services in Switzerland between 2004 and 2014: carbon dioxide regulation, soil erosion prevention, and air quality regulation. We applied additive models to describe the spatial variation attributed to climatological (i.e., temperature, precipitation and relative sunshine duration) and non-climatological drivers (i.e., random effects representing other spatially structured processes) that may affect ecosystem service change. Obtained results indicated strong influences of climatological drivers on ecosystem service trends in Switzerland. We identified equal contributions of all three climatological drivers on trends of carbon dioxide regulation and soil erosion prevention, while air quality regulation was more strongly influenced by temperature. Additionally, our results showed that climatological and non-climatological drivers affected ecosystem services both negatively and positively, depending on the regions (in particular lower and higher altitudinal areas), drivers, and services assessed. Our findings highlight stronger effects of climatological compared to non-climatological drivers on ecosystem service change in Switzerland. Furthermore, drivers of ecosystem change display a spatial heterogeneity in their influence on ecosystem service trends. We propose an approach building on an additive model to disentangle the effect of climatological and non-climatological drivers on ecosystem service trends. Such analyses should be extended in the future to ecosystem service flow and demand to complete ecosystem service assessments and to demonstrate and communicate more clearly the benefits of ecosystem services for human well-being. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","climate change; land use change; regulating services; remote sensing; time series; trends","air quality; carbon dioxide; climate change; ecosystem service; heterogeneity; land use change; remote sensing; soil erosion; sustainability; time series; trend analysis; Switzerland; carbon dioxide; biodiversity; ecosystem; environmental protection; human; soil; Switzerland; Biodiversity; Carbon Dioxide; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; Soil; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066627726

This paper aims to advance a relational understanding of scale in the analysis and evaluation of low-carbon urban initiatives (LCUIs). We wish to lay the path towards an innately geographical conceptualisation of low-carbon urban transformations more generally, in which cities are not seen as rigid and passive physical containers for decarbonisation initiatives, but rather as key nodes within vibrant socio-technical networks operating across multiple material sites. Using a case study of the transnational and translocal REACH (Reduce Energy use And Change Habits) project funded by the European Union as illustration, we argue that low-carbon urban transformations are immanently constituted of three sets of relational processes across scale, involving (1) politicisation, (2) enrolment and (3) the hybridisation of human and material agencies.

In Latin America (from Mexico to Chile, including the Caribbean), most of the area in cruciferous crops is devoted to oilseed rape (Brassica napus; c. 230 600 ha) in Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina, while cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli and Brussels sprouts (40 900 ha) are cropped intensively on small acreages across the region. Although clubroot is present in most Latin American countries, there have been very few studies of P. brassicae. Clubroot research in Latin America has focused mainly on adapting disease management strategies developed in temperate climates to tropical climates, including liming, biological control and genetic resistance. This review summarizes the management strategies used in Latin America to reduce the impact of clubroot, including novel strategies when compared with temperate regions, such as a crop rotation with aromatic plant species and the use of biological control with Trichoderma spp. Latin America has unique characteristics relative to temperate countries such as high humidity, warm temperatures and acidic soil that impact the interaction between P. brassicae and its plant hosts, so more research is required. © 2019 British Society for Plant Pathology","biological control; Brassica napus; Brassica oleracea; Brassica rapa; Latin America; management strategies; Plasmodiophora brassicae","biological control; crop rotation; disease control; fungal disease; fungus; herb; host plant; Argentina; Brazil; Chile; Latin America; Mexico [North America]; Paraguay; Uruguay; Brassica napus; Brassica oleracea; Brassica oleracea var. botrytis; Brassica oleracea var. capitata; Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera; Brassica oleracea var. italica; Brassica rapa; Plasmodiophora brassicae; Trichoderma",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063396585

Forecast skill is assessed in terms of correlation, mean square error (MSE) and mean square skill score. The predictability of the forecast system is assessed by calculating the corresponding “potential” skill measures based on the behaviour of the forecast ensemble. The expectation is that potential skill, where the model predicts its own evolution, will be greater than the actual skill, where the model predicts the evolution of the real system, and that the difference is an indication of the potential for forecast improvement. This will depend, however, on the agreement of the second order climate statistics of the forecasts with those of the climate system. In this study the forecast variance differs from the variance of the verifying observations over non-trivial parts of the globe. Observation-based values of variance from different sources also differ non-trivially. This is an area of difficulty independent of the forecasting system and also affects the comparison of actual and potential mean square error. It is possible to scale the forecast variance estimate to match that of the verifying data so as to avoid this consequence but a variance mismatch, whatever its source, remains a difficulty when considering forecast system improvements. Maps of actual and potential correlation indicate that over most of the globe potential correlation is greater than actual correlation, as expected, with the difference suggesting, but not demonstrating, that it might be possible to improve skill. There are exceptions, mainly over some land areas in the Northern Hemisphere and at later forecast ranges, where actual correlation can exceed potential correlation, and this behaviour is ascribed to excessive noise variance in the forecasts, at least as compared to the verifying data. Sampling error can also play a role, but significance testing suggests it is not sufficient to explain the results. Similar results are obtained for MSE but only after scaling the forecasts to match the variance of the verifying observations. It is immediately clear that the forecast system is deficient, independent of other considerations, if the actual correlation is greater than the potential correlation and/or the actual MSE is less than the potential MSE and this gives some indication of the nature of the deficiency in the forecasts in these regions. The predictable and noise components of an ensemble of forecasts can be estimated but this is not the case for the actual system. The degree to which the difference between actual and potential skill indicates the potential for improvement of the forecasting can only be judged indirectly. At a minimum the variances of the forecasts and of the verifying data should be in reasonable accord. If the potential skill is greater than the actual skill for a forecasting system based on a well behaved model it suggests, as a working hypothesis, that forecast skill can be improved so as to more closely approach potential skill. © 2018, © Crown.","Decadal prediction; Potential skill; Predictability; Skill","annual variation; decadal variation; ensemble forecasting; experimental study; prediction; temperature gradient",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053507967

Contrail cirrus radiative forcing is expected to increase significantly over time due to the large projected increases in air traffic. We use ECHAM5-CCMod, an atmospheric climate model with an online contrail cirrus parameterization including a microphysical two-moment scheme, to investigate the climate impact of contrail cirrus for the year 2050.We take into account the predicted increase in air traffic volume, changes in propulsion efficiency and emissions, in particular soot emissions, and the modification of the contrail cirrus climate impact due to anthropogenic climate change. Global contrail cirrus radiative forcing increases by a factor of 3 from 2006 to 2050, reaching 160 or even 180mWm-2, which is the result of the increase in air traffic volume and a slight shift in air traffic towards higher altitudes. Large increases in contrail cirrus radiative forcing are expected over all of the main air traffic areas, but relative increases are largest over main air traffic areas over eastern Asia. The projected upward shift in air traffic attenuates contrail cirrus radiative forcing increases in the midlatitudes but reinforces it in the tropical areas. Climate change has an insignificant impact on global contrail cirrus radiative forcing, while regional changes are significant. Of the emission reductions it is the soot number emission reductions by 50% that lead to a significant decrease in contrail cirrus optical depth and coverage, leading to a decrease in radiative forcing by approximately 15 %. The strong increase in contrail cirrus radiative forcing due to the projected increase in air traffic volume cannot be compensated for by the decrease in initial ice crystal numbers due to reduced soot emissions and improvements in propulsion efficiency. © Author(s) 2019.",,"air traffic; cirrus; climate change; climate modeling; contrail; ice crystal; parameterization; radiative forcing; soot; transportation planning; Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068219797

In this study, demineralised water injection is presented as an alternative to reduce NOx emissions and enhance engine performance. The experimental study firstly presents the droplet size characterisation of a spray nozzle. This is done for varied injection pressure, water temperature and at varied axial and radial locations using an impaction pin nozzle. The single-shaft Artouste engine is used in conducting the compressor water injection test with water-to-air ratios of 0.5, 1 and 2%. The water droplet diameter, engine gas path and exhaust emissions are all monitored in real time. For the engine tests, droplets are measured at the spraying point and correlations are used to account for the droplet size at the inlet of the compressor due to measurement difficulties in this region. The test showed a reduction in compressor discharge temperature by up to 34 K and a NOx decrease by 25%. Nevertheless, the higher reductions in NOx at higher water-to-air ratios are attributed to a predominant cooling in the combustor because of unevaporated water in the compressor. At 0.5% water-to-air ratio, the drop in NOx is mainly due to compressor cooling and signified by the only case in which the fuel-to-air ratio reduces. The study presents evidence of the combined effects of compressor and combustor water ingestion. The CO is seen to increase significantly and associated with reduced combustor efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Combustor; Compressor; Engine experiment; NOx; Water injection","Combustors; Compressibility of gases; Compressors; Drops; Emission control; Exhaust gases; Gas compressors; Gas emissions; Gas turbines; Hydraulic turbines; Nitrogen oxides; Petroleum prospecting; Spray nozzles; Tourism industry; Combustor efficiency; Demineralised water; Discharge temperature; Experimental investigations; Gas turbine compressors; Impaction-pin nozzles; Injection pressures; Water injection tests; Water injection; emission control; engine; experimental study; instrumentation; nitrous oxide; turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063899095

In order to reduce this sulfation, Graphitized Carbon Nanofibers (GANFg) at 0.10% and two types of Organic Expanders (OEs) were used as additives for the negative plates. These fibers were previously dispersed with a certain amount of OEs. Five mixtures were selected, and the corresponding negative plates were prepared. 2 V / 1 Ah cells were assembled and tested, together with the physicochemical properties of the plates. During the formation of the cells, GANFg are thought to be integrated into the NAM skeleton where would improve the NAM energetic structure. As a result, the use of GANFg slightly enhanced the capacity and the cold cranking ability, although this last one was essentially dominated by the OEs concentration. A lower OEs concentration led to higher charge acceptance, and the use of GANFg involved a higher water loss. However, the water loss rate was considered low in comparison with other carbon materials.

A climate index is a simple diagnostic quantity that can be used to characterize integral aspects of a geophysical system such as circulation patterns, and thus can be used to evaluate decadal forecasts. One of the most studied and well documented regions of the World Ocean is the North Atlantic. The North Atlantic subpolar gyre is an important region for the modulation of European climate and where skillful predictions of up to a decade can be obtained. Ocean re-analysis (ORA-S4) data from 1959 to 2017 are used to introduce a new methodology to compute a climate index of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre that captures both the variability in its strength and shape, the latter was to our knowledge never investigated previously as part of the variability of the gyre on interannual to decadal time scales. The methodology reveals two states of the gyre (before and after 2000), the former is mainly driven by temperature and the latter by a combination of mechanisms that interact to sustain a relatively stable subpolar gyre in terms of strength. © 2019.

We report a mechanochemical strategy to selectively convert methane to chloromethane under overall benign conditions, employing trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) as a cheap and noncorrosive solid chlorinating agent. TCCA is shown to release active chlorine species upon milling with Lewis acids such as alumina and ceria to functionalize methane at moderate temperatures (&lt;150 °C). A thorough parameter optimization led to a maximum methane chlorination rate of 0.8 μmol(CH4,conv) (g(catalyst) s)-1. Findings were compared to the thermal reaction of methane with TCCA and evidenced that mechanochemical activation permitted significantly lower reaction temperatures (90 vs 200 °C) at a drastically improved CH3Cl selectivity (95% vs 66% at 30% conversion). Considering the characterization of the interaction between TCCA and Lewis acids as well as the in-depth analysis of byproducts, we suggest a plausible reaction mechanism and a possible regeneration of the chlorinating agent. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Cerium oxide; Chemical activation; Chlorination; Chlorine compounds; Chlorinating agents; Corrosive conditions; Lower reaction temperature; Mechano-chemical activation; Moderate temperature; Parameter optimization; Reaction mechanism; Trichloro-isocyanuric acids; Methane; aluminum oxide; cerium oxide; chemical compound; Lewis acid; methane; methyl chloride; trichloroisocyanuric acid; unclassified drug; Article; catalyst; chemical interaction; chemical reaction; chlorination; controlled study; mechanochemical activation; radical reaction; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070025272

The analysis showed that the main factors supporting the distribution of innovative technology and public support are legislative and regulative framework as well as clear strategic planning and cooperation between local administrations and transportation authorities. Other important aspects, such as network building features, and the location of the charging infrastructure were also discussed.

Our model considers T=0K and that, as a consequence of the presence of the confinement, the electron bands unfold in a subband system. In addition, the expressions that describe the differential cross-section and the selection rules for the emission spectra are shown. On the other hand, the net gain of Raman is studied through the transition rate, since they are directly proportional.

We suggest a framework for guiding climate change adaptation action concerning flood risk and manageability in cities. The identified key drivers of changing flood hazard and vulnerability are used to provide an overview of each driver's impact on flood risk and manageability at the city level. We find that identified drivers for urban flood risk can be grouped in three different priority areas with different time horizon. The first group has high impact but is manageable at city level. Typical drivers in this group are related to the physical environment such as decreasing permeability and unresponsive engineering. The second group of drivers is represented by public awareness and individual willingness to participate and urbanization and urban sprawl. These drivers may be important and are manageable for the cities and they involve both short-term and long-term measures. The third group of drivers is related to policy and long-term changes. This group is represented by economic growth and increasing values at risk, climate change, and increasing complexity of society. They have all high impact but low manageability. Managing these drivers needs to be done in a longer time perspective, e.g., by developing long-term policies and exchange of ideas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Urban flood management; Urban flood risk","climate change; economic growth; flood; hazard assessment; participatory approach; permeability; risk assessment; urban area; vulnerability; article; awareness; city; climate change; driver; economic development; human; urbanization; environment; flooding; Cities; Climate Change; Environment; Floods; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063979518

However, because of a lack of spectrally resolved measurements, radiation schemes in climate models suffer from a lack of constraint across this spectral range. Exploiting a method developed to estimate upwelling far-infrared radiation from mid-infrared (MIR: cm-1) observations, we explore the possibility of inferring zenith FIR downwelling radiances in zenith-looking observation geometry, focusing on clear-sky conditions in Antarctica. The methodology selects a MIR predictor wavenumber for each FIR wavenumber based on the maximum correlation seen between the different spectral ranges. Observations from the REFIR-PAD instrument (Radiation Explorer in the Far Infrared - Prototype for Application and Development) and high-resolution radiance simulations generated from co-located radio soundings are used to develop and assess the method. We highlight the impact of noise on the correlation between MIR and FIR radiances by comparing the observational and theoretical cases. Using the observed values in isolation, between 150 and 360&thinsp;cm-1, differences between the ""true"" and ""extended"" radiances are less than 5&thinsp;%. However, in spectral bands of low signal, between 360 and 667&thinsp;cm-1, the impact of instrument noise is strong and increases the differences seen. When the extension of the observed spectra is performed using regression coefficients based on noise-free radiative transfer simulations the results show strong biases, exceeding 100&thinsp;% where the signal is low. These biases are reduced to just a few percent if the noise in the observations is accounted for in the simulation procedure. Our results imply that while it is feasible to use this type of approach to extend mid-infrared spectral measurements to the far-infrared, the quality of the extension will be strongly dependent on the noise characteristics of the observations. A good knowledge of the atmospheric state associated with the measurements is also required in order to build a representative regression model.. © Author(s) 2019.",,"clear sky; climate modeling; correlation; energy budget; infrared radiation; radiative transfer; regression analysis; Antarctica; Abies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067257781

With a combined global population of about 2.7 × 1028 cells, they numerically dominate bacterioplankton communities in oligotrophic ocean gyres and yet they have never been grown together in vitro. Here we describe co-cultures of Prochlorococcus and SAR11 isolates representing both high- and low-light adapted clades. We examined: (1) the influence of Prochlorococcus on the growth of SAR11 and vice-versa, (2) whether Prochlorococcus can meet specific nutrient requirements of SAR11, and (3) how co-culture dynamics vary when Prochlorococcus is grown with SAR11 compared with sympatric copiotrophic bacteria. SAR11 grew 15–70% faster in co-culture with Prochlorococcus, while the growth of the latter was unaffected. When Prochlorococcus populations entered stationary phase, this commensal relationship rapidly became amensal, as SAR11 abundances decreased dramatically. In parallel experiments with copiotrophic bacteria; however, the heterotrophic partner increased in abundance as Prochlorococcus densities leveled off. The presence of Prochlorococcus was able to meet SAR11’s central requirement for organic carbon, but not reduced sulfur. Prochlorococcus strain MIT9313, but not MED4, could meet the unique glycine requirement of SAR11, which could be due to the production and release of glycine betaine by MIT9313, as supported by comparative genomic evidence. Our findings also suggest, but do not confirm, that Prochlorococcus MIT9313 may compete with SAR11 for the uptake of 3-dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). To give our results an ecological context, we assessed the relative contribution of Prochlorococcus and SAR11 genome equivalents to those of identifiable bacteria and archaea in over 800 marine metagenomes. At many locations, more than half of the identifiable genome equivalents in the euphotic zone belonged to Prochlorococcus and SAR11 – highlighting the biogeochemical potential of these two groups. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"abundance; adaptation; bacterioplankton; bacterium; biogeography; cell; euphotic zone; genome; genomics; microbial community; oligotrophic environment; Prochlorococcus; dimethylpropiothetin; sea water; sulfonium derivative; Alphaproteobacteria; coculture; genetics; growth, development and aging; heterotrophy; metabolism; microbiology; Prochlorococcus; Alphaproteobacteria; Coculture Techniques; Heterotrophic Processes; Prochlorococcus; Seawater; Sulfonium Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061397196

Among the different human activities, agriculture is most affected by climate change which has been established by various studies at global and regional levels. It imposes serious constraints on the crop production which leads to changes in cropping pattern in general and in mountainous regions of the world in particular. In this regard, the present study aims to analyse the impact of rainfall variability on crop productivity and changes in cropping pattern in the north-western Himalayas. Mann–Kendall and Sen slope analyses were done to detect the changing trends in rainfall, whereas correlation coefficient was used to analyse the influence of rainfall variability on crop yield and the changing cropping pattern. The results indicate that rainfall has shown a decreasing trend from last few decades and has led to changes in the crop yield/production and cropping pattern in the region. Further, it was observed that crops in the region have shown different associations with rainfall, and as a result, area under some crops has increased while under certain other crops it has witnessed a contraction. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate change; Correlation coefficient; Crop production; Cropping pattern; Mann–Kendall; Sen slope analysis","Agricultural robots; Crops; Cultivation; Rain; Correlation coefficient; Crop productivity; Cropping patterns; Human activities; Mountainous regions; Rainfall variability; Regional levels; Western himalayas; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084672051

Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopted a data journeys approach to research design, conducting in-depth semi-structured interviews with climate scientists, citizen scientists and a climate historian who were engaged at key sites across the journey of data from historical record to the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set database. Interview data were complemented by further qualitative data collected via observations of working practices, a digital ethnography of citizen scientists’ online forums, and documentation relevant to the circulation and governance of climate data across emergent data infrastructures. Data were thematically analysed (Ryan and Bernard, 2003), with themes being informed primarily by the theoretical framework. Findings: The authors identify and critically examine key points of friction in the constitution of the data recovery infrastructure and the circulation of data through it, and identify the reflexive and adaptive nature of the beliefs and practices fostered by influential actors within the assemblage in order to progress efforts to build an infrastructure despite significant challenges. The authors conclude by addressing possible limitations of some of these adaptive practices within the context of the early twenty-first century neoliberal state, and in light of current debates about data justice.

This is particularly true for zoonotic diseases that infect humans, agricultural animals, and wildlife. Within the subset of zoonoses, vector-borne pathogens are changing more rapidly with climate change, and have a complex epidemiology, which may allow them to take advantage of a changing environment. Most mosquito-borne infectious diseases are transmitted by mosquitoes in three genera: Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex, and the expansion of these genera is well documented. There is an urgent need to study vector-borne diseases in response to climate change and to produce a generalizable approach capable of generating risk maps and forecasting outbreaks. Here, we provide a strategy for coupling climate and epidemiological models for zoonotic infectious diseases. We discuss the complexity and challenges of data and model fusion, baseline requirements for data, and animal and human population movement. Disease forecasting needs significant investment to build the infrastructure necessary to collect data about the environment, vectors, and hosts at all spatial and temporal resolutions. These investments can contribute to building a modeling community around the globe to support public health officials so as to reduce disease burden through forecasts with quantified uncertainty. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Epidemiology; Infectious disease; Mosquito; Range expansion; Vector-borne; Zoonotic","African horse sickness virus; animal disease; Banna virus; Bluetongue orbivirus; Chikungunya virus; civil servant; climate change; data collection method; Dengue virus; Dirofilaria; disease burden; disease control; Eastern equine encephalitis virus; environmental change; epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus; Flaviviridae; human; incidence; Indiana vesiculovirus; Japanese encephalitis virus; Lumpy skin disease virus; mathematical model; Mayaro virus; mosquito vector; Murray Valley encephalitis virus; nonhuman; O nyong nyong virus; Oropouche virus; Plasmodium malariae; population research; prediction; Reoviridae; Review; Rift Valley fever virus; Schmallenberg virus; Spondweni virus; St. Louis encephalitis virus; Trypanosoma brucei brucei; Trypanosoma evansi; Usutu virus; vector borne disease; Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus; Vesiculovirus; West Nile virus; Western equine encephalitis virus; Yellow fever virus; Zika virus",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067028419

Our aim was to estimate exposure to particulate air pollution (PM2.5) and health effects from shipping in countries around the Baltic Sea, as well as effects of the sulfur regulations for fuels enforced in 2015 by the Baltic Sulfur Emission Control Area (SECA). Yearly PM2.5 emissions, from ship activity data and emission inventories in 2014 and 2016, were estimated. Concentrations and population exposure (0.1° X 0.1°) of PM2.5 were estimated from a chemical transport mode, meteorology, and population density. Excess mortality and morbidity were estimated using established exposure-response (ER) functions. Estimated mean PM2.5 per inhabitant from Baltic shipping was 0.22 µg/m3 in 2014 in ten countries, highest in Denmark (0.57 µg/m3). For the ER function with the steepest slope, the number of estimated extra premature deaths was 3413 in total, highest in Germany and lowest in Norway. It decreased by about 35% in 2016 (after SECA), a reduction of &gt;1000 cases. In addition, 1500 non-fatal cases of ischemic heart disease and 1500 non-fatal cases of stroke in 2014 caused by Baltic shipping emissions were reduced by the same extent in 2016. In conclusion, PM2.5 emissions from Baltic shipping, and resulting health impacts decreased substantially after the SECA regulations in 2015. © 2019 by the authors.

Increasing the NG mole fraction in the blend from 0.0 to 1.0 decreased the effective Schmidt number from 1.4 to 0.7 thus displacing the flame envelope into higher velocity regions such that the corresponding decrease in residence time caused NOx reduction by 46%. While the prompt NOx increased by 11%, there was an additional NOx reduction by 238% due to the residence time decrease pertaining to the density/velocity difference. Conversely, increasing the LPG mole fraction from 0.0 up to 1.0 extended the flame stability limit from 8.2 to 12.7 m/s whereby the residence time decrease caused NOx reduction by 49%. Furthermore, the peak temperature reduction by the flame increased soot-radiation additionally caused exponential NOx reduction. The NG optimum mole fraction in the blend for reaching minimum NOx emissions of about 0.035 g/kW hr in the normal diffusion flame decreased from 0.80 to 0.25 as the firing rate increased 9.5 times, while a further NOx reduction to 0.028 g/kW hr was obtained in the inverse diffusion flame. Employing cross-flow opposing air jets reduced the NOx emissions further to 0.017 g/kW hr and shortened the flame by 36% as increasing the strain rate to 2900 s−1 enlarged the peak turbulent kinetic energy to 11.9 m2/s2 with 12 jets. In the triple flame mode, supplying the LPG across the fuel-rich wing and the NG across the lean wing combined high radiation efficiencies, flame shortening and extensive stability limits of 4.8 m/s.

In this study, we explored the feasibility of microbial selenite reduction using methane by DAMO culture. Isotopic 13 CH 4 and long-term experiments showed that selenite reduction was coupled to methane oxidation, and selenite was ultimately reduced to Se (0) by the analyses of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The introduction of nitrate, the original electron acceptor in the DAMO culture, inhibited selenite reduction. Meanwhile, the microbial community of DAMO culture was significantly changed when the electron acceptor was changed from nitrate to selenite after long-term selenite reduction. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that Methylococcus (26%) became the predominant microbe performing selenite reduction and methane oxidation and the possible pathways of AOM accompanied with selenite reduction were proposed.

To mitigate the impact from flooding events, flood control facilities need to be designed and operated more efficiently, which requires a better understanding of the relationship between climate change and flood events. This study proposed a framework combining the Hydrologic Engineering Center’s Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) general circulation models to assess the impact of climate change on flood events. HEC-HMS is one of the most commonly used hydrologic models in the USA, and CMIP5 provides the latest climate data for potential future climate scenarios. The proposed approach is applied to the Nippersink Creek watershed, which shows that 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year precipitations for the low, medium, and high emission scenarios are all greater than the historic observations. The corresponding 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year floods are remarkably higher than in the historic observations for the three climate scenarios. The high emission scenario results in dramatically increased flood risks in the future. The case study demonstrates that the framework combining HEC-HMS and CMIP5 is easy to use and efficient for assessing climate change impacts on flood events. It is a valuable tool when complicated and distributed hydrologic modeling is not an option because of time or monetary constraints. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate change; CMIP; CORDEX; Flood; HEC-HMS; Hydrologic model","Climate models; Flood control; Floods; Risk perception; CMIP; CORDEX; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Distributed hydrologic model; Future climate scenarios; General circulation model; HEC-HMS; Hydrologic modeling; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; flood frequency; flooding; hydrological modeling; hydrological response; precipitation intensity; rainfall; article; climate change; flooding; precipitation; stream (river); watershed; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065761164

The electrical conductivity (EC) and the Cl− content of groundwater increased during the study period in response to low rainfall with a mean values range from 1214 (1995) to 2482 µs/cm (2018) for EC and from 11.36 (1995) to 14 meq/L (2018) for Cl−.

The major drawback of renewable energy resource is their intermittency, moreover in solar energy shading is also an issue. Electric Vehicles help in reducing emission as it is fed from solar grids. Presently, automotive manufacturers have solar roofed vehicles for charging the vehicle battery while it is running or parked outdoors. As the vehicles are moving there is a possibility of solar panels being under complete shading or partial shading. Thus PV modules are used along with a MPPT to get the maximum power from panels. Shading is one major issue that will lead to the formation of local peak and global peak in the I-V and P-V curve, finally delivering a reduced power output. It causes serious problem for the MPPT algorithm as it will not be able to find the maximum power point. This paper focuses on the effect of partial shading in solar roofed electric vehicle and the variation of output power with different patterns of shading. Four Trina Solar TSM 250PA05.08A solar panels were connected in series along with a boost converter to analyse the shading conditions. MATLAB simulation is presented which shows the output power variation and the formation of multiple peaks due to shading. © 2019 IEEE.","Global Peak; Local Hotspot; Local Peak; MPPT; Partial Shading; Renewable energy; Solar panel","Automobile manufacture; DC-DC converters; Electric vehicles; Environmental impact; MATLAB; Maximum power point trackers; Photovoltaic cells; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Global Peak; Hot spot; Local Peak; Partial shading; Renewable energies; Solar panels; Vehicle-to-grid",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072839418

The high dependence on the weather of the renewable resources is currently moving the facilities management forward to the assessment and planning of the energy production. In this context, this work is focused on the use of forecasting climate data to foresee operation feasibility in small hydropower plants. With this aim, a technological climate service, SHYMAT (Small Hydropower Management Assessment Tool), is conceived as an on-line application targeted at end-users which brings automatically updated information of historical, real time and forecast data as well as local data of the specific hydropower plants. SHYMAT provides forecast of river streamflow and displays it in a user friendly web interface. Moreover this climate service shows information about the water volume available to be turbined (taking into account the minimum environmental flow), the energy production and the number of days of operability of the facility expected according to the forecast provided. This new climate service has been co-designed in tied connection with end users, perfectly suiting their needs and has been developed to be easily applied in other systems in order to satisfy local energy demands. © 2019 IEEE.","energy production; river streamflow; seasonal forecast; small hydropower plant","Forecasting; Hydroelectric power; Stream flow; Energy productions; Facilities management; Management assessment; On-line applications; Renewable resource; Seasonal forecasts; Small hydro-power plants; Updated informations; Hydroelectric power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070840112

Genetic diversity of strawberry cultivars in Banyuroto, Magelang, Indonesia based on Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence. Biodiversitas 20: 1721-1728. Banyuroto Village, Magelang, Central Java is the center of strawberry (Fragaria spp.) development and cultivation program. The mild climate makes the location very suitable for developing sub-tropic horticulture such as strawberry. Various kinds of cultivars have been developed as part of the agrotourism program. However, genetic variation research of those cultivars is still rarely done. Therefore, the molecular study of strawberry was conducted to determine the genetic variation using CAPS markers. DNA of Five strawberry cultivars from Banyuroto and seven strawberry cultivars from Indonesian Citrus and Subtropical Fruits Research Institute, Malang were isolated using the CTAB method. DNA amplification was performed by PCR using four pairs of primers named APx, OLP, F3H2, and CTI2. The amplification results were cut with three kinds of restriction endonuclease enzymes named MboI, MluI, and TaqI. Restriction product was used to analyze the genetic variation of twelve cultivars and to construct the dendrogram using MVSP software with the UPGMA algorithm. The result showed that the percentage of polymorphic was 45% from 9 polymorphic bands. Dendrogram result showed that there were four clusters. Cluster A consists of Stroberi Hitam, Cluster B consists of Californica Cultivars, cluster C consists of Osso Grande and Osso Purbalingga cultivars, and cluster D consists of Rosalinda, Deeprose, Dorit, Earlibrite, Tristar, Festival, Brastagi, and Aerut. This research concluded that CAPS markers can be used as a method for study genetic diversity of strawberries. © 2019, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Such an approach assumes a stationary climate, with several alternatives recently introduced to account for monotonic climate change. However, these methods fail to account for interannual climate variability [e.g., El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)] that systematically alters the background state of the climate similar to climate change. These effects and their uncertainties are well established, but they are not reflected in any readily available climate normals datasets. A new high-resolution set of normals is derived for the contiguous United States that accounts for ENSO and uses the optimal climate normal (OCN)—a 10-yr (15 yr) running average for temperature (precipitation)—to account for climate change. Anomalies are calculated by subtracting the running means and then compositing into 5 ENSO phase and intensity categories: Strong La Niña, Weak La Niña, Neutral, Weak El Niño, and Strong El Niño. Seasonal composites are produced for each of the five phases. The ENSO normals are the sum of these composites with the OCN for a given month. The result is five sets of normals, one for each phase, which users may consult with respect to anticipated ENSO outcomes. While well-established ENSO patterns are found in most cases, a distinct east–west temperature anomaly pattern emerges for Weak El Niño events. This new product can assist stakeholders in planning for a broad array of possible ENSO impacts in a changing climate. © 2019, American Meteorological Society.

Glacier monitoring studies using the Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing techniques have given rise to contradictory results for various reasons. This uncertain situation deserves a thorough examination of the statistical trends of temperature and streamflow at several gauging stations, rather than relying solely on climate projections. Planning for equitable distribution of water among provinces in Pakistan requires accurate estimation of future water resources under changing flow regimes. Due to climate change, hydrological parameters are changing significantly; consequently the pattern of flows are changing. The present study assesses spatial and temporal flow variability and identifies drought and flood periods using flow data from the Indus River. Trends and variations in river flows were investigated by applying the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's method. We divide the annual water cycle into two six-month and four three-month seasons based on the local water cycle pattern. A decile indices technique is used to determine drought and flood periods. Overall, the analysis indicates that flow and temperature variabilities are greater seasonally than annually. At the Tarbela Dam, Indus River, annual mean, maximum, and minimum flows decreased steeply from 1986-2010 compared to the 1961-1985 period. Seasonal flow analysis unveils a more complex flow regime: Winter (October-March), (December-February), and spring (March-May) seasons demonstrate increasing flows along with increasing maximum temperature, whereas summer (April-September), (June-August) and autumn (September-November) showed decreasing trends in the flow. Spatial analysis shows that minimum discharge increased at the higher elevation gauging station (Kharmong, 2542 m.a.s.l.) and decreased at the lower elevation gauging station (Tarbela). Over the same timeframe, maximum and mean discharges decreased more substantially at lower elevations than at higher elevations. Drought and flood analysis revealed 2000-2004 to be the driest period in the Indus Basin for this record. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Flow regimes; Indus basin; Mann-Kendall",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067453641

More recently gypsum has also been recognized as a strategy to increase carbon (C) accumulation in the soil, thus contributing to reduced C emissions agriculture. However, there are still doubts regarding how gypsum influences soil C accumulation and the role of the root system in this process. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the influence of gypsum on C accumulation and the relationships of C with soil chemical properties and development of the sugarcane root system to a depth of 2 m, evaluated in the field with an Oxisol. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design, with four replications and two treatments: control (without gypsum) and gypsum application (5 t ha −1 ). Sugarcane stalk biomass and straw production were evaluated in the first planted sugarcane and six ratoon crops. At 87 months after gypsum application, after the seventh cut, the soil was sampled in the depth of 0–200 cm, in 20 cm intervals, for evaluation of the root dry weight (RW) and soil chemical properties (S-SO 4 2− ), calcium (Ca 2+ ), aluminum saturation (Al 3+ saturation), pH, free fulvic acid carbon (FFAC), total C (TC) and particulate C (PC). Stocks of PC and TC were also estimated. The application of 5 t ha −1 gypsum favored the increase of S-SO 4 2− and Ca 2+ contents and induced a reduction in Al 3+ saturation in the soil profile. In association with these improvements in the chemical properties of the subsurface layers were increases in the RW, FFAC, TC and PC stocks. After 87 months of gypsum application, the TC and PC stocks increased by 12.3 and 2.2 t ha −1 , respectively, in the 0–200 cm layer, with the highest gains in the 40–200 cm layer. The multivariate analysis showed that in the 40–200 cm layer of this extremely weathered soil, the effect of gypsum on increasing TC and PC stocks, as well as FFAC, is a result of the reduced Al 3+ saturation associated with the increase in nutrients such as Ca and S, stimulating greater root development. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Free fulvic acid; Roots; Saccharum spp.; Soil carbon sequestration; Sugarcane","Biological materials; Forestry; Gypsum; Multivariant analysis; Organic acids; Organic carbon; pH; Soil conditioners; Soils; Sugar cane; Fulvic acids; Multi variate analysis; Root development; Roots; Saccharum spp; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil chemical property; Sugarcane root systems; Soil pollution; agricultural soil; carbon sequestration; fulvic acid; gypsum; organic carbon; Oxisol; root; soil carbon; soil profile; sugar cane; Saccharum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062243157

Results indicate that, similar to what is found in the Western context, unusual weather patterns and single extreme events have a deeper impact than long-term climate change on public perceptions. The majority of the population considers climate and environmental changes locally, does not associate them with global drivers, and is not prepared to act on them.

As a follow-up to the sustainable development goals agenda, the local authority is to oversee global collaboration to achieve sustainability of urban, energy and natural resources. This study aims to provide an integrated model between greenhouse gas emissions reduction due to urban activities and the sustainable energy under the SDGs agenda as a case study in Kupang city. The results show share of household mix electricity consumption under GHG constraint as 0%~20% coming from renewable energy which increased rapidly on 14%~18% while the electricity supply increased dramatically between 27.67%~28.73% of the total percentage compared to the electricity generated from diesel. On a certain level of the total of electricity consumed and its greenhouse gases emissions constraint compared to total electricity coming from diesel the ratio is getting raise. Therefore, the optimal constraints at 14%~18% give the most significant allocation of resources energy supplied from the renewable energy system, while the greenhouse gases emissions which decreased dramatically are 874.1 tCO2e~833.4 tCO2e with a balanced distribution of added value for each sector.

Deforestation fires in the Amazonia are the main source of GHG in Brazil. In this work, amounts of CO2, CO, main hydrocarbon gases and PM2.5 emitted during deforestation fires, under real conditions directly in Brazilian Amazonia, were determined. A brief discussion of the relationship between the annual emission of CO2 equivalent (CO2,eq) and Paris Agreement was conducted. Experimental fires were carried out in Western Amazonia (Candeias do Jamari, Rio Branco and Cruzeiro do Sul) and results were compared with a previous fire carried out in Eastern Amazonia (Alta Floresta). The average total fresh biomass on the ground before burning and the total biomass consumption were estimated to be 591 ton ha−1 and 33%, respectively. CO2, CO, CH4, and non–methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) average emission factors, for the four sites, were 1568, 140, 8, and 3 g kg−1 of burned dry biomass, respectively. PM2.5 showed large variation among the sites (0.9–16 g kg−1). Emissions per hectare of forest were estimated as 216,696 kg of CO2, 18,979 kg of CO, 1,058 kg of CH4, and 496 kg of NMHC. The average annual emission of equivalent CO2 was estimated as 301 ± 53 Mt year−1 for the Brazilian Amazonia forest. From 2013, the estimated CO2,eq showed a trend to increase in Amazon region.

Micro-grids have been utilised as efficient solutions in energy-intensive industries greatly balancing energy consumption and production at different scales. Smart micro-grids can also reduce carbon emissions by using renewable energy resources and applying smart energy management techniques.In this paper, we propose a smart micro-grid system for fish-processing industries with a validation use-case at Milford Haven Port in South Wales, UK. The system has been modelled using EnergyPlus and Matlab with the infinite grid, renewable energy resource, battery and charge/discharge controllers utilized for optimising energy consumption and production and for reducing carbon emissions.

The study takes place in the downtown part of the city, which depends on a wide range of companies to provide employment, products and services for a large part of the city's population, along with neighboring cities. As a historical heritage city, the traditional city streets reflect planning from a long time ago, during a time in which modern transportation vehicles and services were practically nonexistent. These factors make commerce in the downtown region a particular challenge for the urban organism. To better understand this scenario and indicate measurements to improve the functioning of the urban transportation network, 152 companies responded to interview questions about the main implicit variables in their goods receiving processes, along with information regarding cargo and vehicle types, trips and infrastructure. Any measure taken to mitigate these problems must obligatorily consider the historic nature of the city and establish coherence between the conflicting objectives of the diverse actors which make up the urban environment. The results show the need for creation of new policies for urban logistics, including more areas reserved for loading and unloading of cargo, along with greater monitoring these areas from authorities to guarantee that the law is upheld.

The primary mode of transport in Qatar is private automobiles, which can have a significant environmental impact. One strategy for transitioning to a low-carbon urban environment is the Doha Metro Project, which aims to reduce emissions from private automobiles. The focus of this study is the development of comparative life cycle assessment models to quantify the energy output and emissions of two major transportation alternatives in Qatar—automobiles and metro—within gate-to-gate system boundaries that limit their operations. GaBi 6.0 software was used to model and quantify the environmental impacts per functional unit of passenger kilometers traveled. The analysis demonstrates that public transportation is more sustainable in all impact categories compared with private automobiles. Most importantly, public transportation is key for addressing the critical environmental impacts of the transportation sector: climate change, particulate matter formation, human toxicity, terrestrial acidification, and water depletion. Annually, a public transportation metro line can reduce approximately 19.42 kt of CO2 emissions, 3.15 tonnes of PM 10 formation, 377.17 tonnes of 1,4-dichlorobenzene, 3.02 tonnes of nitrogen, 11.45 tonnes of sulfur dioxide, and 1.5 cubic meters of water. Electricity and water are the primary factors for the environmental impacts of the metro system; consequently, their impact can be further mitigated using cleaner renewable energy sources and through creation of strategic solutions to increase the use of the metro transit system. © 2019 The Author(s)","Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Life-cycle assessment (LCA); Public transportation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078660527

The issue is tackled herein by generating a large number of representative climate projections using weather generators calibrated with the outputs of regional climate models. A case study was performed on the South Nation RiverWatershed located in Eastern Ontario, Canada, using climate projections generated by four climate models and forced with medium- to high-emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for the future 30-year period (2071-2100). These raw projections were corrected using two downscaling techniques. Large ensembles of future series were created by perturbing downscaled data with a stochastic weather generator, then used as inputs to a hydrological model that was calibrated using observed data. Risk indices calculated with the simulated streamflow data were converted into probability distributions using Kernel Density Estimations. The results are dimensional joint probability distributions of risk-relevant indices that provide estimates of the likelihood of unwanted events under a given watershed configuration and management policy.

The literature supports the need for robustness in infrastructural dimensions of such economies. However, the preparatory economic aspects have been overlooked in favour of post-impact disaster management studies by many countries. The latter studies have also focused upon the need for heavy financial investments without investigating solutions for economic strengthening of those economies including climate change mitigation and affordability. As such, emerging SIDS economies have struggled to meet these obligations from their internal finances that draw predominantly from tax revenue sources and foreign aid thereby often leading to increased debts contributing to economic austerity and decreasing liveability levels when repayment commitments fail. Public-private partnerships (PPP), another sought-after loan strategy, which often attracts foreign direct investment (FDI), can work if PPPs are carefully designed within strict public monitoring criteria. However, their applicability needs to be expanded to include the wider social strata of a city to ensure inclusivity and cohesiveness, and formulated to contribute to a wider urban regeneration agenda. This paper proposes a more inclusive framework bridging governance with drivers for sustainable development, using urban heritage and culture as a strategic thread for debt repayment and economic empowerment through PPP.

Here, we compiled and analyzed 151 N 2 O EF values from agricultural fields across China. The EF of synthetic N applied to these croplands was 0.60%, on average, but differed significantly among six climatic zones across the country, with the highest EF found in the north subtropical zone for upland fields (0.93%) and the lowest in the middle subtropical zone for paddy fields (0.20%). Precipitation and soil pH, which showed non-linear relationships with EF, are among the factors governing it, explaining 7.0% and 8.0% of the regional variation in EFs, respectively. Annual precipitation was the key factor regulating N 2 O emissions from synthetic N fertilizers. Among crop types, legume crops had the highest EFs, which were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher than those of cereals. Total soil N 2 O emissions from fertilized croplands with maize, rice, wheat, and vegetables in China, calculated using the climatic zone (regional) EFs, were estimated to be 239 Gg N yr −1 with an uncertainty of 21%. Importantly, this value was substantially (33%) lower than that (357 Gg N yr −1 ) derived from the IPCC default EF but close to the 253 Gg N yr −1 estimated using crop-specific EFs. N 2 O emissions from applied synthetic N fertilizer accounted for 66.5% of the total annual N 2 O emissions from China's maize, rice, wheat and vegetable fields. Taken together, our study's results strongly suggest that regional EFs should be included for accurate N 2 O inventories from croplands across China. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climatic zone; Cropping system; Emission factor; Nitrous oxide; Soil properties","Climate change; Crops; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Tropics; Vegetables; Climatic zone; Cropping systems; Emission factors; Nitrous oxide; Soil property; Uncertainty analysis; nitrogen; nitrogen fertilizer; nitrous oxide; nitrous oxide; climate change; climatic region; cropping practice; emission control; nitrous oxide; panel data; soil property; agricultural land; Article; cereal; China; climate; cropland; legume; maize; measurement accuracy; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; precipitation; priority journal; rice; soil acidity; uncertainty; vegetable; wheat; agriculture; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; crop; environmental monitoring; statistics and numerical data; China; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; Agriculture; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Crops, Agricultural; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrous Oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062900489

Current energy systems are primarily designed with a focus on total cost minimization and bounds on greenhouse gas emissions. Omitting planetary boundaries in energy systems design can lead to energy mixes unable to power our sustainable development. To overcome this conceptual limitation, we here incorporate planetary boundaries into energy systems models, explicitly linking energy generation with the Earth's ecological limits. Taking the United States as a testbed, we found that the least cost energy mix that would meet the Paris Agreement 2 degrees Celsius target still transgresses five out of eight planetary boundaries. It is possible to meet seven out of eight planetary boundaries concurrently by incurring a doubling of the cost compared to the least cost energy mix solution (1.3% of the United States gross domestic product in 2017). Due to the stringent downscaled planetary boundary on biogeochemical nitrogen flow, there is no energy mix in the United States capable of satisfying all planetary boundaries concurrently. Our work highlights the importance of considering planetary boundaries in energy systems design and paves the way for further research on how to effectively accomplish such integration in energy related studies. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Ecology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Planning; Systems analysis; Biogeochemical; Current energy; Energy generations; Energy systems; Energy-systems models; Gross domestic products; Nitrogen flow; Total cost minimizations; Sustainable development; biogeochemistry; boundary line; cost analysis; downscaling; energy planning; greenhouse gas; international agreement; nitrogen cycle; sustainable development; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063025560

GCS is an approach being explored globally as a defense mechanism against climate change projections, although it is not without its critics. An important focus has been recently placed on understanding the coupling between rock–fluid geochemical alterations and mechanical changes for CO2 storage schemes in saline aquifers. This article presents a review of the current state of knowledge regarding CO2-induced geochemical reactions in subsurface reservoirs, and their potential impact on mechanical properties and microseismic events at CO2 storage sites. This review focuses, in particular, on the current state of the art in fluid–rock interactions within the GCS context. Key issues to be addressed include geochemical reactions and the alteration of transport and mechanical properties. Specific review topics include the swelling of clays, the prediction of dissolution and precipitation reaction rates, CO2-induced changes in porosity and permeability, constitutive models of chemo–mechanical interactions in rock, and correlations between geochemical reactions and induced seismicity.

Formulating reliable policies to adapt to these warming levels requires an understanding of the impacts at regional and national scales. The present study examines the potential impacts of the different global warming levels (1.5 °C and above) on climate extremes over Botswana, one of the most vulnerable countries to extreme climate events. Using a series of regional climate model simulations from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX), we investigate the impacts of the warming on characteristics of the rainy season (onset, cessation, length, and number of wet days), extreme precipitation, and droughts. The simulations project a short length of the rainy season with a reduced number of wet days over Botswana at all the warming levels. They also indicate more frequent and intensified extreme precipitation, particularly in north-west Botswana. However, the additional rain water from the extreme rainfall may not offset the deficit in rainfall amount induced by the shorter rainy season with fewer wet days. Drought intensity and frequency are also projected to increase, but the magnitude of changes increases with higher warming levels. The policy implications of projected changes are discussed in relation to the possible impacts on society using agriculture and water availability as examples. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Drought; Global warming; Public policy; Rain; Drought intensities; Extreme precipitation; Policy implications; Potential impacts; Pre-industrial levels; Regional climate; Regional climate model simulation; Water availability; Climate models; adaptive management; climate change; climate modeling; environmental policy; global warming; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; regional climate; temperature effect; water availability; Botswana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065337977

The decision variables were treatment levels at wastewater discharging stations and the rate of upstream water release. The simulation model forN2Oemissions from the river was embedded in the optimization model and the problem was solved using the simulated annealing technique. In two of the models, the total cost was minimized, while in the third model, emissions from the river were minimized for a specified constraint on the available money. Proof-of-concept studies, with hypothetical scenarios for contaminant loading but realistic flow conditions corresponding to the Tyne River, UK, were carried out. It was found that the treatment cost could be reduced by 36% by treating wastewater discharges in the upper reaches more during the high tide as compared to during low tide. For the same level of N2O emissions, approximately 16.7% lesser costs could be achieved by not only treating the wastewater but also inducing dilution by releasing more water from the upstream side. It was also found that beyond a limit, N2O emissions cannot be reduced significantly by spending more money on treatment and water release. © 2019 by the authors.","Nitrous oxide emissions; Simulated annealing; Tidal river; Waste load allocation","Binary alloys; Nitrogen oxides; Potassium alloys; Rivers; Simulated annealing; Uranium alloys; Waste management; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment; Contaminant loadings; Municipal wastewater treatment; Nitrous oxide emissions; Optimization modeling; Simulated annealing techniques; Tidal river; Waste load allocations; Wastewater discharge; River pollution; emission; nitrous oxide; river discharge; simulated annealing; wastewater; wastewater treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068838168

The performance assessment of GCMs has received significant attention in recent years for reliable estimation of future climate. Even though many approaches have been trialled in the ranking of GCMs for the selection of an appropriate ensemble, there is still a need to explore the potential of the state-of-the-art ranking approaches for a more dependable selection of GCMs suitable for a given task, over a region of interest. The present study assessed the potential of a state-of-the-art feature selection method known as Symmetrical Uncertainty (SU) in ranking 20 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) GCMs based on their ability to simulate monthly precipitation and the monthly average of daily maximum and minimum temperature for annual, monsoon and winter seasons. The performance of GCMs was assessed using gridded climate data obtained from Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC), Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and Princeton Global Meteorological Forcing dataset (Prin) over the period 1961–2005 considering Pakistan as the study area. The ranks obtained with SU were compared with those obtained using two well-established ranking approaches; (1) Compromise Programming (CP) and (2) Wavelet-based Skill Score (WSS). According to the results of this study, for the simulation of all the three climate variables in all seasons; CESM1-CAM5, HadGEM2-AO, NorESM1-M and HadGEM2-ES were identified as the best GCMs by SU, whereas CESM1-CAM5, HadGEM2-AO, NorESM1-M and GFDL-CM3 were identified as the best GCMs by CP, and CCSM4, CESM1-CAM5, GFDL-ESM2G and HadGEM2-ES by WSS. The comparison of ranks of GCMs obtained using the same ranking approach but based on different gridded data products showed more or less similar ranks for a given GCM. However, the differences were noticeable when the ranking was conducted with the same gridded data but employing different ranking approaches.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most abundant anthropogenic greenhouse gas. Its variability in the atmosphere is modulated by the synergy between weather and CO2 surface fluxes, often referred to as CO2 weather. It is interpreted with the help of global or regional numerical transport models, with horizontal resolutions ranging from a few hundreds of kilometres to a few kilometres. Changes in the model horizontal resolution affect not only atmospheric transport but also the representation of topography and surface CO2 fluxes. This paper assesses the impact of horizontal resolution on the simulated atmospheric CO2 variability with a numerical weather prediction model. The simulations are performed using the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) CO2 forecasting system at different resolutions from 9 to 80 km and are evaluated using in situ atmospheric surface measurements and atmospheric column-mean observations of CO2, as well as radiosonde and SYNOP observations of the winds. The results indicate that both diurnal and day-to-day variability of atmospheric CO2 are generally better represented at high resolution, as shown by a reduction in the errors in simulated wind and CO2. Mountain stations display the largest improvements at high resolution as they directly benefit from the more realistic orography. In addition, the CO2 spatial gradients are generally improved with increasing resolution for both stations near the surface and those observing the total column, as the overall inter-station error is also reduced in magnitude. However, close to emission hotspots, the high resolution can also lead to a deterioration of the simulation skill, highlighting uncertainties in the high-resolution fluxes that are more diffuse at lower resolutions. We conclude that increasing horizontal resolution matters for modelling CO2 weather because it has the potential to bring together improvements in the surface representation of both winds and CO2 fluxes, as well as an expected reduction in numerical errors of transport. Modelling applications like atmospheric inversion systems to estimate surface fluxes will only be able to benefit fully from upgrades in horizontal resolution if the topography, winds and prior flux distribution are also upgraded accordingly. It is clear from the results that an additional increase in resolution might reduce errors even further. However, the horizontal resolution sensitivity tests indicate that the change in the CO2 and wind modelling error with resolution is not linear, making it difficult to quantify the improvement beyond the tested resolutions. Finally, we show that the high-resolution simulations are useful for the assessment of the small-scale variability of CO2 which cannot be represented in coarser-resolution models. These representativeness errors need to be considered when assimilating in situ data and high-resolution satellite data such as Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT), Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), the Chinese Carbon Dioxide Observation Satellite Mission (TanSat) and future missions such as the Geostationary Carbon Observatory (GeoCarb) and the Sentinel satellite constellation for CO2. For these reasons, the high-resolution CO2 simulations provided by the CAMS in real time can be useful to estimate such small-scale variability in real time, as well as providing boundary conditions for regional modelling studies and supporting field experiments. © 2019 Author(s).",,"atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric transport; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; climate change; computer simulation; concentration (composition); weather forecasting; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066880104

Designing interventions for conserving the food, energy, and water nexus at household level poses a significant challenge due to the complex interplay between human behaviors, technologies, and policies. Games show potential to increase awareness for environmental issues and influence behaviors towards more sustainable practices. Aim. By bringing together scientists and practitioners in the game design process, a transdisciplinary (TD) approach is seen as a promising way to integrate available knowledge and establish ownership of the problem and solution options. Few gaming literature, however, looked at combining the two approaches in addressing resource conservation issues. Method. We present a systematic account of the TD approach process of developing a role-playing game (RPG) - called HomeRUN (Role-play for Understanding Nexus). Results. We documented our experiences in terms of challenges as well as the benefits of the TD approach. Interacting disciplines in this process include psychology, economics, engineering, climate, sociology, and computer science. Inputs from each discipline combined with feedback from social actors that include city government, utility companies, and community members facilitated continuous improvements of the RPG design. © The Author(s) 2019.","climate change; development; environment; learning; role-playing game",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069905361

To this end, local policy makers need to identify the most thermally vulnerable areas within cities. The Local Climate Zone (LCZ) scheme highlights local-scale variations; however, its classes, although highly valuable, are to a certain extent generalized in order to be universally applicable. High spatial resolution indicators have the potential to better reflect city-specific challenges; in this paper, the Urban Heat Exposure (UHeatEx) indicator is developed, integrating the physical processes that drive the urban heat island (UHI). In particular, the urban form is modeled using remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) techniques, and used to estimate the canyon aspect ratio and the storage heat flux. The Bowen ratio is calculated using the aerodynamic resistance methodology and downscaled remotely sensed surface temperatures. The anthropogenic heat flux is estimated via a synergy of top-down and bottom-up inventory approaches. UHeatEx is applied to the city of Athens, Greece; it is correlated to air temperature measurements and compared to the LCZs classification. The results reveal that UHeatEx has the capacity to better reflect the strong intra-urban variability of the thermal environment in Athens, and thus can be supportive for adaptation responses. High-resolution climate projections from the EURO-CORDEX ensemble for the region show that the adverse effects of the existing thermal inequity are expected to worsen in the coming decades. © 2019 by the authors.","Anthropogenic heat flux; Climate change; Local climate zones; Surface energy balance; Urban heat island; Urban thermal indicator",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067018030

In this survey IEA studied the world energy statistics and stated that 18% of the total energy consumption at home accounts for heating water for various purposes. The increasing gap between energy demand and its availability has envisaged the need for search of alternative sources of energy. Renewable energy sources can play a vital role in fulfilling the energy requirements of the people throughout the world. The majority of thermal energy and electric power is generated through non-renewable sources of energy like coal, gas and nuclear power, which are costly as well as degrade earth’s atmosphere by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Renewable energy sources derive their energy from the existing natural energy such as sun, wind, flowing water, biological processes, and geothermal heat which are almost free of charge. And using alternative renewable sources for generation of energy will save our earth and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. Due to the increasing demand of energy, at times an individual renewable energy based system cannot fulfill the demand of required energy within the required time frame. If one system is insufficient to utilize this ample amount of radiations efficiently, one or more efficient systems can be connected in series for a single application. In other words hybrid systems can extract more energy from the renewable source compared to single system. In present work, a hybrid cooking system was designed by integrating solar water heater (SWH), heat pipe (HP), biogas and wood based boiler (auxiliary system) to decrease dependency on conventional energy sources like coal, LPG etc. At present, almost all community cooking systems use LPG as the prime energy source for cooking. This research work focused on transferring LPG based cooking system to renewable energy based hybrid cooking system. Heat required for boiling rice, pulses and green vegetables per day was calculated for 400 persons in community mess. As per the heat requirement a hybrid cooking system was designed and evaluated for its performance. An attempt was also made to reduce wood consumption in the boiler of hybrid cooking systems and to make the system efficient enough so that it can replace the conventional fuel (LPG) for cooking. ©BEIESP.","Biogas; Hybrid cooking system; Solar water heater and heat pipe set",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069932153

To explain this limited effectiveness, this paper takes a discourse analytical perspective on gender policy and budgeting, with a focus on the translation of the international norm into domestic norms and policies. An in-depth, inductive analysis of 107 policy documents in Uganda examines how the gender mainstreaming norm has been translated at three administrative levels: national, district, sub-county. The analysis finds five processes that reduce the norm's transformational potential: neglecting gender discourse, gender inertia, shrinking gender norms, embracing discursive hybridity and minimizing budgets. Overall, gender mainstreaming largely stopped at the discursive level, and often paradoxically depoliticized gender. The findings explain why gender mainstreaming might be helpful but not sufficient for advancing gender equality and suggest additional focus on promising practices, women's rights movements and stronger monitoring. © 2019 The Authors","Gender mainstreaming; Norm domestication; Norm translation; Transformational potential; Uganda","agricultural policy; climate change; environmental policy; gender disparity; womens status; Uganda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062617089

Consequently, integrating renewables into power systems demonstrated a promising performance in hindering the impacts of climate change, especially in regions where renewable resources are abundant. Northern Cyprus is one of those regions where it enjoys the availability of abundant solar resources. However, integrating renewables requires optimized planning in order to achieve their maximum advantages. Therefore, in this work, we aim at determining the maximum allowable PV Penetration Level (PL) considering different PV PL's as percentages of the aggregated-demand in the Northern Cypriot power system and discuss the associated carbon-emissions reduction potential. Purposefully, the objective in this paper is two-folded. First, we use system total active power-loss as a criterion to identify the maximum allowable level of PV integration into system. Secondly, we present the possibility of reducing carbon emissions according to the different PV PL's. The novelty of this paper relies on employing Weighted Integration (WI) approach for PV plants' allocation into the power system. The analysis show that the maximum allowable PV PL is 50%.
