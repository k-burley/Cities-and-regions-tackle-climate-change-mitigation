These areas also deliver important ecosystem services and are central to tourism, amenity, and leisure in many countries. However, they are also major sources of pollution of waterways and of greenhouse gas emissions. In this review, we focus on how the genetic improvement of some of the major crop species of temperate grasslands can contribute to reduced environmental impacts and climate change mitigation including the enhancement of carbon sequestration. The main species considered are the ryegrasses and fescues and the clovers. With regard to diffuse pollution of waterways, increasing the efficiency with which the plant utilizes nitrogen and phosphorus has significant potential to reduce the amounts available for leaching and overland flow. This also allows reduced fertilizer use, in itself representing a significant saving of greenhouse gas emissions. Changes in the composition of the plant diet have the potential to increase the efficiency of nitrogen use in the rumen and reduce the amount of methane produced by enteric fermentation. Carbon sequestration in temperate grasslands may potentially be enhanced by understanding and altering root architecture and turn over and also litter composition. The role of forage breeding in improving soil quality and flood defense is also considered and wider aspects of the role of persistent perennial species discussed. To fully realize the potential of genetic improvement, breeding programs need to incorporate state-of-the-art genomics and also to be guided by modeling studies. An integrated approach combining the skills of animal scientists, soil scientists, and plant breeders within the context of life cycle analysis is required to find sustainable solutions to the challenge of maintaining the productivity of livestock agriculture while reducing its environmental footprint. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Oilfield impacted soil is the most common environmental problem associated with oil production. The produced water associated with oil-production contaminates the soil and causes the outright death of plants, and the subsequent erosion of topsoil. Also, impacted soil serves to contaminate surface waters and shallow aquifers. This paper is intended to provide an approach for full characterization of contaminated soil by produced water, by means of analysis of both the produced water and the impacted soil using several recommended analytical techniques and then identify and assay the main constituents that cause contamination of the soil. Gialo-59 oilfield (29N, 21E), Libya, has been chosen as the case study of this work. The field has a long history of petroleum production since 1959, where about 300,000 bbl of produced water be discharged into open pit. Test samples of contaminated soil were collected from one of the disposal pits. Samples of produced water were collected from different points throughout the oil production process, and the analyses were carried out at the labs of Libyan Petroleum Institute, Tripoli, Libya. The results are compared with the local environmental limiting constituents in order to prepare for a plan of soil remediation. The results showed that the main constituents (pollutants) that impact the soil are salts and hydrocarbon compounds. Accordingly; an action of soil remediation has been proposed to remove the salts and degradation of hydrocarbons. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Impacted soil; Produced water; Soil remediation","Arsenic compounds; Contamination; Environmental impact; Groundwater pollution; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogeology; Occupational risks; Offshore oil well production; Oil fields; Organic compounds; Petroleum refineries; Pollution; Remediation; Risk assessment; Risk management; Salts; Silica; Soil conservation; Soils; Water analysis; Water treatment; Impacted soil; Produced water; Soil remediation; Water pollution; bicarbonate; calcium; calcium carbonate; calcium chloride; calcium sulfate; chloride; hydrocarbon; magnesium; petroleum; potassium; sodium; sulfate; surface water; water; oil field; oil pollution; oil production; risk assessment; soil pollution; soil remediation; topsoil; aquifer; article; bioremediation; controlled study; Libyan Arab Jamahiriya; oil industry; petrochemical industry; phytotoxicity; risk assessment; soil analysis; soil erosion; soil pollutant; soil pollution; waste component removal; waste disposal; water contamination; water sampling; Environmental Remediation; Petroleum; Risk Assessment; Soil Pollutants; Water Pollutants; Africa; Libyan Arab Jamahiriya; North Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51749114462

This research was attempted to understand the hydrochemical changes of the groundwater attributed to the salinization processes based on major ions composition (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-, SO42-, Cl-). The initial assessments were done in the year 1993-1994, and then followed by subsequent assessments in 2004. Methods of analyses were adopted from the recommended methods of the APHA. The hydrogeochemical saturation indexes (SI) were computed using PHREEQC program in order to assess the state of equilibrium between groundwater and the minerals present. The results of the analyses indicated that the groundwater had been highly enriched with ions of Na +, SO42- and Cl-, reflecting an encroachment of marine water into the aquifer. The groundwater facies in the disturbed aquifer is classified as sodium chloride (Na-Cl) water type. Comparison between two locations showed that higher salinity of groundwater was not the direct factor that contributed to the reduction of SI for carbonate minerals such as calcite, aragonite and dolomite in the study area. This information was later conveyed to the relevant authorities of the island and has been utilized by them in coming out with urgent management actions in protecting and remediating the disturbed aquifer situation.","Groundwater; Hydrochemistry; Major ions; Malaysia; Oceanic island; Seawater intrusion","aquifer; calcite; disturbance; facies; hydrochemistry; ionic composition; island; management practice; remediation; saline intrusion; salinization; sodium chloride; water use; Asia; East Malaysia; Eurasia; Malaysia; Sabah; Sipadan Island; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61949220946

The approach is based on comparing the electric field amplitude as a function of the source-receiver offset with a similar measurement for a non-hydrocarbon bearing reservoir. The presence of hydrocarbon raises the amplitude of the measured electric field indicating the existence and to some degree determining the horizontal extent of the hydrocarbon zone; however with this approach it is difficult to know the reservoir's depth and shape. A more rigorous approach to address this type of application is the full nonlinear inversion. In this presentation we present the so-called parametric inversion algorithm (PIA), which uses a priori information on the geometry to reduce the number of unknown parameters and to improve the quality of the reconstructed conductivity image. This PIA approach can be also used to refine the conductivity image that we obtained using the pixel-based inversion (PBI) algorithm. The PIA also adopts the Gauss-Newton minimization method. The parameters that govern the location and the shape of an anomaly include the depth and the location of the user-defined nodes for the boundary of the region. The unknown parameter that describes the physical property of the region is the conductivity. We will show some inversion results of synthetic and field data to illustrate the PIA approach. We further show that by combining both the pixel-based inversion algorithm and PIA we arrive at a better interpretation of the controlled-source electromagnetic data Copyright 2008.",,"Electric field effects; Electric field measurement; Hydrocarbon refining; Hydrocarbons; Image enhancement; Petroleum reservoirs; Pixels; Software engineering; Controlled Source Electro-Magnetic; Controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM); Electric-field amplitude; Hydrocarbon reservoir; Hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs; Non linear inversion; Parametric inversion; Pixel-based inversion; Oil bearing formations",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650554848

The man-made lake had been neutralized, but bentonite rich sediments remained contaminated with very weathered hydrocarbons (sediments with -50,000-60,000 mg/kg Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons were used in this study). Biostimulation, bioaugmentation (with native microorganisms) and chemico-biological stabilization, all resulted in similar reductions (14-16%) in the TPH concentration over a three month period. The land farming treatments resulted in variable reductions in toxicity, ranging from nil to complete, while the chemico-biological stabilization treatment, not only eliminated acute toxicity but also resulted in a slight stimulation (∼103-109%) of the test organism in the bioassay (Microtox). All three treatments reduced polyaromatic hydrocarbons of probable carcinogenicity to below or nearly below the Mexican norms, reduced Toxic Characteristic Leaching Proceedure leachates to <1 mg/L, and left the material in a pH range of 7.0-7.8. The chemico-biological stabilization has the advantage of only requiring initial mixing of the chemical and organic reagents instead of daily aeration, thereby reducing operating costs. This method is also able to treat very difficult sites at low cost, relying on biological humification processes which are accelerated in a humid tropical and semitropical environment. The total unit cost of the chemico-biological stabilization treatment was estimated to be ∼60% of that for land farming in the southern Gulf of Mexico region. © IRSEN, CEERS, IAU.","Bioremediation; Oil; Soil; Total petroleum hydrocarbons; Toxicity","Concentration (process); Hydrocarbons; Runoff; Sediments; Toxicity; bioassay; biodegradation; bioremediation; petroleum hydrocarbon; sediment pollution; stabilization; sulfur compound; toxicity; tropical environment; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41149160272

To identify using proteomic analysis, proteins of altered abundance in the skin of patients with SSc. Methods. 4 mm excision biopsies were obtained from the forearm involved skin of 12 diffuse SSc patients and 12 healthy controls. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to separate and define proteins in normal and SSc skin biopsy material. Proteins of altered abundance in the disease were formally identified by mass spectroscopy. Abnormalities of the epidermis were confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Results. Proteomic analysis revealed altered abundance of proteins involved in extracellular matrix production, myofibroblast contractility, energy metabolism and response to oxidative stress. In addition, proteins specific to the epidermis and involved in epidermal cell differentiation were altered in abundance in the disease. SSc epidermis is thickened, has an expanded nucleated cell layer, and exhibits abnormal persistence of basal marker keratin 14, delayed expression of maturation markers keratin 1/10 and the induction of keratins 6 and 16, normally absent from interfollicular skin and induced following epidermal injury. These changes closely resemble the activated phenotype seen during wound healing. Conclusions. Consistent with previous models of SSc pathogenesis these data are showing increased contractility, increased extracellular matrix and response to oxidative stress in the involved skin of recent onset SSc patients. In addition, we show that SSc epidermis has an activated, wound healing phenotype. These findings are important because epidermal cells activated by injury induce and regulate local fibroblasts during wound repair. © The Author 2008.

Poultry and livestock NH3 emissions are a concern for air quality, surface deposition, and animal and human health. Particulate matter is a human health concern as well and is regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in nonattainment areas. A vegetative buffer comprising 5 tree species was planted in pot-in-pot containers in 5 rows downwind from 4 henhouse fans, with 1 control row of plants upwind from the fans. When measured with a photoacoustic NH3 detector at fan elevation (1.5 m), NH3 concentrations decreased sharply (P &lt; 0.0001) with greater distance, from 71.1 ppm at 0 m (at the fan) to 2.1 ppm at 5.5 m (between rows 2 and 3), 0.3 ppm at 10 m (after row 5), and 0.1 ppm at 50 m (control). This trend was also observed with colorimetric dosi-rubes and a photoacoustic detector at 0.3- and 3.0-m elevations. Significantly lower NH 3 concentrations were recorded at both the 0.3- and 3.0-m elevations in the presence of the trees compared with when the trees were removed from their pot-in-pot containers, suggesting that a portion of the atmospheric NH3 was being trapped by the plants. This was further supported by greater foliar N concentrations in plants when measured downwind from the fans (P &lt; 0.0001). Dust concentrations sampled downwind from the fans were greatest at 2.5 m and decreased linearly to 50 m (P ≤ 0.0001). Plant PM 2.5, PM10, and total PM washed from the foliage showed the same significant linear trend with greater distance from the fans. Plants also showed unique species differences in their capacity to trap and hold NH 3 and PM that can be applied in practical recommendations. These findings indicated vegetative buffers are capable of trapping NH3 and PM fan emissions from poultry facilities. ©2008 Poultry Science Association, Inc.","Ammonia; Dust; Foliage nitrogen; Laying hen; Plant","Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-59849098034

Although several studies have documented the environmental impacts of high-emitting vehicles, these studies have not looked at the operational impacts of these vehicles on the environment. In this study, field-collected and simulated data are used to explain the operational effects associated with catalytic converter malfunctions on vehicle emissions. In addition, the study develops microscopic emission models for vehicles with catalytic converter malfunctions by using on-road emission measurement data. The study demonstrates that catalytic converter malfunctions produce significant increases in hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxide (NOx emissions of 297%, 211 %, and 378%, respectively, during cruising operations. Furthermore, increases of 63.4%, 26.9%, and 76.1 % are observed during acceleration maneuvers. The study also found that under extremely aggressive driving conditions, both normal and high-emitting vehicles produce very high emission rates. The simulation results demonstrate that the highest impact of catalytic converter malfunction occurs in the 45- to 85-km/h speed range at mild acceleration levels for HC and CO emissions and between 20 and 55 km/h at high acceleration levels for NOx emissions. Simulation analysis of various driving cycles demonstrates that catalytic converter malfunctions produce overall increases in HC, CO, and NOx emissions in the range of 251%, 225%, and 336%, respectively. The study demonstrates that high-emitting vehicles can be significant contributors to air pollution, implying that eliminating high-emitting vehicles could significantly improve air quality in many metropolitan areas.",,"Aggressive drivings; CO emissions; Driving cycles; Emission measurements; Emission models; Emission rates; High accelerations; Metropolitan areas; Operational impacts; Simulated datums; Simulation analysis; Simulation results; Speed ranges; Vehicle emissions; Air pollution; Air quality; Alternative fuels; Catalytic converters; Environmental impact; Hydrocarbons; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Organic compounds; Vehicles; Carbon monoxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56749096943

Japan and USA have already experienced in the past few years a steep growth of the market, Europe is expected to follow the same trend in the next decade. The increasing demand for gas and oil, price rises and environmental concerns are driving a market that is in need of alternative solutions. The growth in the hybrid market significantly exceeded all the hybrid sales forecasts. The parallel hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) combine the benefits of gasoline engines and electric motors and can be configured to achieve improved fuel economy, increased power, and above all better performance as a result of very low greenhouse gas emissions. The potential to reduce emissions from all vehicles is an attractive bonus, but the real drivers for the growth in the market are demonstrable fuel economy improvements and reductions in maintenance costs (global efficiency). The paper presents the activities carried out by Ivcco in the study and development of a parallel hybrid applied on medium range vehicle, focusing the attention to the drivcability performances and targeting the best reduction in terms of fuel consumption and emission in different urban and extra urban missions. The architecture chosen for this type of application is a parallel hybrid with: one electric motor/generator and a single clutch. Plug-in is not required. The system configuration allows to implement the following functionalities: • Stop & Start with Electric Launch • Hybrid Mode • Regenerative Braking Mode • Incrtial Start and Creeping Mode. The control system has been optimized on the customer specific missions, with a feedback from field tests (hybrid end users mini-fleet) to demonstrate the reliability, drivcability and efficiency of the solution. The on road experimentation is an important issue to develop a competitive product in a short period. The preliminary results achieved during the performance tests are perfectly in line with the Ivcco estimations especially in term of fuel consumption and drivcability. The vehicle measurements show the following improvements: 20% fuel reduction in a real urban delivery mission and an acceleration from zero to 90 km/h better than 2,5 seconds in comparison with a baseline Eurocargo truck.","Drivcability; Field test; Fuel consumption; Mission; Parallel hybrid","Drivcability; End users; Environmental concerns; Eurocargo; Field test; Fuel reduction; Gasoline engines; Global efficiency; Hybrid electric technology; Hybrid mode; Hybrid sales; In-line; Maintenance cost; Medium range; Mission; Parallel hybrid; Parallel hybrid electric vehicles; Performance tests; Plug-ins; Price rise; Short periods; System configurations; Urban delivery; Urban missions; Commerce; Exhaust systems (engine); Fuel consumption; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Regenerative braking; Sales; Secondary batteries; Hybrid vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866079662

The experiments were conducted using an optically accessible constant volume combustion vessel under a diesel-like condition (Ta=940K and Pa=2.5MPa). In the FTD-fuelled diesel spray flame, the timing and region for the first appearance of PAH LIF and soot particles in the flame were delayed and shifted downstream compared to the case of JIS#2. In the JIS#2 case, the LIF appeared first in the shorter wavelength region (350 to 400nm) and then shifted to longer wavelength region (above 400nm), while in the FTD-fuel case, the LIF was observed not in the shorter wavelength but only in the longer wavelength region. The production of soot in the flame was increased by lowering the ambient oxygen concentration from 21 to 15% in either fuel cases, while the timing and region for the first appearance of soot and PAHs in the flame were delayed and shifted downstream. By lowering the oxygen concentration further down to 10%, the timing and region for the first appearance of PAHs and soot were further delayed and shifted downstream and the production of soot was decreased.

Based on 37 outcrop samples, quantitative palynological studies recognized 64 genera and 136 palynoflora species in the palynological assemblage, which indicated a Middle-?Late Eocene age. This paper also presents a quantitative palaeovegetation and palaeoclimate reconstruction for the Middle-?Upper Eocene coal occurrences of Central Anatolia on the basis of palynomorph assemblages. The diversified floral and ecological characteristics of the pollen taxa indicates that the Middle-?Upper Eocene formations in central Anatolia were characterized by the presence of a complex mangrove swamp with contributions by Nypa, Pelliciera, Avicennia, Diporites iszkaszentgyörgyi and dinoflagellate cysts which reflect warm climatic conditions. Behind the mangrove zone, pollen of Restionaceae, Ephedraceae, Mauritia, Proxapertites (Araceae) and Longapertites (Arecaceae) as well as the fern Acrostichum aureum occur. Lowland-riparian and montane elements are characterized by the dominance of Myricaceae, Symplocaceae, Icacinaceae, Quercus, Pinus and Castanea. Swampfreshwater elements are represented by Sparganiaceae, Nymphaceae, Taxodiaceae, Cupressaceae and Nyssa as well as fern spores such as Osmundaceae and Gleicheniaceae. The calculations were performed with the help of the 'Coexistence Approach' method to climatically evaluate palynoflora from the Yozgat-Sorgun area. The obtained results have been compared to data derived from the application of the Coexistence Approach to other, already published Central Anatolian palynofloras of the same age. The results of the climatic inferences suggest that the palaeoclimatic conditions were in the megathermal zone (mean annual temperature of 24.8-25 °C), megatherm/mesotherm intermediate zone (mean annual temperature of 23.1-24.8 °C near the coast) whereas mesothermic (mean annual temperature of 16.5-23.1 °C) conditions prevailed in the montane region. Likewise, the results of mean annual range of temperatures indicate the influence of the Indian ocean, which enabled the development of the mangroves.

An artificial neural network (ANN) can be used in assessing the dynamics of complex non-linear systems. Since the relation between SO2 concentrations and many meteorological parameters is complex, an ANN model is developed to predict the SO2 levels. Wind direction is modeled as the combination of two variables, which enables to appropriately define the wind direction. The ANN model exhibited an R-squared value of 0.85. Correlation coefficient of SO2 concentrations for one day difference is 0.82, and two-day difference is 0.60.

During a monitoring program of M87, a rapid flare in VHE gamma-rays was detected by the MAGIC telescope in early 2008. The flux was found to be variable above 350 GeV on a timescale as short as 1 day at a significance level of 5.6 a. The highest measured flux reached 15% of the Crab Nebula flux. We observed several substantial changes of the flux level during the 13 day observing period. The flux at lower energies (150-350 GeV), instead, is compatible with being constant. The energy spectrum can be described by a power law with a photon index of 2.30 ± 0.1 lstat ± 0.20 syst. The observed day-scale flux variability at VHE prefers the M87 core as source of the emission and implies that either the emission region is very compact (just a few Schwarzschild radii) or the Doppler factor of the emitting blob is rather large in the case of a nonexpanding emission region. © 2008.

The fundamental idea of the strategy represents a fuel staging within the premix combustion zone. Thereby, the main combustion is operated at extremely lean mixtures (near lean limit), while richer premix pilot flames are used for setting the overall equivalence ratio. To prove the idea, the emission behavior and the stability of a single swirl-stabilized combustor at atmospheric conditions has been investigated near LBO with and without pilot injection. The combustion tests were conducted at main air mass flow rates of 200 kg/h, 225 kg/h, and 250 kg/h, and at varied main equivalence ratios φtotal, while the air preheat temperature was kept constant at 530 K. High pressure amplitude fluctuations could be detected within nearly the whole investigated operating range, except within a narrow φ-band extremely close to the lean blowout. This region is proposed as a possible operating range for premix combustion where also the emissions NOx and CO remained on low level. The periodic ignition of a pilot fuel/air mixture has been proposed for LBO control as it has similar LBO extension behavior as the common pilot fuel injection, but produces less thermal NOx due to a homogeneous fuel distribution. OH-chemiluminescence images of the main combustion zone show that the OH radical density significantly increases when the pulsed premixed pilot flame is used for LBO control indicating increased combustion efficiency. The reason for the improved combustion efficiency seems to be the independent heat source of the premixed pilot flame that is positioned directly on the centerline of the combustor, just below the recirculation zone of the vortex breakdown. The assumption is supported by the fact that the lean blowout extension can be further improved when the premixed pilot flame is located closer to the vortex breakdown. Copyright © 2008 by P.

Managing climate change risk is a growing field of study, but there are no known systematic approaches that have been applied to spaceports to date. Potential hazards to U.S. spaceports are generally recognized as changes to precipitation, temperature, sea level change, extreme weather events, and related natural hazards, but the site-specific risk characterizations required for risk management have not been systematically applied to these critical national assets. Existing tools and framework resident within NASA's own Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) are well-suited for the task of better understanding NASA's spaceport and mission support risks related to climate change. The GISS approach manages uncertainty and enables risk characterization and adaptation using multi-model probabilistic forecasts tailored to users' site-specific region, variables, and timeframe.

For environmental and resource conservation reasons, KOC is required to minimize the amount of gas flared in order to control and reduce the emissions of major pollutants in the State of Kuwait and neighbors countries. In the present study the total emissions of primary pollutants associated from flaring activities from Kuwait oil field have been estimated. An inventory records the annual emissions of air pollutants: NOX, SO2, CO, CO2, Methane and non-methane, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC): resulting from oil production operations in the Kuwait Oil Fields. The emissions are generated from various point sources and aggregated to have total pollutants load of ambient air. Emissions of flaring pollutants are associated with all operations in Oil fields, Gathering Centers (GC), Boaster Stations (BS), Tank areas and other oil production related activities.

In this data analysis, the potential impact of amino acid PET with 3-0-methyl-6-[ 18F]fluoro-L-DOPA ([ 18F]OMFD) on radiation treatment planning is addressed by the following questions: 1. Was tumour tissue identified with OMFD-PET which was not covered by the conventionally derived planning target volume (PTV)? 2. Would the PTV have been changed incorporating OMFD-PET? Patients, methods: OMFD-PET of 25 patients after subtotal resection of malignant glioma was evaluated. The region of elevated tracer uptake of PET and of contrast enhancing masses on MRI were outlined as separate gross tumour volumes (GTV MRI and GTV OMFD) and reconstructed in the planning CT for comparison with the conventionally drawn GTV conv. A PTV new based on GTV conv+MRI was calculated. Pairwise differential volumes were calculated to estimate overlap and differential volumes delineation by each image modality and the PTV conv and PTV new respectively. Results: Differential volume analysis showed &gt; 10 cm 3 of GTV OMFD outside GTV conv and GTV MRI in 5/25 patients respectively. From GTV MRI &gt; 10 cm 3 were found outside GTV OMFD in 8/25 patients. Although all tumour areas indicated by [ 18F]OMFD were covered by the conventionally derived PTV, based on a GTV OMFD+MRI, the PTV new would have been enlarged &gt;20% in seven patients. In seven patients the PTV new, would have been reduced. Conclusion: OMFD-PET indicated tumour tissue outside the tumour region identified with MRI, adding valuable information for the delineation of the GTV in radiation treatment planning.

It shows how ""technology transfers"" in the aerospace industry have been applied to tall building systems to achieve high-performance. Because the design of tall buildings warrants a multi-disciplinary approach and requires the integration of architectural components, structure, HVAC, and communication systems, an analogy exists between tall building and aircraft, which also comprises complex integrated systems. A few case study building examples are presented which represent the new generation of sustainable tall buildings that are setting trends for future projects incorporating innovations in materials and building systems. It is concluded that since tall buildings consume massive energy, designers of the next generation of tall buildings will incrementally aim for ""zero energy"" design. In this approach climate is used to advantage and the building becomes a source of power. It is possible that tall buildings will some day even produce excess energy and transfer the excess to the city's power grid for use in other ways.","Integration; Sustainable architecture; Tall buildings; Technology transfer; Up alternative energy","Aerospace industry; Design; Integration; Technology transfer; Alternative energy; Architectural components; Innovative technology; Integrated systems; Multi-disciplinary approach; Sustainable architecture; Sustainable design; Warrant consideration; Tall buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900854609

Five laboratory methods used for measuring the relative gas diffusion coefficient (Ds/Do) were compared using a loamy sand, a porous media commonly found in agricultural fields and in several engineered structures, such as in landfill final covers. In the absence of macropores, all methods gave rather similar values of D s/Do. Methods allowing the study of microscale variability indicated that the presence of macropores highly influenced gas movement, thus the value of Ds/Do, which, near a macropore may be one order of magnitude higher than in regions without macropores. Repacked columns do not allow the study of heterogeneity in Ds/Do. Natural spatial variability in Ds/Do due to water distribution and preferential pathways can only be studied in large systems, but these systems are difficult to handle. Advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2008.",,"methane; agricultural land; analytic method; analytical error; article; diffusion coefficient; gas diffusion; gas diffusion coefficient; intermethod comparison; landfill; large 2D repacked column in a closed system; loam soil; long repacked column in a closed system; mathematical computing; mining; nonhuman; oxidation; priority journal; sandy loam; small repacked column in a closed system; small repacked column in an open system; soil analysis; water supply; Diffusion; Gases; Laboratories; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55449124269

However, the problem of monitoring representativeness has been overlooked. In this respect, a comprehensive methodology to monitor air quality has been developed by this Institute, engaged since 2001 in several projects in China dealing with air quality. The new approach requires rearranging the existing monitoring strategies. In short, saturation monitoring is employed to preliminary assess air pollution and provide spatial resolution over the study area. Automatic monitoring is reduced to a minimum to make time-related data available. The information so-measured with high degree of both spatial and temporal resolution, are completed by statistical and mathematical modelling to generate data interpretation schemes. This methodology extensively tested in China during these years has been found to be very useful for macro/micro-designing emission and air quality monitoring networks, apportioning emission sources, assessing spatial representativeness of measurements, and evaluating spatial frequency distributions of air pollutants. Case-studies of Suzhou, Lanzhou and Beijing are presented to discuss these findings. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892087812

In the later Bronze Age enclosures and cremation cemeteries were constructed immediately to the east, followed by Iron Age enclosures and, ultimately, field systems dating to the later Iron Age onwards. A radiocarbon programme enabled the chronological sequence and hiatus between all of these events to be discerned, but the majority of this paper explores the physical, chronological, and social relationship between the two Neolithic causewayed enclosures. These were of different forms and, although on the same hilltop, they each seem to have had distinctly different viewsheds over the Thames and the Swale respectively. There are subtle, but potentially significant, differences in the material culture and deposition which allow exploration of the possible functions and role(s) of the two largely contemporaneous sites. Questions may be addressed such as whether they performed the same functions for two communities or had separate and distinct roles for a single community. Beyond the Neolithic, the paper also explores the nature of the later use of the hilltop. The Bronze Age enclosures, though agricultural in function, clearly seem to respect their Neolithic predecessors invoking a remembrance of space, which is lost by the Iron Age. The shift away from the special function of this landscape in the Neolithic to a subsequent agricultural use is explored, as is the hiatus in use and subsequent re-use of the area.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61949330283

Thirteen reservoir lithofacies and eight non-reservoir (dense) lithofacies were identified from core. Depositional environments of the three reservoir units range from lower ramp to shoal crest to near-back-shoal. The dense zones were deposited in a restricted shallow-lagoonal setting. The Kharaib and Lower Shuaiba formations are part of the late transgressive sequence set of a second-order supersequence, built by three third-order composite sequences. The three third-order composite sequences are built by twenty fourth-order parasequence sets that show predominantly aggradational and progradational stacking patterns. The parasequence sets are bounded by sequence boundaries, maximum flooding surfaces, and flooding surfaces, which define reservoir sub-units or geological model units. These units are correlatable throughout Abu Dhabi. Within the Kharaib Formation, third-order transgressive systems tracts are formed by mud-dominated, moderate to high porosity but low to moderate permeability carbonates, whereas grain-dominated, high to very high porosity and permeability carbonates occur in third-order highstand systems tracts. The Lower Shuaiba Formation shows a deepening-upward trend during the third-order transgressive systems tract. The overlaying third-order highstand systems tract is dominated by deeper marine mudstone to wackestone facies that shows a subtle shallowing-upward trend, as well as an upward increase in grain-richness to skeletal, peloid wackestone to packstone. Thickness and facies changes are minor within one field and only become obvious on a sub-regional and regional view.

Opportunities and technical risks are described in this context. Regulatory information contained in this Paper is intended to serve as reference only. Updated and complete rules and regulations must be used for official purposes. The implementation of the second stage of Brazilian OBD (OBDBr-2), starting in 2010, represents a significant improvement towards exhaust emission control and on-board diagnostic monitoring. Its effectiveness and credibility will be heavily influenced by how this new technology is integrated into I/M programs and how well it meshes with aftermarket catalyst regulations. Currently, Brazilian I/M regulations do not incorporate any OBD requirements and only Rio de Janeiro State has implemented an I/M Program. In the absence of an effective I/M program, emission controls tampering can go undetected (e.g. aftermarket catalysts with no ceramic substrate inside). Having OBD checks integrated into an I/M program is an important factor that should be considered in the next stages of Brazilian emission control programs. The US EPA completely replaced traditional tailpipe exhaust tests with OBD checks. EPA experience, however, has shown that it takes a long time to roll out a credible I/M regulation because its credibility strongly depends on the correlation between OBD checks and I/M tailpipe exhaust tests. Finally, it should be pointed out that to work effectively in an I/M program, OBD requirements need to consider the vehicle population as a whole and include spark-ignition and compression-ignition engines, aftermarket catalysts as well as various evaporative and exhaust emission controls.

Methods Three studies were carried out: the burden of respiratory disease was evaluated (acute lower respiratory infection-ALRI and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - COPD), disease costs were studied and the cost effectiveness of natural gas was analysed in terms of reducing indoor air pollution. Results Without natural gas in these localities, it would be expected that 498 (477- 560) cases of ALRI per year would lead to 149 (119-196) hospitalisations, 6 (4-10) deaths and 7 291 (5,746-9,696) disability adjusted life years (DALY) annually. Furthermore, it is expected that 459 (372-684) cases of COPD per year would lead to 138 (93-239), hospitalisations, 11 deaths (5-26) and 1 500 (973-2 711) DALY annually. Annual disease burden cost was 5,2 (3,8-8,3) million dollars before installing domiciliary natural gas (DNG); most of such cost arose from COPD (around 85 %). ARI and COPD costs after installing DNG would rise to 3,5 (2,5-5,7) million dollars; avoided costs would be 1,6 (1,2-2,6) million dollars, (30 % of disease burden cost without DNG). The incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER) of installing DNG would be 56 (22-74) thousand dollars per life saved and ICER per DALY saved would be 43-66 dollars. Conclusion DNG is a sanitary technology which reduces the burden of indoor air pollution-associated respiratory diseases arising from burning biomass fuel in rural localities in a cost-effective way.","COPD; Cost effectiveness; Natural gas","fossil fuel; acute disease; aged; article; Central America; chronic obstructive lung disease; Colombia; comparative study; cost benefit analysis; cost of illness; economics; evaluation; female; human; indoor air pollution; infant; male; middle aged; mortality; pneumonia; preschool child; rural population; statistical analysis; Acute Disease; Aged; Air Pollution, Indoor; Caribbean Region; Child, Preschool; Colombia; Cost of Illness; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Female; Fossil Fuels; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Pneumonia; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Rural Population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65449186715

The areas around chemical companies or waste disposal sites have been seriously contaminated from the chemicals and other polluting materials that are disposed off. The process developed by JJI, consists of a heater/boiler that pump and circulates hot oil through a pipeline that is enclosed in a larger-diameter pipe. This extraction pipe is vertically installed within the contaminated soil up to a certain depth and is welded at the bottom and capped at the top. The number of heat source pipes and the extraction wells depends on the type of soil, the type of pollutants, moisture content of the soil and the size of the area to be cleaned. The heat source heats the soil, which is transported in the interior part of the soil by means of conduction and convection. This heating of soil results in vaporization of the gases, which are then driven out of the soil by the extraction well. The extraction well consists of the blower which would suck the vaporized gases out of the system.

The gas mixture from a coal hydro-gasifier enters the carbonating reactor, where methane and water are catalytically converted to hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The CO2 is removed from the reaction zone by calcined dolomite, and the product stream is a H2-rich syngas. As a preliminary step, a perfectly stirred, time-dependent model has been developed and implemented in Matlab™ to simulate a fluidized bed and to calculate the composition of the outlet CO2-free syngas and the overall CO2 removal efficiency. The breakthrough curves for the carbonator are predicted by the model as well. The results of this preliminary analysis have then been used to develop a steady-state model of the carbonator, in order to insert the component into the library of a modular object-oriented Process Simulator, CAMEL Pro®: this second-level, systemic model can be used to calculate the percentage of CO2 removed from the fuel gas as a function of the operative conditions and of the sorbent charge level (after the initial transient and before saturation), thus eliminating the time dependence of the equations. The model has been validated with respect to a series of experimental results obtained on a lab-scale reactor.","Breakthrough curves; Carbonator; CO2 capture; Modelling; Process simulation","Calcination; Chemical reactors; Environmental impact; Fluid catalytic cracking; Fluidization; Fluidized bed furnaces; Fluidized bed process; Fluidized beds; Gas fuel analysis; Gas fuel manufacture; MATLAB; Methane; Models; Supersaturation; Synthesis gas; Break through curve; Carbonator; Fluidized bed reactors; Modelling and simulations; Operating temperature; Process simulations; Steady-state modeling; Time-dependent models; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924308938

These data show that the estuary complex has had a history of rapid and dramatic change in response to (1) sea-level rise across the irregular topography of the ancestral Trinity River valley and (2) changes in climate, which regulated sediment supply to the estuary. In general, the valley morphology consists of a deep incision near the center and broad, terraced flanks. As sea level rose during the Holocene and flooded the valley, the shape of the estuary changed from narrow and deep to wide and rounded. As sea level rose to the elevation of the relatively flat fluvial terraces, these areas were flooded rapidly, resulting in expansions in bay area and dramatic reorganization of bay environments. The most notable changes were up-valley shifts in the bayhead delta of tens of kilometers in a few centuries. Radiocarbon ages indicate that these events took place ca. 9600, ca. 8500, and between ca. 7700 and 7400 yr B.P. The early flooding events occurred when sea level was rising rapidly (average 4.2 mm/yr; Milliken et al., this volume, Chapter 1), perhaps episodically. The ca. 8200 yr B.P. flooding surface corresponds to a prominent terrace at -14 m. The ca. 7700-7400 yr B.P. flooding episode was the most dramatic in terms of its impact on the estuary setting. Following this event, the area of the estuary increased by ̃30%. This flooding event occurred as the rate of sea-level rise was starting to decrease. The level of this flooding surface also corresponds to a terrace at ̃-10 m, but the magnitude of flooding is too large to be explained entirely by flooding of this terrace. At the same time, Matagorda Bay to the west and Sabine Lake to the east experienced similar dramatic flooding events. This event occurred when the climate of east-central Texas was in transition from cool and moist to warm and dry, and the vegetation cover of the region was undergoing a reduction in forest and an increase in grasslands. Hence, the ca. 7700-7400 event was likely amplified by a reduction in sediment supply to the estuary triggered by this regional climatic change coupled with an increase in sediment accommodation space caused by flooding of a terrace. Following the ca. 7700-7400 yr B.P. flooding event, the estuary setting changed relatively little as the rate of sea-level rise decreased to less than 2.0 mm/yr. By ca. 2600 cal yr B.P., the modern Trinity bayhead delta had begun to form. Circa 1600 cal yr B.P., the delta experienced a phase of rapid growth. This more recent episode of delta growth may have resulted from an increase in the rate of sediment supply, perhaps associated with human occupation and agriculture in the drainage basin. More recent anthropogenic changes include accelerated subsidence due to groundwater and hydrocarbon extraction. These changes are occurring at rates that approach those that occurred during prior flooding events of the Holocene. Thus, the Galveston estuary complex could be on the verge of another flooding event that would mainly impact the Trinity bayhead delta and low-lying areas around the delta. © 2008 The Geological Society of America.","Climate change; Estuary; Flooding; Sea-level rise","Catchments; Estuaries; Floods; Groundwater; Landforms; Oil well flooding; Sea level; Sediments; Seismology; Topography; Accommodation space; Anthropogenic changes; Climatic changes; Estuarine environments; Fluvial terraces; Irregular topography; Sea level rise; Vegetation cover; Climate change; alluvial deposit; anthropogenic effect; climate variation; drainage basin; elevation; environmental change; estuarine environment; flooding; Holocene; landform evolution; paleoenvironment; river terrace; sea level change; subsidence; vegetation cover; Galveston; Matagorda Bay; Texas; Trinity River [Texas]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74549163686

This study is focused on the EU Water Framework Directive, with emphasis on reduction of eutrophication. The drainage area is included in the WFD administrative area of the Motala Ström River basin. A similar approach is now applied in a recently initiated project in the Thukela River basin, with focus on impacts of climate change on water resources. The methodology is based on the idea that a catchment model serves as a platform for the establishment of a common view of present conditions and the causes behind these conditions. In the following steps, this is followed by model-assisted agreement on environmental goals (i.e. what do we want the future to look like?) and local agreement on a remedy or mitigation plans in order to reduce environmental impact (e.g. eutrophication); alternatively to adapt to conditions that cannot be determined by local actions (e.g. climate change). By involving stakeholder groups in this model-supported stepwise process, it is ensured that all stakeholder groups involved have a high degree of confidence in the presented model results, and thereby enable various actors involved to share a common view, regarding both present conditions, goals and the way to reach these goals. Although this is a process that is time- (and cost-) consuming, it is hypothesised that the use of this methodology is two-pronged: it increases the willingness to carry out remedies or necessary adaptations to a changing environment, and it increases the level of understanding between the various groups and therefore ameliorates the potential for future conflicts. Compared to traditional use of model results in environmental decision-making, the experts' role is transformed from a one-way communication of final results to assistance in the various steps of the participatory process.","Catchment; Coastal zone; Modelling; Nutrients; Participatory","Catchments; Coastal zones; Decision making; Environmental regulations; Eutrophication; Models; Nutrients; River basin projects; River pollution; Runoff; Water conservation; Watersheds; Changing environment; Degree of confidence; Environmental decision making; Eu-water framework directives; Participatory; Participatory process; Scenario modelling; Stakeholder dialogue; Climate change; catchment; climate change; coastal zone; decision making; drainage; environmental impact; eutrophication; hydrological modeling; nutrient enrichment; participatory approach; pollution control; stakeholder; water management; water resource; Eurasia; Europe; Kaggebo Bay; Kalmar [Sweden]; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649329646

The dominant anthropogenic greenhouse gas that seems to be contributing to the climate change problem, carbon dioxide (CO2), has a complex cycle through the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere. The combustion of fossil fuels (power production, transportation, etc.) remains the largest source of anthropogenic CO2 to the Earth's atmosphere. Up until very recently, the quantification of fossil fuel CO2 was understood only at coarse space and time scales. A recent research effort has greatly improved this space/time quantification resulting in source data at a resolution of less than 10 km2/hr at the surface of North America. By providing visual tools to examine this new, high resolution CO2 data, we can better understand the way that CO2 is transmitted within the atmosphere and how it is exchanged with other components of the Earth System. We have developed interactive visual analytic tools, which allows for easy data manipulation, analysis, and extraction. The visualization system is aimed for a wide range of users which include researchers and political leaders. The goal is to help assist these people in analyzing data and enabling new policy options in mitigation of fossil fuel CO2 emissions in the U.S. ©2008 IEEE.","CO2; GIS; Interactive Visualization; Multivariate and spatio-temporal data; Visual analytics; Volume visualization","Analytic technique; Analytic tools; CO2 emissions; Data manipulations; Earth systems; High resolution; Interactive posters; Interactive visualizations; Policy options; Power production; Research efforts; Source data; Space and time; Spatio-temporal data; Visual analytics; Visual tools; Visualization system; Volume visualization; Carbon dioxide; Earth atmosphere; Fossil fuels; Geographic information systems; Global warming; Graphical user interfaces; Greenhouse gases; Insulating materials; Oceanography; Visualization; Data visualization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949855756

The volume requirement of approximately 2m3 could be integrated inside a prefabricated wall so that the waste management utility can be easily commercialized and installed without additional space requirements.

Lane restriction is defined as the movement of particular categories of vehicles on specified lanes (dedicated lanes), whereas lane-less flow movements are conditions when vehicles are free to change lanes. This study was conducted on selected mid-block road sections of different lengths in Chennai city, India. In the process of test runs, tailpipe emissions (CO, HC and NO) were measured using a portable gas analyzer at short intervals of time. These data were then synthesized to evaluate the total emissions from the vehicles for each test run. Instantaneous speeds of the vehicles were measured using an optical sensor fixed to the wheel. Consumption of fuel by the test vehicles were also measured using a petrol reading apparatus. Based on the analysis of field data collected specifically for this study, it is concluded that lane restricted flow generally produced reduced levels of tailpipe emissions compared to lane-less conditions. The impact of various factors such as, number of lane changes, average speed and fuel consumed on emissions were also studied. In order to understand the relationships between emissions and various traffic factors, regression models were tested and built using SPSS software. Highly heterogeneous traffic conditions and the lane changing behavior of drivers in traffic conditions prevailing in urban areas in India offered unique research opportunities in this study.

Ltd., Japan","In the ""Nissan Green Program 2010"", released in December 2006, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. announced plans to offer advanced technology and products to further real-world reductions in CO2 emissions. One solution is the development of a practical fuel cell vehicle (FCV). In 1996, Nissan began developing an FCV and since 2001, has participated in activities to promote the development and to educate the public on the benefits of fuel cell vehicles by participating in fleet programs in the USA (CaFCP) and in Japan (JHFC). In 2006, limited leasing of the newly-developed 2005 X-TRAIL FCV was initiated in Japan, in the Kanagawa Prefecture and in Yokohama City. In 2007, Nissan provided an X-TRAIL FCV to Kanagawa Toshi Kotsu Ltd., for use as the world's first-ever fuel cell taxi in use on pubric roads. The 2005 X-TRAIL is equipped with various newly-developed technologies, including a fuel cell stack that was engineered by Nissan in-house. The X-TRAIL FCV has evolved from a test vehicle in 2002 to the model of today, which provides the utility and convenience required by the consumer in the market. The cruising range, acceleration performance and maximum speed are competitive with existing gasoline vehicles. However, to enable commercialization of the FCV, further improvements in performance and durability as well as reduction in cost will be necessary. Therefore, Nissan is investigating several different approaches to reduce cost and improve durability and performance. The current Nissan R and D activities related to degradation mechanism understanding of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and to possible countermeasures developing for durability improvement is described.

Unburned hydrocarbon of particulate matter that is collected on the plate and electrode of ESP is difficult to remove using rapping method. The particulate disturbs electric strength and decreases performance of ESP for long time operation. Two methods, water-plate collector and water spray, are proposed to clean up the collector plate, keep ESP performance, and reduce gaseous emission, NOx and SOx, in the exhaust gas. In the first method, water or a combination of water and plate is used to substitute for the collector plate of the ESP. The water and water vapor of exhaust gas in the high voltage electric region generates gas-phase radicals, O and OH, by electron impact excitation and ionization. The gas-phase radicals oxidize NOx and SOx to HNO""2, HNO""3, and H""2SO""4. In the other method, water is periodically sprayed on the electrode and collector plate to remove the particulates from ESP. Effects of fresh water and seawater for collector of ESP on collection efficiency and electric power consumption are also analyzed. The results show that intermittent spray of water in ESP keeps the ESP performance, and water-plate collector improves ESP performance to reduce PM, NO, and SO""2 in the marine diesel engine. Seawater used for the water-plate collector has efficiency of SO""2 reduction higher than fresh water. © 2008 Old City Publishing, Inc.","Eletrostatic precipitator; Marine diesel exhaust emission; Water spray; Water-plate collector","Concentration (process); Diesel engines; Electric utilities; Electricity; Electrolysis; Electrostatic precipitators; Electrostatic separators; Gas emissions; Gases; Hydrocarbons; Impact ionization; Ionization of gases; Ionization of liquids; Leakage (fluid); Organic compounds; Particulate emissions; Pesticides; Seawater; Seawater effects; Spraying; Submersible pumps; Water; Eletrostatic precipitator; Marine diesel exhaust emission; Water spray; Water-plate collector; Water vapor; concentration (composition); diesel engine; efficiency measurement; equipment; exhaust emission; ionization; particulate matter; performance assessment; spray",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54749103089

The El Nino phenomenon and glacier top reductions appears as the most severe extreme changes. In the last 25 years, tropical Peruvian glaciers disappeared in 22% volume (7,000 million cubic meters). El Nino phenomenon has regularly and frequently occurred on Peruvian surface, one more severe than others, for instance in the year 1997-98 it generated economic lost equivalent to 4.5% of national gross domestic product. Heavy rainfalls, droughts, frost, healing, etc. are examples of extreme climate events. In the year 2004 alone the hard frost affected 52 provinces, leaving 360,000 homeless people, 66 frost killed children, 259,110 dead livestock, 1,362,695 frost affected livestock, disappearance of 216,756 ha of native grasslands, 34,948 ha of lost crops, and 111,890 ha unsown croplands. Total Peruvian lands count for 128.5 million ha and it has 8 of 11 global climatic types. Of these lands 38% of lands are rain forest, and 42% are protected areas. Cropping and permanent crop lands represent only about 6% of the total area. More than 15 million hectares (14% of total surface area) is native grazing lands, pastures occupies 0.5 million hectares. Animal population (chiefly 'creole' is represented by sheep (10 million), cattle (4.5 million), horses and mules (2.2 million), goats (2.1 million) and South American camelids (3.5 million). All mostly distributed in the grazing lands of the provinces of Cajamarca, Junin, Ayacucho, Arequipa, Puno. These are the main grazing areas in Peru. These areas form part of the 13 priority Peruvian zones to be monitored for greenhouse gas emissions (GGE). Peru is involved in the Global Climate Change (GCC) convention since 1993 and as a vulnerable country, has the agreement to survey and inventory the GGE along the countryside. The GGE inventory in Peru is those related directly to carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Data must be reported as emission source, time and spatial variations. Peru is not engaged to reduce gas emissions, but, it has the agreement to reduce emissions, it also can participate into the mitigation activities by means of the Mechanism Clean of Developing. The national institutions involved in the GCC convention are represented in a technical committee formed within the National System of Environmental Management which it is chaired by the National Council of Environment. This council is conformed by thirteen institutions related to foundations, navy, education, natural resources evaluation, academy diplomatic, transport, mining sector, meteorological service, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and presidential office. In the year 2002, this Peruvian group wrote the proposal of the National Strategy for Global Climate Change. The Andean Countries Community stated that the Andean countries produce less than 2.5% of global emissions, but it is mainly produced by logging and burning process in Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru. For example, Peru produces 0.4% of the total GG emissions. Most of the Peruvian methane emissions (98 816 Gg, estimated for the year 1994) comes from pastoral livestock (60-70 %), land use changes (15-25 %) and waste management (15 %). Pradel, et al. (2006) in La Encanada, Cajamarca, which examined the trade-offs between poverty alleviation and environmental contamination in the context of dairy production systems showed enteric methane emissions were higher than the total GG emissions from transport. The above study also showed that technology (base on improvement of feeding strategies) brought positive results in poverty alleviation, malnutrition reduction, improvement in household incomes, reduction in grasslands degradation and improved water management. Accurate GGE inventory activities and research of mitigation technologies requires international cooperation to build up our national capability to reduce the vulnerability areas. In conclusion, Peru is a vulnerable country to climate change events. For example since Peruvian highlands concentrate 70% of the world tropical glaciers will likely affect the water supply to 70% of our population, and this may change climate conditions in the area. The Peruvian network of interest on GG emissions from agriculture based at Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina (Lima, Peru) is committed to engage in activities aiming at producing accurate inventories of GGE and researching mitigation technologies and considers that international cooperation is crucial to achieve these objectives.",,"clean development mechanism; climate change; El Nino; emission control; emission inventory; environmental management; glacier; global climate; greenhouse gas; Gross Domestic Product; mitigation; pollutant source; pollution monitoring; population distribution; poverty alleviation; protected area; rainforest; trade-off; vulnerability; water supply; Peru; South America; Animalia; Bos; Camelidae; Capra hircus; Equidae; Ovis aries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48549107102

However, because the issue's acceptance into mainstream discourse is relatively recent, and knowledge is rapidly changing, many of the climate-literacy learners who will impact future policy decisions are today's adults. Many educational theorists have determined that adults have different educational approaches and needs than traditional (""school-age"") learners. This article introduces two major frameworks that inform adult education: andragogy and the diffusion of innovations. Each of these frameworks is made up of their own internal assumptions and concepts. These frameworks have been implemented - both intentionally and unintentionally - into climate literacy programs in Oklahoma. We examine the impact of these frameworks on OK-First, a public-safety outreach program that provides education and decision-support for public safety officials who must make decisions in the face of hazardous weather or weather-impacted hazards. The application of these adult educational tenets has been an integral part of ongoing efforts to improve the effectiveness of the program. Copyright © 2008 by Bellwether Publishing, Ltd.

Diesel engines are more energy efficient and produce less carbon dioxide than gasoline engines, but their particulate and NOx emissions are more difficult to reduce than spark ignition engines. To tackle this problem, a number of after-treatment technologies are available, such as Diesel Lean NOx Traps (LNTs)), which reduces oxides of nitrogen, and the Diesel particulate filter (DPF), which reduces particulate matter. Sophisticated control techniques are at the heart of these technologies, thus making Diesel engines run cleaner. Another potentially unattractive aspect of Diesel engines is noise. The hybridization of a Diesel powertrain also offers significant opportunities for reducing noise emissions through the use of a starter-alternator for active engine vibration and noise reduction and by aggressively using engine start-stop and electric launch features. Ohio State University used Model-Based Design in MATLAB and Simulink to address the challenge of integrating a Diesel engine in a crossover SUV as part of the Challenge X student competition. The team developed a number of advanced control strategies to meet vehicle technical specifications and validated these on the vehicle through real world tests. Challenge X is a four year competition, currently in its fourth year, that challenges 17 universities to re-engineer a Chevrolet Equinox for reduced energy consumption and emissions, while maintaining or improving stock performance. The Ohio State University chose an architecture that utilizes a 1.9 L Diesel engine belted to a 10.6 kW starter/alternator and coupled to a six-speed automatic transmission. In addition, a larger 67 kW electric motor drives the rear axle in order to enable electric all wheel drive (eAWD) and electric launch capability. The Ohio State Team is currently fine tuning their vehicle to reduce emissions and improve drivability; this paper captures their experiences in this process.

As a result of this stringent legislation, the automotive engine technology has experienced continuous improvements in many areas. In the field of Engine Control Systems (ECS) innovative procedures have been proposed and major efforts have been devoted to the study of transient phenomena related to operation and design of engine control strategies. Particular attention has been given to the control of mixture strength excursions, which is a critical task to assure satisfactory efficiency of three-way catalytic converters and thus to meet exhaust emissions regulations. This goal has to be reached in both steady state and transient conditions by estimating the air flow rate at the injector location and delivering the fuel in the right amount and with the appropriate time dependence. Furthermore, the ECS designers have to face with the On Board Diagnostics (OBD) requirements that were introduced in 1996 in California and later in Europe and represent one of the most challenging targets in the field of Automotive Control.

Dengue viruses are also maintained in nature by vertical transmission by Ae. aegypti. A study was undertaken in Chennai, a known endemic city in south India, to comprehend the natural vertical transmission dynamics in Ae. aegypti and to assess its epidemiological importance. Methods: Ae. aegypti males collected in resting and landing collections were tested for dengue virus infection by antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and further examined by insect bioassay, Toxorhynchites splendens inoculation-indirect immunofluorescence technique (Toxo-IFA) using serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies (Mabs), if found positive by ELISA. Results: Of the 509 pools of Ae. aegypti males (n=5408) screened, 15 pools, collected in April, June-July, November-December in 2003 and March, May in 2004, were found positive for dengue virus infection and the minimum infection rate (MIR) among adult males was high in June 2003 (28.0/1000). Three positive pools could be serotyped as dengue-2 (2 pools) and dengue-3 (1 pool). Interpretation & conclusions: Dengue virus isolations from wild caught males of Ae. aegypti indicate the occurrence of transovarial transmission. Vertical transmission was mainly observed in summer months when dengue infections in humans were low suggesting that dengue viruses adopt a novel strategy of surviving adverse climatic conditions.","Aedes aegypti; Dengue virus; ELISA; Vertical transmission","monoclonal antibody; Aedes aegypti; article; bioassay; climate change; controlled study; Dengue virus; disease carrier; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; immunofluorescence test; India; inoculation; male; nonhuman; seasonal variation; serotype; vertical transmission; virus isolation; virus survival; virus transmission; Aedes; Animals; Dengue; Dengue Virus; Disease Transmission, Vertical; Endemic Diseases; Humans; India; Male; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51349147008

It has a 2,000 year track record of helping build the Roman Empire to building today's modern societies. As a result of its versatility, beauty, strength, and durability, concrete is used in most types of construction, including homes, buildings, roads, bridges, airports, subways, and water resource structures. And with today's heightened awareness and demand for sustainable construction, concrete performs well when compared to other building materials. Concrete is a sustainable building material due to its many eco-friendly features. The production of concrete is resource effi cient and the ingredients require little processing. Most materials for concrete are acquired and manufactured locally which minimizes transportation energy. Concrete building systems combine insulation with high thermal mass and low air infi ltration to make homes and buildings more energy effi cient. Concrete has a long service life for buildings and transportation infrastructure, thereby increasing the period between reconstruction, repair, and maintenance and the associated environmental impact. Concrete, when used as pavement or exterior cladding, helps minimize the urban heat island effect, thus reducing the energy required to heat and cool our homes and buildings. Concrete incorporates recycled industrial byproducts such as fl y ash, slag, and silica fume that helps reduce embodied energy, carbon footprint, and waste.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953335868

To date these features have not been fully recognized in design codes, which have largely adapted rules devised for carbon steel in a rather simplistic fashion. Recently, a new approach for dealing with local buckling and the associated loss of effectiveness that does not utilize the concepts of either cross-sectional classification or effective cross-sectional properties has been developed for stainless steel and has also been applied to other nonlinear metallic materials. The method is based directly on the deformation capacities of cross sections and covers the behavior of stainless steel members subjected to flexural buckling and combined axial load plus bending. The proposed method has been verified using test results and its performance has been compared against the existing ASCE and Eurocode design guidance for structural stainless steel. Significantly improved and more consistent predictions have been obtained using the proposed method without any extra calculation effort. © 2008 ASCE.","Bending; Column beams; Compression; Cross sections; Stainless steel; Structural design","Beams and girders; Bending (deformation); Buckling; Compaction; Structural design; Column beams; Cross sections; Deformation capacity; Stainless steel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39449115788

Meeting these difficult and apparently conflicting emissions and efficiency goals is becoming increasingly onerous as engine and aftertreatment control complexity increases. Conventional engine calibration techniques are by nature time-intensive, ad-hoc and repetitive, resulting in low productivity of test facilities and engineering effort. Steady state engine mapping methods, such as design of experiments, do little to ensure transient emissions compliance or fuel consumption optimization. A new model-based Rapid Transient Calibration system has been developed, tested and validated using a 2007 production-specification Detroit Diesel Series 60 heavy-duty diesel engine. This system has demonstrated a significant reduction in the time required to calibrate compared to conventional calibration methods by moving an appreciable proportion of the engineering effort from the physical transient dynamometer test cell to the virtual, computational desktop environment, thus offering significant reductions in product development costs and schedules. Significant improvements in actual fuel consumption were shown at the same or lower overall integrated emissions levels in real-world validation testing, proving that this new process offers considerable advantages over conventional calibration methods. This paper details the first complete beginning-to-end validation of this rapid transient calibration optimization process. The calibration process commences with a limited data collection campaign in a transient emissions test cell and is then transferred to the computational environment where high-fidelity dynamically predictive engine emissions and performance models are created. The engine calibration is then optimized off-line using these transient models in conjunction with a set of optimization and constraint functions. To prove the accuracy of the method, a number of engine calibration data sets, each optimized for a different emissions target, are then validated on the engine back in the transient emissions test cell.

The multistep methanogenesis pathway is well elucidated, mainly from the study of non-rumen methanogens, but the adaptations that allow methanogens to grow and persist in the rumen are not well understood. The Pastoral Greenhouse Gas Research Consortium is sequencing the genome of Methanobrevibacter ruminantium, a prominent methanogen in New Zealand ruminants, as part of a project to mitigate greenhouse gases. The genome is ∼3.0 Mb in size with a guanine-cytosine (GC) content of 33.68%. All of the components of the methanogenesis pathway have been identified and comparison of these gene sequences with those from Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus and Methanosphaera stadtmanae indicates that methanogenesis gene organisation is conserved within the Methanobacteriales. The genome of M. ruminantium contains a prophage sequence (designated φmru) with distinct functional modules encoding phage integration, DNA replication and packaging, capsid proteins and lysis functions. A low GC region found at the distal end of the phage sequence harbours a putative DNA restriction/modification system which might provide additional protection against foreign DNA. The genome also contains many large surface proteins with characteristics that indicate that they may mediate association with other rumen microbes. Approximately half of the genes identified within the genome have no known function. Determining the function of these new genes will assist in defining the role of M. ruminantium in methane formation in the rumen and help identify means to control methane emissions from ruminant animals. © CSIRO 2008.",,"DNA; genome; greenhouse gas; methanogenesis; methanogenic bacterium; ruminant; Australasia; New Zealand; Animalia; Bovidae; Methanobacteriales; Methanobrevibacter ruminantium; Methanosphaera stadtmanae; Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus; Miridae",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37649025331

The local electric field enhancement associated with these hot spots is used to determine the surface enhanced Raman scattering enhancement factors for a molecule, here treated as a classical dipole, located near the surface of the sphere. Both incident and Raman emission enhancements are calculated accurately using an extension of the Mie theory that includes interaction of the Raman dipole field with the sphere. The enhancement factors are calculated for dielectric spheres in vacuum with a refractive index of 1.9 and radii of 5, 10, and 20 μm and for wavelengths that span the visible spectrum. Maximum Raman scattering enhancement factors on the order of 103 - 104 are found at locations slightly off the propagation axis when the incident excitation but not the Stokes-shifted radiation is coincident with a whispering-gallery mode resonance. The enhancement factors are found to vary inversely with the resonance width, and this determines the influence of the mode number and order on the results. Additional calculations are performed for the case where the Stokes-shifted radiation is also on-resonance and Raman enhancement factors as large as 108 are found. These enhancement factors are typically a factor of 102 smaller than would be obtained from ∫E∫4 enhancement estimates, as enhancement of the Raman dipole emission is significantly reduced compared to the local field enhancement for micron size particles or larger.

Significant reductions in fuel consumption can be achieved while maintaining the performance and size of current production vehicles; however, it does not appear that the benefits will be commensurate with the costs. Based on the same model employed by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, nationwide reductions in light-duty motor vehicle greenhouse gas emissions of 30% will have no measurable effect on ambient temperature. This calls into question the assumption that the cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions has corresponding economic benefits related to the moderation of climate change. Some technologies for reducing fuel consumption, such as the use of cylinder deactivation systems and lightweight steel, provide a net present value of fuel savings over the expected service life of the vehicle that exceeds the cost of the technology. However, the cost associated with the use of hybrid-electric drive systems translates to over $200 per barrel of oil saved. Even during a time when the price of oil is substantially in excess of the marginal cost of production, hybrids do not provide an economic benefit to consumers. Given the abundance of fossil resources from which motor vehicle fuels can be produced, it does not appear that hybrids will be cost effective for the foreseeable future unless the cost of the technology can be significantly reduced. © 2008 SAE International.",,"Climate models; Cost effectiveness; Crude oil; Economic and social effects; Electric drives; Fuel economy; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Laws and legislation; Current production; Cylinder deactivation (CDA); Federal regulations; Hybrid electric drive system; Light duty vehicles; Light-weight steels; Net present value; United nations intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Cost reduction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072450924

Over the past several years, numerous top executives have been found guilty of improprieties such as illegal accounting methods and violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption statutes. As a result, government authorities in the U.S. and other countries have been expanding their oversight of the ways organizations manage their businesses and the records they generate. Failing to comply with these standards can have significant consequences with the possibility of fines, other monetary penalties, jail time for executives, adverse share price impact and loss of market share. Legal compliance is a challenging and essential element of corporate governance. Companies pursuing opportunities in developing economies often face additional hurdles in fashioning an effective compliance program due to unfamiliar geographies, numerous complex local laws, cultural barriers, and political and financial complexities. Improper business conduct in such locations can expose a company to unforeseen risk, reputational damage and civil and criminal penalties. As a result, organizations should work to ensure that their operations meet the highest standards of both ethical behavior and legal compliance. In the current economic, regulatory and social climate, compliance risks have propelled integrity, good corporate governance and effective and efficient compliance management to a top business priority. Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI) firmly believes that ethics is essential for sustained high business performance. To ensure that it meets these challenges, BHI has developed a global best-in-class compliance program that can serve as a model for other companies facing formidable global compliance challenges. BHI's compliance program consists of a rigorous, customized system of corporate governance. The program requires all employees to comply with the law, the company's core values-integrity, teamwork, performance and learning-and its business code of conduct. BHI's compliance program has a special focus on legal compliance, financial compliance, and health, safety and environmental compliance, all of which are well defined and articulated through every part of the company. The compliance culture that has evolved at BHI is based on the critical concepts of prevention, detection and response. In terms of specifics, BHI's compliance program: establishes proper tone at the top; assigns oversight and management responsibility for the compliance program to a vice president and chief compliance officer with active oversight from executive management and the board of directors; establishes clear global compliance standards and procedures; assigns compliance responsibility and accountability to line managers and all employees; provides mandatory, customized training at all levels; provides a robust and easily accessible reporting system for compliance violations to employees and other stakeholders; and images and investigates all allegations of misconduct and noncompliance in a timely and competent fashion. A key component of the company's compliance program is FCPA compliance. This paper outlines effective processes and procedures that have been employed by BHI, both from a compliance as well as commercial perspective, which can be successfully utilized for managing complex international oil and gas businesses, while fulfilling the obligations of a good corporate citizen. copyright 2008, International Petrolieum Technology Confrence.",,"Competition; Crime; Environmental regulations; Gasoline; Human resource management; Industrial management; Personnel training; Philosophical aspects; Software engineering; Commercial perspectives; Compliance management; Compliance responsibility; Corporate governance; Developing economies; Government authorities; Health , safety and environmental; Processes and procedures; Regulatory compliance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650562851

For this reason, modeling has become an important tool to predict ozone levels under varying emission scenarios. In spite of the efforts focused on reducing pollutant emissions, ground-level ozone concentrations in Spain are still exceeding thresholds established in EU legislation to protect human health and prevent damage to ecosystems. Resolution plays a significant role in modeling, especially when trying to simulate local effects. Higher resolution allows a more accurate definition of air pollutant transport pathways, although higher computing time is required. Besides the better definition of pollutants transport, a better model performance is also expected when simulating higher resolution domains. In this paper model predictions for three different resolutions have been analyzed over some areas in Spain (Madrid, Valencia and País Vasco) for 2004. Simulations of photochemical compounds were carried out using the regional V200603par-rcl version of the CHIMERE model. A comparison between hourly model predictions and observations was done for O3 and NO2 in 2004. An improvement of ozone predictions was found for Madrid and Valencia areas when considering a higher resolution. The improvement of model predictions is more clearly observed for NO2 in this two areas.

The site is located on the south-western margin of the East-European Platform in eastern Romania, in a hydrocarbon-prone area crossed by the Pericarpathian lineament and regional faults. Molecular composition of gas and stable isotopic analyses of methane (CH4>90%, δ13C1: -49.4‰, δD1: -173.4‰) indicate a dominant thermogenic origin, with significant amounts of C2 -C5 alkanes (∼5%), likely migrating through faults from a deep reservoir. Possible candidates are the Saucesti and Secuieni gas fields, located in the same petroleum system. Two surface geochemical surveys, based on closed-chamber flux measurements, were performed to assess the degassing intensity and the extent of the affected area. Methane fluxes from soil reach orders of 104 mg m-2 day-1. Gas seepage mainly occurs in one zone 30000 m2 wide, and it is likely controlled by channeling along a fault and gas accumulation in permeable sediments and shallow subsoil. The estimated total CH4 emission is about 40 t year-1 CH4, of which 8-9 t year-1 are naturally released from soil and 30-35 t year-1 are emitted from shallow boreholes. These wells have likely channeled the gas accumulated in shallow alluvial sediment but gas flux from soil is still high and mitigation measures are needed to reduce the risk for humans and buildings. © 2008 The Authors Journal Compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Gas hazard; Methane seepage; Soil degassing; Thermogenic gas","degassing; methane; seepage; soil emission; urban area; Bacau; Eurasia; Europe; Romania; Southern Europe",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57049084660

In the context of recent debates on the democratic legitimacy of transnational governance, this paper focuses on accountability as a central component of legitimacy. The aim of this paper is to map transnational climate partnerships and evaluate their accountability record in terms of transparency, monitoring mechanisms and representation of stakeholders. Three types of partnerships are identified with respect to their degree of public-private interaction: public-private (hybrid), governmental and private-private. Most of the climate partnerships have functions of advocacy, service provision and implementation. None are standard setting, which indicates that governmental actors are less willing to ""contract out"" rule-setting authority to private actors in the climate change. Some partnerships, such as the World Summit on Sustainable Development climate partnerships and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects represent ""new"" modes of hybrid governance with high degree of public-private interaction. However, many partnerships, not least the voluntary technology agreements such as the APP, rest on ""old"" form of governance based on the logic of lobbying, corporatism, co-optation and interstate bargaining. Private (business-to business) climate partnerships are to varying degrees geared toward quantitative targets in the Kyoto Protocol. The accountability record is higher for hybrid climate partnerships, such as the CDM, due to extensive reporting and monitoring mechanisms, while lower for the governmental networks, such as voluntary technology agreements. Partnerships do not necessarily replace or erode the authority of sovereign states, but rather propels the hybridization and transformation of authority that is increasingly shared between state and nonstate actors. © 2008 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"clean development mechanism; environmental policy; global perspective; governance approach; public-private partnership; sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50449094554

Within the typical planning horizon, many modeling tools (e.g., land use, travel demand, and emissions models) are used to evaluate the impact of regional development, population trends, and infrastructure improvements on air quality. However, these models were not designed, nor are they generally used as a cohesive system with feedbacks between them. Consequently, there is a gap in our understanding of how different models interact and combine to influence emissions inventories associated with future policy scenarios. In this study, funded by the Environmental Protection Agency, an emissions modeling framework was developed using the UPlan, TP+/Viper, and UCDrive emission models for the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) in central California. Specifically, future land use and subsequent travel patterns and emissions inventories were examined based on four policy scenarios for the year 2030: baseline (following general plans, with no roadway expansion), controlled growth (compact urban boundary, higher residential densities, no roadway expansion), uncontrolled growth (low residential densities, roadway expansion), and as-planned (following general plans, with roadway expansion). The integrated modeling framework links emissions to levels of travel pattern variations under different land use policy and development strategies. For example, compared to a scenario with highly controlled urban growth strategies, less restraint on urban growth results in more than a 20% increase in vehicle miles traveled and about 18% higher emissions of primary pollutants at the regional scale in year 2030. By means of comparing and connecting land use, travel patterns and emissions, the sensitivity of SJV mobile emission inventories to different possible growth scenarios can be assessed.

This paper describes such a ""group"" consisting of engineering college professors, administrators, and students who together create a dynamic organization aimed at increasing the representation of women within the engineering workforce. Although women serve as the target audience, the group of ""committed citizens"" consists of women and men with similar intrinsic motivators. In 2004, the team launched a new organization called WE@RIT (or Women in Engineering at RIT) and within a few months hosted their first pre-engineering outreach program aimed at an audience of twelve 6th and 7th grade girls. Over the past four years, the organization has grown significantly to include outreach activities for females from 4th through 11th grade, the TEAK (or Traveling Engineering Activity Kit) Program and companion website designed for 6th grade classroom use; a comprehensive recruitment strategy for 11th and 12th grade women; and an extensive community building program for current women engineering students. During the 2006/07 academic year, WE@RIT hosted over 1500 participants in their various program offerings with the support of 175 people, most of whom were volunteers. The organization and its programming flourish using a managed resource strategy in a climate where funding is limited. Student and faculty volunteers and/or student employees perform much of the effort involved in designing and administering various programs. A unique leadership structure allows a faculty member through work plan adjustment to serve as the program's executive director while a full-time coordinator handles daily program activities. In order to run the organization using resources effectively, the group created overall program goals with supporting program level objectives as well as program-level objectives. The structure allows the team to assess and evaluate various offerings or the entire program on a regular basis. There are few, if any, features of the organizational structure and resource management scheme that are school/region specific, and therefore elements of this organization and its management strategy are transferable. This paper describes a strategy that allows for deliberate organizational growth under limited resource conditions in the context of women in engineering. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2008.",,"Education; Engineering education; Students; Teaching; Dynamic organization; Engineering activities; Engineering colleges; Management strategies; Organizational structures; Recruitment strategies; Resource management schemes; Women in engineering; Professional aspects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029099209

These control scenarios are simulated with photochemical models, which use emissions and meteorological variables to simulate PM2.5 formation, transport, and deposition. A monitor study was established in the central United States to measure simultaneously the PM2.5 sulfate ion, nitrate ion, ammonium ion, and chemical precursor species sulfur dioxide, nitric acid, and ammonia during 2004. These data, combined with nearby meteorological observations, provide an opportunity to assess whether meteorological variables or deposition processes may introduce systematic biases in PM2.5 ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate predictions. Skill in estimating total wet deposition is assessed by comparing model output with National Atmospheric Deposition Program monitors in the region. Meteorological variables that are important for mass transport (wind vector) and thermodynamic chemistry (temperature and relative humidity) compare well to observations. A model sensitivity, in which the temperatures in the inorganic chemistry module are adjusted to compensate for an underprediction bias, shows a minimal model response in predicted PM2.5 ammonium nitrate. The dry deposition of sulfur dioxide seems to have a systematic impact on ambient estimates of sulfur dioxide in the photochemical model. An attempt to correlate bias and error in meteorological variables to bias and error in PM2.5 species showed the most relationship between relative humidity and temperature and ammonium nitraite.

It has been demonstrated that it is possible to reduce shrinkage and maximum temperature of the polymerizable system by adding powdered glassy carbon to surgical cement. The obtained polymer composite with glassy carbon has retained the properties of a viscoelastic material. Low-cycle fatigue tests have shown that cement modification with glassy carbon particles reduced its susceptibility to cyclic creep. The evidence for this is a minor change of the dynamic elasticity modulus of the modified cement with a simultaneously increasing number of load cycles. Through an appropriate selection of components, the PMMA - glassy carbon composite can achieve satisfactory durability, highly desirable by surgeons.","Glassy carbon; Linear shrinkage; Low cycle fatigue; Polymer composites; Polymerization temperature; Surgical cement","bone cement; carbon; poly(methyl methacrylate); surgical cement; unclassified drug; article; chemical modification; composite material; elasticity; material state; materials testing; physical chemistry; polymerization; prosthesis material; structure analysis; surface property; temperature; temperature measurement; total hip prosthesis; viscoelasticity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57749199515

Design/methodology/approach - Recent economic literature on carbon sequestration was reviewed to gather insights on the role of agriculture in greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. Results from the most salient studies were presented in an attempt to highlight the general consensus on producer-level responses to C sequestration incentives and the likely mechanisms used to facilitate C sequestration activities on agricultural soils. Findings - The likely economic potential of agriculture to store soil C appears to be considerably less than the technical potential. Terrestrial C sequestration is a readily implementable option for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and can provide mitigation comparable in cost to current abatement options in other industries. Despite considerable research to date, many aspects of terrestrial C sequestration in the USA are not well understood. Originality/value - The paper provides a useful synopsis of the terms and issues associated with C sequestration, and serves as an informative reference on the economics of C sequestration that will be useful as the USA debates future greenhouse gas emissions mitigation policies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Agriculture; Carbon; Economics; Soils; United States of America",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38149035905

CNG, Gen I and Gen II hybrid electric propulsion systems were compared on fuel economy, maintenance and operating costs per mile, and reliability. These comparisons are based upon comparable service years; the second year in service for CNG and Gen II hybrids, and the second and third years in service for the Gen I hybrids. Conventional diesel buses provided a baseline comparison for fuel economy. Both the CNG and hybrid propulsion systems are alternatives to standard diesel buses and allow for reductions in petroleum use and emissions (usually focused on reductions of particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen). The Gen I hybrid buses exhibited 88% and 37% higher fuel economy than CNG and conventional diesel buses, respectively. The average fuel economy for the Gen II hybrid buses was 5.9% lower than the Gen I hybrid buses. Fuel economy decreased for all bus groups during summer operation due to air conditioning load. However, the hybrids exhibited the most dramatic seasonal fluctuation. The average total maintenance cost per mile for the Gen II hybrid buses was 39% lower than the Gen I hybrid buses, while the CNG buses' average was 5% higher than the Gen I hybrid buses. Total propulsion-related systems maintenance costs per mile were 55% lower for the Gen II hybrid buses than the Gen I hybrid buses, while the CNG buses were 5% lower than the Gen I hybrid buses. The Gen I hybrids experienced a 4.8% traction battery failure rate per year during evaluation year 1, and a 3.3% failure rate per year during evaluation year 2. BAE Systems utilizes lead-acid chemistry Hawker batteries. Hybrid buses are expected to have reduced brake reline frequency because they use regenerative braking. The Gen I hybrid buses accumulated more than two times the mileage of the CNG buses before requiring their first brake reline. © 2008 SAE International.",,"Air conditioning; Brakes; Compressed natural gas; Costs; Electric batteries; Failure analysis; Fuel economy; Hybrid vehicles; Maintenance; Operating costs; Powertrains; Propulsion; Regenerative braking; Air conditioning load; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Hybrid propulsion systems; Hybrid-electric propulsion systems; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; New york city transits; Performance comparison; Seasonal fluctuations; Buses",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072485099

Using simulation, this paper establishes a simple law to predict fuel savings between two tire configurations, which appear to be almost independent of the usage and which depend on the difference of rolling resistance coefficients, the actual weight of the vehicle and the fuel type. This approach has been evaluated in practice for passenger car tires fitted on one gasoline and one Diesel Midsize car by performing rolling resistance tests, coast down tests, fuel consumption tests at constant speed and emissions recorded on a test bench. Even more than just validating the fuel savings prediction law, the test results also show how low rolling resistance tires can help to decrease CO2 emissions and local pollutants such as CO emissions for gasoline engines and NOx emissions for Diesel engines. This conclusion of simultaneous CO2 and NOx reduction has also been proven at constant speed on a heavy duty vehicle equipped with a gas analyzer.

To date CDM projects have been largely confined to schemes that control emission from landfill, but projects that avoid landfilling are beginning to be submitted. In considering the waste options which might be suitable for developing countries certain ones, such as energy from waste, have been discounted for a range of reasons related primarily to the lack of technical and other support services required for these more sophisticated process trains. The paper focuses on six options: the base case of open dumping; three options for landfill (passive venting, gas capture with flaring, and gas capture with energy production), composting and anaerobic digestion with electricity production and composting of the digestate. A range of assumptions were necessary for making the comparisons based on the effective carbon emissions, and these assumptions will change from project to project. The highest impact in terms of carbon emissions was from using a sanitary landfill without either gas flaring or electricity production; this was worse than the baseline case using open dumpsites. Landfills with either flaring or energy production from the collected gas both produced similar positive carbon emissions, but these were substantially lower than both open dumping and sanitary landfill without flaring or energy production. Composting or anaerobic digestion with energy production and composting of the digestate were the two best options with composting being neutral in terms of carbon emissions and anaerobic digestion being carbon negative. These generic conclusions were tested for sensitivity by modifying the input waste composition and were found to be robust, suggesting that subject to local study to confirm assumptions made, the opportunity for developing CDM projects to attract investment to improved waste management infrastructure is significant.

ENERGIRON technology from Danieli &amp; C. and Tenova HYL is characterized by its flexible process configuration, which is able to satisfy and exceed these requirements. In regions where either the high cost or low availability of natural gas work against this traditional energy source, the process is easily configured to operate using coke oven gas, syngas from coal gasifiers and other hydrocarbon sources. More importantly, the air and water effluents of the process are not only low but also easily controlled. Incorporation of selective carbon dioxide (CO2) removal systems has been a key factor over the past decade in significantly reducing the emissions levels, providing an additional source of revenue for the plant operator via the captured CO2. The high pressure operation and closed system of an ENERGIRON plant combined with the HYTEMP Pneumatic Transport System reduces dust emissions to both air and settling tanks, making the process more economical and environmentally friendly as well as reducing overall energy requirements for steel melting.

Wood heating is recommended in several countries as a climate change (CC) adaptation measure, mainly to increase the autonomy of households during power outages due to extreme climatic events. The aim of this study was to examine various perceptions and individual characteristics associated with wood heating through a survey about CC adaptations. Methods. A telephone survey (n = 2,545) of adults living in the southern part of the province of Québec (Canada) was conducted in the early fall season of 2005. The questionnaire used closed questions and measured the respondents' beliefs and current adaptations about CC. Calibration weighting was used to adjust the data analysis for the respondent's age and language under stratified sampling based on health regions. Results. More than three out of four respondents had access to a single source of energy at home, which was mainly electricity; 22.2% combined two sources or more; 18.5% heated with wood occasionally or daily during the winter. The prevalence of wood heating was higher in the peripheral regions than in the more urban regions, where there was a higher proportion of respondents living in apartments. The prevalence was also higher with participants completely disagreeing (38.5%) with the eventual prohibition of wood heating when there is smog in winter, compared to respondents somewhat disagreeing (24.2%) or agreeing (somewhat: 17.5%; completely: 10.4%) with the adoption of this strategy. It appears that the perception of living in a region susceptible to winter smog, smog warnings in the media, or the belief in the human contribution to CC, did not influence significantly wood heating practices. Conclusion. Increased residential wood heating could very well become a maladaptation to climate change, given its known consequences on winter smog and respiratory health. It would thus be appropriate to implement a long-term national program on improved and controlled residential wood heating. This would constitute a ""no-regrets"" adaptation to climate change, while reducing air pollution and its associated health impacts. © 2008 Bélanger et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"autumn; Canada; climate change; data analysis; electricity; energy resource; health belief; health survey; heating; human; language; population research; prevalence; questionnaire; residential area; review; smog; statistical significance; telephone; urban area; winter; wood heating; adult; aged; article; demography; female; greenhouse effect; housing; indoor air pollution; legal aspect; male; mass medium; methodology; middle aged; multivariate analysis; public opinion; smog; socioeconomics; statistics; wood; Adult; Aged; Air Pollution, Indoor; Female; Greenhouse Effect; Heating; Housing; Humans; Male; Mass Media; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Public Opinion; Quebec; Questionnaires; Residence Characteristics; Smog; Socioeconomic Factors; Wood",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47249165126

Four types of treatment processes were built including a biological reactor allowing to remove about 60-70% of the nitrogen content as gas by nitrification/denitrification. The addition of different mechanical separators (screw-press, centrifuge decanter ...) led to concentration of phosphorus in an exportable solid phase, allowing a reduction up to 80% of the phosphorus applied locally on soils. Moreover, a reduction of the gaseous emissions was observed using this management process as compared to conventional management (storage + land spreading) including ammonia (up to 68%) and greenhouse gases (55%). Finally, the level of enteric and pathogenic bacteria was also decreased with the treatment process as compared to conventional management systems.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation policies can provide ancillary benefits in terms of short-term improvements in air quality and associated health benefits. Several studies have analyzed the ancillary impacts of GHG policies for a variety of locations, pollutants, and policies. In this paper we review the existing evidence on ancillary health benefits relating to air pollution from various GHG strategies and provide a framework for such analysis. Methods. We evaluate techniques used in different stages of such research for estimation of: (1) changes in air pollutant concentrations; (2) avoided adverse health endpoints; and (3) economic valuation of health consequences. The limitations and merits of various methods are examined. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for ancillary benefits analysis and related research gaps in the relevant disciplines. Results: We found that to date most assessments have focused their analysis more heavily on one aspect of the framework (e.g., economic analysis). While a wide range of methods was applied to various policies and regions, results from multiple studies provide strong evidence that the short-term public health and economic benefits of ancillary benefits related to GHG mitigation strategies are substantial. Further, results of these analyses are likely to be underestimates because there are a number of important unquantified health and economic endpoints. Conclusion. Remaining challenges include integrating the understanding of the relative toxicity of particulate matter by components or sources, developing better estimates of public health and environmental impacts on selected sub-populations, and devising new methods for evaluating heretofore unquantified and non-monetized benefits. © 2008 Bell et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"air pollution control; air quality; climate change; cost benefit analysis; evaluation; greenhouse gas; health care policy; human; intermethod comparison; outcome assessment; particulate matter; public health; quality adjusted life year; review; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental health; greenhouse effect; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Health; Greenhouse Effect; Health Policy; Humans",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50249153016

The rapidly growing city of Lago Agrio is at one terminus of the recently constructed and controversial OCP Trans-Andean export pipeline and is the location of a legal dispute over impacts from petroleum development in the 1970s. In 2002, EnCana Corporation was faced with the difficult task of permitting and building a crude oil pipeline around this city to connect with OCP. EnCana analyzed thirteen different ROW alternatives, jointly with other petroleum companies interested in sharing the ROW to determine the three best alternatives. The goals were to minimize social and environmental impacts, allow for sharing of a ROW with four different oil companies, be compatible with the Lago Agrio plans for urban growth, and be economically and technical feasible.

Pipelines have been delayed in government permitting, communities have attempted to stop construction, legal actions have been initiated for environmental and community damages during and after construction, and operating pipelines have been sabotaged causing lost production and significant environmental damage from oil spills and significant social impact from contamination or explosions. AEC Ecuador Ltd., a subsidiary of EnCana Corporation (EnCana), and Walsh began evaluating strategies in 2002 for mitigating these costly impediments to permitting, building and operating a crude oil pipeline around the rapidly growing Amazonian city of Lago Agrio. A total of 13 different right-of-way (ROW) alternatives were investigated in the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment process to determine the three best and potentially least controversial routes. The Company encouraged four other petroleum producers to share a single ROW -a proposal without precedent in Ecuador - and a decision was made: all committed to use the same ROW to reduce social and environmental impacts from multiple ROWs crossing Lago Agrio. A comprehensive and transparent stakeholder engagement strategy was developed to facilitate community participation and evaluation of the three alternatives. The stakeholders included local, regional and national government; community councils and associations; non-governmental and religious organizations; and individual landowners. Field visits were conducted, technical presentations were provided, formal and informal comments were solicited and workshops were conducted to arrive at a hybrid alternative with micro routing around areas of stakeholder concern. A key strategic decision was made by the Company to maintain transparency throughout consultation process and flexibility in the final design, despite an atmosphere of continuous conflict stemming from another recently constructed pipeline in the city. The affected communities also participated directly in construction monitoring and environmental and social compliance assessment. Due to the high level of community acceptance and proactive environmental approach, the government regulators allowed for a special exemption from the hydrocarbon law to allow multiple pipelines in a single ROW and as consequence, the existing regulation was identified as outdated compared with current international industry practice for ROW. The pipelines in the ROW were constructed in 2003 with no public controversy and have been operating to date without incidents and without any complaint about the stakeholder strategy and methodology. There have been no legal challenges.

LLC (PSM), 1440 West Indiantown Rd, Jupiter, FL, 33458, United States","Increasingly restrictive emission regulations for gas turbines are driving key technology decisions across the United States and Europe. For example, in Texas, United States, regulations are forcing permit holders in certain non-attainment areas to ratchet down industrial oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission levels by over 80% by 2008. Improvements today in the technology of lean pre-mix combustion for gas turbines can result in reduction of NOx and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions to ultra-low levels without using Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR's) or Oxidation Catalysts (OCAT's); and often provides the end user with the most cost effective solution to addressing these requirements. This paper describes the demonstrated current field performance of a dry, lean-premixed combustion system developed for direct replacement in MS7E/EA gas turbines previously configured with either the OEM's DLN-1 combustion system or converted from a standard diffusion combustion system. The LEC-III® combustion system, developed by Power Systems Mfg. LLC (PSM), owned by Alstom, has proven sub-4ppm NOx and single digit CO emissions levels over the entire premix load operating range with natural gas fuel, from full load down to below 55% of full load conditions in customer machines. A recent conversion effort completed by PSM in 2006 &amp; 2007 now has five gas turbines currently operating at a Texas industrial power producer operating at below 4ppm NOx with the LEC-III system. The conversion scope will also be detailed. Dynamic pressure sensing instrumentation was installed on each combustion chamber to measure and record combustion dynamic oscillations or ""noise"" to optimize fuel splits within each combustor. Rugged construction and performance optimization enable the dynamics to be maintained within acceptable limits to ensure extended service intervals of over 16,000 equivalent fired hours. Detailed field-installed emissions results are provided for this Frame 7E/EA LEC-III site. Finally an overview of PSM's Combustion Technology Roadmap (CTR) will be discussed, which leverages their high-pressure, high-airflow test rig to evaluate technology improves with the objective of achieving guaranteed LEC-III combustion system NOx emissions below 3ppm NOx with low levels of CO.

The hydrogen project foresees the construction of a 11 MWe hydrogen-fed gas turbine able to couple high efficiency (fuel utilization) with low nitrogen-oxide emissions. The project (partly funded by Regione Veneto, a local authority in the North-East of Italy), will be built at Enel's coal-fired Fusina Power Plant [1]. The aim of a first demonstrative phase is to verify the correct operation of the gas turbine supplied by pure hydrogen and to acquire know-how of hydrogen combustion, safety aspects and control technologies in gas turbine cycles. In the second phase, the goal will be to optimize the combustion technology, paying particular attention to NOx emissions. To make hydrogen suitable for the electricity generation in an environmentally compatible manner, Enel is developing the Fusina's experimental power plant project. Since currently no commercial hydrogen burners are suitable for gas turbine power plants, both Enel and Nuovo Pignone are investigating feasible solutions for a hydrogen-fuelled low- NOx diffusion burner design. In this context, this paper presents the results from a CFD analysis showing the NOx reduction based on steam injection and burner minor modifications. An initial model with a coarse mesh and simple aerodynamic treatment was used to evaluate the NOx emissions with varying amount of steam injected into the combustion chamber. In the view of the following experimental campaign, some solutions have been selected after an initial tuning of the CFD model. Furthermore, a second CFD model based on a finer mesh and a detailed geometry discretization will enable a more precise investigation of the fluidynamic field. Results of the numerical model, which simulates a GE10 gas turbine combustor fuelled with pure hydrogen, are presented and compared with experimental tests at full scale and full pressure conditions.",,"Coal combustion; Computational fluid dynamics; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Gas turbines; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Mesh generation; Nitrogen oxides; Nuclear fuels; Technology transfer; Combustion technology; Electricity generation; Environmentally compatible; Experimental campaign; Gas turbine combustor; Geometry discretization; Heavy-duty gas turbines; Nitrogen oxide emissions; Gas turbine power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69949159783

Data from Zackenberg show that timing of snowmelt, the length of the growing season and summer temperature are the basic variables that determine the phenology of flowering and primary production upon which the herbivores depend, and snow may be the most important climatic factor affecting the different trophic levels and the interactions between them. Hence, the spatio-temporal distribution of snow, as well as thawing events during winter, may have considerable effects on the herbivores by influencing their access to forage in winter. During winter, musk oxen prefer areas with a thin snow-cover, where food is most easily accessible. In contrast, lemmings seek areas with thick snow-cover, which provide protection from the cold and some predators. Therefore, lemmings may be affected directly by both the timing of onset and the duration of winter snow-cover. Musk oxen significantly reduced the productivity of arctic willow, while high densities of collared lemmings during winter reduced the production of mountain avens flowers in the following summer. Under a deep snow-layer scenario, climate and the previous year's density of musk oxen had a negative effect on the present year's production of arctic willow. Previous year's primary production of arctic willow, in turn, significantly affected the present year's density of musk oxen positively. Climatic factors that affect primary production of plants indirectly, influenced the spatial distribution of herbivores. Additionally, snow distribution directly affected the distribution of herbivores, and hence, in turn, affected the plant community by selective feeding and locally reducing the standing biomass of forage plants. Although only few moth larvae were observed at Zackenberg, these had in some cases important local effects owing to their foraging on up to 60% of the flower stands on individual mountain avens. UV-B radiation induces plants to produce secondary plant metabolites, which protects tissues against UV-B damage. This results in lower production of anti-herbivore defenses and improves the nutritional quality of the food plants. Zackenberg data on the relationship between variation in density of collared lemmings in winter and UV-B radiation indirectly supports this mechanism, which was originally proposed on the basis of a positive relationship between UV-B radiation and reproduction in two sub-arctic species of hares (Lepus timidus and Lepus americanus). © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Some mining companies have also identified ancillary opportunity to sequester CO2 in their by-products; recent work in the alumina industry is a prime example. In addition to process plant emissions, mining companies are becoming increasingly aware of their overall carbon footprint, including CO2 generated during the production of utility power. New power plant designs, in various stages of development, include CO2 separation and sequestration techniques. This paper summarizes the state-of-the-art for these technologies; including integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plants.

Despite this, little work has been done on these assemblages and ochre source exploitation patterns are not well understood for either time period. Ochre, due to its heterogeneous nature, has often been thought not suitable for characterization and sourcing analysis. However, much success has been achieved sourcing Australian ochre using a variety of techniques. Similar analysis has rarely been carried out on South African ochre deposits and assemblages. This study examines the utility of ochre sourcing using a Middle-to-Latcr Stone Age ochre assemblage from Nelson Bay Cave on the Robberg Peninsula, South Africa. Archaeological ochre samples were subjected to both powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) in order to determine chemical and mineralogical composition. Using these techniques, several probable chemical groups were identified within the assemblage. This study suggests that it may be possible to match archaeological ochre fragments to specific geological deposits or regions of the landscape. In the future, such work will help to develop an understanding of ochre exploitation and transport in the Middle to Later Stone Age.","Later stone age; Middle stone age; Nelson bay cave; Ochre; Particle-induced x-ray emission (pixe); Sourcing; South africa; X-ray diffraction (xrd)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-60949329114

It is also desirable to optimise life-cycle emissions rather than local emissions only. However, using LCA results directly as an objective function gives sub-optimal designs, since inputs whose life-cycle emissions are easy to reduce are underused and vice-versa. We develop a method integrating LCA results in an optimisation framework, so that the optimal designs found are logically consistent with the aim of minimising global emissions. We then apply the method to the optimisation of a NGCC power plant with CO2 capture, optimising column dimensions, solvent flow and heat exchange configuration with respect to two functions: cost and life cycle global warming potential. This method of using LCA results has an actual benefit since the cost of reducing local emissions cannot be lower than for global emissions.","Carbon dioxide capture; Life cycle; Methodology; Multi-objective optimisation","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Design; Environmental design; Environmental impact; Global warming; Life cycle; Optimal systems; Carbon dioxide capture; Energy conversion systems; Environmental objectives; Global warming potential; Life cycle emissions; Methodology; Multi-objective design optimization; Objective functions; Multiobjective optimization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924282263

Mechanical separation allowed the following size-fractions to be obtained: fine fraction - mineral fraction of municipal solid waste (MFMSW) (Φ &lt; 20 mm), middle fraction - organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) (20 mm &lt; Φ &lt; 80 mm), and coarse fraction (Φ &gt; 80 mm). The most suitable fraction for biological treatment was OFMSW, containing about 76 % of high rate biodegradable organic fraction (HRBOF). The rate constant of degradation for organic compounds in OFMSW was 0.23 d-1. It was shown that total gas production (TGP) during 10 years may achieve 550 m3/Mg OFMSW. Mechanical pre-treatment may allow an 45 % decrease of the amount of landfilled MSW resulting in a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of up to 70 m3/Mg over 10 years of landfilling (in contrast to MSW landfilling - 213 m3/Mg).

The nadir emitted radiance has been measured down to 100 cm -1, thus covering a spectral interval that, until now, was nearly unexplored, and up to 1400 cm-1, including the well characterized atmospheric window region, in which it is possible to perform comparison and intercalibration with operative instruments. The measurements were performed at an altitude of 34 km, from a stratospheric balloon launched in tropical region, near Teresina (Brazil). The acquired spectra have a spectral resolution of 0.5 cm-1. It should be noted that despite the operating spectral range extending to the far-infrared region, REFIR-PAD does not require any cooled components, thanks to the use of pyroelectric detectors and an optical scheme that compensates for the instrument self-emission. This work shows the results of the analysis of the spectra, focusing on the far infrared portion of the atmospheric emitted radiance. The retrieval of the vertical profiles of water vapour and temperature during the flight is presented. The vertical resolution of the retrieval is 2 km in the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS) region, and lower at higher altitudes. The comparison with ECMWF for validation is also shown. Besides the characterization of temperature and water vapour, from the analysis of the emitted radiance useful information can be gathered about cloud and aerosol contribution to radiation budget.","Emission sounding; Far infrared spectroscopy; Fourier transform spectroscopy; Outgoing long-wave radiation; Water vapour","Emission spectroscopy; Fourier transforms; Infrared spectroscopy; Water vapor; Emission sounding; Outgoing long-wave radiation; Tropical engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41849116657

We measured nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, and plant and soil N content and isotopic composition with a manipulative experiment of temperature and fertilizer application. Infrared lamps were used to increase surface temperature by 3.5±1.3°C on average and control and heated plots were split into high and low fertilizer treatments. The N2O fluxes increased following fertilizer application and were also directly related to soil moisture. There was a positive effect of warming on N2O fluxes. Soils in the heated plots were enriched in nitrogen isotope ratio (δ15N) relative to control plots, consistent with greater gaseous losses of N. For all treatments, C4 plant C/N ratio was negatively correlated with plant δ15N, suggesting that low leaf N was associated with the use of isotopically depleted N sources such as mineralized organic matter. A significant and unexpected result was a large, rapid increase in the proportion of C4 plants in the heated plots relative to control plots, as measured by the carbon isotope ratio (δ13C) of total harvested aboveground biomass. The C4 plant biomass was dominated by crabgrass, a common weed in C3 fescue lawns. Our results suggest that an increase in temperature caused by climate change as well as the urban heat island effect may result in increases in N2O emissions from fertilized urban lawns. In addition, warming may exacerbate weed invasions, which may require more intensive management, e.g. herbicide application, to manage species composition. © Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.","C2 weeds; C3 and C4; Crabgrass; Fescue; Nitrous oxide; Turfgrass; Warming","aboveground biomass; carbon isotope; climate change; climate effect; fertilizer application; grass; heat island; isotopic composition; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen isotope; nitrous oxide; soil moisture; surface temperature; temperature effect; weed; North America; United States; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48849107483

At the same time, in a growing number of countries, the energy sector is going through a privatisation, deregulation and globalisation process which is affecting energy demand and fuel selection, driving gradual integration of energy markets and requiring new solutions. It is now also well recognized that pollution is often not a localized problem and that gaseous air pollutants can cross great distances. This has led to the cooperation between countries to control transboundary pollution, under bilateral or multilateral agreements. As for the energy sector, countries are not only becoming increasingly linked in political, economic and social terms but also in environmental terms. Power generators and equipment manufacturers have been developing technologies and business agreements in countries with respective legislation constraints over many years and take this trend of interdependence into account. The equipment manufacturers and global solution providers such as Alstom have become the focal point driving the development of new environmental compliance products and solutions within the fossil fuel based energy sector to meet these increasingly stringent emissions reduction requirements while extending the plant lifetime of existing power plants, and keeping them competitive. This paper gives an overview and outlook of environmental regulations, air pollution control technologies and some experience in pioneering environmental long-term service agreements. The most immediately effective way to ensure emissions compliance of existing power plant is obviously to professionally maintain and upgrade the plant in order to guarantee high availability and operating reliability. The second option is to take advantage of monitoring and control systems for continuous process supervision and optimisation. Regular monitoring and fine-tuning of the plant by an expert team using state of the art technology indeed guarantees the lowest possible emissions and energy consumption.

Formation of deposits within the holes of the injector nozzle or on the outside of the injector tip may have an adverse effect on overall system performance. This paper provides a critical review of the current understanding of the main factors affecting deposit formation. Two main types of engine test cycles, which attempt to simulate field conditions, are described in the literature. The first type involves cycling between high and low load. The second involves steady state operation at constant speed either at medium or high load. A number of influences on the creation of deposits are identified. This includes fouling through thermal condensation and cracking reactions at nozzle temperatures of around 300°C. Also the design of the injector holes is an influence, because it can influence cavitation. The implosion of cavitation bubbles is believed to limit nozzle deposits. Field and laboratory tests showed that small amounts (around 1ppm) of zinc tend to increase the formation of deposits and are therefore another influence. But it is not clear whether zinc acts catalytically to accelerate deposit formation or if it becomes part of the solid deposits. Bio-diesel has been observed to lead to higher deposit formation in the injector nozzle. The chemical and physical processes that lead to deposit formation are not known or well understood, due to their complexity. A physical mechanism put forward focuses on the role of the residual fuel that remains in the nozzle holes after the end of the injection process. © 2008 SAE International.",,"Cavitation; Condensation reactions; Fuels; Nozzles; Powertrains; Solid lubricants; Zinc; Cracking reactions; Diesel injector nozzles; Emissions regulations; Field and laboratory test; Nozzle temperature; Operating environment; Steady-state operation; Thermal condensation; Deposits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072476968

Here idealized ensemble forecasting experiments are used to show that these methods are liable to produce systematically unreliable probability forecasts of climatologically extreme weather. It is argued that the failure of these methods is linked to an assumption that the distribution of truth given the forecast can be sampled by adding stochastic perturbations to state estimates, even when these state estimates have a realistic climate. It is shown that this assumption is incorrect, and it is argued that such dressing techniques better describe the likelihood distribution of historical ensemble-mean forecasts given the truth for certain values of the truth. This paradigm shift leads to an approach that incorporates prior climatological information into BMA ensemble postprocessing through Bayes's theorem. This new approach is shown to cure BMA's ill treatment of extreme weather by providing a posterior BMA distribution whose probabilistic forecasts are reliable for both extreme and nonextreme weather forecasts. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"Bayesian Model Averaging; Climatological informations; Ensemble forecasting; Ensemble forecasts; Ensemble members; Ensemble postprocessings; Extreme weathers; Likelihood distributions; New approaches; Paradigm shifts; Probabilistic forecasts; Probability densities; Probability forecasts; State estimates; Stochastic perturbations; Weather forecasts; Bayesian networks; Probability distributions; State estimation; Weather forecasting; Probability density function; Bayesian analysis; climate modeling; ensemble forecasting; estimation method; experimental study; paradigm shift; probability density function; reliability analysis; theoretical study; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-64149099829

The main purpose of this study was to determine the impact of temperature perturbations on urban and regional ozone concentrations and its distribution in South Texas. A regional photochemical model was employed to study the influence of the increase in temperature on tropospheric ozone for a high ozone episode of September 13-20, 1999. The temperatures were increased uniformly throughout the modeling domain and through the vertical layers by 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 °C, respectively, in line with the anticipated enhancements of global temperature as predicted in the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. These temperature perturbations represented the worst case consequences of extreme climate change in this region and produced significant enhancements in the peak ozone concentrations. The greatest amplification in maximum 8 hr ozone concentrations in South Texas for the 6 °C temperature perturbation scenario was approximately 8 ppb with pockets of urban areas exhibiting the largest increases on a spatio-temporal basis. In addition, trans-boundary flux from the Houston-Galveston industrialized region played a major role in supplementing the ozone concentrations in the study region under the perturbed temperature scenarios.","And near non-attainment area; Climate change; Ozone; Temperature perturbation, photochemical modelling","And near non-attainment area; Global temperatures; Houston; In lines; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Ozone concentrations; Ozone episodes; Ozone levels; Peak ozone concentrations; Photochemical models; Spatio temporals; Temperature perturbation, photochemical modelling; Trans boundaries; Tropospheric ozones; Urban areas; Worst case; Amplification; Climate change; Concentration (process); Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Ozone; Ozone layer; Atmospheric temperature",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62449175351

Such an approach, however, was not applicable to the contamination transport environment [to be] encountered by the NASA Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) during surface operations on the Red Planet. For MSL, we required an understanding of contaminant transport under the Mars-ambient conditions of an approximately 8 Torr CO2 atmosphere in order to provide traceability between hardware outgassing limits and the allowable vapor-phase contaminant concentrations in the vicinity of atmospheric sampling sensors and deposition to prospective solid sample sites on the Martian surface. In setting outgassing requirements for the MSL surface system, an engineering upper-bound estimate - rather than a precise result based on an all-inclusive simulation of the dynamic flow field - of the local contamination density was needed. Here we describe a 3-D, low-speed computational fluid dynamics approach, including molecular diffusion, to determine mixing ratios of contaminants at the atmospheric sample inlets and solid sample inlet deposition rates. Turbulence enhances the effective diffusion, leading to the dilution of the volatile contaminants, which reduces contamination concentration at a distance far from the source in comparison to inviscid or laminar flow fields: Therefore, the approach employed here results in a conservative upper bound compared to one in which turbulence is explicitly addressed. Because contaminant transport in this environment (Peclet number in the range of 50-1000) is advection dominated, spatial contamination concentration is a strongly-peaked function of the wind direction. Results of sample calculations for expected Mar wind speeds (u = 1-20 m/s) and several wind directions are presented.

Such dust dispersion can be a serious nuisance as well as a health hazard to inhabitants and animals in nearby settlements. It can also degrade crops, making them less marketable, and pollute soil, surface water and ground water. Wind can seasonally erode waste impoundments in all types of climate, but the erosion intensifies and persists for more of each year as regional aridity increases. As clouds of dust are often observed billowing across the top surfaces of waste impoundments in dry windy weather, there is a common misconception that dust arises from erosion of the top surface of an impoundment, resulting in much effort and money being misspent on top treatments when in fact the sloped sides of the impoundments are the true source of blown dust. This paper offers a brief review of general waste impoundment wind erosion issues and then focuses in more detail on the mechanics of how wind erodes surfaces of waste impoundments.

As HCCI combustion lacks direct ignition timing control and auto-ignition depends on the operating condition, control of auto-ignition is necessary. Since auto-ignition of a homogeneous mixture is very sensitive to operating conditions, a fast combustion phasing control is necessary for reliable operation. To this purpose, HCCI modeling and model-based control with experimental validation were studied. A six-cylinder heavy-duty HCCI engine was controlled on a cycle-to-cycle basis in real time by applying in-cylinder pressure feedback. A low-complexity physical model was developed, aiming at describing the major thermodynamic and chemical interactions in the course of an engine stroke. The model shows the importance of thermal interaction between the combustion and the cylinder walls. The model was used to synthesize a controller for controlling the combustion phasing by varying the inlet valve closing and the inlet temperature. The synthesized controller behaves well both in steady-state and during step changes of the desired combustion phasing.

Our paper does not seek to comment on or clarify the issue of whether climate change is real or is of the magnitude that society generally believes. However, given the current status of societal belief that this is an issue that requires immediate intervention, the issue of climate change regulation and its potential impacts to the cement industry are realities that must be managed. The rapid developments in the area of climate change have the potential to impact many sectors in widely varying ways. And, for sectors such as the portland cement industry, it is crucial to have an in-depth understanding of the changing regulatory landscape, how scenarios may play out, and how companies should be positioning themselves to mitigate future climate risk. This paper provides a review of key federal, state and international legislation with the objective of summarizing what operators of cement plants in the US may face as legislation becomes regulation over the next several years. For example, this paper will discuss how the cement industry might fare with the allocation or auction of allowances and ""upstream"" versus quot;downstream"" regulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Specific federal bills are reviewed with a lens on how future requirements could play out for the portland cement industry. In addition, we discuss the implications should U.S. EPA regulate CO2 as a National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). In addition to the federal perspective, this paper reviews states that are implementing GHG reporting and reduction requirements. States with notable activity such as California and Florida will be highlighted with brief discussions on proposed and final regulatory requirements and impacts on recordkeeping, reporting, and energy costs in the portland cement industry. This paper explores how portland cement companies are managing climate risk by implementing energy efficiency initiatives, planning for GHG emissions reductions, and evaluating external offset projects. Specific examples will be provided of how GHG reductions are managed and offset projects are evaluated. Finally, our paper concludes with suggested actions and considerations that cement producers should understand in the short-tem and long-term to navigate the complex regulatory regime that climate change will likely be. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Climate changes; Technical conferences; Cement manufacture; Cement plants; Cements; Climate control; Climatology; Environmental Protection Agency; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Industry; Laws and legislation; Portland cement; Rivers; Cement industry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50649105037

The intended market transformation of the LEED™ Certification system appears to be working. Statistics show that the numbers of certified green buildings in both the United States and Canada are increasing at an exponential rate. The proposed changes to the USGBC version of LEED™-2009/V.3-are intended to support changes in the system that recognize differences in credit values as well as regionalized differences in the required approach to green building. The introduction of LEED™ for Homes and Neighborhoods has extended the potential influence of the program beyond the original commercial building marketing target. ASHRAE's proposed Standard 189.1 is also taking aim at increasing the standards for high-performance Buildings of a non low-rise residential variety. However, with continuing environmental degradation, and more recent escalating concerns about global warming and CO2 levels in the environment, it is becoming clear that even the highest standards of construction that are being implemented in North America today are simply not enough. While the design and construction industries in the United States and Canada scramble to adopt and evolve green building guidelines such as LEED™ to increase their rigor and range of applicability, the United Kingdom is advancing in the implementation of regulations that are specifically intended to control carbon emissions, and not just for commercial buildings. Great Britain has already adopted policies that require all new housing stock to be carbon neutral by the year 2016. They are working towards the implementation of carbon taxes to motivate companies to look closely at the way that they consume energy and goods, and reward citizens that show initiative in responding to this crisis. The act of carbon counting is beginning to permeate a multitude of sectors in the UK. The issue of carbon is not a simple one. There is carbon involved in the extraction of the resources that we use to create products; in the transportation of these products to the site; in the physical construction of the buildings; in the operation of buildings; and in the lives of people as they carry on business. In order to be able to reach a state of carbon neutrality, lifestyle changes will be necessary. The status quo cannot be simply modified to reduce its carbon cost. Consumption patterns must change. Buildings and their programs may require downsizing or creative reinvention. Understanding the definitions of the terms that are associated with this elevated movement is important.

As in previous work, we use SVMs to estimate emission probabilities in the context of an SVM/HMM system. However, training pairwise classifiers to discriminate between some of the HMM-states of very close phonetic classes produce unsatisfactory results. We propose a data-driven approach for selecting the HMM-states for which SVMs are trained and those ones that are implicitly tied. Additionally we introduce an algorithm that is incorporated into the decoder for dynamically selecting the subset of SVMs used to estimate the emission probabilities. This algorithm reduces the number of SVMs evaluated at the frame level dramatically while preserving recognition accuracy. We present results in a very challenging corpora composed of children's speech. Our approach not only outperforms comparable GMM/HMM based systems but other SVM/HMM systems proposed to date.

For this reason long-term datasets of phenology and meteorological data are important for understanding how vegetation responded to past climate and predicting the response of plants to future climate change. Most studies focus on changes in the natural vegetation, whereas, despite their potential economic importance, only a few deal with trends in agricultural and horticultural varieties (Chmielewsky et al., 2004). Obviously, the ongoing warming trend has had measurable impacts on the growth and yield of field crops, but the size and extent of the impacts have differed spatially and temporally. There is a clear need to synthesize crop yield and climate data from different areas to provide critically needed observational constraints on projections of the impacts of both climate change and management practices on future food production (Lobell and Asner, 2003). Starting from a meteorological dataset (1956-2007) and 3 years (2005-2007) of phenological observations on maize crop in 4 representative stations across Veneto region, in north-eastern Italy, an analysis of the effect of climate change was conducted to investigate whether the changes have had significant impact on the growth and yield of maize, which is one of the staple crops in the region. © 2008, Page Press Publications.

In most cases the level of ethanol in gasoline does not exceed 10%. In some parts of the Unites States, E85 fuel consisting of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline is commonly available. Many US vehicles sold today are specially adapted for use of both gasoline and high ethanol fuels; so-called Flexible Fuel Vehicles (FFV). While high ethanol fuels are currently a small percentage of the overall gasoline pool, they provide an interesting opportunity to study the effects that ethanol use in gasoline may have on lubricant related performance. Based on past industry experience with methanol based fuel, theoretical areas of concern for ethanol based fuels are valve train rust and potential problems associated with high amounts of water in the lubricant. The authors have studied the lubricant related effects of E85 use in well controlled field testing under cold climate conditions. It is concluded that the use of E85 fuel leads to significantly higher water levels in the lubricant as compared to the use of gasoline.

The overall aims are to quantify the potential environmental effects when current waste handling and transportation fuel systems are replaced. A general conclusion is that the indirect environmental benefits (e.g. reduced emissions of ammonia and methane, and nitrogen leaching) from altered handling of organic waste materials and land-use may often significantly exceed the direct environmental benefits achieved when biogas replaces petrol (e.g. reduced emissions of carbon dioxide and air pollutants). Such indirect benefits are seldom considered when biogas is evaluated from an environmental point of view.

The removal effectiveness of the vapor-phase biofilter on methanol, formaldehyde, phenol, and 1-methoxy-2-propanol was equivalent to that of an RTO. Removal was also significantly higher than was required by any environmental regulation that governed the process to be installed. The pilot unit showed that phenol would not be toxic to the microorganisms. Periodic shutdowns had no impact on the control efficiency, even if the shutdown lasted for 4 day. This was contrary to 3M experiences with a mulch filled biofilter. The micro-organisms would actually destroy the organic compounds, rather than just be a transfer of the compounds from one media, i.e., air, to another, i.e., water. This point was a particular concern due to a city wastewater ordinance that limited the concentration of phenol in the wastewater. Reduced greenhouse gas emissions by around 600 ton/yr were obtained when compared to an RTO. About$500,000/yr in natural gas costs were saved upon installation of the biooxidation system.

However up to now, this coupling has been hardly investigated through numerical techniques. A CFD model was thus implemented to investigate the airflow and temperature patterns inside a glasshouse during daytime, by solving simultaneously the radiative transfer and the energy equations. Simulations were carried out on a four-span compartmentalised glasshouse. The greenhouse was covered with a 4 mm thick horticulture glass and equipped with continuous roof vents. A two dimensional steady state CFD model was developed by using commercial software. The mathematical model solves the Navier-Stokes equations with the Boussinesq assumption and a k-ε turbulence model. Solar and atmospheric radiations are included by using a bi-band (distinguishing short and long wave length) radiation model. The analysis focuses not only on the ventilation rate but also on the heterogeneity of the climatic parameters in the canopy vicinity. The model was first partially validated by comparing measured and simulated temperatures inside the greenhouse and along the walls. Numerical predictions of the climate were then obtained for various ventilator configurations (windward only, leeward only and a combination of both). They offer a detailed view of the spatial velocity and temperature distributions and can be used as a tool to assess the characteristics of the ventilation process. The windward vent case generates the highest ventilation rate; nevertheless, the symmetric case ensures a better homogenization of the temperature and velocity. The best compromise between ventilation and homogenization of climatic parameters at the plant level is found by combining a windward roof vent for the windward span and symmetric roof vents for the rest of the greenhouse.","CFD modelling; Inside climate heterogeneity; Sky and solar radiation",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71449115258

In addition, several air quality studies have identified increased concentration levels of certain pollutants near high traffic volume roads. The U.S. Environmental Protection. Agency (EPA) has begun a research program investigating the relationship of traffic activity, environmental conditions, and near road air quality. As part of this program, the EPA is investigating the influence of noise barriers, vegetation, and other roadside structures on air pollutant concentrations near the road. This presentation integrates results from an. air quality modeling assessment and air quality monitoring measurements to identify how noise barriers and vegetation near roads may impact local air quality. Air quality measurements were collected at sites with and without noise barriers and vegetation along a stretch of limited access highway in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA during the summer of 2006. This study allowed an assessment of the potential influence of these structures on near-road air quality. These structures influence pollutant transport and dispersion in the near-field (<300 m). Preliminary results suggest that, under some meteorological conditions, noise barriers and vegetation may reduce air pollutant concentration levels downwind of the barrier. These results may provide useful information in assessing the role of roadside structures on near road air quality for future land use decisions.

Laser produced plasma systems have been developed as a viable approach for the EUV scanner light source for optical imaging of circuit features at sub-32nm and beyond nodes on the ITRS roadmap. Recent advances in the development of the system, its present average output power level and progress with various subcomponents is discussed. We present the latest results on peak EUV and average EUV power as well as stability of EUV output, measured in burst-mode operation at the nominal repetition rate of the light source. In addition, our progress in developing of critical components, such as normal-incidence EUV collector and liquid-target delivery system is described. We also report on dose stability, plasma position stability and EUV distribution at the output region of the source. This presentation reviews the experimental results obtained on systems with a focus on the topics most critical for an HVM source. The capability to scale LPP power by further development of the high power CO2 drive laser in order to increase duty cycle and duration of continuous light source operation is shown. Production systems with thermal management and capable of 5 sr light collection are being assembled and tested. A description of the development of a normal-incidence ellipsoidal collector is included. Improvements in substrate quality lead to increased EUV reflectance of the mirror. Results on the generation of liquid tin droplets as target material for efficient plasma generation are also described. The droplet generator serves as a key element in the precise and spatially stable delivery of small quantities of liquid tin at high repetition rates. We describe a protection module at the intermediate focus (IF) region of the source and imaging of the EUV distribution using a sub-aperture collector and a fluorescent screen.

Mickiewicza 30, 30-059 Krakow, Poland","This paper outlines a theoretical method of finding 3D velocity fields and methane and dust concentrations in the air in blind drifts with a force-exhaust overlap ventilation system incorporating a forcing duct with a vortex duct and an auxiliary exhaust duct with the dust separator. The solution is supported by equations and simulation programs utilizing the CFD approach. The air and methane mixture is assumed to be an ideal and compressible gas, its motion is taken to be steady and the whole process is assumed to be isothermal. Fresh air is assumed to be a three-component mixture of nitrogen, oxygen and water vapour. The problem considered in this study is described with continuity equations, Navier- Stokes equations, k-s model equations as well as transport equations of chemical species (components of air-methan mixture). Calculation data are presented in the form of velocity field images, streamlines and mass fractions of CH4. Fig. 2 shows velocity distributions in the selected drift cross-sections in the considered flow region (Fig. 1). The air vortex, generated by the vortex duct, moves towards the face head and in the direction of the overlap zone. The actual division of the air stream depends on the ratio of air volume supplied to the overlap zone to that supplied to the face region. The air jet leaving the dust separatpr installation produces in its wake a zone of about 15 m, dominated by recirculation flow. Fig. 4 shows the distribution of mass fractions of methane, assuming that methane should enter via the face region and via the belt-shaped section in the floor, in the central part of the overlap zone. Apart from expected methane concentration levels near the roof (in the face region), there are other methane concentration zones caused by flow obstacles, such as continuous mining machines and forsing duct system here located near the side walls. This is associated with the development of low-intensity airing zones, where methane concentrations are higher. The flow of air-solid particles mixture is governed by the two-phase Euler-Lagrange's model with the gaseous continuous phase and a dispersed phase comprising solid (dust) particles. Apart from solving the equations of mass, momentum and energy conservation for the continuous phase, the model utilizes the trajectories of dispersed phase particles. It is assumed that dust is emitted from the face head surface. Images of several hundred particles' trajectories, originating in the face head section, are shown in Figs 5, 6. Small ratio of air in the overlap zone helps contain the dust cloud in the face region. As the amounts of air in the overlap zone increase, the highly dusted zone enlarges, too. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the dust measurement and calculation data in the selected drift locations and the length of time that solid particles remain in the face zone. In qualitative terms, simulation data obtained using the Euler-Lagrange's two-phase flow model are consistent with the data quoted in literature and with practical observations. A full quantitative analysis, however, would require us to find the degree of correspondence between the simulation and experimental data. Calculations are supported by the program FLUENT 6.1.","Blind drifts ventilation; CFD simulation; Unerground ventilation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954871390

An implication of the paradigm shift is that there should be a concomitant expansion of the policy agendas of the international climate and trade regimes. The traditional North-South paradigm of technology transfer ignores the increasing importance of developing countries as sources of advanced climate-friendly technologies, and therefore ignores South-North and South-South transfers. Further, whereas the North-South paradigm has emphasized developing countries' intellectual property rights policies as barriers to technology transfers, the 'global' paradigm focuses attention on trade and investment policy barriers, including developed countries' policies that inhibit technology transfer from developing countries. The analysis is relevant to international negotiations in the post-2012 climate regime, and is also relevant to the future development of the trade regime - not only at the multilateral level in the WTO, but also at the regional and bilateral levels. © 2008 Earthscan.","Climate change; Climate policy; North-South; Post-2012; South-South; Tacit knowledge; Technology transfer; Trade and investment policy","climate change; developing world; environmental policy; environmental technology; intellectual property rights; North-South relations; paradigm shift; technology transfer; trade-environment relations; World Trade Organization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54749126288

GOSAT is scheduled to be launched in 2009 to monitor column amounts of CO2 and CH4. A nadir-looking Fourier-Transform Spectrometer (FTS) of Short Wavelength Infrared (SWIR, 1.6 microns and 2 microns) and 0.76 microns oxygen A-band regions are mounted on GOSAT. We focus on the methane retrievals from 1.67 μm spectral band under conditions of strong optical path modification due to atmospheric scattering. First, the algorithm of spectral channel selection is proposed to reduce the effects of uncertainties in water vapor content and solar spectrum. Two techniques for the atmospheric scattering correction are compared: one uses CO2 as a proxy gas; the second is based on the simple parameterization of photon path-length probability density function (PPDF). The latter technique includes the following steps: estimation of PPDF parameters from radiance spectra in the O2 A-band and 2.0 -μm CO2 band, the necessary correction to use these estimated parameters in the 1.58-μm CO2 and 1.67-μm CH4 bands; and, finally, CO2 and methane retrievals. Both approaches were verified by numerical simulations using an independent radiative transfer approach to produce radiance spectra expected for the GOSAT sensor.

This is likely due to the fact that nuclear energy is an 'environmental alternative' to fossil fuel plants that emit greenhouse gases (GHG). Nuclear power also has a much higher energy density output than other alternative energy sources such as solar, wind, and biomass energies. There is also growing consensus that processing of low- and high-level waste, LLW and HLW respectively, is a political issue rather than a technical challenge. Prudent implementation of a closed fuel cycle not only curbs build-up of GHGs, but can equally mitigate the need to store nuclear used fuel. The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) is promoting gradual integration of fuel reprocessing, and deployment of fast reactors (FRs) into the global fleet for long-term uranium resource usage. The use of mixed oxide (MOX) fuel burning Light Water Reactors (LWR) has also been suggested by fuel cycle researchers. This study concentrated on modeling the construction and decommissioning rates of six major facilities comprising the nuclear fuel cycle, as follows: (1) current LWRs decommissioned at 60-years service life, (2) new LWRs burning MOX fuel, (3) new (Gen' III+) LWRs to replace units and/or be added to the fleet, (4) new FRs to be added to the fleet, (5) new reprocessing and MOX fuel fabrication facilities and (6) new LWR fuel fabrication facilities. Our initial work [1] focused on modeling the construction and decommissioning rates of reactors to be deployed. This is being followed with a 'mass flow model', starting from uranium ore and following it to spent forms. The visual dynamic modeling program Vensim was used to create a system of equations and variables to track the mass flows from enrichment, fabrication, burn-up, and the back-end of the fuel cycle. Sensible construction and deployment rates were benchmarked against recent reports and then plausible scenarios considered parametrically. The timeline starts in 2007 and extends in a preliminary model to 2057; a further mass flow model scenario continues until 2107. The scenarios considered provide estimates of the uranium ore requirements, quantities of LLW and HLW production, and waste storage volume needs. The results of this study suggest the number of reprocessing facilities necessary to stabilize and/or reduce recently reported levels of spent fuel inventory. Preliminary results indicate that the entire national spent fuel inventory produced over the next -50 years can be reprocessed by a reprocessing plant construction rate of less than 0.07 plants/year (small capacity) or less than 0.05 plants /year (large capacity).

The existing data and models produce very variable emission factors, also according to climate, sanding conditions, road material; thereby, a more general approach, based on the use of traffic tracer such as CO and NOx, can be put into practice in order to have a reliable assessment of PM emissions. Within the tracer approach, the definition of the background concentration of pollutants is of prime importance but representative measurements could be not at disposal. The present work is an attempt to define background concentration by considering the average concentration measured in an urban area during the night (0-5 am), when traffic and industrial instantaneous contribution are negligible and the heating plants are switched off. The so called night method has been tested and validated by means of the OSPM model, an atmospheric dispersion model studied for street canyons, for CO and NOx. In the case of CO, the results were surprisingly satisfactory and the method could be considered consistent, whereas NOx turned out to be not reliable as a tracer because of the chemical reactions that occur in the troposphere.","Air quality; Atmospheric modelling; Background concentration; CO; OSPM; Traffic; Tropospheric chemistry","air quality; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric modeling; concentration (composition); dispersion; particulate matter; traffic emission; troposphere; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58849100376

Since 1995 more than 20 European countries have instituted tolls on heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) using national roadways. The motivations are several; expanding sources of revenue beyond the gas tax, managing demand for road space, encouraging efficient operations, leveling the tax burden on haulers registered in different countries, and reducing CO2 emissions. This paper first provides a brief overview of various toll systems in use, then focuses on the German experience as a potential model for the United States. The innovative German system combines a Global Positioning System onboard unit with mobile communications technology. In its launch year, 2005, Germany collected €2.87 billion for 23.9 billion vehicle kilometers (35% by foreign trucks) tolled an average of €.12/km for autobahn use. Support of the German trucking industry was achieved through measures to increase competitiveness with foreign shippers. The toll system's first 2 years of operation indicate that avoidance traffic is a minor issue, that potential for modal shift to rail has yet to be realized, and that subsidies for clean vehicle purchase have helped reduce the pollution of the German HGV fleet.",,"Automobiles; Competition; Fleet operations; Roads and streets; Toll highways; Truck transportation; Vehicles; Wireless networks; European countries; Germany; Mobile communications; Potential modeling; Private capital; Private partnerships; Road networks; Toll system; Transport infrastructures; Truck traffic; Trucking industries; United States; Trucks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58449134312

Regional plans and associated onground investment have the potential to have widespread and long-lasting environmental, economic and social impacts. However, rarely are these impacts quantified and clearly understood. In this chapter we describe part of a large integrated project called the Lower Murray Landscape Futures (LMLF) which aimed to assess the impact of regional plans for the Lower Murray on selected environmental and socioeconomic indicators under alternative future landscape scenarios with input from stakeholders. The dryland component of the LMLF is a large-scale integrated regional planning and landscape futures analysis focussing on issues such as: agricultural production including food, fibre and bioenergy production; soil erosion; loss of terrestrial biodiversity; rising watertables; and the salinisation of the land and waterways. The project was designed to be inclusive and engender collaboration amongst researchers, participation by regional stakeholders, and communication to regional stakeholders and communities. The intention is to provide useful evidence-based natural resourcemanagement planning advice to regional agencies. Landscape futures are plausible spatial arrangements of management actions (vegetation management, ecological restoration, conservation farming, deep-rooted perennials, biomass, and biofuels) that achieve regional natural resource management targets, assessed under six policy options and five climatic and economic scenarios. The triple bottom line impacts of landscape futures under each scenario and policy option were then assessed and visualised. The costs and benefits of landscape futures were compared and the trade-offs assessed to inform regional planning in the Lower Murray. © 2008, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Biomass; Conservation; Economic and social effects; Economics; Electric power system interconnection; Investments; Natural resources management; Planning; Regional planning; Agricultural productions; Bioenergy productions; Ecological restoration; Environmental conditions; Natural resource management; Socio-economic indicators; Terrestrial biodiversity; Vegetation management; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028871554

Recent ACARE propositions drive the aircraft industry towards drastic emission reductions (80% reduction of NOx, 50% of CO2 in 2020) and ICAO constraints are becoming more and more stringent concerning community noise. In this context, designing a ""green"" supersonic business jet (SSBJ) which by nature burns much more fuel and generates more noise than its subsonic counterpart is becoming more difficult than ever. A good way to reduce the environmental impact of such an aircraft is to optimize its aerodynamic efficiency. This is one of the major objectives of the European Project HISAC which aims at assessing the technical feasibility of an environmentally compliant SSBJ. As leader of HISAC, Dassault Aviation coordinated the wind tunnel testing activity that was conducted within this project. In 2007, two aircraft models were manufactured and tested in high speed regime (up to Mach 1.8) at ONERA S2MA (France) and TsAGI T-128 (Russia), and in low speed regime at RUAG LWTE (Switzerland). These three test campaigns enabled to set up a large experimental database which was then used to calibrate and validate CFD codes. The purpose of this paper is to draw a comparison between numerical results obtained by Dassault Aviation's state-of-the-art aerodynamic computer code AETHER (3D Navier-Stokes) and wind tunnel test data. This analysis allows for code improvement, calibration and validation. It will be shown that today available CFD results match remarkably well experimental data, thus validating Dassault Aviation's aerodynamic assessment tools.

With the widespread implementation of distributed control systems, and especially centralized SCADA in the water sector, beginning in the 1980s, utilities had the technical tools to begin to realize this objective. In the US, an estimated three percent of all electricity production is consumed by water and wastewater systems, with more than 90% of the energy purchased being used for pumping. A prudent utility will make every effort to specify and install the most energy efficient pumps for the application, as well as to operate pumps in the most cost efficient manner possible. Climate change is an issue of growing international concern. Many governments and organizations have recognized this and are now seeking ways to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), in particular carbon dioxide (CO2). Generation of electricity through fossil fuels or coal burning plants are prime contributors to GHG emissions. It follows that if a water utility desires to minimize its carbon footprint, one way to do so would be to reduce net energy consumption through operation of pumps at greater efficiencies. An energy management system (EMS), if properly designed can supplement the SCADA system to enable plant operations and planning personnel to both reduce their electricity bills and to minimize total energy consumption, thereby resulting in a net reduction in CO2 emissions. This paper describes four case studies of energy management systems in the US and the impact each of these have had on reducing the carbon footprint of the respective water utility. The process of estimating the impact based on energy efficiency measurement followed by analysis of each state's energy production and fuel mix is presented as well as the results achieved following the first full year of operation. © 2008 American Water Works Association.","Energy efficiency; Green house gases; Operations optimization; Pump scheduling; Real time","Advanced control; CO2 emissions; Coal-burning plant; Cost-efficient; Electricity bill; Electricity production; Energy efficiency measurements; Energy efficient; Energy management system; Energy productions; Fuel mix; GHG emission; Net energy consumption; Operations optimization; Plant operations; Pump scheduling; Real time; Technical tools; Total energy consumption; Water and wastewater; Water sector; Water utility; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Exhibitions; Fossil fuels; Human resource management; Management; Pumps; SCADA systems; Water quality; Water supply; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871788490

The question addressed in this article is where to locate the point of compliance in the electricity sector - where in the supply chain linking fuel suppliers to generators to the transmission system to retail load-serving entities should the obligation for measurement and compliance be placed? This problem is examined in the specific context of California's legislative requirements and particular energy markets, with the implications of the different policy options explored.

For O2, a CO2 atmosphere or mixed solvent containing CO2 is safer than an N2 blanket, leading to many possible uses for such systems.

Two options have been widely discussed for implementing cap-and-trade in the electricity industry. The first is to regulate the emissions from electricity at the load-serving entity (LSE) level. The second option for implementation of cap-and-trade has been called the 'first-seller' approach. Conceptually, under first-seller, individual sources (i.e. power plants) within California would be responsible for their emissions, as with traditional cap-and-trade systems. Emissions from imports would be assigned to the 'importing firm'. An option that has not been as widely discussed is to implement a pure source-based system within California, effectively excluding imports from the cap-and-trade system altogether.

Theoretical considerations predict that cooling takes place from these emitters if the electron emission is governed by resonant tunneling. Resonant tunneling manifests itself by a saturation behavior in the I-V curve. Maximum cooling should take place near the saturation region. A thermally insulating test system was configured capable of measuring temperature changes in the millikelvin range. For the test sample, at an emission current of about 10 μA, which is the current where saturation is observed, a reduction in the temperature of about 0.01 °C is obtained. The reduction in temperature is attributed to cooling. © 2008 American Vacuum Society.",,"Electronic cooling; Graphite field emitters; Cooling; Graphite; Nanocrystalline materials; Resonance; Field emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41549121923

This time, however, consumers will almost certainly continue to demand that hotels join other commercial real estate operators in constructing and operating their buildings in accordance with standards established by the U.S. Green Building Council. The so-called LEED standards (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) are the basis of certification for qualifying buildings. Governments are beginning to mandate reduced energy use and emissions. Whereas building a green hotel used to cost a premium, current studies show that the cost of building to LEED standards is not greater than conventional approaches, while those buildings are healthier for occupants and less expensive to operate. Although retrofitting buildings does save energy, a better approach is to construct green hotels. Current incentives for energy-saving construction and operation may diminish, and early adopters will have the best chance at those incentives. © SAGE Publications, Inc. 2008.","Environmental awareness; Green hotel development; LEED certification",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49949098666

In addition, optima tend to vary with internal states and outside conditions. To manage their production process, growers generally rely on rules based on experience. However, much of this experience has been acquired under conditions of relatively low fuel prices. In view of increasing fuel costs and worldwide initiatives to reduce CO2 emission, horticultural producers are faced with the need to adapt their practice in order to remain economically viable. The horticultural research community can provide knowledge which may help growers to adapt to the changing conditions. In The Netherlands, internet technology is being used to facilitate efficient communication between growers and scientists. Information is collected automatically from process computers at five commercial nurseries, dynamic models are used to monitor crop and climate conditions, and nearly real-time results are published on a web portal, where it is linked with an information database and web logs by growers, advisors and researchers.

The model can describe energy management systems as networks of a series of energy flows, transferring extracted/imported energy resources to end users through a variety of conversion and transmission technologies over a number of periods. It can successfully incorporate optimization models, scenario development and policy analysis within a general framework. Complexities in energy management systems can be systematically reflected; thus, the applicability of the modeling process can be highly enhanced. Four scenarios (including a reference case) are considered based on different energy management policies and sustainable development strategies for in-depth analysis of interactions existing among energy, socio-economy and environment in the Region. Useful solutions for the planning of energy management systems have been generated, reflecting trade-offs among energy-related, environmental and economic considerations. They are helpful for supporting (a) adjustment or justification of the existing allocation patterns of energy resources and services, (b) allocations of renewable energy resources, (c) formulation of local policies regarding energy consumption, economic development and energy structure, and (d) analysis of interactions among economic cost, system efficiency, emission mitigation and energy-supply security. Results also indicate that UREM can help tackle dynamic and interactive characteristics of the energy management system in the Region of Waterloo and can address issues concerning cost-effective allocation of energy resources and services. Thus, it can be used by decision makers as an effective technique in examining and visualizing impacts of energy and environmental policies, regional/community development strategies and emission reduction measures within an integrated and dynamic framework.

In the post-2012 period, developing countries could receive financial benefits in return for decreasing their greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). Protected areas can act as a case study for REDD: lessons can be learnt from their success or otherwise in reducing deforestation and supporting local livelihoods. Depending upon the exact mechanisms decided between and within countries, protected areas could have a role to play in reducing national-scale deforestation, through strengthening existing forest protected areas and/or declaring new areas. Overall, protected areas are effective at limiting deforestation, but there are exceptions. Their track record in supporting livelihoods is more variable. The early indications are that community-managed and indigenous reserves are often effective in achieving both goals, but that biodiversity conservation is not necessarily such a high priority within these areas. Further research into the most effective management and governance frameworks for achieving goals on carbon emissions, biodiversity and communities, and the extent to which protected areas reduce (or merely displace) deforestation within national boundaries would be useful in informing REDD implementation. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70450227986

The energy conversion technologies can include photovoltaic panels, micro combined heat and power, micro wind, heat pumps, solar thermal systems, fuel cells and micro hydro schemes. In this paper, a small research of the availability of the conversion apparatus and the prices for the micro wind turbines and photovoltaic systems is made and a comparison between these two technologies is performed in terms of the availability of the resource and costs. An analysis of the new legal framework published in Portugal is done to realize if the incentives to individuals' investment in sustainable and local energy production is worth for their point of view. An economic evaluation for these alternatives, accounting with the government's incentives should lead, in most cases, into attractive return rates for the investment. Apart from the attractiveness of the investment there are though other aspects that should be taken into account and those are the benefits that these choices have to us all. The idea is that micro-generation will not only make a significant direct contribution to carbon reduction targets, it will also trigger a multiplier effect in behavior change by engaging hearts and minds, and providing more efficient use of energy by householders. The diversified profile of power generation by micro-generators, both in terms of location and timing, should reduce the impact of intermittency or plant failures with significant gains for security of supply. ©2008 IEEE.","Economic evaluation; Micro-generation; Micro-wind; Photovoltaic; Solar thermal","Carbon; Economics; Electric batteries; Electric power generation; Electricity; Energy conversion; Fuel cells; Hydraulic machinery; Hydraulic motors; Photovoltaic effects; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Turbines; Wind power; Economic evaluation; Micro-generation; Micro-wind; Photovoltaic; Solar thermal; Electric generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51749085372

We aim at evaluating how these representations correctly estimate classical descriptors (LAeq and statistical descriptors) and specific descriptors able to capture noise dynamics at a traffic signal scale. Three typical urban situations are studied: in front of, upstream and downstream of a traffic signal. Noise source representation can be coarse for classical descriptors calculation if traffic dynamics are precisely described.

In response, smart growth programs - designed to counter sprawl - have gained popularity in the US. Studies show that residents of neighborhoods with higher levels of density, land-use mix, transit accessibility, and pedestrian friendliness drive less than residents of neighborhoods with lower levels of these characteristics. However, these studies have shed little light on the underlying direction of causality - whether neighborhood design influences travel behavior or whether travel preferences influence the choice of neighborhood. The available evidence thus leaves a key question largely unanswered: if cities use land use policies to bring residents closer to destinations and provide viable alternatives to driving, will people change their behavior in ways that reduce emissions? This study examines evidence from a study of residents of eight neighborhoods in Northern California on the link between neighborhood design and two behaviors that affect emissions: driving and choice of vehicle type. The study used multivariate modeling techniques to control for socio-demographic characteristics as well as attitudes and preferences. The results support the premise that land use policies have at least some potential to reduce driving and ownership of light duty trucks, thereby reducing emissions.

In 2006, figures showed a total energy emission to networks of 49 177 GWh and aggregated losses in the Portuguese transmission and distribution networks of 3 730 GWh (8,48% referred to network energy consumption). By default, concern about losses reduction is taken into account in the planning stage of network development by using network losses as a criterion for selection between different technical solutions. The National Plan for Climatic Changes (PNAC), approved by the Portuguese Government, states that until 2010, total network losses (Transmission and Distribution) should be lower than 8,60%. The Tariff Code includes an incentive mechanism to reduce losses in distribution networks and allowing the DSO to be rewarded (or charged) in case of achieving global distribution losses below (or above) than a reference value set by ERSE, for each year. At the beginning of the present regulation period (2006 - 2008), ERSE set the reference values for the distribution network losses. In each year, if real losses relies under (or above) the reference value, the DSO is entitled to a financial reward (or penalty) proportional to the differential between those values, being this differential capped to a maximum value also set by ERSE. This article presents the evolution of losses reference values for the successive regulation periods since 1999 and the evolution of real losses in distribution networks, allowing a better cost-benefit analysis of financial consequences of the incentive mechanism for power losses reduction application. ©2008 IEEE.","Distribution networks; Incentive mechanism; Power losses; Regulation","Computer networks; Distribution of goods; Distribution networks; Incentive mechanism; International conferences; Power losses; Regulation; Electricity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51749118061

In the short-term, the most cost-effective strategy to reduce emissions and fuel consumption is by far the optimization of engines efficiency. In the near future, the generalization of hybrid vehicles will certainly be a reality, as it can reduce fuel consumption and GHG emissions up to 50% without any change in vehicle classes and hence no need for any compromise between safety and performance. It has been proven that the use of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) as a fuel allows an even more drastic reduction of CO2 emissions (23% saving with regard to the gasoline reference). Besides GHG emissions, natural gas as a motor vehicle fuel brings additional environmental benefit in terms of exhaust emissions. CNG vehicles in use today have very low emissions of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and do not produce any Particulate Matters (PM) which are a critical issue. Stringent European Union limits on airborne particulates are accordingly favourable to the development of CNG-fuelled vehicles. Moreover, CNG, as an alternative fuel, can contribute to the energy supply diversification and to the reduction of Europe's dependency on crude oil. Results presented here give an overview of the potential of energy consumption reduction by the combination of a dedicated CNG internal combustion engine with an electric motor in a hybrid vehicle. In 2005, IFP and GDF SUEZ settled a partnership to develop two CNG hybrid vehicle demonstrators based on existing vehicles. The first demonstrator, based on the Toyota Prius II, is fuelled by CNG only. The initial objective of the nroiect was to bring CO2 emissions below the threshold level of 80 g/km on NEDC cycle and to ensure that regulated pollutant emissions comply with EURO IV regulation. The main optimizations focused on thermal engine mapping dedicated to CNG combustion and the integration of both the high pressure CNG line and the electronic control unit. Indeed, after optimization, CO2 emissions were measured on chassis dynamometer at 76 g/km during NEDC cycle. With regard to the gasoline reference (104 g/km), the savings in greenhouse gas emissions represent 26%. These results are extremely low for a vehicle from this range, i.e. approximately half less than an average gasoline vehicle from the same category (sedan of 1,300 kg). In addition, emissions of regulated pollutants (with the original exhaust line) comply with the Euro IV standards, maintaining drivability constant. The participation in the 2006 Bibendum Challenge highlighted performances of the demonstrator under real conditions. The fuel consumption was measured on road tests around Paris, as follows : 75 km on a race track at a stabilized speed of 100 km/h 60 km in extra-urban driving conditions at a mean speed velocity of 50 km/h 12 km under urban driving conditions Few kilometers of connection between the tracks at low speed. The official CNG consumption measured by the organizers of the Challenge is 2.3 kg/100 km, which represents 63 g/km CO2. This result, in terms of equivalent energy consumption for gasoline, is 3.5 L/100 km, which represents 82 g/km CO2 (whereas the commercialized gasoline reference is 104 g/km). In partnership with Valeo and INRETS, a second project, funded by ADEME (French Agency for Environment and Energy Management), aimed at developing a mild-hybrid CNG urban vehicle, based on a MCC Smart ForTwo car. The project was born to reach 3 main targets : 1. A reduction of CO2 emissions down to 80 g/km on NEDC cycle at least (which represents 32% less than a gasoline vehicle) 2. CO, HC and NOx emissions complying with the Euro IV standards 3. Better drivability at low engine speed. Valeo has provided the StARS system (Starter-Alternator Reversible System), replacing the standard alternator and allowing the Stop&amp;Start function in order to reduce fuel consumption. More precisely, the StARS system turns-off automatically the thermal engine when the vehicle comes to a standstill (red lights, temporary halts, traffic jam, etc.) and restarts it instantly and silently as soon as the driver releases the brake pedal or accelerates. This system is combined with ultra-capacitors to store the electrical energy on-board and can assist the engine during acceleration (boost mode). Emphasis was placed by the partners of the project on improving the general driving feeling of the vehicle compared to the gasoline reference, as well as a significant reduction in pollutant emissions. Besides the reduction of GHG emissions achieved by such hybrid vehicles, using CNG offers a further great advantage: in the short term, a fraction can be substituted by green gas. Green gas is a purified biogas, produced from the anaerobic fermentation of organic waste (municipal biowaste, food processing waste, agricultural waste) or even energy crops. The purification makes green gas totally incorporable in CNG (same engines and distribution equipments). If produced from organic waste, a green gas has CO2 emissions five times lower than current Diesel. If produced from energy crops, the efficiency (km per hectare) is better than liquid biofuels. Production processes are commercially available ; green gas is already used as a fuel, particularly in Sweden and Switzerland (there is currently 30% of green gas incorporated in the Swiss CNG). The German incorporation objective is 10% in 2010. In France, the first operation is starting in Lille-Séquedin, where 100 buses will be fuelled by a green gas produced from municipal biowaste. Lille is one of the sites studied in the European project BIOGASMAX, of which GDF Suez is a partner. Technical solutions adopted for the construction of these two vehicle demonstrators are presented on this paper. Results in terms of fuel consumption and pollutant emissions after optimization - in agreement with the initial objectives - are also presented.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953700039

This paper investigates the development of a dynamic simulation and control code for the S-CO2 recompression cycle.The cycle analyzed is a 600 MWth, highly recuperated, single shaft recompression power conversion cycle with a turbine inlet temperature of 650°C The cycle features relatively high net efficiency (~47%) at relatively low heat addition temperatures, primarily due to efficient compression. The bottom of this cycle approaches (but in the steady state does not cross) carbon dioxide's critical point, where high fluid densities (~600 kg/m3) allow efficient compression. Dynamic simulation of this cycle is complicated by its key features: Single-shaft constant-speed turbomachinery, main and recompression compressor in parallel, operation of the main compressor inlet very close to the critical point, and rapid fluid property changes surrounding the critical point. A dynamic simulation and control code for gas-cooled Brayton Cycle reactor power conversion systems' (PCS) has been significantly modified and enhanced to use supercritical carbon dioxide as the working fluid. These modifications include the incorporation of accurate yet fast fluid properties, more detailed modeling of turbomachinery performance, and rapid yet sufficiently accurate calculation of heat exchange in printed circuit heat exchangers, even with rapid fluid property changes. Of particular significance are the methods devised to overcome convergence problems caused by compression near the critical point of CO2, and the attendant large variations in properties in the main compressor, precooler and low temperature recuperator. Coding innovations have made faster than real time simulation possible (on today's off the shelf hardware), which makes plant simulator and control applications feasible.An independent simulation code has been compared to the developed code for a rapid load change (10% instantaneous drop in generator power) transient. Both codes use turbine bypass to control the transient in the S-CO2 recompression cycle. Initial results show close agreement between the simulation codes for a variety of parameters.",,"Compressor inlet; Control applications; Control codes; Convergence problems; Critical points; Detailed modeling; Dynamic modeling; Dynamic simulation; Fluid densities; Fluid property; Gas-cooled; Heat exchange; Key feature; Load change; Low temperatures; Nuclear reactor design; Off-the-shelf hardwares; Power conversion cycle; Pre-cooler; Printed circuit heat exchangers; Reactor power; Real time simulations; Recompression; Simulation code; Steady state; Supercritical carbon dioxides; Turbine inlet temperature; Working fluid; Carbon dioxide; Compressors; Computer simulation; Design; Electric generators; Electronic equipment manufacture; Equations of state; Fluids; Heat exchangers; Mining; Nuclear energy; Nuclear industry; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear propulsion; Nuclear reactors; Turbines; Supercritical fluid extraction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349974202

The ensemble approach allows giving this information within a probability range. Within this work both perturbation on the circulation model and the chemical transport model will be implemented. The ensemble system is composed by the numerical weather prediction model ARPEGE, the meteorological model MM5 and the chemical transport model CHIMERE. Meteorological perturbations will be addressed firstly by a set of ten ensemble members derived by the ARPEGE model, plus a control run, which will force MM5 simulations. Since the concept of air pollution ensemble forecast is not the same than the one for meteorology, we propose here an original approach for the chemistry-transport model perturbations based on previously done CHIMERE sensitivities studies: focus will be made on plausible emissions scenarios and different daily emissions profiles, boundary layer evolution, vertical mixing and photolysis rates.

In addition, thermal and photovoltaic panels can be integrated into the system to improve thermal and electrical energy production, respectively. Each site can be connected to the others through district heating micro-grids. Hence thermal energy can be distributed inside the system.

Radiometric quantities such as the generalised radiant emittance and intensity, and the polarization parameter of the field are determined with basis on the generalised radiance tensors. These quantities reduce to their scalar counterparts if the vector character of the field is not regarded. In addition, the generalized radiance was analyzed using a procedure which separates the contributions provided by individual radiators from those provided by radiator pairs within their immediate surrounding, subjected to the accomplishment of conservation laws. This procedure reveals that only the individual radiators of the planar source contribute to the measurable radiometric quantities; the correlations of the field vectors in the surrounding of each individual radiator only modulates its contribution; and that modulations redistribute the contributions given by the individual radiators which can be understood like a lateral flux over the wavefront.

As a consequence the greenhouse climate is at times suboptimal and the crop yield is suboptimal as well. Nevertheless well design and well operated Mediterranean greenhouses achieve a positive economic balance between their agronomic performance and the investment and operations costs. A general overview of the current production strategies and technology of the Mediterranean greenhouse industry is provided. The demand exists for year-round supply of high quality greenhouse products, but in the Mediterranean region the growing period is often limited due to the lack of proper climate control. Two basic strategies to overcome this problem are to enhance the greenhouse technology or to grow crops in two or more regions with harvesting periods that complement each other. Both production strategies must be respectful of the environment. Life Cycle Assessments conducted on passive greenhouses have shown that the major impact on global warming is due to the production of the steel structure, while fertiliser production and its use is the main reason for water eutrophication and air acidification. Concerning greenhouse technology the importance of improving light transmission and natural ventilation is discussed. New cladding materials such as IR reflective films are promising materials that allow maximum PAR transmission and optimal near infrared reflection for better air temperature management. Computational analysis studies have determined that ventilation can be enhanced by reducing the greenhouse width, by orienting the roof ventilators towards prevailing winds, by increasing the roof slope up to 30° and by using internal deflectors to produce better air mixing and more uniform internal climate. Other climate control methods such as shading, evaporative cooling and CO2 enrichment are also briefly discussed. A review of crop production techniques and management, plant protection issues, better use efficiency of water and other relevant aspects of the greenhouse industry lead to the final consideration of this paper. Production strategy and greenhouse technology have to be considered when developing the production ""package"" or system, in which all the specialized elements cooperate to reach the best potential result for each greenhouse operation.","Climate control; Greenhouse management; Greenhouse technology; Microclimate; Production strategy",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049204325

Currently, the efforts to obtain lower emission levels in internal combustion engines are mainly focused on the improvement of catalyst technologies. Nevertheless, a significant reduction in emissions and consumption in heavy-duty vehicles could be achieved by means of the adjustment of the vehicle components (engines and fuel systems) to the specific task for which they were designed. In this way, both the engines and the fuel systems may be optimized for both the consumption and the emissions by means of several factors: an exhaustive study of the cycles to be performed, the vehicle weight, the speed and necessary accelerations in the vehicles, as well as the use of simulation tools. With this aim, three different cases dealing with the public transport have been analyzed: (i) a bus optimized to perform an urban cycle, (ii) a bus to carry out an inter-urban cycle (iii) and finally, a bus optimized for a mixed cycle.

Several land-use alternatives have been proposed to curb the rise of CO2 in coming decades: i) massive use of biomass for bio-fuels; ii) grassland conversion of agriculturally degraded soils, iii) saving and restoring forests (Fargione et al., 2008). It is unfortunate that these “carbon-oriented” options are almost always in competition for available land with the overwhelming objective of agriculture, which is to provide food, in good quantity and quality, to human populations. In fact, growing forests maximize carbon storage but provide little, if any, source of food for mankind. On the other hand, land conversion from forests or grasslands into arable crops notoriously determine a lowering of carbon storage compared to original ecosystems. Therefore, it is apparent that “win-win” land-use solutions for food production and carbon sequestration can hardly be devised. In this contest, the ongoing debate concerning the effectiveness of land use options is becoming a primary criteria for evaluating land use strategies at local and global level (Searchinger et al., 2008). The objective of this study was to explore the potential contribution of a new idea: setting aside straw bales within farming systems might provide transparent and verifiable carbon sequestration coupled with food production. © 2008, Page Press Publications.

As a result, the use of renewable and sustainable energy resources, such as biomass, has become increasingly attractive. In view of increase in the demand for waste utilization and combustion of renewable fuels, materials of these kinds are more often burned together with coal in steam generators, what may be the lowest-cost option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Because of their organic origin, these fuels (wood, bark, straw, sewage sludge, municipal solid wastes, agricultural waste, bone meal, etc.) are termed 'biomass', although they include not only strictly natural components. The biomass and waste fuels also contain mineral matter, generally in proportions strongly different from those found in coal. The agricultural products industries generate large quantities of biomass residues that could also provide fuel for electricity production. Increasing the use of such fuels could alleviate the burdens and environmental consequences of waste disposal in the agricultural products industries and waste water treatment plants. The use of biomass as fuel is predetermined at first by ecological point of view because during combustion process formed carbon dioxide is a participant of natural carbon cycle and do not impact to green house effect. However the ecologically compatibility of fermentable biomass including agricultural waste combustion is not proved in full.

The research is focalized on the actual uses of process wastes and in particular on the different kinds of wastes, which kinds are presently reused or disposed of, in order to identify and classify the wastes typologies that will be studied. To decide the possible reuse of output such as resources, the quantity and the quality of wastes are carefully examined and subsequently classified on physics-chemical and biological properties and on the possible fields of reuse. An optimum waste use, through available or innovative technologies, will cause profits and advantages to local companies and the regional economy, new jobs and new local production.

While hydrogen production and advanced energy cycles are still in its early stages of development, research towards coupling a high temperature reactor with electrical generation and hydrogen production is under way. Many aspects of the NGNP must be researched and developed in order to make recommendations on the final design of the plant. Parameters such as working conditions, cycle components, working fluids, and power conversion unit configurations must be understood. A number of configurations of the power conversion unit were demonstrated in this study. An intermediate heat transport loop for transporting process heat to a High Temperature Steam Electrolysis (HTSE) hydrogen production plant was used. Helium, CO2, and a 80% nitrogen, 20% helium mixture (by weight) were studied to determine the best working fluid in terms cycle efficiency and development cost. In each of these configurations the relative component sizes were estimated for the different working fluids. Parametric studies were carried out on reactor outlet temperature, mass flow, pressure, and turbine cooling. Recommendations on the optimal working fluid for each configuration were made. Engineering analyses were performed for several configurations of the intermediate heat transport loop that transfers heat from the nuclear reactor to the hydrogen production plant. The analyses evaluated parallel and concentric piping arrangements and two different working fluids, including helium and a liquid salt.

The time-dependent spectral properties and nonlinear dynamics of a separate photon emission by the micro-molecular-like system ""excited atom coupled to a resonance decaying mode"" have been analyzed. The investigation has been carried out by solving the Schrödinger equation in the interaction picture with the help of the Green functions method in the Heitler-Ma's form . The formalism was supplemented with the novel algorithm in operating causal singular functions and with fundamentals of the theory of quasi-stationary systems. The proposed theory accounts automatically of both reabsorptions of emitted photon and its simultaneous escaping out of the cavity. Solutions of the wave equation were found without using intermediate virtual states and series expansions. In accordance with the theory of quasi-stationary systems the field of mode decaying exponentially in the empty nanocavity was represented with the Lorenz-shaped packet of stationary photonic states (quasi-modes). The electro-dipolar interaction between the atom and the mode field was adopted to be switched on suddenly. The expressions and plots of emission probabilities spectral densities together with photon emission probability dynamics as functions of time for various ratios Γ/4g of photon escaping rate Γ and coupling constant g are presented. For Γ/4g <1 the transient emission spectrum reveals the presence of two symmetrical side-bands and of the central peak, the latter decaying in time at the rate ∞Γ/2 so that the final spectrum is a doublet. In this case the photon emission probability is described by decaying oscillations. On the contrary for Γ/4g ≥1 spectrum is a singlet and the emission occurs in exponentially decaying way.","Atom; Emission; Nanocavity; Nonperturbative; Properties; Resonance photon; Spontaneous; Two level","(e ,2e) theory; (min ,max ,+) functions; Coupling constants; Dinger equation; Dipolar interactions; Emission probabilities; Excited atoms; green functions; nano cavities; Nano-photonics; Non-linear dynamics; Nonperturbative theory; Novel algorithms; photon emissions; Photonic states; Quasi stationary; single resonance; Singular functions; Spectral properties; Time-dependent; Two level (Rydberg) atoms; Virtual states",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45149124472

Wooden buildings are usually well known by their ecological and sustainable advantages, especially on the use of eco-materials as well as the low-emission construction process. In order to study the appropriate concept and to demonstrate the possibility and the potentiality of wooden buildings for public facilities in the southern Taiwan, an architectural project has been thus launched and been supported by authorities as a pilot project by designing and constructing a wooden building in the campus of the university. The main themes of the project consist of timber structural design, passive design corresponding to local climate and the use of renewable energy. The focal points of the project emphasize not only the engineered needs resisting earthquake and typhoon in the region, but also the integration of different policies concerning the sustainable development in the country, such as green building and the green material labeling system, the green campus and ecology engineering. This paper will present this studied case from its initial concept, through the design process and the engineering considerations to the final results.",,"Architectural projects; Construction process; Design process; Eco-materials; Extreme weather events; Focal points; Green buildings; Green campus; Green materials; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; High energy; Industrialized countries; International community; KYOTO protocol; Local climate; Passive design; Pilot projects; Public facilities; Renewable energies; Sick building syndrome; Southern taiwan; Waste emission; Building materials; Construction industry; Ecology; Emission control; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Indoor air pollution; Planning; Structural design; Sustainable development; Timber; Water pollution; Wooden buildings; Environmental protection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865746987

In this research, therefore, a future vision for the year 2030 in the Sancha Area (SANCHA VISION 2030), a typical densely built-up area in Tokyo, has been elaborated including a simulation to estimate benefits from the application of distributed energy systems in terms of reduced energy consumption and CO2 emissions as well as mitigation of the heat-island phenomenon. As a result, it was demonstrated that a ""distributed local energy system"", which provides a district with both electrical power and heat through an integrated distribution system, may contribute to a considerable improvement in energy efficiency for those areas. In addition, it may also provide other benefits, including enhancement of living amenity and urban security in times of emergency. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The synthesised results show that the quality of the palaeoecological environment for biological growth is primarily affected by nutrient supply and terrigenous disturbance. Ba and P are important nutrient elements for the growth of diatoms, radiolarians and planktonic foraminifera. Together with dissolved silica and calcium carbonate in sea water, these elements may control microbiotic development. However, variations in Fe content appear to affect diatom and radiolarian abundance. Optimal biotic growth occurs when nutrients are abundant and when there is minimal terrigenous disturbance. Biotic growth decreases when sea water is highly oligotrophic and terrigenous input is high. Maximum biological growth occurred in the mid Holocene, but deteriorated soon afterwards owing to increased terrigenous input, causing a decrease of biological abundance and productivity in the late Holocene. The results also indicate how the Toba volcanic eruption ca. 74 ka ago contributed to changing the ecological environment in the southern South China Sea.

Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) organized petroleum corporations, automobile and engine manufactories as well as research institutes to test the adaptability of the fuels from Chinese refineries to the modern vehicles or engines on the road running conditions in China. In this paper, the effects of diesel fuel quality on combustion and emission of a Euro IV heavy-duty diesel engine as one part of the program were studied to provide technical data to stipulate the feasible diesel fuel standard, which should guarantee modern vehicles or engines to meet the 4th stage regulations. Eight kinds of diesel fuels with different properties, such as cetane number, distillation temperature (T90) and sulfur content, were tested on a Euro IV Cummins heavy-duty diesel engine with urea SCR after-treatment. Engine power, fuel economy, and ESC cycle emissions (NOx, CO, HC) before and after SCR were measured. The gaseous SO2, total PM and SOF, DS, sulfate in PM were analyzed. Heat release rates were calculated to analyze in-cylinder combustion variation resulting from the changes of the fuel properties. The test results show that diesel properties have little effect on power, fuel consumption, and heat release rate of the engine; sulfate in PM and gaseous SO2 emission increase linearly with sulfur content; with the increase of cetane number, BSFC and PM decrease slightly, while NOx slightly increases; with the decrease of T90, NOx decreases, and PM shows trend of slight decrease. Base on the experimental data from ESC cycle, the empirical formula of NOx and PM emissions before SCR changing with the sulfur content, cetane number, aromatics and T90 were obtained using the linear regression method.

This paper presents a power market model that considers renewable portfolio standards (RPS), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions cap-and-trade and green pricing programs. These are three concurrent policies in the United States that are expected to be implemented to reduce our reliance of electricity on carbon intensity sources. Under these policies, electricity generated from renewable sources would incur little or no GHG costs, and also can be used to meet RPS, or sell into green pricing programs. Therefore, load serving entities (LSEs) would view electricity as differential products and price it differently based on its emission rate. As an illustration, the model is applied to analyze the interactions of three policies using a three-node power system. The result suggests that the green premium and the price of renewable energy credits (RECs) are closely related and the interactions among three policies can effectively increase profits earned by renewables generators. RECs market needs to be carefully designed to prevent double counting.","Emissions trading; Green pricing; Power market model; Renewable portfolio standard","Carbon intensity; Emission rates; Emissions trading; GHG emission; Green pricing; Green pricing programs; Load serving entities; Market needs; Model-based; Power market model; Power markets; Power systems; Renewable energy credits; Renewable portfolio standard; Renewable sources; Renewables; Air quality; Commerce; Costs; Electric generators; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Leakage (fluid); Standards; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649643590

A statistical downscaling approach was used to downscale daily five general circulation model (GCM) outputs (three Canadian and two US GCMs) and to derive six-hourly future climate information for the selected cities (Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, and Windsor) in south-central Canada. Discriminant function analysis was then used to project the future weather types, based on historical analysis defined in a companion paper (Part I). Future air pollution concentrations were estimated using the within-weather-type historical simulation models applied to the downscaled future GCM climate data. Two independent approaches, based on (1) comparing future and historical frequencies of the weather groups and (2) applying within-weather-group elevated mortality prediction models, were used to assess climate change impacts on elevated mortality for two time windows (2040-2059 and 2070-2089). Averaging the five GCM scenarios, across the study area, heat-related mortality is projected to be more than double by the 2050s and triple by the 2080s from the current condition. Cold-related mortality could decrease by about 45-60% and 60-70% by the 2050s and the 2080s, respectively. Air pollution-related mortality could increase about 20-30% by the 2050s and 30-45% by the 2080s, due to increased air pollution levels projected with climate change. The increase in air pollution-related mortality would be largely driven by increases in ozone effects.

It is most likely that the estimate of future extreme temperature-and air pollution-related mortality from this study could represent a bottomline figure since many of the factors (e.g., population growth, age structure changes, and adaptation measures) were not directly taken into account in the analyses. © 2009 The Author(s).","Acclimatization; Climate change scenarios; Future air pollution; Human mortality; South-central Canada; Statistical downscaling; Synoptic weather typing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954087824

We present a brief review of our combined theoretical and experimental studies on hydrogen spillover mechanisms in solid-state materials where, for the first time, the complete mechanisms that dictate hydrogen spillover processes in transition metal oxides and nanostructured graphitic carbon-based materials have been revealed. The spillover process is broken into three primary steps: (1) dissociative chemisorption of gaseous H2 on a transition metal catalyst; (2) migration of H atoms from the catalyst to the substrate and (3) diffusion of H atoms on substrate surfaces and/or in the bulk materials. In our theoretical studies, the platinum catalyst is modeled with a small Pt cluster and the catalytic activity of the cluster is examined at full H atom saturation to account for the essentially constant, high H2 pressures used in experimental studies of hydrogen spillover. Subsequently, the energetic profiles associated with H atom migrations from the catalyst to the substrates and H atom diffusion in the substrates are mapped out by calculating the minimum energy pathways. It is observed that the spillover mechanisms for the transition metal oxides and graphitic carbon-based materials are very different. Hydrogen spillover in the transition metal oxides is moderated by massive, nascent hydrogen bonding networks in the crystalline lattice, while H atom diffusion on the nanostructured graphitic carbon materials is governed mostly by physisorption of H atoms. The effects of carbon material surface curvature on the hydrogen spillover as well as on hydrogen desorption dynamics are also discussed. The proposed hydrogen spillover mechanism in carbon-based materials is consistent with our experimental observations of the solid-state catalytic hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of coronene. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2008.",,"Atoms; Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Chemical bonds; Diffusion; Diffusion in solids; Hydrogen; Hydrogen bonds; Hydrogenation; Metals; Platinum; Substrates; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; Carbon based materials; Catalytic hydrogenation; Dissociative chemisorption; Hydrogen spill overs; Minimum energy pathways; Solid-state materials; Transition metal catalysts; Transition-metal oxides; Hydrogen storage; carbon; catalyst; experimental study; graphite; hydrogen; platinum; substrate; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65149086435

For their potentials as an energy sources, they are related to plants' productivity as well as growth rate. Concerning the utilization options, plants that possess high economical value and/or versatilities were encouraged. Among the options are handicrafts, fertilizers, animal feeds, construction materials, paper making, and pharmaceutical products. In term of nutrient uptakes, in most cases they were relatively minor comparing to other removal mechanisms in SFCWs. No significant differences in term of treatment efficiency could be found. The proposed species have to be able to tolerate the municipal wastewater. The cost differences of plant propagules between each species are marginal, hence they should not be considered as the main selection criteria. Based on an investigation of 45 species worldwide, the recommendation table is developed with 13 suitable species that fit all the criteria.

This system consists of a fuel reformer (REF), lean NOx trap (LNT), catalyzed diesel particulate filter (DPF), and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst arranged in series to reduce tailpipe nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). This system utilizes a REF to produce hydrogen (H 2), carbon monoxide (CO) and heat to regenerate the LNT, desulfate the LNT, and actively regenerate the DPF. The NOx stored on the LNT is reduced by the H2 and CO generated in the REF converting it to nitrogen (N2) and ammonia (NH3). NH3, which is normally an undesired byproduct of LNT regeneration, is stored in the downstream SCR which is utilized to further reduce NOx that passes through the LNT. Engine exhaust PM is filtered and trapped by the DPF reducing the tailpipe PM emissions. The REF is used to periodically generate heat to raise the DPF temperature and oxidize the accumulated soot. This paper addresses the issues resulting from transient operation and control of the above mentioned aftertreatment system. These results were obtained from urban and highway drive cycles using a 2007 compliant medium duty test vehicle equipped with an LNT + SCR aftertreatment system. The system performed LNT regenerations, DPF regenerations, and LNT desulfations as needed under a variety of transient conditions. An average system NOx conversion of 86% was demonstrated for a variety of transient driving conditions.

Similar to CHP systems, micro-CHP (micro-Cooling, Heating, and Power) systems consist of power cogeneration systems and thermally-activated components such as absorption chillers, water tanks, boilers and air handling units. There have been many studies in regard to steady-state models following load profiles in order to demonstrate the economic advantage of CHP systems. However, there has not been much work using dynamic simulation of CHP systems, which include the transient response of the building along with the rest of the CHP components. This paper presents both technical and economical results from the dynamic simulation of the micro-CHP system used to model the test facility at Mississippi State University (MSU). The results are compared to a dynamic model using a conventional heating and cooling system. TRNSYS, a dynamic simulation program, is used to simulate the time response of the micro-CHP system based on the transient heating, cooling, and electric power demand of a test facility. The performance and costs of a conventional heating and cooling system are assessed using TRNSYS and the results are then compared against the simulated performance of the micro-CHP system. Details of the simulation model include geometric and material information (e.g., size and type of walls and windows), internal gains (following the equipment and occupancy schedules), local weather information (e.g., ambient temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation), and estimated infiltration of the test facility.

It was based on the IPCC report no. 4 presented in Barcelona on November 2007. The messages are briefly: Warming of the climate system is unequivocal Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to human activities have grown since pre-industrial times Continued GHG emissions at or above current rates would cause further warming and induce many changes in the global climate system during the 21st century that would very likely be larger than those observed during the 20th century Key mitigation technologies in the waste sector: Landfill Gas (LFG) methane recovery; waste incineration with energy recovery; composting of organic wastc; controlled waste water treatment; recycling and waste minimisation; biocovers and biofilters to optimise methane oxidation The above by the IPCC proposed mitigation technologies for the waste sector can be categorized regarding specific waste treatment scenarios and their efficiency expressed in kg CO equivalent emitted per ton of waste. Landfill w/o LFG recovery 1850 kg CO2-eq Landfill with LFG recovery 250-775 kg CO2-eq1 Energy-from-Waste plant -1000.- 100 kg CO2-eq1 With a population of little over 300 million people and a per capita municipal waste generation rate of 760 kg/person.year, the total waste generated in the USA is about 230 million Mg/year (OECD). With the treatment scenarios discussed above, the following can be stated: If all wastes were landfilled waste disposal would If all wastes were incinerated in Energy-from-Waste (EfW) plants, the emissions could be reduced by about 500 million tons of CO2 equivalents (about 9% of today's US CO2 output) and make the waste management sector a GHG emissions sink. The total electricity generated from EfW plants could be as high as 15,000 MW replacing about 50 standard 300 MW power plant units. To an average US 4 person household about 3 ilyear of municipal solid wastes can be allocated, corresponding to an annual difference between landfilling without LFG recovery and EfW treatment of about 6.9 Mg CO2-eq /year. If this household wanted to achieve the same reduction of CO2, equivalent emissions by other means than having thcsc wastcs burnt in a modern EfW plant, they have the following options: Remove one automobile from use (EPA: 6.0 Mg CO2-eq /year) Cut household electricity consumption by 80% (EIA: 7.8 Mg CO2 /year) The European parliament commission has proposed to reduce CO2 emissions in Europe to 20-30% below 1990 levcls. In comparison with Europe, annual GHG emissions (CO2-eq/personyear) in the U.S. today are on a level about double that of the Europe. In order to achieve a similar reduction in the U.S., significant efforts have to be done on all energy fronts. Energy-from-Waste (EfW) is one of them, which at the same time solves a space and pollution problem and does not leave these issues to future generations.

This method utilizes electromagnetic emissions (EME) originating from the PCB to determine circuit health. EME from rapidly changing voltages and currents within high-speed logic and other circuits have traditionally been seen as a problematic source of interference that must be eliminated to as great an extent as possible. However, changes within these emissions can be a highly significant indicator that a failure has occurred within a PCB component as well as within adjacent circuit card paths of the board itself. Further, the hardware and software requirements needed to capture and analyze these emissions are relatively simple in comparison to today's highly complex automatic test equipment. This unique approach involves analyzing electromagnetic emission signatures through automated means, and ascribing failures to the circuit board as a whole, as well as to the individual circuit board components. ©2008 IEEE.","ADR; Automatic defect recognition; Electromagnetic emissions; EME; Fault detection; Integrated circuits; Printed circuit boards","Automatic testing; Electromagnetic dispersion; Electromagnetic wave emission; Electromagnetism; Electronic equipment manufacture; Fault detection; Integrated circuits; Magnetic materials; Networks (circuits); Printed circuit manufacture; Printed circuits; Refrigerators; ADR; Automatic defect recognition; Automatic test equipments; Circuit boards; Circuit cards; Electrical fields; Electromagnetic emissions; EME; Hardware and softwares; Innovative approaches; Speed logics; Printed circuit boards",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57949107811

During the last years, many international research projects, aimed at identifying the most contributing noise sources and a way to reduce their emission, have involved universities, private research centres, and industries too. Considering the noise effect on people in big urban centres, inhabitants experience a lot of noise sources, such as traffic, industrial plants and urban trains. For this last noise source in particular, one of the most relevant contributions is represented by the squeal of vehicle wheels. Squeal noise is due to the wheel vibrations related to a self-excited phenomenon, which leads to a limit cycle with very high vibration amplitudes. This is the reason why high power control system should theoretically be required to suppress the vibrations and the resulting noise emission. The aim of this paper is to investigate the possibility to prevent the squeal noise from a resilient wheel using active control techniques, by means of smart materials. © 2008 by the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Department of Mechanical Engineering All rights reserved.",,"Industrial plants; Noise abatement; Vehicle wheels; Environmental noise; International researches; Noise emissions; Piezo-actuators; Research centres; Resilient railways; Scientific community; Vibration amplitude; Vibrations (mechanical)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906348070

Political complications, economic instabilities, supply shortages, and continued pollution contributions pose significant obstacles to continued reliance on oil. Alternative technologies based on renewable resources offer much more promise for a sustainable approach to meeting global energy needs. Recent research and applications have established hydrogen as a viable clean fuel source. Those applications, including fuel cells, have shown promise for the eventual migration from a fossil-fuel economy to one based on renewable energy sources. Air pollution, specifically contributions to greenhouse gases, is a major environmental hazard due to the use of fossil fuel-related hydrocarbons for fuel and industrial applications. An alternative, hydrogen, offers significant advantages as an ultra-clean fuel of the future when it is burned directly or processed through fuel cells. Currently, the main process for hydrogen production is catalytic steam reforming of natural gas. This process is relatively inefficient and does not allow the use of a wide range of feedstock materials including renewable sources. The objective of impending research is to develop this new, ultra-clean and efficient process, which converts a wide range of hydrocarbons, including renewable bio-oils, into pure hydrogen suitable for fuel cells and which also converts CO2 emission into syngas. The main impact is clearly on air pollution and global warming through the minimization of greenhouse gas emission and the economical production of pure hydrogen to foster the hydrogen economy. This new process will achieve considerable increase in hydrogen productivity and considerable decrease in the energy consumed to produce it. The technology will center on a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) that will separate hydrogen from bio-oils in an efficient process that greatly reduces polluting hydrocarbons compared to traditional fossil fuel processing. Early studies will include the mathematical modeling of computational fluid dynamics to identify process parameters. Eventually, a pilot plant will be used to verify/modify the mathematical model, for a wide range of conditions and renewable feedstocks. Testing the pilot plant will lead to the development of reliable design equations suitable for replication, build, and tight control of this novel process.

When it is hot, they can cool themselves down with air conditioners. Likewise, when it is cold, they can warm themselves with heaters. The wealthier the person, the more sophisticated the heating or cooling employed. A poor person has little such climate control. When it is hot, they are hot. When it is cold, they are cold. Without accessing any other information or asking any questions, the ability someone has to control their own personal environment is a ready and reasonable way of assessing their level of economic development. It is ironic then that as all nations become increasingly wealthy that the ability to control climate is quickly disappearing. Climate change is occurring and the affects are already evident. Weather patterns are changing, animal migration is occurring at different times, polar ice caps are shrinking and access to secure water supplies for some is diminishing. Global wealth is no longer sufficient for being assured of climate control. In a sense, therefore, all nations and all individuals are becoming more poor-like. Further, this lack of climate control will be exacerbated if we continue to develop as we have in the past. The global community must now act in unity to address climate change. The Kyoto Protocol was the first significant international instrument that addressed climate change. However, this protocol ceases to exist in 2012 and negotiations have already begun to design the next international climate change protocol. This new book sets out what this new protocol might be. The purpose of the book is therefore to contribute to the current negotiations and offer an alternative to the consensus that appears to be emerging: a consensus that will see very little departure from the principles that underpinned the Kyoto Protocol - limited targets for a limited number of nations. The reactive approach - see what happens, limit damages, and learn from experience - is unworkable. Rather we must take a proactive approach.

These parameters were determined in experiments that took into account the likely configuration of a full-scale plant in the banana growing region of north Queensland. The digestion was conducted in a 200-l reactor using fed-batch operation, relying entirely on the natural microbial consortia on the reject bananas to avoid reliance on external inocula such as sludge, an undesirable material around food packaging facilities. An enrichment culture was first established in a highly buffered 200-l batch digestion unit. The fed-batch digester was then started by exchanging leachate with the mature batch reactor. Under loading conditions of 0.6 kg VS m-3 d-1 over 70 days where the average working volume was 160 l, the digester produced 398 ± 20 l CH4 kg VS-1. Increasing the loading rate to 1.6 kg VS m-3 d-1 resulted in a reduced methane yield of 210 l CH4 kg VS-1 over 23 days of operation, with a concomitant accumulation of banana waste in the digester.

Here, we apply quantitative isotopic climate proxies in order to construct two age-equivalent, relatively continuous temperature and pCO2 records that span the eight million years preceding the Triassic-Jurassic boundary and that supersede previous terrestrial records in temporal resolution. The δ18O data suggest that mean annual temperatures (MAT) increased by 7-9 °C from the late Norian to the Rhaetian in association with the peak increases in pCO2 levels. The δ13C data suggest relatively low late Norian pCO2 levels (&lt;500-1000 ppmV), increased Rhaetian levels (&gt;1500 ppmV), and at least two periods of extreme pCO2 levels (∼3000 ppmV) preceding the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. These estimates are consistent with a recent Late Triassic climate model that suggests the effects of increased pCO2 levels on Pangea would cause severe climatic consequences, including a global MAT increase of 6 °C (&gt;10 °C in some regions). While it is possible that periods of increased aridity could have resulted in erroneously high estimates of both temperature and pCO2 levels, it is likely that climate was still fluctuating during the end of the Triassic. Although our data precede the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, many studies conclude that the mass extinction took place over a more prolonged period beginning in the Late Triassic. Thus, climate may have been a significant driving mechanism of the Late Triassic extinctions. © 2008 Geological Society of America.","Extinction; Late Triassic; Paleoclimate; Pedogenic carbonates; Stable isotopes","Extinction; Late Triassic; Paleoclimate; Pedogenic carbonates; Stable isotopes; Carbonates; Isotopes; carbonate; extreme event; Jurassic; mass extinction; paleoclimate; pedogenesis; proxy climate record; stable isotope; stratigraphic boundary; Triassic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69949135385

However; most of the world's energy consumption is for heat and transportation. Nuclear energy has considerable potential to penetrate these energy sectors now served by fossil fuels that are characterized by price volatility and finite supply. Advanced applications of nuclear energy include seawater desalination, district heating, and heat for indust rial processes. Nuclear energy also has potential to provide a near-term, greenhouse gas free, source of energy for transportation. These applications rely on a source of heat and electricity. Nuclear energy from water-cooled reactors, of course, is not unique in this sense. Indeed, higher temperature heat can be produced by burning natural gas and coal, or through the use of other nuclear technologies such as gas-cooled or liquid-nietat.-cooled reactors. Water-cooled reactors, however; are being deployed today while other reactor types have had considerably less operational and regulatoiy experience and will take still some time to be widely accepted in the market. Both seawater desalination and district heating with nuclear energy are well proven, and new seawater desalination projects using water-cooled reactors will soon be commissioned. Provision of process heat with nuclear energy can result in less dependence on fossil fuels and contribute to reductions of greenhouse gases. Importantly, because nuclear power produces base-load electricity at stable and predictable prices, it pivvides a greenhouse gas free source of electricity for transportation systems (trains and subways), and.for electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, and in the longer term nuclear energy could produce hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles, as well as for other components of a hydrogen economy.

The gas turbine, a GE10-1 model, is manufactured by Nuovo Pignone and will be installed at ENEL's coal-fired Fusina power plant, near Venice. The turbine, rated for 11 MWe, is equipped with a diffusive flame combustor and is suitable for operation with 100% hydrogen as main fuel over the entire load range. Hydrogen is available at Fusina site as byproduct of petrochemical plants. Natural gas will be used as start-up and back-up fuel, and NOx emission abatement will be achieved by means of steam injection. Load operation will be possible with hydrogen only, with methane or hydrogen-methane mixtures (in case of reduced availability of hydrogen) and with or without steam injection. In order to support the combustion system's design, experimental activities have been carried over a prototypical combustor, installed on a combustion test rig at ENEL's experimental facility, located in Sesta (Tuscany). The test rig has been upgraded in order to permit full-scale combustor operation. Tests have been planned with the aim of providing a complete screening of combustion system's sensitivity to minor hardware modification (three different burners and two different liners, designed for diffusive combustion, have been available) and operating conditions (sensitivity to cycle parameters and effect of steam injection). Special instrumentations have been installed for a detailed monitoring of hot parts' metal temperature, combustion-driven pressure oscillations and pollutant emissions. A water-cooled camera has been installed for direct flame visualization. The experimental campaign is still on-going and only the default combustor configuration has been tested so far. However, collected results indicate safe combustor operation in both hydrogen and methane combustion mode: metal temperatures have never exceeded warning limits and pressure pulsation have been extremely quiet. NOx emission during hydrogen operation in dry combustion mode have been proven to be roughly 3 times higher than in dry methane combustion mode. Steam injection has been proven to be effective in reducing NOx emissions down to contractual values. Additional efforts are in progress to obtain a further reduction of emission level. Finally, experimental results have been processed in order to set up a simple NOx emissions' model, accounting for NOx production in any possible operating mode.",,"Combustion systems; Combustion test; Cooled camera; Cycle parameters; Dry combustion; Emission abatement; Emission level; Experimental campaign; Experimental characterization; Experimental facilities; Flame combustors; Flame visualization; Gas turbine cycles; Hardware modifications; Hydrogen-fuelled; Load operations; Load range; Local institutions; Metal temperature; Methane combustion; Operating condition; Operating modes; Pollutant emission; Pressure oscillation; Pressure pulsation; Start-ups; Steam injection; Test rigs; Tuscany; Zero emission; Combustors; Drilling rigs; Engines; Fuel systems; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Gas turbines; Hydrogen; Leakage (fluid); Methane; Petrochemical plants; Smoke; Steam; Steam power plants; Turbomachinery; Coal combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69949165865

The Maximizing Emission Reductions and Economic Savings Simulator (MERESS) is an optimization tool that was developed to allow users to evaluate avant-garde strategies for installing and operating CHP FCSs in buildings. These strategies include networking, load following, and the use of variable heat-to-power ratios, all of which commercial industry has typically overlooked. A primary goal of the MERESS model is to use relatively inexpensive simulation studies to identify more financially and environmentally effective ways to design and install FCSs. It incorporates the pivotal choices that FCS manufacturers, building owners, emission regulators, competing generators, and policy makers make, and empowers them to evaluate the effect of their choices directly. MERESS directly evaluates trade-offs among three key goals: GHG reductions, energy cost savings for building owners, and high sales revenue for FCS manufacturers. MERESS allows users to evaluate these design trade-offs and to identify the optimal control strategies and building load curves for installation based on either 1) maximum GHG emission reductions or 2) maximum cost savings to building owners.

This article discusses the deployment of MERESS to show illustrative results for a California campus town, and, based on these results, makes recommendations for further installations of FCSs to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. MERESS is used to evaluate one of the most challenging FCS types to use for GHG reductions, the Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell (PAFC) system. These PAFC FCSs are tested against a base case of a CHP combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT). Model results show that three competing goals (GHG emission reductions, cost savings to building owners, and FCS manufacturer sales revenue) are best achieved with different strategies, but that all three goals can be met reasonably with a single approach. According to MERESS, relative to a base case of only a CHP CCGT providing heat and electricity with no FCSs, the town achieves the highest 1) GHG emission reductions, 2) cost savings to building owners, and 3) FCS manufacturer sales revenue each with three different operating strategies, under a scenario of full incentives and a $100/tonne carbon dioxide (CO2) tax (Scenario D). The town achieves its maximum CO2 emission reduction, 37% relative to the base case, with operating Strategy V: stand alone operation (SA), no load following (NLF), and a fixed heat-to-power ratio (FHP) [SA, NLF, FHP] (Scenario E). The town's building owners gain the highest cost savings, 25%, with Strategy I: electrically and thermally networked (NW), electricity power load following (ELF), and a variable heat-to-power ratio (VHP) [NW, ELF, VHP] (Scenario D). FCS manufacturers generally have the highest sales revenue with Strategy III: NW, NLF, with a fixed heat-to-power ratio (FHP) [NW, NLF, FHP] (Scenarios B, C, and D). Strategies III and V are partly consistent with the way that FCS manufacturers design their systems today, primarily as NLF with a FHP. By contrast, Strategy I is avant-garde for the fuel cell industry, in particular, in its use of a VHP and thermal networking. Model results further demonstrate that FCS installations can be economical for building owners without any carbon tax or government incentives. Without any carbon tax or state and federal incentives (Scenario A), Strategy I is marginally economical, with 3% energy cost savings, but with a 29% reduction in CO2 emissions. Strategy I is the most economical strategy for building owners in all scenarios (Scenarios A, B, C, and D) and, at the same time, reasonably achieves other goals of large GHG emission reductions and high FCS manufacturer sales revenue. Although no particular building type stands out as consistently achieving the highest emission reductions and cost savings (Scenarios B-2 and E-2), certain building load curves are clear winners. For example, buildings with load curves similar to Stanford's Mudd Chemistry building (a wet laboratory) achieve maximal cost savings (1.5% with full federal and state incentives but no carbon tax) and maximal CO2 emission reductions (32%) (Scenarios B-2 and E-2). Finally, based on these results, this work makes recommendations for reducing GHG further through FCS deployment.

Many of these units, which collectively represent almost 60 GW of installed capacity, are difficult to retrofit for deep emission reductions because of space constraints and unfavorable economies of scale, making them increasingly vulnerable to retirement in the face of progressively more stringent environmental regulations. The Greenidge Multi-Pollutant Control Project is being conducted as part of the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Power Plant Improvement Initiative to demonstrate a solution for these units. The project seeks to establish the commercial readiness of a multi-pollutant control system that is designed to meet the needs of smaller coal-fired EGUs by offering deep emission reductions, low capital costs, small space requirements, applicability to high-sulfur coals, mechanical simplicity, and operational flexibility. The system comprises an innovative combination of technologies including combustion modifications, a NOxOUT Cascade® hybrid selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) / in-duct SCR system, and a Turbosorp® circulating fluidized bed dry scrubbing system with baghouse ash recycling and activated carbon injection. These technologies were retrofitted to the 107-MW AES Greenidge Unit 4 by Babcock Power Environmental Inc. (BPEI) in 2006, with a total plant cost of ̃ $340/kW and a footprint of &lt; 0.5 acre. Extensive testing has been carried out through mid-2008 to evaluate the perlormance of the multi-pollutant control system during its first year-and-a-half of commercial operation. This paper summarizes performance and cost results from AES Greenidge Unit 4 and discusses commercial deployment of the demonstration technology. Guarantee tests conducted at AES Greenidge in 2007 proved that the multi-pollutant control system was capable of reducing NOx emissions to 0.10 lb/mmBtu, SO2 emissions by 96%, SO3 and HCl emissions by 97%, and mercury emissions by &gt; 95% while the unit fired 2.4-3.2% sulfur eastern U.S. bituminous coal. Additional tests have since been conducted to characterize the performance of the system as a function of unit operating conditions; the results of these tests are presented. The predominant operating challenges encountered to-date have arisen from the combustion system and from accumulation of large particle ash (LPA) in the in-duct SCR catalyst; as a result, the unit has required several outages for catalyst cleaning and has routinely operated with NOx emissions slightly greater than 0.10 lb/mmBtu. The Turbosorp® scrubber has operated commendably, routinely achieving &gt; 95% SO2 removal efficiency while the unit is firing mid-to-high sulfur coals (e.g., containing 2.5-5.0 lb SO2 / mmBtu). Moreover, all tests performed to-date have demonstrated 93-99% mercury removal as a co-benefit of the hybrid NOx control and Turbosorp® systems, without the need for any activated carbon injection.",,"Activated carbon injection; Baghouses; Circulating fluidized bed; Coal-fired power plant; Combustion modification; Combustion systems; Commercial deployment; Commercial operation; Dry scrubbing; Economies of scale; Emission reduction; Extensive testing; First year; Flue-gas desulfurization; Generating unit; High-sulfur coals; Innovative technology; Installed capacity; Large particles; Low capital costs; Mercury control; Mercury emissions; Mercury removal; Multi-pollutant control projects; Multi-pollutant control systems; Operating condition; Operational flexibility; Plant cost; Power environmental; Removal efficiencies; SCR catalysts; Selective non-catalytic reduction; Space constraints; Space requirements; U.S. Department of Energy; Activated carbon; Bituminous coal; Catalysts; Charcoal; Coal combustion; Coal industry; Control theory; Desulfurization; Economics; Environmental regulations; Flue gases; Fluidization; Fluidized bed combustion; Fluidized bed process; Fluidized beds; Fossil fuel power plants; Mercury (metal); Metal recovery; Mining; Pollution; Reduction; Removal; Retrofitting; Sulfur; Technology; Selective catalytic reduction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349592761

The engine behaviour in terms of efficiency and combustion process can be better understood by means of in-cylinder heat flux measurements. The study of the unsteady wall heat transfer, supported by previous studies of flame propagation and flame speed through ion sensors and optical fibres, reveals a limited influence of the reformer gas upon the heat transfer coefficient and possibly upon the flame-quenching distance, which is estimated in three different and independent ways. A detailed statistical analysis of single-cycle heat flux shows that the cycle-to-cycle variation remains large when the fraction of reformer gas in the fuel blend increases, even if the global engine stability improves. The comparison of numerous data shows how the chemical energy is released partly within the flame and partly within the post-flame region. This last can account for as much as 30 per cent of the total energy release. The analysis of slow and fast-burning cycles with different fuel blends shows that this fraction of energy is released only when, during the expansion stroke, the cylinder temperature decreases below a certain threshold, allowing radicals to recombine and carbon monoxide (CO) completely to oxidize to CO 2. © IMechE 2008.",,"Carbon monoxide; Combustion; Gas emissions; Gas engines; Gasoline; Impurities; Measurement theory; Mixed gas fuels; Reforming reactions; Fast burning cycles; Flame propagation; Reformer gases; Wall heat transfer; Heat flux",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40749090771

One strategy, Homogeneous-Charge Late-Injection (HCLI) combustion utilizes 55% or more cooled external Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) with a single Direct Injection strategy to control ignition timing. These engines are operated at low temperatures to ensure near zero NOx emissions, implying that fuel in the thermal boundary layers will not reach sufficient temperature to fully oxidize, resulting in Unburnt Hydrocarbon (UHC) and CO emissions. Of particular interest to HCLI engines are the UHC's that are not fully oxidized by the Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC). Experimental measurements reveal that at average equivalence ratios greater than 0.8, methane is the single largest tailpipe-out UHC emission. In this study, a four-cylinder 2.15 L Diamler (om646) engine is simulated with Fluent coupled to a 2D combustion code. The combustion model is formulated to account for thermal and mixture composition inhomogeneities in addition to turbulent mixing in the engine. The simulation results show good agreement with experimental pressure traces, and with engine-out CO emissions. The simulation indicates that while the majority of CO and UHC emissions are produced in fuel-lean mixtures, nearly all methane emissions originate from rich regions of incomplete mixing. © 2008 SAE International.",,"Boundary layers; Diesel engines; Engine cylinders; Exhaust gas recirculation; Exhaust gases; Fuels; Ignition; Methane; Mixing; Mixtures; Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Powertrains; Temperature; Diesel oxidation catalyst; Equivalence ratios; External exhaust gas recirculation; Mixture compositions; Numerical investigations; Partially-homogeneous; Thermal boundary layer; Un-burnt hydrocarbons; Direct injection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072475935

It is shown that both respond differently to drought and climate change forcing, with decentralised rainwater harvesting systems in cities exhibiting a more uniform performance across these stressors. The impact of natural variations in climate is considerable, with the inland catchments that supply cities exhibiting a disproportionate decrease in yield in response to rainfall reductions, as compared to rainwater tanks in the cities. A 50% decrease in median rainfall at each location results in a 60% to 85% reduction in runoff to dams and a 15% to 30% reduction in yield from 3 kL rainwater tanks. Rainwater yields from 3 kL tanks in the cities were more resilient to the potential for climate change than runoff into dams supplying the cities. Reductions in runoff from the worst case climate change scenario ranged from 19% to 53%, while reductions in yields from rainwater tanks were 5% to 8%.

When a dc motor driven alternator is used for laboratory tests the transient speed deviations are considerably smaller. Since the electrical characteristics of a dc motor allow for a fast torque response when experiencing an increased mechanical load, the varying frequency effect observed on the output voltage is not normally experienced in a laboratory scenario. This paper describes a method of recreating the mechanical response during load acceptance on a diesel gen-set when using a dc motor driven alternator.

Mach 1, 38010 San Michele all'Adige (TN), Italy","Background. The timing of grape ripening initiation, length of maturation period, berry size and seed content are target traits in viticulture. The availability of early and late ripening varieties is desirable for staggering harvest along growing season, expanding production towards periods when the fruit gets a higher value in the market and ensuring an optimal plant adaptation to climatic and geographic conditions. Berry size determines grape productivity; seedlessness is especially demanded in the table grape market and is negatively correlated to fruit size. These traits result from complex developmental processes modified by genetic, physiological and environmental factors. In order to elucidate their genetic determinism we carried out a quantitative analysis in a 163 individuals-F1 segregating progeny obtained by crossing two table grape cultivars. Results. Molecular linkage maps covering most of the genome (2n = 38 for Vitis vinifera) were generated for each parent. Eighteen pairs of homologous groups were integrated into a consensus map spanning over 1426 cM with 341 markers (mainly microsatellite, AFLP and EST-derived markers) and an average map distance between loci of 4.2 cM. Segregating traits were evaluated in three growing seasons by recording flowering, veraison and ripening dates and by measuring berry size, seed number and weight. QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) analysis was carried out based on single marker and interval mapping methods. QTLs were identified for all but one of the studied traits, a number of them steadily over more than one year. Clusters of QTLs for different characters were detected, suggesting linkage or pleiotropic effects of loci, as well as regions affecting specific traits. The most interesting QTLs were investigated at the gene level through a bioinformatic analysis of the underlying Pinot noir genomic sequence. Conclusion. Our results revealed novel insights into the genetic control of relevant grapevine features. They provide a basis for performing marker-assisted selection and testing the role of specific genes in trait variation. © 2008 Costantini et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Vitaceae; Vitis; Vitis vinifera; article; chromosome map; chromosome segregation; cross breeding; fruit; gene; genetic linkage; genetic marker; genetic recombination; genetics; grape; meiosis; phenotype; plant seed; quantitative trait; quantitative trait locus; Chromosome Segregation; Crosses, Genetic; Fruit; Genes, Plant; Genetic Markers; Linkage (Genetics); Meiosis; Phenotype; Physical Chromosome Mapping; Quantitative Trait Loci; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Recombination, Genetic; Seeds; Vitis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44049106913

The degradation of the organic fraction of the wastes in combination with percolating rainwater leads to the generation of highly contaminated liquid, called leachate. Municipal landfill leachates typically contain high concentrations of inorganic compounds (ammonium and metals), as well as high levels of organics, many of them also toxic and resistant to biodegradation. Because of this, treatment efficiency of conventional biological plant for landfill leachates is usually very low. The purpose of our research work was to evaluate the quality of the leachate originating from municipal landfill and to assess efficiency of air stripping and adsorption to activated carbon for reduction of toxicity of the leachate. Both TRE procedures were used to identify the contribution of organic substances (air stripping, adsorption) and ammonium nitrogen (air stripping) to toxicity of the effluent. We have followed the efficiency of single toxicity reduction method with measurement of physico-chemical parameters and toxicity bioassays. They were carried out by applying an acute toxicity test with luminiscent bacteria Vibrio fischeri and an acute test with nitrifying microorganisms from activated sludge. We have compared physico-chemical analysis and toxicity of the leachate before and after TRE procedures. Air stripping removed 85 of ammonium nitrogen at pH value of 11, but the removal of organics was low. On the other hand, adsorption to activated carbon (50 gL-1) removed 79 of organic compounds, but ammonium nitrogen remained. Both methods (TRE) did not decrease toxicity to the nitrifying microorganisms. We have concluded that ammonium nitrogen and organic substances do not contribute much to the toxicity of the leachate. Further work will be focused on some other TRE methods, mainly ion exchange to assess the contribution of high concentrations of inorganic compounds. © 2008 WIT Press.","Air-stripping; Landfill leached; Powdered activated carbon treatment; Toxicity reduction evaluation","air; bioassay; conference proceeding; landfill; toxicity; toxicology; Bacteria (microorganisms); Vibrio fischeri",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58849157902

Over recent times, the availability of data bases of historical climatic information and the development of predictive tools ranging from correlation analysis to computer simulation models have made the climatic information useful to a much wider range of stakeholders. This paper provides an overview of the elements of the decision-making process, and how these elements affect the adoption of, and benefits arising from, the decision. We examine both the technical and social barriers to decision-making. Major technical issues are lack of availability of data and lack of appropriate predictive tools. At the farm scale, the major social issue in decision-making is risk aversion due to personality or capacity to take risk, particularly in the case of resource poor farmers. Large farmers with low risk aversion and significant capital assets can take high risks for high and infrequent returns. At societal and larger scales, social issues and political responses become far more important. Elements in decision-making are illustrated via a number of Case Studies on the use of weather and climate predictions at different geographic scales (farm, region, national, and global) and time scales (days, months, years). The applications of short, medium and long-range forecasts at farm, regional and national levels is demonstrated drawing from our own research. These include applications of Seasonal Climate Forecasting (SCF) based on El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) for irrigation, crop and pasture management as part of a project funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural research (ACIAR). Other Case Studies examine the development of systems for forecasting national crop yields, requirements for commodity imports, and crop insurance schemes. The paper concludes by listing some initiatives that can improve the use of weather and climate data in agricultural planning and decision making in Developing Countries. These include improvements in the collection of meteorological data, development of locally applicable predictive tools, formation of groups and co-operatives that can make participative decisions to spread the risks associated with the decision-making, and greater involvement of Government to integrate the national research and application effort.","Agricultural planning; Cliamte risk; Decision-making",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78049470772

Methods: We used intrapulmonary arteries and/or endothelial cells, either exposed in vitro to particles or removed from PM-instilled animals for assessment of vasomotricity, cGMP and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and cytokine/chemokine release. Results: Endothelial NO-dependent relaxation and cGMP accumulation induced by acetylcholine (ACh) were both decreased after 24 hr exposure of rat intrapulmonary arteries to standard reference material 1648 (SRM1648; urban PM). Relaxation due to NO donors was also decreased by SRM1648, whereas responsiveness to cGMP analogue remained unaffected. Unlike SRM1648, ultrafine carbon black and ultrafine and fine titanium dioxide (TiO2) manufactured particles did not impair NO-mediated relaxation. SRM1648-induced decrease in relaxation response to ACh was prevented by dexamethasone (an anti-inflammatory agent) but not by antioxidants. Accordingly, SRM1648 increased the release of proinflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-interleukin-8) from intrapulmonary arteries or pulmonary artery endothelial cells, but did not elevate ROS levels within intrapulmonary arteries. Decreased relaxation in response to ACh was also evidenced in intrapulmonary arteries removed from rats intratracheally instilled with SRM1648, but not with fine TiO2. Conclusion: In contrast to manufactured particles (including nanoparticles), urban PM impairs NO but not cGMP responsiveness in intrapulmonary arteries. We attribute this effect to oxidative-stress-independent inflammatory response, resulting in decreased guanylyl cyclase activation by NO. Such impairment of the NO pathway may contribute to urban-PM-induced cardiovascular dysfunction.","Endothelium; Inflammation; NO; Particulate matter; Pulmonary artery","antioxidant; carbon; chemokine; cyclic GMP; cytokine; dexamethasone; guanylate cyclase; interleukin 8; nanoparticle; nitric oxide; nitric oxide donor; reactive oxygen metabolite; titanium dioxide; tumor necrosis factor alpha; nitric oxide; animal cell; animal tissue; artery endothelium; article; controlled study; cytokine release; endothelium cell; environmental exposure; enzyme activation; in vitro study; inflammation; male; nonhuman; oxidative stress; particulate matter; priority journal; pulmonary artery; rat; urban area; air pollutant; animal; cattle; comparative study; drug effect; muscle relaxation; physiology; Wistar rat; Animalia; Rattus; Air Pollutants; Animals; Cattle; Male; Muscle Relaxation; Nanoparticles; Nitric Oxide; Pulmonary Artery; Rats; Rats, Wistar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55949108248

Several factors have contributed to this, including high oil prices, emerging recovery technologies, increasing world demand for liquid hydrocarbons, and the continued decline in U.S. conventional oil production. In recent years, several initiatives have been taken by government and the private sector to encourage the development of a domestic oil shale industry. The United States has the largest and most concentrated deposits of oil shale in the world, including nearly 2.0 trillion barrels across the eastern and western states. However, until recently, U.S. oil shale development efforts have largely been in hiatus. Several other nations also have significant oil shale resources, including China, Estonia, Israel, and Turkey. Since 2006, more than 25 U.S. companies have made public information about new oil shale technologies. Other non-U.S. companies have also achieved significant advances. An analysis has been conducted to identify and profile advanced oil shale technologies that improve performance and help mitigate barriers to commercialization. Advances include reduced water use, improved energy efficiency and net energy balance, better carbon and emissions management, reduced surface impact, spent shale use and disposal, and effective groundwater protection. The analysis addresses both surface and in-situ processes and includes technologies intended to produce liquid fuels or to fire electric power generation. Notable examples include the Kiviter and Galoter retorts in use in Estonia, the Alberta Taciuk Processor considered for use by OSEC in Utah, Shell's In-Situ Conversion process under consideration in Colorado and in Jordan, Petrobras' Petrosix Gas Combustion Retort (and variations) in use in Brazil, the Raytheon/CF radio-frequency with critical fluids technology just licensed by Schlumberger, and the EcoShale process under development in Utah. The results of the analysis suggest significant promise that production of oil from oil shale can be technically and economically feasible while meeting rigorous industry and public standards for technical performance, resource conservation, and environmental protection. It also identifies areas where further research, development, and demonstration are needed.

GGAS aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with the generation and use of electricity through project-based activities to offset the production of emissions. GGAS applies in two jurisdictions that are part of a wholesale electricity market operating across a total of six jurisdictions and this imposes some constraints on scheme design. Nevertheless, GGAS has developed a set of comprehensive operational systems and procedures to validate energy efficiency projects and verify the abatement they produce. To the end of calendar year 2006, nearly ten million energy efficiency certificates have been created under GGAS, representing nearly ten million tonnes of CO2-e abatement. Some significant issues have arisen regarding the creation of certificates from the mass distribution of small energy-efficient household appliances. However, the experience with GGAS still demonstrates that tradeable energy efficiency certificates can be an effective mechanism for incentivising greenhouse gas emissions abatement in the context of a baseline-and-credit emissions trading scheme. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","Additionality; Baseline-and-credit; Emissions trading; Energy efficiency certificates; Greenhouse; White certificates","Air quality; Alternative fuels; Commerce; Domestic appliances; Electricity; Gas emissions; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Leakage (fluid); Additionality; Baseline-and-credit; Emissions trading; Energy efficiency certificates; White certificates; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54349092550

Current and impending regulations on emissions and energy conservation are making attractive the reductions in asphalt mix production temperature. Warm mix asphalt (WMA) is a means to this end and several systems have been developed including: foaming, emulsions, additives, synthetic binders and others. Warm mix asphalt is produced at temperatures 20 to 40°C lower than hot mix asphalt (HMA). The immediate benefit of producing and placing asphalt mixes at a lower temperature is the reduction in energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, fumes, and odors generated at the plant and the paving site. Furthermore, the technical benefits are substantial including reduction of short term binder hardening, reduction of mixture tenderness, possible increase of percentage of reclaimed asphalt pavement in new asphalt pavement mixes and possible extension of the construction season. This paper presents an overview of the current warm mix asphalt state-of-practice. A review of the various warm mix asphalt systems is provided. Findings of various studies concerning the observed and measured field performance and the environmental benefits in terms of energy conservation and reduced greenhouse gas emissions are also detailed in the paper.",,"Asphalt; Energy conservation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Construction efficiency; Construction season; Environmental benefits; Environmental stewardship; Reclaimed asphalt pavements; Reduction in energy consumption; Technological improvements; Warm mix asphalt (WMA); Asphalt pavements",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896612805

The quantitative description shows that the ISM consists mainly of surfaces, so that the stellar UV-radiation can deeply penetrate into the ISM and in consequence dominates its physical and chemical conditions. Thus, the bulk of the ISM can be identified as photon dominated regions (PDRs). A simple model with the proper fractal characteristics is that of an ensemble of spherical clumps with a power-law mass spectrum and a power-law mass-size relation. Hence, we model the FIR line emission of the molecular gas by the integrated emission of such an ensemble, calculating the emission of individual clumps with the KOSMA-τ PDR code. This clumpy PDR-model, with observationally constrained parameters, is fitted to the CO, [C I], and [O I] emission along the Galactic plane as observed by the FIRAS instrument abord the COBE satellite. The FIR line intensity distribution with Galactic longitude is reproduced within factors of about 2.

For the class of engines of interest in this work, namely liquid-propellant rocket engines, the pressure is always supercritical, whereas the temperature could be either sub- or super-critical; however, propellants are typically injected into an environment that exceeds the critical temperature and pressure for both fuel and oxidizer, therefore a fast transition to a supercritical state is observed. In such a condition, it is possible to neglect the liquid phase and treat the liquid as a ""dense"" gaseous jet. However, the ideal gas equation of state is not suitable for computing the correct p-v-T relationship for oxygen and fuel at the operating pressure and temperature typical of LOx/HC rocket combustion chambers. Therefore, a suitable equation of state together with adequate model equations for the transport properties are employed. Starting from this background, the current work provides a model for the numerical simulation of high-pressure turbulent combustion employing detailed chemistry description, embedded in a Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations solver with a Low Reynolds number k-ε turbulence model.","Compressibility factor; Flamelet; High pressure combustion; Progress-variable","Adequate models; Compressibility factor; Critical technologies; Critical temperatures; Detailed chemistry; Equation of state; Fast transition; Flamelets; High pressure; High-pressure combustion; Ideal gas equations; Key issues; Liquid Phase; Low Reynolds number; Numerical simulation; Operating pressure; P-V-T relationships; Progress-variable; Propulsive performance; Research efforts; Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes Equations; Rocket combustion chambers; Scientific community; Super-critical; Supercritical state; Turbulent combustion; Boosters (rocket); Combustion chambers; Compressibility; Computer simulation; Environmental impact; Equations of state of gases; Explosives; Gases; Ground operations; Hydrocarbons; Liquids; Navier Stokes equations; Oxygen; Propellants; Propulsion; Real variables; Reynolds number; Rockets; Transport properties; Turbulence models; Combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957848390

In the present work detailed investigations of limited emission compounds and of particle emissions of 2-strokc scooters with direct injection and with carburetor were performed. To demonstrate the emission reduction potentials some possibilities of emission improvements were combined in steps. These technical measures were: • Higher tier lube oils • Lower oil dosing • Active oxidation catalyst • Supplementary filtration &amp; oxidation devise (WFC)z.ast;z.ast;). • Special fuel. The particle mass and nanoparticles, which are amply present in the 2-strokc exhaust gas and which contribute strongly to the toxicity level arc still unlimited by the international exhaust gas legislation. They were extensively investigated in the present project series. It was impressively demonstrated, that a strong reduction of particle emissions is possible by means of a combination of these technical measures. There arc also further possibilities of improvements, like total filtration, or use of alternative fuels. All those technical measures can be effective for the vehicles on the road only if the necessary market conditions will be created like: incentives for better products, production conformity control, in-use compliance control, public information and others.","Catalyst efficiency; Emission reduction; Particle emissions scooters; Wircmesh filter catalyst","Catalyst efficiency; Compliance control; Emission reduction; Lube oil; Market condition; Oxidation catalysts; Particle emissions; Particle mass; Public information; Reduction potential; Technical measures; Urban areas; Air quality; Alternative fuels; Catalysts; Emission control; Vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866107099

However, in an environment of limited funding only the most effective projects can be implemented, and agencies require metrics to help determine which TCMs to pursue. The comparison of different TCMs is complicated by the fact that projects which address one pollutant may not impact another, and while Ozone is analyzed on a daily basis, PM2.5 and its precursors are evaluated using an annual comparison. There is a need to simplify the analysis and selection of projects by providing a metric or composite measure that summarizes total emissions benefits in a clear and concise way. This paper focuses on a metric developed for the New Jersey Department of Transportation in support of their recent analysis of Reasonably Available Control Measures (RACMs.) The Emissions Score was developed as a way to collapse both annual and daily estimates of emission benefits for multiple pollutants into a single, consistent value. This metric considers the annual and daily emissions targets for each pollutant, the estimated current inventory for each pollutant and a series of weighting factors that emphasize the pollutants of most concern, to the region. The Emissions Score was used to rank the proposed projects in terms of overall impact. Ultimately this rating, combined with other factors such as cost effectiveness and political feasibility, was used to articulate the effectiveness of the TCM projects proposed in the study.

The energetically preferred spatial conformation of n -pyrrole oligomers (n=1-24) in both the reduced and oxidized phases is obtained and analyzed in this paper within the hybrid density functional theory. Binding energies, gap energies, radius of gyration, end-to-end distance, and vibrational frequencies are reported as functions of oligomer length. Reduced n -pyrrole are bent chains for all sizes showing a dramatic departure from planarity. Vibrational spectra of n -pyrrole oligomers indicate the presence of two fairly size-insensitive frequency regions, which increase in intensity with increasing oligomer size. Several oxidation levels were analyzed for n -pyrrole through the distribution of the carbon-carbon bond orders and single/double bond lengths. It is shown that the oxidation level is directly related to the way positive charge localizes along the n -pyrrole oligomer chain. If charge/ n<13, the oligomers are bent and charge is delocalized; if charge/ n13, the oligomers are planar and charge notoriously localizes in n /charge regions along the backbone. Calculations with electronegative dopants show that charge localizes in the neighborhood of the dopant. It is demonstrated that one localized state in the gap between the highest occupied and lowest-unoccupied states appears for every +2e in the oxidation level. The band structure of infinite reduced polypyrrole gives a band gap energy in excellent agreement with experiment. The evolution of the band gap and the charge-localized band as a function of polypyrrole oxidation level is reported. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",,"ABS resins; Binding energy; Chemical oxygen demand; Conducting polymers; Conjugated polymers; Density functional theory; Doping (additives); Energy gap; Gallium alloys; Molecular spectroscopy; Nitrogen compounds; Oligomers; Organic conductors; Oxidation; Polypyrroles; Probability density function; A densities; Band gaps; Carbon bonds; Charge regions; Frequency regions; Functional approaches; Gap energies; Hybrid density functional theories; Localized bands; Localized states; N- pyrroles; Oligomer chains; Oligomer lengths; Oxidation levels; Planarity; Polypyrrole oxidations; Positive charges; Radius of gyrations; Spatial conformations; Unoccupied states; Vibrational frequencies; Polymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55349122174

Its phosphate-binding action involves ionic binding and precipitation of insoluble complexes within the lumen of the intestine, thereby preventing absorption of dietary phosphate. While pharmacokinetics have little relevance to the efficacy of lanthanum carbonate, they are of fundamental importance when it comes to evaluating safety. When administered as lanthanum carbonate, the oral bioavailability of lanthanum is low (~0.001%). The small absorbed fraction is excreted predominantly in bile, with less than 2% being eliminated by the kidneys. Predictably, therefore, plasma exposure and pharmacokinetics have been shown to be similar in healthy human volunteers and CKD stage 5 patients. With almost complete plasma protein binding, free lanthanum concentrations in patients at steady state are <3 pg/mL. These properties greatly reduce systemic exposure, tissue deposition and the potential for adverse effects. While lanthanum has a variety of calcium-like actions in vitro, there is little or no evidence that these occur in vivo. This paradox is explained by the very low concentrations of circulating free lanthanum ions, which are many orders of magnitude lower than reported effect concentrations in vitro. Safety pharmacology and toxicology evaluations have failed to reveal any significant calcium-like actions in vivo, despite inclusion of high intravenous doses in some cases. Lanthanum carbonate has a low propensity to cause systemic drug interactions due to its poor absorption. However, the higher concentrations present in the gastrointestinal tract can form chelates with some drugs, such as fluoroquinolones, and reduce their absorption. The improved understanding of the pharmacokinetics of lanthanum that has emerged in recent years has helped to explain why the myriad of calcium-like effects described in vitro for lanthanum have little if any relevance in vivo. The pharmacokinetic investigations of lanthanum carbonate formed an important part of the stringent premarketing safety assessment process and have been influential in reassuring both regulators and physicians that the agent can be used safely and effectively in this vulnerable dialysis population. © 2008 Adis Data Information BV.

The MEMS measured 5Hz NOx, and load was obtained from the electronic control unit. Trucks were loaded to about 95% of their gross vehicle weights. Emissions in g/mi and g/bhp-hr were computed over the various road routes. In addition, some of the trucks were tested 1 to 2 years later to determine emission changes that may have occurred for these trucks. Emission results varied significantly over the different road routes due to different speeds, driving patterns, and road grades. Careful analysis of the available data indicates that both the brake-specific and distance-specific NOx emissions on later model year trucks were lower than the earlier model year trucks, and these average NOx reductions were approximately proportional to the reductions in the brake-specific emission standards. Furthermore, analysis of the vehicles that were re-tested after 1-2 years (with mileage above their emissions useful life) indicated a small reduction in NOx emissions with mileage or age, on average.

SAE 2008-01-1852 estimates the fuel economy levels that the California and federal programs can be expected to require, under assumptions stated in that paper. This paper applies those fuel economy estimates to examine the impact of the California and federal programs on lifecycle emissions of GHGs and carbon dioxide (""CO2""). EISA 2007 not only proposes to improve car and LDT fuel economy, but it also proposes to reduce GHGs through its Renewable Fuel Standards (""RFS"") provisions, which are likely to lead to substantial expansion in the use of 85% ethanol gasoline blends (E85). It is unlikely, however, that E85 use will expand in California and states that have adopted California emission standards because those standards effectively restrict the production of E85 FFVs. This difference between the California and federal programs likely will make the California program less effective in reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions, especially outside of California. California is working to implement a Low Carbon Fuel Standard that may address this issue within California. This paper evaluates the impacts of the two programs in two states-California and Colorado. The analysis shows that the California standards may, under certain assumptions, result in somewhat lower fleetwide CO2 and GHG emissions in the 2012 to 2018 calendar year time frame. The California program's advantage over the Federal program is much shorter in Colorado than in California, due to the greater fraction of light duty trucks sold in Colorado. Under an alternative scenario that assumes that fuel economy standards are maximum feasible regardless of location, the federal program provides greater CO2 and GHG benefits due to the RFS provisions. Under either set of assumptions, however, after 2018 or thereabouts, the federal program provides greater CO2 and GHG benefits.

Widespread shallow- and marginal-marine conditions during the Asbian and Brigantian are recorded by mixed carbonate and siliciclastic deposits across northern Britain. Further south, carbonate successions developed on the platforms and shelves of England, Wales, and southern Ireland. Distinctive changes in the stacking pattern of the cycles defined from these successions at different locations suggest regional transgressions in the Asbian during a period of high global temperatures. In the mid-Brigantian, a marine transgression reduced deposition on the carbonate platforms and flooded the Midland Valley of Scotland, connecting previously separate subbasins. During the latest Mississippian (Namurian), the first extensive Southern Hemisphere glacigenic deposits broadly coincide with a positive shift in the carbon and oxygen stable isotope record and a transition to a humid climate in paleo-tropical latitudes. At this time across Britain and Ireland, siliciclastic fluvial, deltaic, and deep-water deposition dominated, and extensive peat mires developed in Scotland. Large-scale multistory fluvial systems (several tens of kilometers in width and tens of meters in thickness) incised into marine and deltaic deposits during periods of low eustatic sea level, and widespread marine bands are interpreted as eustatic sea-level rises. During the Westphalian, extensive peat mires developed on low-gradient waterlogged depositional plains. The presence of several widespread Westphalian marine bands suggests that significant eustatic rises led to extensive transgressions of this largely nonmarine environment. In the Asbian and Brigantian, eustatic sea-level changes were probably of lower magnitude during a period of higher global temperatures. During the early Namurian, the shift to a much cooler global climate provided a mechanism for generating higher-magnitude and higher-frequency eustatic changes as ice sheets waxed and waned. © 2008 Geological Society of America.","Glacio-eustasy; Paleoclimate; Paleoequatorial; Sedimentary architecture","Carbonation; Deposits; Glacial geology; Ice; Peat; Sedimentology; Eustasy; Eustatic sea-level rise; Late paleozoic ice age; Non-marine environments; Oxygen stable isotopes; Paleoclimates; Paleoequatorial; Sedimentary architecture; Sea level; carbonate platform; depositional environment; depositional sequence; glacioeustacy; Mississippian; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; paleolatitude; paleotemperature; sequence stratigraphy; transgression; Westphalian; Ireland; Midland Valley; Scotland; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-75249091088

Since flame retardants work in a passive mode to help prevent fires from starting and slow down the progress of fires that do start, we generally do not realize the important role they have in many of the products we use on a daily basis. In the end-use application, flame retardants delay the spread of fires or delay the time of flashover in order to enable people more time to escape the effects of the fires. The ultimate purpose of their use is to save lives, reduce injury, reduce destruction of property, and reduce local pollutants that result from fires. Despite the ability to help save lives, flame retardants have received a considerable amount of negative publicity due to perceived environmental and toxicological issues. A great deal of information is publicly available on the potential health and environmental effects of commonly used flame retardants, including EU Risk Assessments. Industry is responding to the challenge to ensure that flame retardants are sustainable. Environmental criteria alone are not sufficient to guarantee sustainable flame retardants for the future.

This is particularly true in the rapidly growing commercial vehicle sector in India. As roadinfrastructure improves, and as the need for goods transportation and personal mobility increases, fleet owners will respond by demanding state-of-the-art heavy-duty diesel engines that can carry heavier payloads while providing optimal fuel efficiency. Based on the European experience, the primary path to achieving improved engine performance is to increase the Peak Firing Pressure (Pmax) in the combustion chamber. In the European commercial vehicle sector, Pmax has increased from approximately 180 bar in 1999 to 220∼240 bar in 2007. The resulting increase in thermal and mechanical loading have required a change from conventional grey cast iron to Compacted Graphite Iron (CGI) in order to satisfy durability requirements without increasing the size or the weight of the engines. With at least 75% higher tensile strength, 45% higher stiffness and approximately double the fatigue strength of conventional grey cast iron, CGI satisfies durability requirements and also provides the dimensional stability required to meet emissions legislation throughout the life of the engine. In response to EURO 4 legislation, nine new heavy-duty CGI engines were launched in Europe during 2007. As the same EURO 4 legislation will be phased-in to major cities in India during 2009, the same Peak Firing Pressure solutions and durability challenges will undoubtedly be faced, and the same solutions will undoubtedly be implemented. As a result, it is forecast that the Indian foundry industry will experience a significant up-turn in CGI product development and series production before the end of the decade. Of course, this CGI activity and production experience will also lead toward new opportunities for the export market.",,"Commercial vehicle sector; Compacted graphite iron; Emissions legislation; Engine performance; Export markets; Fatigue strength; Foundry industries; Fuel efficiency; Goods transportation; Grey cast iron; Heavy-duty diesel engine; Major cities; Mechanical loading; Peak-firing pressures; Performance and emissions; Personal mobility; Primary path; Series production; Automobiles; Cast iron; Combustion chambers; Commercial vehicles; Durability; Engine cylinders; Fleet operations; Foundries; Fuel economy; Graphite; Product development; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651298250

Although independently commissioned, and designed to serve different purposes, they both deal with the practicalities of reducing carbon emissions in London; one through a technical analysis, and the other through the use of policy instruments. The first identifies how best it is to achieve future carbon savings with different mixes of energy technologies, while the other analyses the impact of regional planning policy on renewable energy implementation. Together they provide a picture of what needs to be done to achieve carbon emissions reductions targets in a large city using distributed and embedded energy systems, both technically and through policy frameworks. The report ""London carbon scenarios to 2026"" investigated the possible mix of energy technologies that could be deployed at a local and regional level to meet target carbon emissions reductions. The paradigm of local and regional implementation must necessarily assume some local or regional coordination, with some degree of power to influence the energy system. It is becoming increasingly apparent that there needs to be a sufficient political will and leadership to help force the pace of change necessary to meet even the minimum targets. London has set itself clear policy objectives to reduce its carbon footprint, and move towards a new paradigm in energy delivery. The aim is to increase embedded energy generation substantially, while improving the energy efficiency of the building stock. It is clear that success in meeting percentage carbon reduction targets is heavily dependent on planners and developers understanding the requirements and setting up clear mechanisms to negotiate the final design. © 2008 Copyright © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The Antarctic ozone hole continues to form every year and let harmful radiation reach the surface. In some years, ozone levels also drop alarm ingly in the Arctic. Even so, observations suggest Earth's beleaguered ozone layer is beginning to recover. According to a new study, the protocol is also providing the polar regions with some protection from another threat: climate change. Olaf Morgenstern of Cambridge University and his colleagues have simulated what Earth's climate would be like in 2025 if levels of ODS had continued to rise unchecked since 1989. Ozone depletion affects circulation and climate in the stratosphere and, through coupling, in the atmosphere closer to Earth's surface. The Cambridge model predicts an annual mean warming of around 1 K in the polar regions and a remarkable spring time warming of 2-3 K in the lee of the Antarctic Peninsula. In the Arctic, Canada and Greenland warm considerably more than northern Siberia.

In order to investigate how the forecast more stressing factors could affect Mediterranean shrubland ecosystems, an appropriate manipulation of the microclimate was carried out in an area covered by Mediterranean maquis aimed at extending the drought period and increasing the night-time temperature. Soil cover, plant growth, litterfall, leaf water status, and leaf nutritional status were monitored over three growing seasons. The manipulation altered the microclimate according to common scenarios, increasing mean annual night-time air temperature by about 1 °C and mean annual temperature by about 0.5 °C, and decreasing precipitation between 6-46% of the total rainfall during the growing seasons. A general increase of vegetation cover was observed in the whole community during the three years of experimentation. This positive temporal pattern was mainly observed in control and warming treatment, whereas in the drought treatment it was less evident. At species-specific level, a clear negative effect of drought treatment was observed for C. monspeliensis percentage cover. Shoot elongation was not significantly affected by the warming treatment. A significant negative effect of drought treatment was noticed in the 2001-2002 and 2002-2003 growing seasons. An increase of N and P concentrations in the drought treatment in Cistus was observed and it can be explained by the reduced shoot growth induced by the water shortage that we had observed in the same treatment. The absence of a concentration effect on the other two species could be the signal of the different behaviour with regard to a drier climate, and therefore could be a symptom of future change in species composition.

However, the contribution of smaller rivers is still poorly understood, mainly because of limitations in mapping their spatial extent. Considering that the largest extension of the Amazon River network is composed of small rivers, the authors' objective was to elucidate their role in air-water CO2 exchange by developing a geographic information system (GIS)-based model to calculate the surface area covered by rivers with channels less than 100 m wide, combined with estimated CO2 outgassing rates at the Ji-Paraná River basin, in the western Amazon. Estimated CO 2 outgassing was the main carbon export pathway for this river basin, totaling 289 Gg C yr-1, about 2.4 times the amount of carbon exported as dissolved inorganic carbon (121 Gg C yr-1) and 1.6 times the dissolved organic carbon export (185 Gg C yr-1). The relationships established here between drainage area and channel width provide a new model for determining small river surface area, allowing regional extrapolations of air-water gas exchange. Applying this model to the entire Amazon River network of channels less than 100 m wide (third to fifth order), the authors calculate that the surface area of small rivers is 0.3 ± 0.05 million km2, and it is potentially evading to the atmosphere 170 ± 42 Tg C yr-1 as CO2. Therefore, these ecosystems play an important role in the regional carbon balance. © 2008, Paper 12-006; 6,817 words, 5 Figures, 0 Animations, 4 Tables.","Biogeochemical cycles and modeling; Carbon cycling; Hydrologic scaling","Biogeochemical cycle; Carbon balance; Carbon cycling; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Dissolved organic carbon; Hydrologic scaling; Inorganic carbon; Outgassing rate; Air; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Ecology; Geographic information systems; Watersheds; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879308911

At present biofuel production is estimated at 35 billion liters, accounting only for a small part (∼2%) of the 1200 billion liters of annual gasoline consumption worldwide. But the contribution of biofuels to energy supply is expected to grow fast with beneficial impacts including reductions in greenhouse gasses, improved energy security and new income sources for farmers. However, biomass production for energy will also compete with food crops for scarce land and water resources, already a major constraint on agricultural production in many parts of the world. China and India, the world's two largest producers and consumers of many agricultural commodities, already face severe water limitations in agricultural production, yet both have initiated programs to boost biofuel production. This paper explores the land and water implications of increased biofuel production globally and with special focus on these two important countries, using the WATERSIM model. It concludes that, although of lesser concern at the global level, local and regional impact could be substantial. In fact, the strain on water resources would be such in China and India that it is unlikely that policy makers will pursue biofuel options, at least those based on traditional field crops. © IWA Publishing 2008.","Bio-ethanol; Biofuels; China; India; Water requirements; Water scarcity implications",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40449132719

It is demonstrated that aquifer thermal energy storage supplemented with surface water heat collection in summer, yields sufficient heat to compensate total heat demand of a residential district. Using the urban water system as energy source makes natural gas supply obsolete, provides a CO2 reduction of 60% and is preferable in terms of costs compared to conventional gas based central heating installations. The feasibility of the urban groundwater system, urban surface water system, and the economic feasibility are determined in this paper. The local groundwater feasibility to supply the design discharge is determined by soil and aquifer characteristics from the national groundwater data-base, reference projects, and bore-hole data. A heat balance model is used to quantify effects on the water system. Internal rate of return calculation for the investments and full lifetime exploitation costs are used to determine the economic feasibility of the concept. In summer, there is a net water temperature decrease of 1.5-1.6 °C. Water quality and ecological improvement take place because a lower temperature results in increasing oxygen content. Moreover, the expected water temperature increase by climate change can be prevented. The concept is economically feasible. Considering the full lifetime and all investment and exploitation costs, the concept is more profitable than a conventional system.","Aquifer thermal energy storage; Sustainable energy; Urban water",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65449181620

On site biomethane production, through anaerobic digestion or future gasification-methanization plants, will allow the problem of gas distribution to be overcome when a natural gas grid is not widely diffused. The capture and use of biomethane derived from the organic waste matter decomposition process allows a significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Biogas production plants represent an attractive way, alternative to simple composting, to reduce organic material landfill disposal, as required by the European Union. With reference to dedicated crops, biomethane represents the most efficient method of biomass utilization in comparison with other biofuels in the first generation category. In any case, the same problems of land use competition (especially food in developing countries) can derive from the low conversion efficiency of solar energy in biomass. A better approach is given by the second generation for the capacity to use almost all the parts of the vegetables, leaving the edible fraction for food employment. For this category the best results could also be obtained with biomethane allowing consequent lower land use competition. Improvements in hydrogen production from waste and biomass by dark fermentation and the connected possibility of direct production of methane/hydrogen mixtures could be another advantage thanks to the possibility of favouring gas engine development with higher efficiency and further decreasing emissions.","Biomass; Biomethane; Greenhouse effect; Natural gas; Waste","Air pollution; Anaerobic digestion; Automobile parts and equipment; Automobiles; Biochemical engineering; Biofuels; Biogas; Biological materials; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Competition; Conversion efficiency; Developing countries; Environmental impact; Environmental regulations; Gas emissions; Gas engines; Gas fuel manufacture; Gas industry; Gas plants; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Internal combustion engines; Land use; Leakage (fluid); Natural gas; Renewable energy resources; Sewage; Solar energy; Biogas productions; Biomass utilizations; Biomethane; Dark fermentations; Decomposition process; Direct productions; Efficient methods; Engine development; European unions; Gas distributions; Green house gas emissions; Higher efficiencies; Land-use competitions; Landfill disposals; Natural gas engines; Natural gas grids; Organic materials; Organic wastes; Second-generations; Stringent regulations; Toxicological impacts; Urban areas; Waste; Gases; biofuel; conference proceeding; environmental impact assessment; European Union; greenhouse effect; methanogenesis; natural gas; toxicology; urban area",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58849118913

The market for carbon credits has grown rapidly within the recent years and has been projected to exceed $500 billion in trades by 2020. This developing situation certainly warrants watching by rangeland interests. Rising carbon credit prices would certainly make investments in rangeland mitigation projects a financially attractive, and an environmentally proactive, alternative to traditional land management. However, as a relatively small portion of any potential private sector carbon market, terrestrial sequestration in general, and rangelands in particular, must operate efficiently within the market (prices and rules) and exploit inherent competitive advantages. Rangeland carbon sequestration projects are competitive because of the relatively low cost of achieving increased soil carbon storage and its compatibility with existing management operations and production systems. On the other hand, documenting and verifying changes in carbon storage is a daunting challenge. The success of rangeland projects as participants in a private sector market will be determined in large part by the ability of the rangeland management profession (scientists, advisors, and managers) to develop accurate, credible, and cost-effective protocols to ensure to both buyers and the public that gains are real.",,"carbon sequestration; climate change; environmental economics; land management; private sector; rangeland; trade-environment relations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65549128184

The numerical models used in this study are the Brazilian Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (BRAMS) developed originally by Colorado State University and the Advanced Research Weather Research Forecast (WRF-ARW) Model, version 2.0.1, developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The simulations carried out in this study use the Grell-Devenyi Ensemble cumulus parameterization scheme. Apart from using climatological sea surface temperature (SST) for the control simulations, the impact of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) SST on the simulation of rainfall is evaluated using these two models. The performances of the models are compared by examining the predicted parameters like upper- and lower-level circulations, moisture, temperature, and rainfall. The strength of convective instability is also derived by calculating the convective available potential energy. The intensity of maximum rainfall around Mumbai is significantly improved with TMI SST as the surface boundary condition in both the models. The large-scale circulation features, moisture, and temperature are compared with those in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction analyses.

Diagnosing potential problems on an SCR may be facilitated by reliably monitoring NOx concentrations at the inlet as well as the outlet to the SCR unit. In addition to obtaining temporal data on NOx concentrations, having spatially resolved measurements enable location of degraded performance within the catalytic bed. In the past, inlet and outlet NOx was measured using conventional extractive continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS). Such systems are used for reporting regulated emissions. They are expensive to purchase. Extractive, so-called, micro-CEMS cost less than the regulatory CEMS; however, both types of CEMS require frequent maintenance. Because of these cost issues, operators are reluctant to install multiple instruments to gain spatially resolved monitoring capability. HORIBA in collaboration with the EPRI Instrumentation and Control Center have developed a low cost, low-maintenance, in-situ instrument for monitoring NOx concentrations, the INM-700. The benefits of such an instrument for the SCR application is that its low purchase price and low operating and maintenance cost free the operator to deploy multiple units at both inlets and outlets to SCRs; the in-situ nature of the measurement allows the instrument to be precisely located with none of the drawbacks of sample handling lines and time lags associated with extractive methods.

Fully premixed fueling was used for the fueling sweep. This sweep extended from a fuel/air equivalence ratio (φ) of 0.28, which is sufficiently high to achieve a combustion efficiency of 96%, down to a below-idle fueling rate of φ = 0.08, with a combustion efficiency of only 55%. The stratification sweep was conducted at an idle fueling rate, using an 8-hole GDI injector to vary stratification from well-mixed conditions for an early start of injection (SOI) (40°CA) to highly stratified conditions for an SOI well up the compression stroke (325°CA, 35°bTDC-compression). The engine speed was 1200 rpm. At each operating condition, exhaust samples were collected and analyzed by GC-FID for the C1 and C2 hydrocarbon (HC) species and by GC-MS for all other species except formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. These two species were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography. In addition, standard emissions-bench exhaust analysis equipment was used to measure total HC, CO, CO2, O2, and NOX simultaneously with the sampling for the detailed-speciation analysis. Good overall agreement was found between the emissions-bench data and total HC from the detailed measurements. Unreacted fuel, iso-octane, was by far the most prevalent HC species at all operating conditions. Numerous other HC and oxygenated HC (OHC) species were found that could be identified as breakdown products of iso-octane. Several smaller HC and OHC species were also identified. At the highest φ, emissions of all species were low, except iso-octane. As φ was reduced, emissions of all species increased, but the rate of increase varied substantially for the different species. Analysis showed that these differences were related to the degree of breakdown from the parent fuel and the in-cylinder location where they formed. SOI-sweep results indicated that stratification improves combustion efficiency by reducing the fuel penetration to the crevice and cylinder-wall boundary-layer regions, as well as by creating a locally richer mixture that burns hotter and more completely. © 2008 SAE International.",,"Boundary layers; Combustion; Diesel engines; Efficiency; Fueling; High performance liquid chromatography; Hydrocarbons; Polyols; Combustion efficiencies; Equivalence ratios; Fuel stratification; Operating condition; Oxygenated hydrocarbon; Speciation analysis; Speciation measurements; Start of injections; Fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072459654

The best option (considering efficacy-, cost and additional benefits) to mitigate greenhouse gas is the use of SOC sequestration activities which are based on increasing soil carbon inputs, and/or slowing decomposition processes of crop residues and SOC itself. A variety of management practices have been developed and tested to maintain, or possibly increase crop production and soil organic matter levels. These options include reduced or no-tillage, the addition of organic amendments, improved crop nutrition, and crop rotations that include legumes. Drinkwater et al. (1998) reported that rotations with legumes can maintain higher SOC levels than continuous cropping systems with non-leguminous row crops. Gregorich et al 2001, found greatest difference m soil C levels between alfalfa-com rotation and monoculture com systems. Cropping with deep-rooted alfalfa was the key factor in maintaining higher levels of SOC, particularly at depths below the plow layer. This is attribute to the higher legume derived aromatic SOC compounds below the plow layer; these C compounds are more resistant and so they contributed to an annual increase of SOC that could range from 40 to 85 gC m-2y-1as reported by Drinkwater (1998) and Gregorich (2001) respectively. More detailed studies, based on ecosystem C balance, are required on land use change from monoculture com (Zea Mays L.) to rotation maize with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). This study investigates the effects on Net Ecosystem Production (NEP) and Net Biome Production (NBP) one year after conversion from monoculture com to rotation com with alfalfa. The additional objective of this study is to make an estimation of Global Warming Potential considering N2O emissions as affected by the crop rotation change. © 2008, Page Press Publications.

The flow equations are first presented followed by a brief discussion of the equation of state (EOS) and a description of the two-phase flash algorithm. An implicit-pressure, explicit-concentrations (IMPEC) sequential algorithm is then applied iteratively to enforce the non-linear volume balance saturation) constraint. The pressure equation is solved using mixed FEM, while the concentrations are updated consistent with requiring local mass balance of every component. Thermal effects also play an important role in such problems since they effect the phase properties and hence, stable and accurate locally conservative methods are desirable to model the thermal energy balance equation. To this end, we present also a time-split scheme for modeling the energy balance equation that is sequentially coupled to the flow solution rendering it cheap yet accurate for the complex problems being modeled. Results of benchmark problems in compositional flow modeling are presented and validated where possible. Some large-scale parallel tests are performed on more challenging applications such as those with highly heterogeneous permeability fields on very fine grids. Efficient parallel scalability of the code on upto 512 processors is also demonstrated.

Supplementing oil consumption with renewable biomass resources looks a very promising step towards this goal in this journey. The US government has already defined goals for increasing the use of biomass-derived feedstocks, and the production of fuels from those alternative sources. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 calls for domestic production of alternative fuels to be 36 billion gallons per year by 2022, 14 billion of which is to be produced by XTL process. Rentech is the leader in synthetic fuels production technology, and is about to start demonstration plant to produce alternative fuels using XTL route. Rentech process is very flexible to handle variety of feedstocks such as biomass, municipal waste, pet-coke and coal and produces variety of chemicals and fuels such as diesel and jet fuels using multiple commercially-available proven technologies on front- and back-end. BCTL plant with appropriate mixture of coal and biomass produces fuels with a net carbon footprint 20% lower than low-sulfur diesel from a conventional petroleum refinery. Rentech aims reducing greenhouse gas footprint of fuels from the Rentech Process to a level significantly below that of petroleum derived fuels. Various biomass feedstocks will be tested at Process Demonstration Unit by co-feeding of biomass with coal or petroleum coke to produce ultraclean synthetic fuels. Rentech is working on building a commercial synthetic fuels plant in Adams County, Mississippi to be completed by 2011. Phase I targets synthetic fuels production at 1,600 bpd, and Phase II at 28,000 bpd.

Among the possible technologies to mitigate GHG emissions, carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be applied to existing plants and now it is being accepted officially in order to gain emission reduction certificates. This paper presents a feasible solution for CO2 capture and storage network in Italy from sources that are included in the National Allocation Plan and that are forced to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the second phase of the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. The technical aspects of carbon sequestration are derived from industrial applications, while transportation and storage depend on local and geological characteristics. Since Italy has complex geological characteristics, the selection of the most convenient sites should include hydrocarbon reservoirs that are currently used or are depleted. To select these sites, all oil wells that are located in the Italian territory and are managed by UNMIG (National Mining Office for Hydrocarbons and Geothermy) were considered, and a short list was selected among those that have safety and lasting characteristics to ensure a long time permanence. The position of the selected storage sites is drawn on a GIS map containing all the plants included in the National Allocation Plan to be able to identify the optimal networks for carbon dioxide transportation. The case study is located in an area that includes Milan, Pavia and Lodi districts. Knowing the amount of CO2 produced by plants in the selected zone, it is possible to determine the tons of CO2 to capture and the size of transportation and storage systems. Pipelines are, in this case, the most appropriate transport technologies. From emission and sequestration points to storage sites it is necessary to build 122km pipelines for 8 MtCO2 capacity. Using this CCS grid it is possible to avoid CO2 emission with economic feasibility close to the cost of carbon trading values. In fact, the market cost of a European Union Allowance (EUA) at the start of the first period of application of Directive 2003/87/CE was about 30€/tCO2.

The novel aspect of this work is that the relevant species, NO, NO2 and NH3 are estimated and controlled independently. The ability to target NH3 slip is important not only to minimize urea consumption, but also to reduce this unregulated emission. Being able to discriminate between NO and NO2 is important for two reasons. First, recent Fe-zeolite catalyst studies suggest that NOx reduction is highly favored by the NO 2 based reactions. Second, NO2 is more toxic than NO to both the environment and human health. The estimator and control law are based on a 4-state model of the urea-SCR plant. A linearized version of the model is used for state estimation while the full nonlinear model is used for control design. An experimentally validated, higher order simulation is used to evaluate the performance of the closed loop system. For the cases considered, the control strategy uses less urea, produces less NH3 slip, and less tailpipe NOx than a similar strategy where NO and NO2 are assumed as all NO during estimation and control law implementation.

The upgrades discussed in this paper were targeted to reduce SO2 emissions and potentially fuel cost. Prior to installation of the PPTR upgrade, TVA had made improvements to fire protection and detection, dust collection and suppression and pulverizer inerting and isolation systems to enable JOF to lower fuel cost by the use of higher percentage Powder River Basin (PRB) coal blends. However, further improvements were needed as JOF was still TVA's highest emitter of SO2 emissions and was limited from lowering sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions further because the PPTR capability at that time. After completing the upgrades required to burn higher percentage PRB blends, TVA considered other improvements to make further reductions in SO2 emissions; one being high frequency power supplies (HFPS). Performance predictions indicated that a reduction in SO 2 emissions to the range of 1.4 - 1.5 1bs/MBtu was possible. Given that on Units 1-6, most of the precipitator transformer rectifiers (T/R) were 30+ years old and those not replaced to date were polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contaminated, TVA decided to add HFPSs on Units 1-6, up-date the controls on Units 7-10 (which had PPTR upgrades in the late 80's including the addition of 2 fields increasing the total to 6 fields), and add a supervisory system covering all 10 units. Alstom Power Service was presented the opportunity to supply TVA Johnsonville the upgrades as specified. In addition to the project's performance objectives, the PPTR upgrades could not affect generating capacity throughout the entire installation. Comparisons are made for the PPTR power supplies, controllers, and supervisory control systems before and after the upgrade. The boiler operating conditions and coal analyses are examined, including TVA's SO2 reduction goals. Finally, the paper will discuss PPTR performance and the beneficial results of the state-of-the-art upgrades.",,"ALSTOM Power; Before and after; Coal analysis; Dust collection; Fossil plant; Fuel cost; Generating capacity; High frequency power supply; Inerting; Isolation systems; Operating condition; Performance objective; Performance prediction; Powder River Basin coals; Power supply; Supervisory control systems; Supervisory systems; Tennessee Valley Authority; Air pollution; Coal dust; Electric equipment protection; Electrostatic precipitators; Electrostatic separators; Electrostatics; Energy conversion; Fire protection; Landforms; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Waste management; Fossil fuel power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76749111639

Such pathways also impact on urban carbon sinks and play a significant role in determining the vulnerabilities of cities to the impacts of climate change. The connections between cities and climate change are not straightforward; understanding the drivers that explain such pathways is important to finding appropriate solutions. Above all, governing climate change at the city level and implementing measures for climate change are daunting tasks given that cities are primarily focused on local issues. However, climate change is already occurring and there is an urgent need to clarify and communicate how cities in developing and developed countries can contribute to lessening the causes and impacts of climate change from their respective levels. Cities and climate change interlinkages manifest themselves in several forms. For a long time, the focus of such interactions in climate policy debate has been one-sided, i.e. the impact of cities on climate through emissions of energy-related greenhouse gases. Cities are increasingly affected by the physical impact of climatic change such as the heightened frequency of adverse climate effects-flooding, hurricanes, infrastructure damage, etc.-and the socio-economic impacts of such consequences.

The U.S. GCOS support philosophy is based upon a three-tiered approach involving a series of international, regional, and bi-lateral project efforts. One of the most active and important areas of involvement is in the Pacific Ocean region where we leverage support for this via formal climate bilateral agreements that the U.S. has with both Australia and New Zealand. NCDC and the U.S. GCOS Program Manager serve as the NOAA and U.S. lead on these bilateral climate agreements. This paper will describe the efforts undertaken in the Pacific region towards developing a more sustainable and robust GCOS observing ground-based network for atmospheric, oceanographic, and terrestrial climate observing in the region. The paper will describe the actions to date, plans for the future, and how the efforts to date such as the establishment of a virtual Regional Climate Center for the region in order to, among other things, work towards improving data availability and access for and from the nations in the region in order to improve climate services across the region.

Turbulent diffusion flames were established between stoichiometric oxygen and hydrogen flows. The flames were acoustically excited to simulate the onset of combustion instability, resulting in large-scale periodic wrinkling of the flames. Under natural conditions such wrinkling of the flames and the associated fluctuations in local heat release rate would signify the start of flame-acoustic interaction that precedes fully blown combustion instability. Since our previous work showed that the extent of flame-acoustic interaction was sensitive to oxidizer-fuel density difference, methane was added to the fuel flow to increase the fuel density and thereby investigate the feasibility of using a methane-hydrogen blended fuel for suppressing flame instability. The results showed that the extent of flame wrinkling was substantially reduced with a methane-hydrogen blended fuel. The amount of suppression under comparable flame and acoustic forcing conditions correlated well with the methane mole fraction, consistent with our understanding of the role that fuel-oxidizer density gradient plays in flame-acoustic interaction. Detailed examination of local values of Rayleigh index further supported the critical role of density gradient. The present results suggest that the susceptibility to combustion instability can be reduced by using a blended fuel that reduces its density difference with the oxidizer while maintaining a similar ignition characteristic. This opens up the possibility of suppressing GO2/GH2 combustion instability by adding methane to the hydrogen flow.

The electron Bernstein wave (EBW) can propagate in ST plasmas and is emitted at EC harmonics. These properties suggest thermal EBW emission (EBE) may be used for local Te measurements in the ST. Practically, a robust Te (R,t) EBE diagnostic requires EBW transmission efficiencies of >90% for a wide range of plasma conditions. EBW emission and coupling physics were studied on NSTX with an obliquely viewing EBW to O -mode (B-X-O) diagnostic with two remotely steered antennas, coupled to absolutely calibrated radiometers. While Te (R,t) measurements with EBW emission on NSTX were possible, they were challenged by several issues. Rapid fluctuations in edge ne scale length resulted in >20% changes in the low harmonic B-X-O transmission efficiency. Also, B-X-O transmission efficiency during H modes was observed to decay by a factor of 5-10 to less than a few percent. The B-X-O transmission behavior during H modes was reproduced by EBE simulations that predict that EBW collisional damping can significantly reduce emission when Te <30 eV inside the B-X-O mode conversion (MC) layer. Initial edge lithium conditioning experiments during H modes have shown that evaporated lithium can increase Te inside the B-X-O MC layer, significantly increasing B-X-O transmission. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",,"Amber; Aspect ratio; Blood vessel prostheses; Cyclotrons; Dust collectors; Electric conductivity measurement; Electron beam welding; Experiments; Fusion reactors; Harmonic analysis; Joints (anatomy); Lithium; Plasma diagnostics; Plasmas; Settling tanks; Spheres; Tellurium compounds; Coupling physics; Cutting offs; Electron Bernstein waves; Electron cyclotron emissions; Mode conversions; National Spherical Torus experiments; Plasma conditions; Scale lengths; Spherical tokamaks; Transmission behaviors; Transmission efficiencies; Electron cyclotron resonance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55349084805

We have found that the evolution of the intensity during the e-beam irradiation depends on the surface polarity. For O-face, the ultraviolet (UV) emission decreases exponentially and approaches an asymptotic value. For Zn-face, it first increases and then decreases. The decrease components are similar in both faces. If we halt the e-beam irradiation, the UV intensity recovers partially. These results suggest that the decrease in the UV evolution is related to metastable bulk defect reactions at the subsurface region while the increase is related to surface reaction such as electron-stimulated desorption. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",,"Crystallography; Desorption; Electromagnetic waves; Electron beam lithography; Electron beams; Electron guns; Electron irradiation; Irradiation; Light emission; Light sources; Luminescence; Particle beams; Powders; Semiconducting zinc compounds; Surface chemistry; Surface reactions; Zinc; Zinc alloys; Zinc oxide; E-beam irradiation; Surface polarities; ZnO single crystals; Single crystals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50849104775

A widespread and integral environmental indicator is the soil microbial respiration and can be estimated either on the basis of carbon dioxide evolution or of oxygen uptake. In accordance with many previous studies, we found that soil respiration decreased in the presence of heavy metals such as Cu. The Cu spiking of an acid and unpolluted, organic-rich pine forest soil at approximately the limits for sewage sludge (100 to 200 μg Cu g-1 soil) led to high concentrations of up to 0.35 μg Cu per ml in the soil solution and reduced carbon dioxide evolution by 27% and the oxygen uptake by 18% during basal respiration. Thus, the respiratory quotient (RQ) which is defined as the carbon dioxide evolution related to oxygen uptake was reduced with increasing Cu levels. The Cu effect was also detected after the addition of glucose as a readily available substrate. In the soil investigated, the carbon isotope characteristic of the 13C- CO2 evolved did not give any indication of specific carbon use and fractionation processes during basal metabolism as indicated by enrichment or depletion of 13C values. However, carbon isotope characteristic of the 13C-CO2 evolved showed that glucose addition stimulated mineralization of the soil organic matter (SOM) which derived from either increased biomass turnover or simulated dead SOM degradation and is defined as priming effect. The results showed that (1) the evaluation of heavy metal effect on soil respiratory indicators and the transformation of active SOM are method-dependent and (2) under aerobic conditions, soil microbial communities consumed relatively more oxygen in the presence of Cu than in its absence in this acid, unpolluted and organic rich soil under pine forest.","Carbon dioxide evolution; Copper; Heavy metals; Humus degradation; Microbial indicator; Oxygen uptake; Priming effect; Respiratory quotient; Soil respiration","anthropogenic effect; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; climate change; copper; environmental indicator; forest soil; glucose; metabolism; microbial community; oxygen; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; soil respiration; substrate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54049083425

The application of disaggregate modeling to estimate the impacts of transportation policies - for instance, the reduction of vehicle kilometers of travel and air pollution levels - is the principal motivation for this study. First, a nested logit (NL) model was developed to investigate household travel behavior linked to vehicle ownership, mode choice, and trip-sharing attributes. The nest structure consists of two levels; the upper level characterizes car-owning, motorcycle-owning, and no-vehicle-owning choices, whereas the lower level represents household-related mode choices. Second, the estimated NL model is applied to the analysis of policies related to center-based telecommuting, transit, and road pricing. Several hypothetical satellite offices outside the central business district are considered to analyze the travel behavior associated with telecommuting. The new locations for the satellite offices were chosen on the basis of travel convenience and compatibility with the current road network. With center-based telecommuting as the base policy, several policies were investigated by combining the base policy with transit and road pricing.

With climate change and higher transport energy prices becoming pressing policy issues increasing attention is being directed to the capacity of metropolitan planning to overcome these challenges. For the past two decades Australian metropolitan plans have focused on urban consolidation as means of reducing transport energy demand. Transport energy dependence is highest in middle and fringe suburban areas. But the structure of urban housing markets means the capacity of current Australian urban planning policies to achieve consolidation objectives in middle and outer areas is highly restricted, especially if the delivery of density gains is delegated to the private sector. The paper contends that current planning policies which rely on urban consolidation therefore have limited potential to produce significant transport emissions reductions. Such policies also risk generating socially inequitable distributional outcomes given higher transport fuel costs from an emissions trading scheme or higher global oil prices. The paper calls for a rethink of current metropolitan transport, urban planning and housing supply models to achieve reductions in transport energy dependence in the middle and outer suburban areas of Australian cities.",,"Emissions reduction; Emissions Trading Scheme; Housing markets; Housing supply; Oil Prices; Planning policies; Policy issues; Private sectors; Suburban areas; Transport energy; Transport fuel; Urban consolidation; Urban housing market; Climate change; Commerce; Energy management; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Urban planning; Urban transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859010896

The overall goal of the PACS-Sounding Network (PACS-SONET) was to obtain relatively inexpensive wind profiles for describing climate variability over parts of the intertropical Americas that were not well covered by routine radiosonde observations. Major portions of the project supported climate research programs focusing on both the South and North American monsoon systems, while other parts of the network provided multiyear observations across important gaps in the Central American cordillera and also helped to describe cross-equatorial flow variations in the eastern Pacific. Approximately 50,000 observations were made by the PACS-SONET over its 10-yr operation.

Ammonia (NH 3) is a highly reactive and soluble alkaline gas, which occurs naturally in the atmosphere. It originates from both natural and anthropogenic sources, with the main source being livestock agriculture. Although the processes responsible are considered "" natural, "" the emissions generated from manures can be considered anthropogenic in nature, due to the influence of human management, both regarding the nitrogen input to livestock feed and the spatial concentration in so-called "" emission hot-spots "" due to high-density intensive farming practices. This chapter covers the characteristics, spatial distribution, and temporal trends of emission sources, dispersion, deposition and effects on the environment, at multiple scales from local to global. Modeling and measurement methodologies are discussed, including combinations of these approaches for validation. Finally, it addresses issues of emission abatement and policy strategies, taking account of links with other forms of nitrogen and pollution swapping. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In this frame, Snecma is currently developing in parallel three engine architectures answering ACARE 2020 objectives and recent global warning concerns in different ways. The first architecture is a ""balanced"" concept between fuel burn, environment and maintenance cost, that relies on the CFM56 experience and on the introduction of very innovative technologies. At 2015-2017 Entry Into Service (EIS), the LEAP56 baseline already reaches a most of ACARE 2020 requirements. Then, two more radically innovative engine architectures have been identified to go a step further towards two different environmental priorities: - first one, the Counter-rotating TurboFan (CRTF) is a promising answer, offering a foreseen 20dB cumulative noise reduction, while improving fuel burn in the same amount as advanced conventional turbofans. This concept goes beyond ACARE 2020 goals on noise at a given By-Pass Ratio (BPR), which might become essential especially if optimal BPR slides to non-installable under the wing diameters or noise requirements increase under public pressure. - second one, the Open rotor architecture is an even more complex concept that delivers a breakthrough on Fuel Burn and CO2 emissions thanks to an important propulsive efficiency without any duct drag penalties. Finally, particularly through current European Union (EU) Project VITAL and EU Project DREAM and JTI Clean Sky, Snecma has already started and will continue the detailed assessment of two main general architectures selected to go toward or beyond ACARE 2020 goals. In parallel, Snecma and General Electric (GE) through the LEAPS6 program will carry on to build up technological bricks applicable on any of these three architectures in order to be ready to answer any future environmental requirements.","Architectures; Counter-rotative; Engine; Environment; Open rotors","Aeronautical research; Counter-rotative; Environment; Environmental requirement; General architectures; Innovative technology; Open rotors; Propulsive efficiencies; Aerodynamics; Aviation; Carbon dioxide; Engines; Noise abatement; Architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878896943

Common to all dispersion models is the requirement for accurate meteorological parameters. The paper outlines the benefits and risks of three separate approaches to obtain meteorological input for atmospheric dispersion models. The preferred approach is based on directly-measured observations and the primary source of readily available observed data at airports is METAR. A typical METAR report contains observations of temperature, dew point, wind, precipitation, cloud cover, cloud heights, visibility, and barometric pressure. However, most dispersion models require information on atmospheric stability. Although stability is not directly reported in METAR data, a widely-available algorithm allows for the estimation of atmospheric stability class using measured values of wind speed and the observed cloud cover. The next preferred option should be used when METAR or other observed data are not readily available or more sophisticated 3D gridded meteorological fields are required by the specific dispersion model. This second approach uses meso-scale numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. These models can produce high quality 'best guess' meteorological fields on a wide variety of time and distance scales. NWP models, however, require high-level meteorological expertise in order to run and are computationally intense. This may make the NWP approach impractical for use in routine applications or for large-scale studies which involve many different airports. Finally, this paper outlines a third approach to obtaining meteorological data. This approach uses long-term, globally-archived, gridded meteorological analysis fields, such as REANALYSIS data, which are readily available and cover long-term time scales. Although less accurate than METAR and NWP models, this approach may be of benefit to those users who require 'good guess' meteorological data for air pollution studies in those cases where direct observations, such as METAR, are not available and NWP modelling is not a viable solution.","Data completion; Dispersion; Local air quality; METAR; MM5; Numerical weather prediction; REANALYSIS; Stability; WRF","air quality; airport; atmospheric pollution; conference proceeding; modeling; numerical model",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56349152789

Well integrity is important because wells and the annuli and pathways that may exist within them can act as leakage pathways for CO2 back to the surface or as conduits for leakage between formations. Studies related to the integrity of wells have been conducted on well cements created in both the laboratory and in the field.

The original measured pollutant data were statistically analyzed in time series including monthly and seasonal patterns using the auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method, linear trend, simple moving average of three terms and simple exponential smoothing. The performance evaluations of the adopted statistical models were carried out and discussed according to the root mean square error (RMSE) estimations and several tests. Due to their generalization capacity, ANN has been proposed in this work as model for time series forecasting, because ANN provided better air quality forecasts than the Box-Jenkins ARIMA method.

This also leads to a developmental concentration on fuel savings and the reduction of emissions. The development of hybrid drives permits an increase in the efficiency of the transport systems and a reduction in the emission of exhaust gas. The brake energy generated in the braking process is temporarily stored and re-supplied to the driveline. Owing to their highly dynamic mode of operation vehicles in municipal service, in particular buses arc especially suitable for hybridisation and the recuperation of brake energy. Today the hybrid drives built and tested by MAN for city buses are based on decades of experience. Development from hybrid drives with a flywheel store and the storage of the brake energy in hydraulic accumulators has led to Diesel-electric drives in which brake energy is stored in electric reservoirs. Batteries, ultra-capacitors or a combination of both may be installed. By this, the driveline can be optimised for its specific service. By building and testing the hybrid buses to date MAN has been able to demonstrate their suitability for day to day service. With the development level it has already achieved MAN is getting closer to economically viable service. Diesel-electric hybrid drives can be considered to be a transitional technology on the way to electric vehicles of the future. One key parameter therefore is the energy density of electric storage systems, which has to be further increased. The use of hybrid vehicles can be seen in the contradictory context between economy and ecology. Ultimately, widespread introduction of hybrid technology in bus drives will depend on the general political and economic conditions. The report shows a comparison of different drive systems recorded on the same bus line.","Environment; Hybrid drive; Mobility; Recuperation","Bus lines; City bus; Drive systems; Drivelines; Dynamic modes; Economic condition; Energy density; Environment; Fuel savings; Growing demand; Hybrid bus; Hybrid drive; Hybrid technology; Hybridisation; Key parameters; Municipal services; Petroleum consumption; Petroleum resources; Recuperation; Storage systems; Transport systems; Brakes; Buses; Carrier mobility; Drives; Economics; Electric vehicles; Exhaust systems (engine); Fuel economy; Hybrid vehicles; Hydraulic accumulators; Petroleum deposits; Public utilities; Electric drives",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866068026

We review how climate change could affect future concentrations of tropospheric ozone and particulate matter (PM), and what changing concentrations could mean for population health. Data Sources: We review studies projecting the impacts of climate change on air quality and studies projecting the impacts of these changes on morbidity and mortality. Data Synthesis: Climate change could affect local to regional air quality through changes in chemical reaction rates, boundary layer heights that affect vertical mixing of pollutants, and changes in synoptic airflow patterns that govern pollutant transport. Sources of uncertainty include the degree of future climate change, future emissions of air pollutants and their precursors, and how population vulnerability may change in the future. Given these uncertainties, projections suggest that climate change will increase concentrations of tropospheric ozone, at least in high-income countries when precursor emissions are held constant, which would increase morbidity and mortality. Few projections are available for low- and middle-income countries. The evidence is less robust for PM, primarily because few studies have been conducted. Conclusions: Additional research is needed to better understand the possible impacts of climate change on air pollution-related health impacts. If improved models continue to project higher ozone concentrations with climate change, then reducing greenhouse gas emissions would enhance the health of current and future generations.","Air pollution; Climate change; Health impacts; Ozone; Particulate matter","ozone; ozone; air pollutant; air quality control; airflow; chemical reaction; climate change; concentration (parameters); developing country; environmental health; greenhouse gas; lowest income group; morbidity; mortality; particulate matter; pollution transport; priority journal; review; troposphere; article; climate; environmental exposure; human; particle size; Climate; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Ozone; Particle Size",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56349150418

This idealized assumption is just one of many ways in which emissions mitigation actions could play out globally, but not necessarily the most likely. This paper explores the implications of generic policy regimes that lead to stabilization of CO2 concentrations under conditions in which non-Annex I regions delay emissions reductions and in which carbon prices vary across participating regions. The resulting stabilization scenarios are contrasted with the idealized results. Delays in the date by which non-Annex I regions begin to reduce emissions raise the price of carbon in Annex I regions relative to the price of carbon in Annex I in an idealized regime for any given CO2 concentration limit. This effect increases the longer the delay in non-Annex I accession, the lower the non-Annex I carbon prices relative to the Annex I prices, and the more stringent the stabilization level. The effect of delay is very pronounced when CO2 concentrations are stabilized at 450 ppmv, however the effect is much less pronounced at 550 ppmv and above. For long delays in non-Annex I accession, 450 ppmv stabilization levels become infeasible. © 2008 Earthscan.","Carbon pricing; CO2; Cost-effectiveness; Emissions reduction; Regir comparison; Stabilization scenarios","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cost; emission control; environmental policy; international cooperation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51449091568

This article explores the implications for the USA of climate stabilization at 3.4 W/m2. Stabilization at this level, even under idealized conditions of nearly immediate global cooperation, will require a transformation of the USA's energy system, beginning almost immediately and extending throughout the century and beyond. This transformation will need to be even more rapid and extensive if the emissions reduction regime encompasses only a portion of the global economy. The availability of advanced technologies such as CCS, sustainable bioenergy production, wind and solar, nuclear energy and end-use efficiency improvements will facilitate this transition. Indeed, the degree to which technology advances over the coming century is among the most important determinants of the economic costs of stabilization for the USA and the rest of the world. The scope of the energy system transformation highlights the need to begin deploying technologies that are currently available and to continue to invest in R&amp;D to develop newer, more efficient, and less expensive low- or zero-carbon energy supply technologies and end-use technologies. © 2008 Earthscan.","Climate change; Climate stabilization; Energy; Energy systems; Low-carbon; Technology","carbon emission; climate change; emission control; energy policy; environmental policy; global change; policy strategy; radiative forcing; research and development; stabilization; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47249116515

These were: (1) simulation modelling, (2) a non-destructive analysis of growth and (3) plant carbon status. A cost and benefit analysis using simulation modeling was carried out using grower-collected greenhouse environment and yield data. Simulation modelling was useful in a retrospective analysis for determining the costs and benefits of several CO2 dosing scenarios. However, the analysis was hampered as a C02 management tool because key data relating CO 2 production to the CO2 concentration in the greenhouse was unavailable and also because the yield model was inaccurate. Nondestructive measures of growth are collected by growers and might be useful as plant-based indicators of CO2 response. However, the measures investigated were deemed to be too sluggish to be used for CO2 dosing decision-making. Finally, plants under CO2 enrichment can accumulate substantial amounts of starch in their leaves and excess starch may indicate CO2 over-dosing. Plant carbon status was investigated by determining the distribution of leaf starch in the canopy and diurnally. These profiles led to the identification of canopy strata that are under the influence of both source and sink. The carbon status of this region maybe useful for CO2 dosing decisions and is worthy of further study.","Carbon-status; Greenhouse; Growth; Leaf mass per area; Model; Starch; Tomato","Lycopersicon esculentum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049195580

This paper will describe the development of the Walking Strategy, an action plan for building the policy, infrastructure and program elements needed to create a culture of walking in the City of Toronto. It will also discuss the importance of building on a solid policy framework and inclusive consultation process in the development of the Strategy. The Toronto Walking Strategy builds on a strong foundation. The City's Official Plan provides an excellent policy framework for achieving a more intense, mixed-use development patter to support increased travel by foot, bicycle and public transit. The City has many existing pedestrian-related policies, guidelines, programs and services. The City's recently adopted Climate Change, Clean Air and Sustainable Energy Action Plan sets out emission reduction targets and calls for a new way of thinking about transportation and community planning and design. The Walking Strategy Team reviewed existing policies and programs, identified areas for improvement and gaps where new initiatives were needed, in order to integrate all walking-related initiatives into a single strategy. An extensive consultation process ensured that the Strategy was built on the knowledge and coordination of several City divisions, public advisory committees, external stakeholders, international experts and Toronto residents. This input was collected in a variety of forms including: A community walkability roadshow, public and staff workshops and working groups. An important element of the consultation process was the International Walk21 Conference - Putting Pedestrians First, hosted by Toronto in October 2007. Walk21 provided a unique opportunity for Toronto to learn about global best practise and to have international experts review and comment on Toronto's Walking Strategy framework report. The Toronto Walking Strategy, to be presented to Toronto Council in September 2008, establishes clear implementation targets for each of the Strategy's actions. The City's new ""Public Realm Office"", within the Transportation Services Division, will be responsible for implementing the Walking Strategy, coordinating work across all City Divisions, and monitoring and reporting on progress in achieving the Strategy's actions. This paper will also explain how implementation of the Walking Strategy has been integrated into the regular business of all relevant City Divisions.",,"Climate change; Regional planning; Advisory committee; Community planning; Consultation process; Emission reduction targets; External stakeholders; International experts; Sustainable energy; Transportation services; Emission control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896640121

Two MBT residuals with 5 and 12 months total (aerobic) biological stabilisation times were used in the study. MBT residual appeared to be a favourable medium for CH4 oxidation as indicated by its area-based CH4 oxidation rates (12.2-82.3 g CH4 m-2 d-1 at 2-25 °C; determined in CH4-sparged columns). The CH4 oxidation potential (determined in batch assays) of the MBT residuals increased during the 124 d column experiment, from &lt;1.6 to a maximum of 104 μg CH4gdw- 1 h-1 (dw = dry weight) at 5 °C and 578 μg CH4gdw- 1 h-1 at 23 °C. Nitrous oxide (N2O) production in MBT residual (&lt;15 μg N2Okgdw- 1 d-1 in the CH4 oxidative columns) was at the lower end of the range of N2O emissions reported for landfills and non-landfill soils, and insignificant as a greenhouse gas source. Also, anaerobic gas production (25.6 lkgdw- 1 during 217 d) in batch assays was low, indicating biological stability of the MBT residual. The electrical conductivities (140-250 mS m-1), as well as the concentrations of zinc (3.0 mg l-1), copper (0.5 mg l-1), arsenic (0.3 mg l-1), nickel (0.1 mg l-1) and lead (0.1 mg l-1) in MBT residual eluates from a leaching test (EN-12457-4) with a liquid/solid (L/S) ratio of 10:1, suggest a potential for leachate pollutant emissions which should be considered in plans to utilise MBT residual. In conclusion, the laboratory experiments suggest that MBT residual can be utilised as a support medium for CH4 oxidation, even at low temperatures, to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from landfills. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The new agreement needs to include a wider participation of parties, and therefore needs to address the effort sharing of countries. The mitigation capabilities and the responsibilities of countries do however vary significantly. This can, in principle, be overcome with a cap-and-trade system, with which the question of equity is addressed trough the allocation of emission allowances. A number of effort sharing schemes have been proposed. Effort sharing however suffers from a fundamental trade-off between detail and transparency on how the emission allocations are calculated. This study addresses this problem by comparing and combining the results from a transparent but simplified effort sharing model EVOC, and a detailed and - due to its complexity - seemingly non-transparent ETSAP-TIAM energy system model. The aim of the study is to evaluate the goodness of the initial effort sharing, particularly in terms of mitigation costs experienced by different regions in the scenarios. Based on the long-term energy-climate scenarios crafted with the TIAM model, we assess the resulting consequences in emission profiles and the energy system, concentrating especially on regional mitigation costs and emission trading. Two cases of market failures in emission trading are also considered. Finally we compare the mitigation potentials between the two models and estimate the effect of EVOC recalibration on the national emission allowances. The results of the study underline particularly the importance of detailed and reliable assumptions for the mitigation potentials of different countries in the effort sharing process.

Compare today's development concerns with the 1970's. In 1970 the primary uncertainties were future electric demand, the cost of capital, and the return on investment granted by a public utility commission. In 2008, uncertainties include a global fuel market; resource depletion; future environmental policies, including traditional pollutants, GHG's, and issues that might appear over the long life of the project; rapidly escalating capital and labor costs; unproven technology options; and geopolitical upheavals arising beyond energy and environment. Lawmakers and regulators are increasingly asked to ensure clean, reliable and fairly-priced energy supply and energy security. How does one balance between the need to add new capacity while enhancing the sustainability of the energy system? The signatories to the Kyoto Protocol have entered the first budget period. The European Union Emission Trading System has been in operation since 2005. Experience from this trading system offers valuable lessons for emerging carbon markets. Discussions are underway to develop GHG reduction programs that might include the United States and the developing nations while the EU is moving ahead with plans for reductions of 20 to 30% below 2005 levels. In the United States, regulation of GHG's is no longer considered a question of ""if."", but ""when."" Laws aimed at carbon reduction will be ""works in progress"" with amendments likely to follow. The RGGI initiative starts its first budget period on January 1, 2009. Globally, financial institutions are developing risk standards or investment policies to incorporate risks arising from potential new GHG regulations or to the impact of climatic changes. Insurers are establishing means to share risks and are seeking ways to hedge against these perceived risks. We will contrast real world events with idealized mitigation strategies, technological options essential to these strategies and their projected costs. The IPCC's 4 th Assessment reports examined mitigation strategies under various scenarios. Assumptions underlay these analyses, assumptions that are often overlooked in discussions of policy, time lines for reductions, and metrics for success. These and related assessments raise important questions about the efficacy of current efforts and the pace of change. Can sound application of assessment tools improve the ability of project developers to communicate with the spectrum of regulators and interested parties that routinely become involved in decision making? Examination of key assessment studies argues that: Fossil fuels will be needed to meet societal needs for many years. Significant cuts in GHG emissions are essential for pragmatic reasons and must start soon. New technologies paired with enhanced performance of existing infrastructure can address both energy security and environmental concerns. Careful assessments of risks and of interactions amongst technologies are critical to ensure progress against both goals. A strong array of tools are available to support assessments. But these all carry uncertainties and can be compromised by biased assumptions. We will survey case studies that offer key insights, prevalent assumptions that underlie many major assessments, and statistical gaps while summarizing policy and technology risks.",,"Assessment tool; Carbon markets; Carbon reduction; Climatic changes; Cost of capital; Electric demand; Emission trading systems; Energy and environment; Energy project; Energy security; Energy systems; Enhanced performance; Environmental concerns; Environmental policy; European Union; Financial institution; Fuel markets; GHG emission; Investment policies; KYOTO protocol; Labor costs; Long life; Mitigation strategy; New technologies; Perceived risk; Priced energy; Project developers; Resource depletion; Return on investments; Technology options; Technology risks; Time line; Trading systems; Budget control; Commerce; Cost accounting; Emission control; Employment; Environmental protection; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Human computer interaction; Laws and legislation; Profitability; Public utilities; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Standardization; Technology; Uncertainty analysis; Wages; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869608014

The kinetics of the ORR at the Pt/C electrode was examined in 0.50 mol dm-3 HClO4 solution in the temperature range from 274 to 318 K. At all temperatures, two distinct E-log j regions were observed; at low current densities with a slope of -2.3RT/F and at high current densities with a slope of -2.3x2RT/F. In order to confirm the mechanism of oxygen reduction previously suggested at a polycrystalline Pt and a Pt/Ebonex nanostructured electrode, the apparent enthalpies of activation at selected potentials vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode were calculated in both current density regions. Although ΔHa,1≠ ΔHa,h ≠, it was found that the enthalpies of activation at the zero Galvani potential difference were the same and hence it could be concluded that the rate-determining step of the ORR was the same in both current density regions.

This along with the tremendous increase in carbon dioxide emissions all over the world in the last decade has simulated the EDRG (Environmental Design Research Group, at the Architectural Engineering and Environmental Design Department) at the AAST (Arab Academy for Science and Technology) to setting the Environmental awareness campaign in the Schools of Alexandria, Egypt. The campaign is run mainly by Architecture professors, and both graduates and postgraduates of the architecture department and this is where the novelty of this campaign mainly lies and will be discussed in this paper. Environmental issues are not properly integrated in curricula of secondary schools in Egypt, and attract quite a little attention there. Continuous research carried out by the EDRG founded by the authors of this paper highlighted the problem of local environmental awareness in Egypt and that it was one of the main obstacles behind lessening pollution rates in this region and saving the environment. Therefore, this campaign has set this awareness program as today's kids are the aim of proper development in Egypt. This project has two main objectives to fulfil; one is to engage the architectural students in raising sustainable and environmental awareness in our non-sustainable societies and second is to raise environmental awareness of school children and the youth by using artistic means, and to encourage them to participate in solution of environmental problems in their communities. Theatre, movie, painting and social role-plays are perceived as an interactive method to speak up global environmental problems in understandable and creative way. The campaign promotes and aware students within all education levels about the main reasons behind global warming, climate change and pollution and the proper use of renewable energy technologies, ecological and sustainable approaches to decrease carbon dioxide emissions all over the world and save our planet earth. The paper considers the role of environmental awareness at an early stage in the proper application of alternative energy sources in our built environment. The environmental awareness campaign is discussed along with its main aims and outcomes in this paper. The paper also contemplates the role of Architects and Architecture students in social interaction and in awareness of their communities.","Environmental awareness; Green day; Public awareness; Sustainable societies","Carbon dioxide; Curricula; Earth (planet); Global warming; Pollution; Students; Sustainable development; Alexandria; Alternative energy source; Architectural engineering; Awareness program; Built environment; Carbon dioxide emissions; Environmental awareness; Environmental design; Environmental issues; Environmental problems; Global environmental problems; Green day; Interactive methods; Planet earth; Pollution sources; Public awareness; Renewable energy technologies; Role-plays; Science and Technology; Secondary schools; Social interactions; Sustainable society; Architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067723123

The key enzymes of photosynthetic carbon assimilation in C4 plants have evolved independently several times from C3 isoforms that were present in the C3 ancestral species. The C4 isoform of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), the primary CO2-fixing enzyme of the C4 cycle, is specifically expressed at high levels in mesophyll cells of the leaves of C4 species. We are interested in understanding the molecular changes that are responsible for the evolution of this C4-characteristic PEPC expression pattern, and we are using the genus Flaveria (Asteraceae) as a model system. It is known that cis-regulatory sequences for mesophyll-specific expression of the ppcA1 gene of F. trinervia (C4) are located within a distal promoter region (DR). Results. In this study we focus on the proximal region (PR) of the ppcA1 promoter of F. trinervia and present an analysis of its function in establishing a C4-specific expression pattern. We demonstrate that the PR harbours cis-regulatory determinants which account for high levels of PEPC expression in the leaf. Our results further suggest that an intron in the 5' untranslated leader region of the PR is not essential for the control of ppcA1 gene expression. Conclusion. The allocation of cis-regulatory elements for enhanced expression levels to the proximal region of the ppcA1 promoter provides further insight into the regulation of PEPC expression in C4 leaves.",,"Asteraceae; Flaveria; Flaveria trinervia; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; 5' untranslated region; article; enzymology; Flaveria; gene deletion; gene expression regulation; genetics; intron; metabolism; molecular evolution; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; plant leaf; promoter region; sequence homology; transgenic plant; 5' Untranslated Regions; Base Sequence; Evolution, Molecular; Flaveria; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Introns; Molecular Sequence Data; Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase; Plant Leaves; Plants, Genetically Modified; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Sequence Deletion; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39049097652

By all accounts, the contribution of urban motorized transport to climate change will continue growing unless per capita GHG emissions can be decreased more quickly than the rate of population growth. Municipalities across the country have outlined various strategies for reducing GHG emissions from transportation, but to date, few have linked the relative impacts of these strategies with stated targets. Fewer still have looked at the combined impacts of behavioral and technological changes for reducing GHG emissions, in comparison to what can realistically be expected from each approach. Using the Greater Toronto and Hamilton metropolitan region as an example, this paper quantifies the GHG impacts of several different levels of transit service ranging from ""business as usual"" to a very high level of transit investment with supporting TDM measures and technological advancements. Urban transportation emissions in the region are assessed using transportation demand models and Transport Canada's Urban Transportation Emissions Calculator. Results show that the highest level of transit service increases will reduce GHG per capita emissions by approximately 30%, which only just off-sets the impacts of population growth. These results indicate that municipalities across Canada cannot rely on transit improvements alone to address sustainability objectives and aggressive GHG reduction targets; but must also consider a broad range of strategies in the areas of technology, active transportation and TDM.","Greenhouse gas emissions; Mode split targets; Sustainable transportation; Transportation planning","Climate change; Emission control; Fuels; Gas emissions; Motor transportation; Population statistics; Urban growth; Urban transportation; Emission reduction strategy; Incremental improvements; Mode split; Sustainability objectives; Sustainable transportation; Technological advancement; Transportation planning; Vehicle fuel efficiencies; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896671847

Principal species at the site were Oryza perennis (a C3 grass), Echinochloa polystachya, and Paspalum repens (both C4 grasses). Monthly mean daily NPP of the mixed species community varied from 50 to 96 g dry mass m-2 day-1, with a seasonal average (±1SD) of 64 ± 12 g dry mass m-2 day-1. Mean daily NPP (±1SE) for P. repens and E. polystachya was 77 ± 3 and 34 ± 2 g dry mass m-2 day-1, respectively.

In order to minimise losses of volatile organic compounds to the environment, these tanks are often fitted with pressure / vacuum valves (PV valves). These enable the tank to operate at pressures typically between +56mbar and -6mbar before the valve opens. The atmosphere within the tank is often in the flammable region and hence during outbreafhing, the vapours vented from the PV valve are also flammable. These may be ignited by an external ignition source such as static discharge or hot work occurring near the vent. The common assumption has always been that the tank would be protected from internal explosion by the presence of the PV valve on the basis that the flame could not pass back through the valve. 1 This paper presents the opinion that ignition can, in fact, flash back through a PV valve based on consideration of flame speed, minimum experimental safe gap (MESG) and flow rates.

Representative codes in the empirical, analytical and computational categories were exercised and assessed against a set of benchmark acoustic data obtained from wind tunnel tests of three model scale fans. The chosen codes were ANOPP representing an empirical capability, RSI representing an analytical capability, and LINFLUX representing a computational aeroacoustics capability. The selected benchmark fans cover a wide range of fan pressure ratios and fan tip speeds, and are representative of modern turbofan engine designs. The assessment results indicate that the ANOPP code can predict fan noise spectrum to within 4 dB of the measurement uncertainty band on a third-octave basis for the low and moderate tip speed fans except at extreme aft emission angles. The RSI code can predict fan broadband noise spectrum to within 1.5 dB of experimental uncertainty band provided the rotor-only contribution is taken into account. The LINFLUX code can predict interaction tone power levels to within experimental uncertainties at low and moderate fan tip speeds, but could deviate by as much as 6.5 dB outside the experimental uncertainty band at the highest tip speeds in some case.",,"Acoustic data; Broadband noise; Emission angle; Experimental uncertainty; Fan noise; Fan pressure ratio; Measurement uncertainty; Power levels; State of the art; Three models; Tip speed; Wind tunnel tests; Acoustic noise; Fans; Forecasting; NASA; Uncertainty analysis; Computational aeroacoustics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78249237240

Because of its enormous implications for a wide range of transportation and manufacturing systems, it has attracted increasing interest in recent years from both the research and industrial communities (see a recent book on this subject in Ref. 1). From a practical point of view, development and uses of new materials, coatings, and/or lubricants that can enable superlubricity in moving mechanical systems will have huge positive impact on saving energy and reducing emissions. The annual cost of friction- and wear-related losses in some of the highly industrialized nations is currently estimated to be more than 5% of their gross national products. Hence, achieving superlubricity in moving mechanical systems will also have a huge positive impact on the economical well-being of all nations. In this presentation, an overview of recent progress in superlubricty research in general and novel superlow friction coatings and solid/liquid lubricated systems in particular is provided and the prospects for achieving superlubricity in real life applications are highlighted.

In order to make efficient use of these systems, it's important to have a complete system approach when it comes to calibration of the engine and aftertreatment system. This paper presents a simplified model of a heavy duty SCR catalyst, primarily intended for use in combination with an engine-out emissions model to perform model based offline optimization of the complete system. The traditional way of modelling catalysts using a dense discretization of the catalyst channels and non-linear differential equation solvers to solve the heat and mass balance equations, requires too much computational power in this application. The presented model is also useful in other applications such as model based control. The basic model structure is a series of continuously stirred tank reactors using discretized catalyst walls to describe the mass transport in the solid phase. The simplified model uses a state-space concept. At low temperatures the model uses an implicit method of calculating the coverage differential. At higher temperatures, the model is simplified to a first order system using an operating condition dependent characteristic time constant. These simple, yet robust methods allows for long step lengths in the process of solving the differential equations. This makes the model a useful improvement over current models.

PstS is a phosphate-binding lipoprotein that is part of the high-affinity phosphate transport system. Streptomyces lividans accumulates high amounts of the PstS protein in the supernatant of liquid cultures grown in the presence of different carbon sources, such as fructose or mannose, but not in the presence of glucose or in basal complex medium. Results. Functionality experiments revealed that this extracellular PstS protein does not have the capacity to capture phosphate and transfer it to the cell. Regulation of the pstS promoter was studied with Northern blot experiments, and protein levels were detected by Western blot analysis. We observed that the pstS gene was expressed in cultures containing glucose or fructose, but not in complex basal medium. Northern blot analyses revealed that the pst operon (pstSCAB) was transcribed as a whole, although higher transcript levels of pstS relative to those of the other genes of the operon (pstC, pstA and pstB) were observed. Deletion of the -329/-144 fragment of the pstS promoter, including eight degenerated repeats of a sequence of 12 nucleotides, resulted in a two-fold increase in the expression of this promoter, suggesting a regulatory role for this region. Additionally, deletion of the fragment corresponding to the Pho boxes recognized by the PhoP regulator (from nucleotide -141 to -113) resulted in constitutive pstS expression that was independent of this regulator. Thus, the PhoP-independent expression of the pstS gene makes this system different from all those studied previously. Conclusion. 1.- In S. lividans, only the PstS protein bound to the cell has the capacity to bind phosphate and transfer it there, whereas the PstS form accumulated in the supernatant lacks this capacity. 2.- The stretch of eight degenerated repeats present in the pstS promoter may act as a binding site for a repressor. 3.- There is a basal expression of the pstS gene that is not controlled by the main regulator: PhoP. © 2008 Esteban et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"bacterial protein; carbon; PhoP protein, Bacteria; phosphate; phosphate binding protein; unclassified drug; article; culture medium; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; promoter region; regulator gene; regulon; Streptomyces lividans; Bacterial Proteins; Carbon; Culture Media; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Genes, Regulator; Phosphate-Binding Proteins; Phosphates; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Regulon; Streptomyces lividans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149094952

It uses CAS theory to understand ways in which the resilience of two alternative futures, labeled ""Carbon Valley"" and ""Post-Carbon Society"" (Heinberg 2004), might evolve. The paper discusses ways in which changes implemented through the efforts of local communities at local, smaller scales of the nested systems seek to influence the evolution of adaptive cycles of the system at the local, national, and global scales, lt. identifies the influences of ""attractors,"" defined as factors driving the evolution of the system, that are influential across the panarchy. These include climate change threats, markets, regulatory regimes, political alliances, and local concerns about the environmental and social impacts of the Hunter's coal dependency. These factors are weakening the apparent resilience of the coal industry, which is being propped up by the coal industry corporations, labor unions, and governments to maintain coal dependency in the Carbon Valley. Moreover, they are creating an alternative basin of attraction in which a Post-Carbon Society might emerge from the system's evolutionary processes.

Methods. All women with a histological diagnosis of HG-CIN and planned for laser CO2 conization from January 2003 to December 2004 were prospectively submitted to a HR-HPV test prior to surgery and at three and six months of follow-up. Women providing written informed consent with 24 months of follow-up were enrolled in the study group. A positive HPV test, involvement of resection margins, age at first intercourse, smoking habits, parity and age at conization &gt; 50 years old were considered as risk factors for relapsing HG-CIN during follow-up, and were univariately and multivariately analyzed to discover any independent influencing factors. Results: Of HG-CIN 15.4% resulted not to be HPV related nor relapsing. The HPV clearance rate after treatment was 78.8%. Involvement of resection margins and HR-HPV DNA persistence post-treatment resulted as the only two statistically significant risk factors for HG-CIN recurrence (rate 3.8%). HR-HPV DNA persistence in follow-up resulted to be independent from other risk factors at multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Although able to reach a low recurrence rate of HG-CIN, laser CO2 conization does not remove HPV infection completely from the cervix with a case of persistence in every five treated patients. In our experience this persistence in itself represents an independent risk factor for developing relapsing disease and constitutes the basis to introduce HPV testing even in the follow-up of patients treated for HG-CIN by laser CO2 conization.","HPV persistence; Laser CO2 conization; Recurrent CIN","virus DNA; adult; age; article; cancer recurrence; carbon dioxide laser; disease course; disease severity; female; follow up; human; human tissue; infection risk; informed consent; major clinical study; multivariate analysis; parity; persistent virus infection; preoperative evaluation; prognosis; prospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; sexual intercourse; smoking habit; statistical significance; univariate analysis; uterine cervix carcinoma in situ; uterine cervix conization; Wart virus; Adult; Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia; Cervix Uteri; Cohort Studies; Conization; DNA, Viral; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Laser Therapy; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Papillomaviridae; Papillomavirus Infections; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Vaginal Smears",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47949130948

The net effect could be job creation, as low-carbon technologies tend to be more labour-intensive, at least in the short term until efficiency gains bring down costs. In the medium term, the effect will be felt economy-wide as value chains and production patterns adjust. This effect is more difficult to gauge, particularly if climate policy is unilateral and trade effects have to be taken into account.

The building used for the case study is a university teaching and research complex located in Miami, Florida. The building's original service centrifugal chiller plant and natural gas boiler are compared with the proposed cogeneration system based on energy and exergy performance. Because of the complexity of the system configuration and control schemes, building energy simulation code EnergyPlus is used as the primary tool to solve the energy balance equations. Further mathematical model for individual process exergy destruction, i.e. space cooling, dehumidification, VAV box reheating, mechanical ventilation, cooling tower evaporation, etc. are developed. To address both the processes of space cooling and dehumidification, the reference state which is associated with ambient temperature and humidity ratio is used throughout the analysis. The simulation results meet well with on-site measurement of energy usage. It is found that at whole system level, exergy efficiency is generally much lower than that of energy. The performance of chiller plant, natural boiler, air handling unit is far from thermodynamic ideal operation. By comparing different chiller plant modification scenarios, the cogeneration energy system with centrifugal chillers demonstrate the ability to increase both energy and exergy efficiencies for the overall system. The system with single-effect absorption chiller exergy efficiency is the lowest among all the candidate scenarios. The implication between exergy efficiency and sustainable building is discussed. To further improve the exergy efficiency, low exergy resources such as geothermal and solar heating should be used.

Taking into account the changes of macroeconomic background, it conducts a detailed analysis in terms of CO 2 emission trend from 4 th Five Year Plan through 10 th Five Year Plan. The decomposition results indicate that economic development and increase in population are major driving forces, and that improvement in energy efficiency contributes to the reduction of CO 2 emission, and that decarbonization in primary energy structure is also an important strategic choice.

If on one hand, high pressure combustion has some effective advantages, on the other hand the severe engine's system operating conditions requires a more careful design of all the engine's components. In particular, the rocket thermal protection system has to manage higher heat flux peak value and integrated heating over time; so an optimal TPS design could be a tough task to achieve. Starting from this background, the current work presents a comparative study of different wall-functions models developed in order to improve wall heat flux prediction capabilities. These models have been embedded in a Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes pressure-based solver employing a high Reynolds number k-ε turbulence model. The performances of the examined wall-functions models have been evaluated by reproducing numerically the run #268 of the test campaign held at Jet Propulsion Laboratory(JPL) of the California Institute of Technologies in 1963.1 This test, consisting in a flow of vitiated-air through a nozzle, presents very similar flow conditions with respect to common high-pressure rocket combustion chamber. For the validation in a reactive flow situation, a more complex test case has been considered, namely the RCM-1 2006, for which experimental and numerical data are available in literature.2. © 2008 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",,"Combustion chambers; Engines; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Ground operations; Industrial research; Navier Stokes equations; Propulsion; Reynolds number; Rocket nozzles; Rockets; Turbulent flow; Wall function; California Institute of Technology; High-pressure combustion; Jet Propulsion Laboratory; K-epsilon turbulence model; Propulsive performance; Reynolds - Averaged Navier-Stokes; Rocket combustion chambers; Thermal Protection System; Heat flux",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957851692

Concerns about the impacts of coal on the environment and human health are not new; they may date from its first use as a fuel in China about 3,000 years ago. There is speculation that radioactivity from coal and coal-combustion products presents a health hazard, although there is little evidence to support this contention. Air pollution is another environmental impact of coal combustion. In the past several decades, the association of sulfur emissions with acid rain, and epidemiological studies on the health impacts of particulates, gases, organic compounds, radionuclides, and elements emitted into the atmosphere by coal combustion resulted in federal and state regulations limiting emissions of toxic compounds from coal combustion. Various technologies have been developed that capture potentially harmful elements and compounds before they can be emitted to the atmosphere. These technologies convert the particulates and vapor-phase compounds into solid wastes. The solids are then disposed of in sediment ponds and landfills. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053565335

These include extremes of temperature and pH, anoxia, water stress, physical fragmentation, toxic metals and other pollutants, as well as anthropogenic stresses arising from applications of fertilisers, lime and wood ash. Fungi can respond to these stresses by altering their morphology, modifying their external environment or adapting their internal metabolism, although the degree of phenotypic plasticity may vary. Since mycorrhizal fungi obtain their carbon from autotrophic host plants, the fungi may also be exposed to stress through changes in carbon allocation from hosts. The refinement and application of molecular identification methods has led to the realisation that the degree of host specificity shown by some mycorrhizal fungi may be higher than assumed in the past. This implies that the availability of compatible roots will influence fungal survival and changes in the species composition of plant communities. Restricting the supply of assimilates from compatible host roots may thus limit the growth of certain fungi. Other types of biotic stress may arise from interactions with competing mycorrhizal symbionts, other fungi, soil animals or bacteria. These different types of stress are reviewed from physiological, ecological and evolutionary perspectives in an attempt to identify potentially fruitful lines of future research. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, this process reduces completely methane emissions and stabilizes the manure before its agronomic use. AD plants can be built in a wide range of capacities: as capacity increases, economies of scale in capital equipment are realized, but transportation costs increase as manure and the digested substrates must be conveyed over longer distances. It is thus a key issue to assess the tradeoffs between biomass' transportation and plants' capacity. We propose a method to evaluate the AD plants' convenience on a given territory by an economic, energy and emissive point of view. A mathematical model is formulated in order to optimize biomass use by finding the optimal AD plants' number, capacity, location, and the corresponding biomass collection basin. The method is applied to the district of Cremona, one of the most important Italian farming areas. The optimal solution is achieved by widespread AD plants over the territory in order to exploit biomass locally. Biomass transportation is minimized for its high costs are not balanced by economies of scale. AD plants in Cremona yield positive returns in economic terms, as energy produced and GHG emissions avoided (7% reduction with respect to 2003). The robustness of this result has been confirmed by sensitivity analysis of the plant and transportation costs. The final result is crucial for local planning of biomass exploitation: local governments can encourage the development of conversion plants at municipal level without the need for centralized decisions.","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; GHG emissions; Plant location","Animal manure; Biogas production; Biomass transportations; Capacity increase; Capital equipments; Conversion plants; Economies of scale; GHG emission; High costs; Local government; Local planning; Methane emissions; Optimal solutions; Transportation cost; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Decision making; Environmental technology; Greenhouse gases; Information technology; Location; Manures; Mathematical models; Methane; Optimization; Biomass",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858323230

Although with some potential limitations, cluster analyses of sequences recovered from clone libraries have revealed differences in populations among animals fed forage v. grain, including amylolytic ruminococci and novel groups of clostridia adhering to the rumen particulates. Rapid profiling procedures, such as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), can be used to infer likely differences in community structure of bacteria and archaea among numerous replicates of animals and times after feeding diets that are more representative of intense ruminant animal production. Metagenomics procedures also are being applied to issues related to ruminal output of fatty acid isomers influencing milk fat composition and consumer acceptance, the environmental impact of nitrogen in animal waste and methane emissions, and future potential approaches to improve ruminal fibre digestibility. If varying concentrations of ruminal metabolites and fluxes quantified from microbial processes can be combined with results from metagenomics applied to rumen microbiota, then we should reduce the unexplained variability in models in which the prediction of nutrient supply to the intestine is synchronised with nutritional guidelines for more efficient feed conversion by ruminants. © CSIRO 2008.",,"bacterium; cluster analysis; community structure; concentration (composition); diet; digestive system; food supply; genomics; metabolite; nutrition; protozoan; ruminant; Animalia; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bovidae; Clostridia; Protozoa",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45849090282

EPA's PM2.5 54-site Chemical Speciation Trends Network is a subset of CSN. These networks were designed to obtain information about the spatial and temporal chemical composition of ambient fine particulate matter in urban (CSN) and rural (IMPROVE) areas. EPA has recognized the need to have a combined dataset to develop effective emissions control strategies for fine particles, and supported a study in which CSN and IMPROVE sampled side-by-side at a series of both urban and rural sites beginning in 2001. IMPROVE results had greater theoretical sensitivity than CSN due to higher filter deposit densities, as a consequence of the higher sample flow rate and smaller filter area size used by IMPROVE. Other differences between networks include artifact correction for the organic carbon (OC) fraction, which is done with IMPROVE, but not for CSN; and shipping temperatures. Another strong, consistently identified factor was originally identified as biomass combustion because it was dominated by OC and elemental carbon in a typical ratio of about 3:1, plus high potassium.

A number of technical and legal issues must be resolved before carbon sequestration can become a viable means to reduce carbon emissions. Recently the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (""IOGCC"") set forth a model statute and model rules and regulations, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") set forth a proposed rule for CO2 injection that could resolve some of these issues and make large-scale carbon sequestration projects a reality. The IOGCC model treats CO2 as a resource and covers the areas of permitting, property ownership, storage operations, and long-term monitoring and liability. Certain parts of the IOGCC model rules were a basis for the EPA proposed rule governing carbon sequestration that was published for public comment on July 25, 2008. This EPA proposed rule creates a new class of underground injection wells regulated as part of the Underground Injection Control program under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Both the IOGCC model statute and the EPA proposed rule provide specific guidance on construction and permit application submittals tailored toward the long-term nature of carbon storage. Carbon sequestration has also recently been addressed on a broader scale as a component of CO2 reduction in other federal proposals. The FutureGen project was recently modified by the Department of Energy (""DOE"") from a $1.8 billion research and development facility to multiple operations that would utilize carbon sequestration technology in coal-fired power plants. Congress has been bombarded with proposed climate change legislation, such as the Lieberman-Waimer bill that proposed a cap and trade program. All of the legislation provides methods for reducing emissions thereby increasing incentives to develop carbon sequestration. Also, carbon sequestration is being encouraged through the use of small-scale experimental projects set in motion by the DOE carbon sequestration partnerships. New rules and regulations addressing the technical and legal aspects of sequestration must be adopted. Until this regulatory framework is available, development of sequestration projects most likely will be hindered or delayed.

This approach has been used since the early-mid 90s by the French, U.S., Canadian, Australian and other climate modeling groups along with, or as an alternative to, the current widely-used nested-grid approach. Stretched-grid GCMs are used for continuous climate simulations as usual GCMs, with the only difference that variable-resolution grids are used instead of more traditional uniform grids. The important advantages of variable-resolution stretched-grid GCMs are that they do not require any lateral boundary conditions/forcing and are free of the associated undesirable computational problems. As a result, stretched-grid GCMs provide self-consistent interactions between global and regional scales while a high quality of global circulation is preserved, as in uniform-grid GCMs. The international SGMIP-2 (Stretched-Grid Model Intercomparison Project, phase-2) includes 25-year (1979-2003) climate simulations using enhanced variable and uniform-resolution GCMs developed at major centers/groups in Australia, Canada, France, and the U.S. The SGMIP-2 regional (North American) and global products are available as a link of the WMO/WCRP/ WGNE web site: http://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/science/wgne. The SGMIP-2 multi-model regional ensembles compare well with reanalysis and observations, in terms of spatial and temporal diagnostics. Regional biases are mostly limited to about half (or less) of typical observational or reanalysis errors while a high quality of global circulation is preserved.

We emphasize the difference between coastal and inland arctic fox populations. Inland foxes rely on peak abundance of lemming prey to sustain viable populations. In the short-term, warmer winters result in missed lemming peak years and reduced opportunities for successful arctic fox breeding. In the long-term, however warmer climate will increase plant productivity and more herbivore prey for competitive dominant predators moving in from the south. The red fox has already intruded the arctic region and caused a retreat of the southern limit of arctic fox distribution range. Coastal arctic foxes, which rely on the richer and temporally stable marine subsidies, will be less prone to climate-induced resource limitations. Indeed, arctic islands, becoming protected from southern species invasions as the extent of sea ice is decreasing, may become the last refuges for coastal populations of arctic foxes.","Alopex lagopus; Arctic; Arctic fox; Climate change; Global warming; Missed lemming cycles; Predators; Sea ice; Tundra ecosystems; Vulpes lagopus","animal; Arctic; article; ecosystem; feeding behavior; fox; greenhouse effect; physiology; population dynamics; Animals; Arctic Regions; Ecosystem; Feeding Behavior; Foxes; Greenhouse Effect; Population Dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49249109044

The spontaneous emission lifetimes measured at ∼10 K for the (0001) polar QWs were 1.4 ns at an emission wavelength of 400 nm, but increased monotonically to 85 ns at 520 nm. On the other hand, those for 11 2-2̄} and {1 1-01̄} semipolar QWs and {112-0̄} and {1 1-00̄}nonpolar QWs were on the order of a few hundred picoseconds and independent of the emission wavelength. To quantitatively discuss these results, the crystalline orientation dependence of the spontaneous emission lifetime of 1s heavy hole excitons in InGaNGaN QWs at 0 K was calculated, when lateral confinements were considered to express well-reported potential fluctuations. It is revealed that both the crystalline orientation and lateral confinement vary the spontaneous emission lifetime by orders of magnitude. Analyses of the experimental results suggest that excitons in the (0001) polar QWs are more strongly localized as the In composition increases, but the semipolar and nonpolar QWs exhibit the opposite tendency.

However, much of the attention on the built environment has focused on the energy performance of individual buildings, with little research into how the form of the urban environment, as a whole, influences energy use. In terms of the urban environment, the interactions between urban morphology and the consequential localised climatic conditions that are influential in forming the Urban Heat Island, can impact significantly on the performance of individual buildings. However this relationship is not always recognised when examining the performance of individual building in terms of energy demand and CO2 reduction.

While sandstorms originating in China's north and northwest buffet Korea and Japan, coal-fired power plants pollute the air, literally adding fuel to the fire that drives global climate change. Governments and international non-government organizations (INGOs) are now working with their Chinese counterparts to mitigate desertification and climate change and to protect some of the most biologically diverse areas on Earth. From environmental education campaigns to eco-tours, from model cities to integrated conservation and development projects, INGOs have been at the forefront of environmental cooperation with China. INGOs spend over two hundred million USD a year working to protect China's environment. In order to understand the evolution of INGOs in environmental protection in China, it is necessary to understand the larger politicaleconomic contexts in which they operate. Indeed, shifting political winds often decided whether INGOs could operate at all within China's borders, not to mention what they could do. Furthermore, China's engagement with NGOs has always been part of a broader engagement with other international organizations working within the realm of environmental protection. For example, the Stockholm Conference and Rio Conference both mark definitive shifts in how the Chinese government viewed international cooperation around environmental protection. Finally, INGOs have interacted with a growing number of domestic actors, from national, provincial, and local environmental protection and forestry bureaus to the growing number of domestic environmental NGOs (ENGOs). The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), for example, worked with over two hundred partners on over forty projects in 2006 alone.

While no national policy to control greenhouse gases has yet been developed, many state and local governments have taken actions to reduce emissions. Twenty-eight states have adopted climate action plans, and 128 city and county governments are participating in an initiative to reduce emissions. While California has regulated tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases, New York, has enacted requirements on the transportation planning side. The 2002 New York State Energy Plan required metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) in the state to conduct a greenhouse gas energy analysis as part of the transportation planning process for regionally significant projects. This paper provides an overview of the transportation/climate change connection and its importance to New York, summarizes the requirements of the Energy Plan and examines the analyses conducted by three of the thirteen MPOs in New York. It synthesizes their findings, and assesses what effects the greenhouse gas analyses have had on the transportation planning decision-making process and the potential for achieving greenhouse gas reductions from such exercises. Further, this paper will compare the methods used by the MPOs to quantify greenhouse gas emissions and to conduct the analysis, and recommend areas where further methodological development is needed or available for future planning documents. With political and scientific attention increasing, the transportation sector may face some form of emission, reduction targets in the future-whether mandatory or voluntary.

To reduce the computation time, this paper presents a pipelined, prefetch, and parallelized architecture for PET BP (3PA-PET). The key feature of this architecture is its original memory access strategy, masking the high latency of the external memory. Indeed, the pattern of the memory references to the data acquired hinders the processing unit. The memory access bottleneck is overcome by an efficient use of the intrinsic temporal and spatial locality of the BP algorithm. A loop reordering allows an efficient use of general purpose processor's caches, for software implementation, as well as the 3D predictive and adaptive cache (3D-AP cache), when considering hardware implementations. Parallel hardware pipelines are also efficient thanks to a hierarchical 3D-AP cache: each pipeline performs a memory reference in about one clock cycle to reach a computational throughput close to 100. The 3PA-PET architecture is prototyped on a system on programmable chip (SoPC) to validate the system and to measure its expected performances. Time performances are compared with a desktop PC, a workstation, and a graphic processor unit (GPU).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62249222082

Ruthenium(II)quaterpyridinium complexes exhibit superior reactivity as sensitizer-relay-assemblies (SRA's) in sacrificial systems for water and hydrocarbon reductions, while harvesting the ultraviolet and most of visible fraction of the incident solar spectrum. Phosphonate-tethered Ru(II)quaterpyridinium complexes were synthesized from Ru(II)-tris-quaterpyridyl. These complexes form stable adhesive layers on ITO (Indium tin oxide). A series of differential pulse voltammetry experiments were carried out to measure the ground state and excited state redox potential of phosphonate-tethered Ru(II)quaterpyridinium complexes on ITO. The reductive potentials obtained were compared with the reductive potential of the CO2 to CH4 and H2O to H2 reductions. Our measurements confirmed that we can thermodynamically oxidize water and reduce CO2 by using phosphonate-tethered Ru(II)quaterpyridinium complexes.

Current remote sensing methodologies for estimating gross primary productivity are not satisfactory because they rely too heavily on (i) the availability of climatic data, (ii) the definition of land-use cover, and (iii) the assumptions of the effects of these two factors on the radiation-use efficiency of vegetation (RUE). A new methodology is urgently needed that will actually assess RUE and overcome the problems associated with the capture of fluctuations in carbon absorption in space and over time. Remote sensing techniques such as the widely used reflectance vegetation indices (e.g. NDVI, EVI) allow green plant biomass and therefore plant photosynthetic capacity to be assessed. However, there are vegetation types, such as the Mediterranean forests, with a very low seasonality of these vegetation indices and a high seasonality of carbon uptake. In these cases it is important to detect how much of this capacity is actually realized, which is a much more challenging goal. The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) derived from freely available satellite information (MODIS sensor) presented for a 5-year analysis for a Mediterranean forest a positive relationship with the RUE. Thus, we show that it is possible to estimate RUE and GPP in real time and therefore actual carbon uptake of Mediterranean forests at ecosystem level using the PRI. This conceptual and technological advancement would avoid the need to rely on the sometimes unreliable maximum RUE. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.","Carbon cycle; CO2 uptake; Eddy covariance; Mediterranean forests; MODIS; Primary productivity; Radiation use efficiency; Remote sensing; Vegetation","biomass; biosphere; carbon balance; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; eddy covariance; estimation method; forest; global change; light use efficiency; MODIS; NDVI; nutrient uptake; photochemistry; primary production; satellite data; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; Viridiplantae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56349122518

We focused on two different species (Pinus Halepensis and Quercus Ilex) and compared their growth under the IPCC-B2 climate scenario in order to quantify significant changes between present and future. The influence of environmental factors such as atmospheric CO2 increase and topography on the tree growth has also been quantified. We modeled species growth with the help of a processbased model (MAIDEN), previously calibrated over measured ecophysiological and dendrochronological series with a Bayesian scheme. The model was fed with the ARPEGE - MeteoFrance climate model, combined with an explicit increase in CO2 atmospheric concentration. The main output of the model gives the carbon allocation in boles and thus tree production. Our results show that theMAIDEN model is correctly able to simulate pine and oak production in space and time, after detailed calibration and validation stages. Yet, these simulations, mainly based on climate, are indicative and not predictive. The comparison of simulated growth at end of 20th and 21st centuries, show a shift of the pine production optimum from about 650 to 950m due to 2.5K temperature increase, while no optimum has been found for oak. With the direct effect of CO2 increase taken into account, both species show a significant increase in productivity (+26 and +43% for pine and oak respectively) at the end of the 21st century. While both species have different growth mechanisms, they have a good chance to extend their spatial distribution and their elevation in the Alps during the 21st century under he IPCC-B2 climate scenario. This extension is mainly due to the CO2 fertilization effect. © Author(s) 2008.",,"Ilex; Pinus halepensis; Quercus ilex",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952742337

State-of-the-art models, including the KH-RT spray breakup model, the RNG k-ε turbulence model, and a n-heptane reduced chemistry including reduced GRI NOx mechanism were used. The performances of two combustion models, KIVA-CHEMKIN and GAMUT (KIVA-CHEMKIN-G), coupled with 2-step and multi-step phenomenological soot models were compared. The numerical results were compared with available experimental data obtained from an optically accessible HSDI engine and good agreement was obtained. To assess the effects of the in-cylinder flow field on combustion and emissions, off-centered swirl flows were also considered. In these studies, the swirl center was initialized at different positions in the chamber for different cases to simulate the effects of different intake flow arrangements. To aid the comparisons, the angular momentum referred to the swirl center was kept constant in each case. Numerical results of off-centered swirl cases were compared with the centered swirl case, as well as with available experimental images obtained using laser induced fluorescence (LIF), laser induced incandescence (LII), and particle image velocimetry (PIV). Eccentric phenomena observed in the experiments were well predicted by the present method. The off-centered swirl was found to have higher turbulence intensities and effective diffusivities, which enhance the mixing process. Soot formation is strongly correlated with the turbulent viscosity. Off-centered swirl flow results in an asymmetric distribution of turbulent viscosity and consequently an asymmetric distribution of soot emissions. Analysis of the mass distributions of temperature showed that the resulting mixture is a little more homogeneous with larger off-centered swirl flows, which leads to a slight reduction in NOx emissions. The off-centered swirl delays the formation of acetylene, which changes the phasing of soot formation.

LTC with late fuel injection further offers the benefit of combustion phasing control because ignition is closely coupled to the fuel injection event. But with a short ignition-delay, fuel jet mixing processes must be rapid to achieve adequate premixing before ignition. In the current study, mixing and pollutant formation of late-injection LTC are studied in a single-cylinder, direct-injection, optically accessible heavy-duty diesel engine using three laser-based imaging diagnostics. Simultaneous planar laser-induced fluorescence of the hydroxyl radical (OH) and combined formaldehyde (H2CO) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are compared with vapor-fuel concentration measurements from a non-combusting condition. Through comparative analysis of OH, H 2CO, and PAH fluorescence, mixtures are identified as either fuel-lean, fuel-rich, or of intermediate stoichiometries. The impacts of combustion chamber design on incylinder mixing processes are explored by comparing three piston bowl diameters of 60%, 70% and 80% of the cylinder bore. The data show that piston-bowl diameter influences in-cylinder mixing and pollutant formation processes by altering jet-jet and jet-wall interactions. When the fuel jets impinge on the bowl wall prior to ignition, adjacent jets merge, forming fuel-rich regions where soot formation occurs. By using a larger diameter bowl, wall impingement prior to ignition is reduced and delayed, and mixtures are leaner throughout the jet. However, a greater fraction of the jet becomes too lean for complete combustion. By using a smaller diameter bowl, a strong jet-wall interaction pushes the fuel-rich jet-jet interaction regions into the center of the chamber, where mixtures are predominantly lean. This reduces net soot formation and displaces fuel-lean regions of otherwise incomplete combustion into the combusting regions near the bowl wall.

We provide here a summary of the findings of the techniques and case studies presented to reinforce the strength of the techniques described. Isotopic dilution techniques represent a flexible and powerful tool to assess changes in metal exchangeability as a result of a number of processes such as natural attenuation, rhizosphere reactions, remediation processes, etc. However, it must be remembered that this information is operationally defined mainly as a function of the equilibration time. Nonetheless, a combination of isotopic dilution techniques together with spectroscopic methods, such as those described in this chapter, represent an exciting possibility to obtain quantitative and mechanistic information regarding important processes controlling contaminant's bioavailability in soil. The strength of synchrotron-based spectroscopic techniques has been described. For instance through the application of XANES it has been demonstrated that Cr is present in ambient particulate matter in a wide variety of forms that probably represent an equally broad set of sources. The majority of the Cr analysed within the aerosol particulate case study presented in Section 7.3 was present in relatively unreactive phases such as Cr(III) oxy(hydro)oxides, Cr(0) and Cr-carbides, but Cr(VI) is also present in some ambient particles. This finding was consistent with complementary laboratory ageing experiments, which suggest that ambient particulate Cr(VI) has a lifetime of days. Analysis of Peruvian mummy teeth by using synchrotron micro-XRF mapping has provided an insight into the environmental exposure of individuals to trace metals that would be difficult to obtain by other means. It is apparent from this study that the trace metal concentration in the cementum ring system differs from that of the rest of the tooth. Metals such as Br and Pb appear in the cementum of teeth from different individuals, indicative of different lifetime exposure. In addition the two distinct Zn bands suggest an endogenous origin for the Zn. It is clear that micro-focused XAFS is an ideal tool for the analysis of ambient particulate matter. The specific advantages of micro-XAFS include spatial resolution of a few microns, element specific analysis, oxidation state determination, elemental correlations and detailed structural information, even in non-crystalline samples. These are all important factors that must be determined for a more complete understanding of particulate matter composition and its impacts on health. A better understanding of the complex chemical composition of ambient particulate matter may lead to improvements in the effectiveness of particulate matter regulations. Soil samples affected by a smelter were analysed by XAFS spectroscopy to determine the speciation and local coordination environment of As in the samples. The level of understanding achieved through the determination of local coordination and oxidation state provided by these studies would be extremely difficult to acquire by other means. This study stemmed from the need to assess the stability of As carriers in soil for the development of a conceptual model for human health and environmental risks associated with the soil containing up to 270 ppm As. The idea of remobilisation of trace metals due to microbial activity is supported by XAFS measurements along with the spatial associations provided by the SEM. This spectroscopic evidence suggests that trace element mobility can be directly associated with dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria. By combining both electron microscopy and synchrotron-based techniques with other available selective extraction procedures one can investigate the partitioning of trace metals in lacustrine sediment and similarly iron rich lateritic soil profiles. In particular, the ability to estimate concentrations of metals associated with carbonate Fe (particularly siderite and ankerite) and magnetite Fe materials in weathered sediment profiles contributes to our increased understanding with respect to bioavailability. The application of the spectroscopic procedures to laterite environments provides insight into the dominant modes of occurrence of different trace metals associated with Fe and Mn minerals in weathered laterites and how they will behave in the presence of biologically mediated redox environments. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Direct measurement of permeability through coring and wireline formation testing is expensive and sometimes fail to achieve. In recent years, different methodologies have been introduced to the petroleum geosciences/engineering descipline to predict permeability from openhole logs. In this case study, the permeability models for two wells with core data were built using the following methods: permeability-effective porosity relationship, FZI, multilinear regression, and fuzzy logic. The last two uses the raw openhole logs data including density, neutron, sonic, and gamma ray. These models then were used to predict the permeability in the third well. Core data was used to cross-check the result for these wells. Along with the openhole logs, image logs permeability including coarse and high resolution is available to investigate the model.The models result shows that the fuzzy logic yields a better result compared to other methods as fuzzy logic model could almost reproduce the whole range of the available core permeabilities but the permeability of the other models is in a narrower range compared to core permeability. Furthermore, the fuzzy logic model result is in harmony with the log derived permeability and could be used for permeability prediction fieldwide. ©2008,Intemational Petroleum Technology COnference.",,"Carbonate reservoir; Core permeability; Crucial parameters; Direct measurement; Effective porosity; Fuzzy logic model; Heterogeneous carbonates; High resolution; Image logs; Multi-linear regression; Openhole; Permeability model; Permeability modeling; Permeability prediction; Reservoir modeling; Wireline formation testing; Capillarity; Core samples; Density measurement (specific gravity); Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy sets; Gamma rays; Neutron logging; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Wells; Oil well logging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650518224

The majority of cities in developing countries still dispose of their municipal waste in uncontrolled 'open dumps.' Municipal solid waste landfill construction practices and operating procedures in these countries pose a challenge to implementation of LFGTE projects because of concern about damage to the gas collection infrastructure (horizontal headers and vertical wells) caused by minor, relatively shallow slumps and slides within the waste mass. While major slope failures can and have occurred, such failures in most cases have been shown to involve contributory factors or triggers such as high pore pressures, weak foundation soil or failure along weak geosynthetic interfaces. Many researchers who have studied waste mechanics propose that the shear strength of municipal waste is sufficient such that major deep-seated catastrophic failures under most circumstances require such contributory factors. Obviously, evaluation of such potential major failures requires expert analysis by geotechnical specialists with detailed site-specific information regarding foundation soils, interface shearing resistances and pore pressures both within the waste and in clayey barrier layers or foundation soils. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the potential use of very simple stability analyses which can be used to study the potential for slumps and slides within the waste mass and which may represent a significant constraint on construction and development of the landfill, on reclamation and closure and on the feasibility of a LFGTE project. The stability analyses rely on site-specific but simple estimates of the unit weight of waste and the pore pressure conditions and use ""generic"" published shear strength envelopes for municipal waste. Application of the slope stability analysis method is presented in a case study of two Brazilian landfill sites; the Cruz das Almas Landfill in Maceio and the Muribeca Landfill in Recife. The Muribeca site has never recorded a slope failure and is much larger and better-maintained when compared to the Maceio site at which numerous minor slumps and slides have been observed. Conventional limit-equilibrium analysis was used to calculate factors of safety for stability of the landfill side slopes. Results indicate that the Muribeca site is more stable with computed factors of safety values in the range 1.6-2.4 compared with computed values ranging from 0.9 to 1.4 for the Maceio site at which slope failures have been known to occur. The results suggest that this approach may be useful as a screening-level tool when considering the feasibility of implementing LFGTE projects. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we used a novel approach based upon four dimensionless scaling groups commonly used for hydrocarbon phase behavior modeling (reduced temperature and acentric factors for light and heavy pseudo components) as well as multivariate regression analysis based on response surface methodology to develop an MMP correlation for a broad range of reservoir oils. Applying the response surface method and multivariate regression analysis made it possible to quantify and rank the effect of each one of the mentioned dimensionless groups on the predicted MMP value. Since reservoir temperature is one of the main parameters, slim tube simulations were performed at four different reservoir temperatures (90, 150, 180, and 220 °F) for all of the fluid models. Based on the results from these simulations, and by performing multi-variate regression analysis, MMP values were correlated using a response surface based on linear, quadratic, and third degree equations. Our new MMP correlation takes into account the important equation-of-state properties for heavy- and light-oil components as well as temperature. Predicted MMP values from the new correlation were compared with previously published MMP correlations and found to have a lower average error.

Another monocyclic isomer may be considered as a planar C6(CO)3 ""carbon-complex"", a carbon version of the related iron carbonyl complex Fe(PH3) 2(CO)3.

As a result, Brazil, as the largest sugar ethanol producer and exporter in the world, can expect growing foreign demand for ethanol exports. Also, the introduction of flex-fuel vehicles in Brazil is causing domestic sales of ethanol to increase steadily. In this paper, we investigate the regional and industrial economic consequences of rapid growth in Brazilian ethanol domestic consumption and exports. For this, we use a disaggregated multi-regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with energy industry detail. Our modelling emphasises a number of features of ethanol production in Brazil which we expect to be important in determining the adjustment of its regional economies to a substantial expansion in ethanol production. These include regional differences in ethanol and sugar production technologies, sugarcane harvesting methods and the elasticity of land supply to sugarcane production. Some of the conclusions are as follows, (i) Debate on the prospects for the Brazilian ethanol industry often places a high weight on export growth. Our simulations suggest that growth in domestic ethanol demand will be the major influence on the Brazilian economy, at least to 2020. (ii) Pressure for further land clearance is often associated with a rapid ethanol growth scenario. But only a small (less than 2%) reduction in land use by other agriculture is necessary to accommodate the required expansion in ethanol production. Food production is equally affected by the appreciation of real exchange rate (Dutch disease effect) and growth of the light-duty vehicle fleet, (iii) Tight enforcement of a nation-wide ban on manual harvesting could reduce the ability of some (poor) regional economies to participate in the benefits of growth in ethanol production.","Brazil; CGE models; Energy; Ethanol",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961057301

Multiway boulevards are one alternative. Through lanes in the middle are separated by landscaped medians from side access lanes for bicycles and slow-moving local traffic. Using a case study from Oregon's Eugene-Springfield metropolitan area, this project considers what could happen if cities built arterials as multiway boulevards. This interdisciplinary study, which included widespread stakeholder and public participation as well as detailed land use and transportation modeling, was instrumental in the Eugene Planning Commission's decision to endorse converting a portion of the arterial into a multiway boulevard. Although the case study arterial, with its existing bus rapid transit lanes, requires an unusually wide right-of-way, the results show that the arterial could better accommodate residential and mixed-use buildings at the edges if reconfigured as a multiway boulevard. Projected benefits include the possibility of supporting 8,400 dwelling units, reducing annual vehicle miles traveled by nearly 100 million miles (161 million km), and reducing annual carbon emissions by nearly 110 million Ib (50 million kg). Development along the boulevard can preserve up to 1,680 acres (680 ha) of farmland and lead to an annual transportation savings per household of about $1,500.

The operational evaluation is used to reveal the overall performance of the model, and diagnostic evaluation approaches are then used to identify what processes and/or inputs significantly influence the predict-ted concentrations and whether they are simulated correctly. Dynamic evaluation entails assessing a model’s ability to reproduce observed changes in pollutant concentrations stemming from changes in weather and emissions.

In established markets such as the US and Europe, zeolite SCR systems are expected to be used due to their ability to survive the exhaust gas temperatures seen in an active diesel particulate filter regeneration. In emerging markets where the fuel sulfur level may be as high as 2000 parts per million, zeolite SCR catalysts may have durability issues. In these markets, low sulfur fuel is needed overall to meet emissions standards and to avoid high sulfate emissions, but the aftertreatment system must be durable to high sulfur levels because there is a risk of exposure to high sulfur fuel. Also, emissions standards may be met without a DPF in some applications, so that the exhaust system would not see temperatures of 600°C or higher. If a zeolite SCR system were used in this application, a diesel oxidation catalyst would be needed to regenerate the SCR after exposure to high sulfur fuel, adding cost to the system. Thus, a vanadium SCR system has several advantages for this application. This work shows experimental comparisons of state of the art vanadium SCR catalysts with base metal zeolite SCR catalysts. NOx conversion performance after exposure to sulfur is examined, as well as NOx conversion in the presence of hydrocarbons. Improvements in durability and performance of vanadium SCR catalysts are shown. Also, modeling results are presented demonstrating the ability of a vanadium SCR system to meet the NOx emissions targets for a Euro IV or Euro V standard. The thermal durability of current vanadium SCR catalysts is also evaluated. Based on these tests it is concluded that in markets where there is a risk of exposure to high sulfur fuel, vanadium SCR is the recommended technology.

Research on molecular phylogeny demonstrated that Erysiphales are Leotiomycetes (inoperculate discomycetes) rather than Pyrenomycetes or Plectomycetes. Life cycles are surprisingly variable, including both sexual and asexual states, or only sexual states, or only asexual states. At least one species produces dematiaceous conidia. Analyses of rDNA sequences indicate that major lineages are more closely correlated with anamorphic features such as conidial ontogeny and morphology than with teleomorph features. Development of molecular clock models is enabling researchers to reconstruct patterns of coevolution and host-jumping, as well as ancient migration patterns. Geographic distributions of some species appear to be increasing rapidly but little is known about species diversity in many large areas, including North America. Powdery mildews may already be responding to climate change, suggesting they may be useful models for studying effects of climate change on plant diseases. Copyright © 2008 by Annual Reviews.

This presentation focuses on how landfills are participating in voluntary carbon and renewable energy markets, and presents case studies from award-winning projects that utilize these funding mechanisms. Landfills participate in the voluntary carbon markets using one of two main mechanisms: on an exchange or through an over-the-counter (OTC) transaction. An exchange, such as the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), is likely the most well known mechanism. At present, CCX has 35 registered landfill methane offset project providers in the United States [1]. As of April 2008, landfill methane projects comprised approximately 9 percent of all the carbon credits issued by CCX. OTC transactions are private between the seller, buyer, and/or broker involved in the transaction. Despite their private nature, the volume of OTC traded emissions has substantially grown in recent years according to research from Ecosystem Marketplace [2]. Recent data from Point Carbon indicate that 132 U.S. landfills have either made a transaction in the carbon market, or are in the process of developing, producing, certifying, or verifying their emissions reductions in order to prepare for an OTC transaction or exchange on the CCX [3]. In addition to carbon finance, LFGE projects generating electricity are also selling Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). These RECs are then purchased by companies wishing to reduce their environmental footprint or used by utilities to comply with various renewable portfolio standards. Stakeholders are also using state and federal financial incentives to promote LFGE projects. In 2008, the IRS awarded 45 applicants the authority to issue Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (CREBs) to support LFGE projects [4]. Several other new financial incentives were funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) including the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants (EECBG) and extensions to the federal production tax credits. This paper summarizes financial incentives available for LFGE projects and provides case study examples of several landfills that are implementing projects with these funds.",,"American recovery and reinvestment act of 2009; Carbon credits; Carbon finance; Carbon markets; Chicago; Emissions reduction; Energy project; Environmental footprints; Federal Production Tax Credit; Financial incentives; Funding mechanisms; Landfill gas; Landfill methane; Renewable energies; Renewable energy certificates; Renewable energy markets; Renewable portfolio standard; Biogas; Carbon; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Forestry; Land fill; Methane; Research; Sales; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865612165

With this pipeline will come vastly improved efficiencies in the supply of water, with an estimated water saving of 103,000 ML being returned to the environment, existing consumptive use, new development, and for recreation. The main source of supply to the WMPP will be from the headworks system located in and around the Grampians National Park with the northern (Mallee) area supplied direct from the River Murray.

Most studies on emissions of nitrous oxide from soils focused on fluxes between soil and atmosphere and hence represent an integration of physical and biological processes at different depths of a soil profile. Analysis of N2O concentration and isotope signature along soil profiles was suggested to improve the localisation of sources and sinks in soils as well as underlying processes and could therefore extend our knowledge on processes affecting surface N2O fluxes. Such a mechanistic understanding would be desirable to improve N2O mitigation strategies and global N2O budgets. To investigate N2O dynamics within soil profiles of two contrasting (semi)natural ecosystem types (a temperate acidic fen and a Norway spruce forest), soil gas samplers were constructed to meet the different requirements of a water-saturated and an unsaturated soil, respectively. The samplers were installed in three replicates and allowed soil gas sampling from six different soil depths. We analysed soil air for N2O concentration and isotope composition and calculated N2O net turnover using a mass balance approach and considering diffusive fluxes. At the fen site, N2O was mainly produced in 30-50 cm soil depth. Diffusion to adjacent layers above and below indicated N2O consumption. Values of δ15N and δ18O of N2O in the fen soil were always linearly correlated and their qualitative changes within the profile corresponded with the calculated turnover processes, suggesting further reduction of N2O. In the spruce forest, highest N2 O production occurred in the topsoil, but there was also notable production occurring in the subsoil at a depth of 70 cm. Changes in N2O isotope composition as to be expected from local production and consumption processes within the soil profile did hardly occur, though. This was presumably caused by high diffusive fluxes and comparatively low net turnover, as isotope signatures approached values measured for ambient N2O towards the topsoil. Our results demonstrate a highly variable influence of diffusive versus production/ consumption processes on N2O concentration and isotope composition, depending on the type of ecosystem. This finding indicates the necessity of further N2O concentration and isotope profile investigations in different types of natural and anthropogenic ecosystems in order to generalise our mechanistic understanding of N2O exchange between soil and atmosphere.","Denitrification; N2O consumption; N2O production; Nitrogen-15; Oxygen-18; Soil profiles","nitrogen; nitrous oxide; oxygen; concentration (composition); conference proceeding; denitrification; isotopic composition; nitrogen isotope; nitrous oxide; oxygen isotope; soil chemistry; soil profile; source-sink dynamics; conference paper; gas; Germany; growth, development and aging; Poaceae; soil; spruce; Gases; Germany; Nitrogen Isotopes; Nitrous Oxide; Oxygen Isotopes; Picea; Poaceae; Soil; Picea; Picea abies",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57549098380

WFI consists of spraying a fine mist of water into the compressor inlet of the gas turbine. Prior research on larger, higher pressure ratio engines determined the WFI can reduce nitrous oxide emissions and also yield increases in power output and thermodynamic efficiency. Whereas previous research has focused on large gas turbines, the effects of water fog injection on a smaller, lower pressure ratio gas turbine, as represented by the Rolls-Royce Model 250-C20B, have yet to provide conclusive results. This investigation determined the effect of WFI on the Model 250-C20B's exhaust gas composition, power output, thermodynamic efficiency and component efficiencies. The investigation used an instrumented Model 250-C20B gas turbine and a water spray system. Temperatures and pressures were measured for each of the gas turbine's five state points. Exhaust gas composition and output shaft torque and speed were also measured. Experiments were conducted with water fog injection water flow rates ranging from 0.1 to 1.4 gallons per minute, representing a maximum of 6 percent of the maximum mass flow rate of air through the engine. The results of these tests were compared with baseline runs conducted with no water fog injection. It was determined that the exhaust gas composition was significantly affected by the water fog injection. The increase of WFI decreased the concentration of nitrous oxides in the exhaust. NO x concentration at 1.4 gallons per minute of WFI at maximum throttle setting was 27 percent of the concentration of NOx with no WFI. The effects of WFI on the power output of the engine were also determined to be significant. WFI increased the net power for a specified mass flow rate of air. However, the fuel flow rate of the engine was mechanically limited by the governor. This limited the maximum attainable net power with elevated WFI rates. Additionally, the Brake Specific Fuel Consumption of the engine increased as WFI rate increased. This indicated that though WFI increased power, it did so at the cost of elevated fuel consumption meaning the engine was less efficient. This was caused by the fuel flow rate limit. These results are significant in that they define the practical limits of Water Fog Injection's efficacy for smaller gas turbines as represented by the Model 250-C20B. To a limited WFI water flow rate, it is possible to realize decreases in nitrous oxide emission and increases in power output over the baseline.",,"Brake specific fuel consumption; Compressor inlet; Exhaust Gas Composition; Experimental studies; Fuel flow rates; Injection water; Lower pressures; Mass flow rate of air; Nitrous oxide; Nitrous oxide emissions; Power out put; Pressure ratio; Rolls-royce; Shaft torque; State points; Thermodynamic efficiency; Water flow rate; Water fog; Water sprays; Yield increase; Anesthetics; Engines; Flow of water; Fog; Fuel consumption; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gas turbines; Hydraulics; Mass transfer; Nitrogen oxides; Pipe flow; Propulsion; Steel metallurgy; Stress analysis; Thermoelectric power; Turbomachinery; Water injection; Compressibility of gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957836387

Its share in global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions declined from about 11 percent in 1990 to about 6.4 percent in 2003.1 Despite the sharp decline, Russia remains among the world's largest polluters, ranking third in the world after the United States and China and before Japan and India. This chapter presents the history of Russian climate policy since the Kyoto Protocol was adopted at Conference of the Parties (COP-3) until the present day. This chapter also presents an analysis of the driving forces behind Russia's CO2 emissions and offers discussions on future emissions scenarios. Until now there were no specific incentives to reduce carbon emissions. Any improvements in carbon efficiency were the result of general economic reforms and the integration of Russia into the world economy. Nevertheless, after Russia recovered from its economic crisis, carbon emissions grew four times more slowly than its gross domestic product. Russia will definitely meet its Kyoto target and, with high probability, will be able to supply nearly 3 billion tonnes of CO2 allowances to the international carbon market, especially as Russia's carbon emissions will remain below its 1990 levels.

Several projects have been undertaken to develop a strategy towards a European hydrogen-based transport system. The present paper describes the part of two of those projects: CUTE and HYFLEET:CUTE, sponsored by European Commission's 6th Framework Research Programme, involving several partners, mainly from industry, governments, academic and transport operators. The CUTE project was officially closed on March 2006, while HyFLEET:CUTE is an ongoing project. Both projects have the objective of developing and demonstrating a hydrogen based public transport system. This paper will look at the main conclusions of CUTE project and at the life-cycle analysis of the hydrogen used in the filling station and the fuel cell buses that ran in the city of Porto. The life-cycle analysis covers al phases from production, transport, and storage of hydrogen, up to the operation in the municipal fleet. This included the study of the energy efficiencies and environmental impact (the so called well-totank and tank-to-wheel studies) of different hydrogen production pathways. Regarding the bus operation, the energy and environmental vehicle performance is assessed and compared with current technologies. Furthermore, in the framework of the Hyfleet:UTE project, a new filling station was built by the French oil company Total in Berlin that uses on-site hydrogen production with a LPG reforming system, combined with liquid hydrogen trucked from a Linde factory. The municipal fleet vehicles used are built by MAN and use an internal combustion engine and compressed hydrogen storage.

In southern Mediterranean countries exceedances of the IO 2 and PM10 European air quality targets are observed in urban environments. Moreover the budget of urban emissions contributes to the emissions of O3 precursors (mainly IO x) in a region where the concentration of photochemical pollutants still remains a problem especially during summertime. Air quality modeling, used as a management tool, permits to test abatement emissions strategies in advance. Iowadays, the subs titution of vehicles by introducing new technologies (e.g. cleaner fuels, hybrid vehicles, fuel cells) or alternative fuels (e.g. biofuels, natural gas or hydrogen) is a common practice in conurbations around Europe. This work focuses on the assessment of the impacts on air quality due to the introduction of hybrid cars in the largest urban areas of Spain: Madrid (within a more continental environment), and the urban coastal city of Barcelona. The WRF-ARW/HERMES/CMAQ modeling system has been implemented and validated with a high resolution (1 km2 and 1 hr) thanks to the calculation power of the MareIostrum supercomputer (94.21 TF lops peak). Due to the complex topography and climatic particularities of the study areas it becomes necessary to use high spatial and temporal resolution and to have a highly-disaggregated emission inventory of gaseous pollutants and particulate matter (HERMES model developed specifically for Spain). The model was applied during a representative summertime polluted episode. The introduction of a 10% or a 30% of hybrid cars in substitution of the oldest petrol and diesel cars of both cities proved to be effective to reduce IO 2, SO2 and PM10 concentrations in the conurbations (i.e. a 37% reduction in IO 2 24-hr average concentration occurs in Madrid and a 18% in Barcelona when introducing a 30% of hybrid vehicles; moreover 24-hr average PM10 decreases up to 12% and 14% in Madrid and Barcelona, respectively). Ievertheless the O 3 concentrations slightly arise (being the 8-hr average concentration a 3% higher in Madrid and a 24% in Barcelona respect to the base case). The selected domains present a similar behavior with respect to their impacts, with a noticeable reduction of ground-level IO x in downtown areas and an increase in the tropospheric ozone concentration in the VOC-limited areas. In downwind locations the precursors' emissions control causes a reduction of O3 levels. The air quality modeling system proves to be a suitable and useful tool to manage urban air quality, especially when applied with this high resolution.","Air quality modelling; Hydrid electric vehicles; Management; Tropospheric ozone; Urban air quality","air quality; automobile; conference proceeding; emission control; metropolitan area; modeling; ozone; traffic emission; Barcelona [Barcelona (PRV)]; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Eurasia; Europe; Madrid [Madrid (ADS/PRV)]; Madrid [Spain]; Southern Europe; Spain; Hydrida",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56349084295

Nowadays, one of the strategies to reduce emissions is based on the substitution of vehicles by introducing new technologies (e.g. cleaner fuels, hybrid vehicles, fuel cells, etc.). This work assesses the variation on air quality due to the substitution of specific vehicle fleets by natural gas vehicles in the two largest cities of Spain: Barcelona and Madrid. Six different scenarios are studied, focusing on the total or partial modification of public transportation vehicles (buses, taxis), freight vehicles and private vehicles. One scenario involving a combination of all of them is also studied. Under this perspective, the WRF/HERMES/CMAQ modelling system has been implemented and validated with a high resolution (1 km and 1 hour) in the area thanks to the calculation power of the MareNostrum super-computer of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (94.21 TFlops peak). Daily average concentrations of NO2, SO2 and PM, both PM10 and PM2.5, and 8-hour average concentration for O3 and 1-hour maximum concentrations for these species are estimated both in Barcelona and Madrid Greater Areas. All the scenarios studied involve a reduction in NO2, SO2 and PM concentrations. Most important changes in air quality are registered when the combined scenario is implemented. Ozone concentrations remain approximately in the same levels as in the base case scenario, except for some VOC-limited areas where the reduction of NOx involves a slight O3 increase (under the 10%). A large reduction in PM concentration is observed for both cities when the 50% of commercial light vehicles is transformed. Results of the simulations for the combined scenario indicate that it is particularly effective in reducing PM10 (up to –43% in maximum hourly concentration at some points) and PM2.5 (up to –36%). © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2008.","Air quality modelling; Alternative fuels; Emissions; Natural gas vehicles; Urban pollution management",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051694822

Such near zero sulfur emission legislation requires a high efficiency of the hydro(desulphurization) technology particularly for upgrading of heavy oils and residua. In order to achieve this goal a better understanding of the Ni and/or Co promoter effect on Mo and/or W is strongly required. Trimetallic (NiCoMo and NiCoW) and bimetallic (NiMo, NiW and CoMo) HDS catalyst precursors were prepared by urea-matrix combustion method. The oxidic and sulfided states of the HDS catalysts were characterized by laser Raman spectroscopy (LRS) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Catalyst performance was evaluated using a tubular fixed-bed reactor and the hydrodesulfurization of thiophene under normal pressure as model reaction. The addition of Co (or Ni) on Mo (or W) strongly improved the HDS behavior. However, the addition of Co-Ni on Mo and/or W hindered the HDS performance. This latter effect is attributed to the formation of Ni-Co-S rather than Ni(Co)-Mo(W)-S phase. Urea-matrix combustion method facilitates the formation of well-dispersed oxidic precursors on the alumina surface. This is reflected in a strong synergistic effect that markedly increases the C-S bond cleavage reaction whereas a less pronounced antagonistic effect affects the relative rate of hydrogen transfer reactions.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955609554

Individual patients with type 2 diabetes show large differences regarding the relative contribution of insulin resistance or insulin deficiency to the diabetic state. Also, the deterioration of β-cell function varies. When β-cell mass could be measured in vivo in humans, the effects of different diabetes treatments on -cell mass could be studied and result in a more individually-tailored therapy, based on the principle underlying defect. Furthermore, quantification of β-cell mass could be used for monitoring in patients with diabetes type 1 undergoing islet transplantation. Recently, new strategies for imaging of -cell in vivo have been developed. For imaging of transplanted β-cell in vivo, the β-cells can be preloaded with superparamagnetic iron-oxide particles. By this approach, magnetic resonance imaging of β-cell mass was possible in mice. For imaging of pancreatic β-cells, radiolabeled tracers are preferable due to their high sensitivity.

Using highly idealized examples two measures of day-to-day variability were compared. It was found that standard deviation works well to characterize variability for random climates, as expected, but did not perform well for orderly and oscillatory climates. For these climates, a more direct calculation of day-to-day variability was found to be more representative. This method better captures the clustering of temperatures that may result from a number of meteorological and geographic factors which bring order to the local climate. These concepts were applied to two Canadian cities, Toronto, Ontario and Calgary, Alberta. Both cities were found to have a degree of orderliness in their climate. Toronto's orderliness appears to be linked to the temperature mitigating effect of a moister climate and midlatitude cyclones. In addition, the proximity of Lake Ontario produces land/sea breezes which act to reduce thermal variability. Calgary experienced more variability, both on average and in the exceedances of 5 °C and 10 °C thresholds for day-to-day temperature swings. This is a result of a drier climate with less hydro-climatic inertia and the presence of chinook winds which produce, particularly in winter, swings of temperature frequently exceeding 10 °C. Although all the measures of day-to-day temperature variability examined appear to be decreasing in both cities, only the decrease of 5 °C exceedances of Tmin at Toronto was statistically significant. © Springer-Verlag 2008.",,"air temperature; climate oscillation; cluster analysis; numerical method; temperature effect; temperature gradient; Alberta; Calgary; Canada; Great Lakes [North America]; Lake Ontario; North America; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51749116937

The electrical conductivity of nitrocellulose extending from insulator to metal behavior distinctly changes by orders of magnitude via vacuum heat treatment at temperatures ranging from 600 to 1,000° C.

The U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and scientific academies of 10 leading nations have all confirmed that human activity, especially the burning of fossil fuels, is a major driver of this warming trend. In the context of an international budget on carbon emissions, the United States should reduce its emissions at least 80 percent below 2000 levels by 2050. In order to reach such dramatic reductions, changes must begin immediately - the costs of delay are high. This presentation will assess the potential of energy efficiency and various alternative energy sources to play a role in these reductions. It is critical to look at the technological feasibility and the overall state of the industries for all of our energy options. From there what is possible depends on the economic and political picture that will frame decision making both now and into the future. What are some major obstacles that exist as the nation aims for these significant reductions? Are there political and economic options for overcoming those obstacles? What role should future technologies like clean coal and advanced nuclear play as they try to stake a claim as well?

The airport industry has shifted from public to private sector ownership over the last twenty years as a result of new policy directions initiated by the desire of the 1980s conservative government to privatize public utilities. At the same time, air traffic growth has been strong, encouraged by a more liberal environment and in particular by the emergence of low-cost carriers (LCCs). Moreover, throughout this period there have been pressures on capacity at airports in London and the southeast of England, especially at Heathrow, and these pressures have had a major impact on the development of the U.K. airport industry. Today the U.K. government has very limited influence over the air transport sector through ownership-the airline industry is entirely private and the airport industry is now mainly private. The only remaining limited control lies with en route air traffic control, which is provided by a mixed public-private organization that took over from a public agency in 2001. Therefore the main ways in which the government can influence the U.K. airport industry are through the planning system and regulation. Three other sets of policies that affect the airport industry are not considered directly in this chapter. The first set is the U.K., European, and international policy measures designed to mitigate the environmental impacts of aviation, such as local regulations regarding air quality and noise, and possible wider controls related to climate change and emissions. These policies clearly have a major impact on the planning process and are likely to have an increasing influence over future traffic volumes and costs of the industry. The second set of policies affects the use of existing capacity, such as the current slot allocation system and the lack of a transparent secondary market. Third are the bilateral restrictions on U.K. airlines for services outside of Europe. As background, this chapter begins by considering the nature and traffic characteristics of the airport industry in the United Kingdom. It then reviews the U.K. airport policy and planning framework and discusses the ownership structure and regulatory regime of the airports. This leads to an assessment of the effectiveness of the planning, regulatory, and ownership system, and to the implications of making changes to this system. The paper concludes that the planning process is too long and needs to be shortened and that the regulatory regime has produced economic distortions that need to be corrected. The chapter is also critical of the structure of the BAA airport group, formerly the British Airports Authority, which was set up when privatization occurred and economic regulation was introduced. In short, it is argued that the regulatory and industry structure that was established twenty years ago is now outdated and in need of a full-scale, coordinated review.

Fiji consists of 332 islands and thus has a predominant and large coastline. Viti Levu is the largest and most important of the islands, harboring Fiji's capital city and most of the major towns concentrated around its coast. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the extent of possible sea-level rise using GIS, and to identify high-risk locations. Potential sea level rise was shown graphically as an output to determine where inundation or flooding would take place. This analysis allowed important areas facing risk to be highlighted for future action. Flooding/inundation can be classified into two kinds: 'permanent inundation', which is the result of sea-level rise with tide; and 'temporary flooding', also including occasional storm surge events. The inundated area was displayed under different projections and quantified. The results produced output maps showing the distribution of inundation/ flooding around the island of Viti Levu as well as the extent of flooding. Six scenarios for sea-level rise were used (0.09, 0.18, 0.48, 0.50, 0.59, 0.88 m). Six scenarios for storm surge were used with return intervals of 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 years. High risk and priority locations are identified as Fiji's capital Suva, the major tourist center and arrival port of Nadi, and Fiji's second city Lautoka. Future action, adaptation and response strategies in these identified locations must occur to reduce risk from climate change. © Integrated Research System for Sustainability Science and Springer 2008.","Climate change Fiji; GIS; Risk; Sea-level rise; Vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56049114895

York Region is comprised of nine local municipalities with a population approaching 1 million at the end of 2007. The Regional government has recently embraced a number of growth management and planning initiatives with the goal of becoming more sustainable and reducing the Region's carbon footprint. This is being achieved through improved Regional transit services, aggressive transportation demand management and the development of a regional scale pedestrian system and cycling network. York Region Council formally adopted the PCMP in April 2008. The Plan is intended to guide the Region as it works with local municipalities over the next 25 years to implement a comprehensive pedestrian system and region-wide cycling network. The PCMP also includes facility design guidelines as well as supporting policies and programs to encourage walking and cycling in the Region. Developing a pedestrian and cycling plan for the Region involved several unique challenges, such as the need to develop a regional scale network that can connect to existing and previously proposed local municipal networks. Opportunities were identified and capitalized upon to integrate pedestrian and cycling facilities with Regional transit, leveraging synergies with local municipalities and other stakeholders, and coordinating pedestrian and cycling infrastructure projects with Regional road construction projects. The PCMP concludes with a series of recommendations that address the opportunities and challenges identified through the study. Some of the key recommendations include: • Implementing a comprehensive outreach program and other initiatives aimed at educating the public and promoting active transportation; • Establishing an inter-municipal working group to coordinate between the Region, local municipalities and other stakeholders; • Establishing a Pedestrian/Cycling Coordinator staff position at the Region to manage and guide the implementation of the PCMP; • Adopting a 10-year Implementation Plan, which coincides with the Region's 10-year Capital Roads Program to pursue opportunities to incorporate pedestrian and cycling infrastructure with scheduled road projects; • Adopting the Municipal Partnership Program, an unprecedented initiative whereby York Region shares up to 50% of construction costs for qualifying local municipal pedestrian and cycling infrastructure projects that are consistent with the Region's PCMP; • Establishing the ""Lake-to-Lake Route"" through York Region, a major cycling destination linking Lake Simcoe at the north end of York Region to Lake Ontario at the south end via cycling routes through the City of Toronto; and • Applying detailed Planning and Design Guidelines, developed as part of the PCMP. Implementation of several elements of the Plan has already begun, and this paper includes a discussion of the preliminary evaluation of these initiatives and how they may be improved in the future.",,"Carbon footprint; Design; Lakes; Active transportations; Construction projects; Infrastructure project; Municipal networks; Partnership programs; Regional government; Supporting policies; Transportation demand management; Transportation routes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896674365

Planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) of the OH radical is used to examine the flame structure within the combustor. Tunable diode laser-based absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) is used to measure water vapor concentration and static temperature near the combustor exit. Combined with conventional measurements and Reynolds-averaged CFD simulations, these optical diagnostic techniques significantly enhance the information that is obtained from the scramjet combustor. In this study, wall pressure data show the combustor to be operating in dual-mode with two regions of elevated pressure corresponding to the primary and secondary flameholding zones. The OH radical is well-distributed across the combustor with high OH concentrations occurring along the body, side, and cowl walls. TDLAS measurements indicate non-uniform body-to-cowl profiles in both temperature and water concentration. Near-wall regions are found to be the hottest while the core region is cooler. Similarly, the highest concentrations of water vapor are found near the walls.

Past eigen-based regionalization studies have relied on rain gauge networks, which is restrictive because rain gauge coverage is sparse, especially over complex terrain that exists in the western United States. Here, the use of alternate data products is examined by conducting a comparative regionalization using nine precipitation datasets used in hydrometeorological research. Five unique precipitation climates are identified within the western United States, which have centers and boundaries that are physically reasonable and that highlight the relationship between the precipitation climatology and local topography. Using the congruence coefficient as the measure of similarity between principal component solutions, the method is found to be generally stable across datasets. The exception is the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-Department of Energy (NCEP-DOE) Reanalysis 2, which frequently demonstrates only borderline agreement with the other datasets. The loading pattern differences among datasets are shown to be primarily a result of data differences in the representation of (i) precipitation over the Rocky Mountains, (ii) the eastward wet-to-dry precipitation gradient that occurs during the cold season, (iii) the magnitude and spatial extent of the North American monsoon signal, and (iv) precipitation in the desert southwest during spring and summer. Sensitivity tests were conducted to determine whether the spatial resolution and temporal domain of the input data would dramatically affect the solution, and these results show the methodology to be stable to differences in spatial/temporal data features. The results suggest that alternate data products can be used in regionalization studies, which has applications for rain gauge installation and planning, climate research, and numerical modeling experiments. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"comparative study; data set; precipitation assessment; principal component analysis; sensitivity analysis; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049101827

Examples of traditional contaminants include sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), hydrogen sulfide, particulate matter, smoke, and haze. This list of air pollutants can be subdivided into pollutants that are gases or particulates. Mobile source emissions are the largest contributor to urban emission inventories in many locations. Ambient air quality standards have become increasingly stringent, and it is important to understand the role of mobile source emissions on air quality through well-designed studies. High air pollution load in Turkey metropolitan cities like Istanbul, Izmir, Ankara, etc. has been a major leading to factor towards lowering the ambient air quality day by day. The lowering of air quality is a main environmental problem that affects many urban and industrial sites and the surrounding regions. Onroad vehicles are responsible for a significant and rapidly increasing portion of the air pollution in the urban areas of developing nations.Second by second emissions of CO, CO2, HC, and NOx were measured in case study. Geographical Information System (GIS) is a computer based information system that enables capturing, modeling, manipulation, retrieval, analysis, and presentation of geographically referenced data. In this study, In order to compare measurements from the different vehicles, second by second vehicle speed and road altitude data was collected using GPS technology simultaneous with the emissions measurement. It is possible to analyze that increasing emission which various of vehicles sent out environment with GIS. The analysis of the amount of emission depending on the changes of the slopes, calculation of gases spread into air depending on traffic jam, the analysis of the amount of emission depending on the route selected in the city were applied. © 2008 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

Atmospheric submicrometre particles have a significant impact on human health, visibility impairment, acid deposition and global climate. This study aims to understand the size distribution of submicrometre particles and new particle formation in eastern Australia and the results indicate that photochemical reactions of airborne pollutants are the main mechanism of new particle formation. The findings will contribute to a better understanding of the effects of aerosols on climate and the reduction of submicrometre particles in the atmosphere. Abstract. An intensive measurement campaign of particle concentrations, nitrogen oxides and meteorological parameters was conducted at a rural site in subtropical eastern Australia during September 2006. The aim of this work was to develop an understanding of the formation and growth processes of atmospheric aerosols, and the size distributions under various meteorological conditions. In order to achieve this, the origins of air arriving at the site were explored using back trajectories cluster analysis and the diurnal patterns of particle number concentration and size distribution for the classified air masses were investigated. The study showed that the photochemical formation of nucleation mode particles and their consequent growth was often observed. Furthermore, the nucleation mode usually dominated the size distribution and concentration of the photochemical event in the first 34 h with a geometric mean diameter of 26.9 nm and a geometric standard deviation of 1.28. The average particle growth rate was estimated to be 1.6 nm h-1, which is lower than that observed at urban sites, but comparable to the values reported in clean environments. The potential precursors of the photochemical events are also discussed. © CSIRO 2008.","Back trajectory; Particle growth rate; Particle size distribution; Photochemical event.","aerosol formation; air mass; atmospheric pollution; cluster analysis; nitrogen oxides; nucleation; photochemistry; size distribution; subtropical region; trajectory; Australasia; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57849105980

The author has been part of both the initiatives. A GIS-based DECoRuM® (domestic energy, carbon-counting and carbon-reduction model) model has been developed, demonstrated and validated by implementing in existing dwellings in Oxford. It was implemented to estimate and map baseline energy use and CO2 emissions on a house-by-house level, identify pollution hotspots, predict the potential for reductions in CO2 emissions and monitor reductions achieved as a result of deploying energy efficiency measures and renewable energy systems. Area-based carbon emission reductions will require concerted action by all sectors of the community. In fact most of the measures required to reduce CO2 emissions will be implemented at the city level, working with city councils since they have the ability to make communities more energy efficient by using their influence over the community and existing statutory powers. A GIS-based CO2 model extended to the whole of Oxford would enable the City Council to track progress and assess the emission reductions achieved. Therefore, work on building the GIS CO2 model should be commissioned as soon as possible. Undoubtedly, these experiences from Oxford provide a useful example for other cities in their endeavor for emission reductions. But importantly these initiatives also make the case for all to do their bit as urban city dwellers, since the delivery of emissions reductions would require a partnership approach across a city, with all sectors including individuals fully engaged in taking forward an agreed action plan. © 2008 Copyright © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The X-ray variabilities in the higher-flux states are well explained by the combination of a variable, direct power law and a temporally stable, absorbed component. In low-flux states, however, spectral variations are mainly due to flux changes of the absorbed component. Furthermore, when the source enters into the lowest-flux state, the absorbed component no longer appears. One promising interpretation is that part of the central emission region is covered by a temporally stable material, while the size of the emission region varies so as to produce a flux variation predominantly in direct power-law component. Once the emission region becomes smaller than the size of the absorber, however, the absorbed flux also begins to decrease.

The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO 2 emissions, is vital to the continued success of coal-fired power generation in a marketplace that is expected to demand near-zero emissions in the near future. Oxycombustion is a technology option that uses pure oxygen, and recycled flue gas, to fire the coal. As a result, this system eliminates the introduction of nitrogen, which enters the combustion process in the air, and produces a highly-concentrated stream of CO 2 that can readily be captured and sequestered at a lower cost than competing post-combustion capture technologies. Oxycombustion can be applied to a variety of coal-fired technologies, including supercritical and ultra-supercritical pulverized coal boilers. The incorporation of oxycombustion technology in these systems raises some new technical challenges, especially in the area of advanced boiler materials. Local microclimates generated near and at the metal interface will influence and ultimately govern corrosion. In addition, the fireside corrosion rates of the boiler tube materials may be increased under high concentration oxygen firing, due to hotter burning coal particles and higher concentrations of SO 2, H 2S, HCl and ash alkali, etc. There is also potential to experience new fouling characteristics in the superheater and heat recovery sections of the steam generator. The continuous recirculation of the flue gases in the boiler, may lead to increasing concentrations of deleterious elements such as sulfur, chlorine, and moisture. This paper identifies the materials considerations of oxycombustion supercritical and ultra-supercritical pulverized coal plants that must be addressed for an oxycombustion power plant design.

Even considering the above practices, the success rate of acquiring representative pressure tests is limited, since formation artifacts such as sanding, washouts, or supercharging when testing in very tight formations can lead to misinterpretation. Today, many aging oil and gas fields are being redeveloped to target remaining hydrocarbon. Formation pressure, fluid gradients and the determination of whether or not compartments are in communication are important information when analyzing such a reservoir. This paper discusses an approach that facilitates understanding the above challenges while drilling, even in difficult environments. A smart test function reduces storage and shock effects while drawing down on tight formations, but also avoids sanding in ghly unconsolidated formations. Performing self-learning, optimized test sequences improve the accuracy of the pressure and mobility data and lead to higher operating efficiency. The operator cost efficiencies of acquiring valid formation pressure data while drilling are becoming more influential in deciding the value proposition of a wireline reservoir characterization program. Cost efficiencies may indeed be pivotal but importantly, the benefit of acquiring accurate pressure data in real time warrants equal consideration, as a number of novel applications now exist. Case histories and recent improvements, such as testing on wired pipe or longer test times, are included in this paper and demonstrate the applicability to conventional formation pressure applications, such as compartmentalization evaluation or fluid gradient analysis, traditionally acquired with wireline formation testers. Benefits for drilling and subsurface teams, such as mud-weight (MW) management, safe selection of casing points, calibr ion of pore pressure predictions, selection of wireline sampling points, reservoir monitoring, geo-steering, and obtaining data in high-risk wells, are equally important and the reasons why LWD formation testing becomes a cross-functional discipline.

Furthermore, reality frequently overtakes ongoing planning. These circumstances are especially severe for the urban planning of mega cities, where sustainability must be in the focus of interest for several reasons. ""Green lungs"", as one example supporting sustainability within urban environments enhance the functionality of cities to balance humidity locally, to shade buildings and sites and to enable public recreation as well as to reduce air pollution directly and indirectly. This quantitatively and qualitatively less explored branch of urban design requires complex and time consuming modeling tasks even on a master planning scope. In this paper we describe a novel method to create sustainable urban vegetation designs automatically as a kind of early simulation step, which can be used as a guideline for following master planning tasks of high-density urban environments. We had formalized sustainability criteria available in current planning knowledge into CGA shape grammar, which had been introduced by [1]. Additionally, we extended these urban planning rule sets with defined urban landscape patterns. We use these patterns with a procedurally model rule-based distribution and placement of vegetation as well as landscape objects to generate sustainable urban environments. We also show how to use a shape grammar in combination with procedural methods that iteratively develop an urban design, automatically creating more and more details in order to plan sustainable cities more effectively. We link the use of patterns [2] and the design possibilities of shape grammars to plan sustainable design. As results, we present the simulated master plans of different sustainable urban environments in different climates. This paper evolves out of a recent paper [3] of the authors with a strong similarity in section 1-5.

The potential coal seams for methane production in Australia are found in coal zones that are Jurassic to Permian in age with coal ranks ranging from sub-bituminous to low volatile bituminous coals. Many Australian coal seams contain high volumes of methane gas upto 25 m per tonne. Australia began producing CBM in 1988 but it was not until 1996 when the commercial CBM production started in the state of Queensland. Australia has total CBM reserves of about 300 to 500 Tcf (8.6 to 14.3 trillion m With the total amount of CBM in-place reserves worldwide estimated to be between 3,500 and 95,000 Tcf (100 and 272 trillion m CBM is considered one of the world's largest sources of fossil fuel. In the United States, the total CBM in-place reserves are estimated at 749 Tcf (21.4 trillion m and CBM now represents almost 10% of its domestic natural gas production. Canada has just begun producing gas from CBM reservoirs and its estimated in-place CBM reserves are about 1,300 Tcf (37 trillion m In Australia, as CBM is seen as a clean and pipeline- quality energy, it is rapidly developing. Along with the large CBM resource, the main drivers for this move are the continuously reducing cost of coal seam gas production, and the depleting conventional energy resources. A number of sophisticated CBM reservoir simulation and exploitation tools have been devetoped by the University of New South Wales and CSIRO to simulate the conventional CBM production as well as the CBM recovery using multi-component gases. In the field, Australia looks 1:oward enhancing CBM recovery by injecting nftrogen and or carbon dioxide to increase CBM extraction.

This offers room for improvement in requirements within the EPBD-set, overall building performance and on building components. Designing on the basis of performance requirements that were defined when energy prices were less than a quarter of today's price, means that we are wasting money now and will continue to do so until the next building renovation. The minimum requirements for thermal performance of a building should reflect the average energy price for the estimated lifetime of the building. For 100 European cities Eurima, the European Insulation Manufacturers Association, has quantified the gap between the required or recommended U-value and the economically optimum U-value. This gap in U-values means loss of money for society, for the building owner and the building occupant. The Eurima study: ""U-values for better energy performance of buildings"" leads to the following conclusions: • Once the cost savings for heating and cooling energy exceed the total investment costs for insulation measures, the optimum U-value (insulation thickness) is the same for new and existing buildings, as long as no technical limitations occur. In this sense the recommended U-values apply to new and existing buildings. • Different argumentations, both for cost effectiveness and in the climate protection approach, result in comparable maximum U-values. This means that climate protection and cost efficiency are not contradictory and may well be combined. • Recommended maximum U-values resulting from the analyses based on cost-efficiency and possible Post Kyoto targets are in most cases more ambitious than current national standards, offering room for improvement of requirements. • In residential buildings of southern Europe thermal insulation also reduces the energy demand for cooling. This is especially true for roof and wall insulation which combined with proper shading and a good ventilation strategy provides very robust and considerable savings. It is also true that a wellbalanced package of floor, wall and roof-insulation measures results in a significant and cost effective reduction in the energy demand for heating and cooling.","Component requirements; Cost efficiency; Energy regulations; Optimum values; U-values","Buildings; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy policy; Insulation; Investments; Roofs; Walls (structural partitions); Component requirements; Cost efficiency; Energy regulation; Optimum value; U-values; Cost benefit analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067709589

Few studies have examined this, and past results are variable, which may be due to methodological variation. To address this, we grew two C3 and two C4 species at current or elevated CO2 and three different growth temperatures (GT). We assessed photosynthetic thermotolerance in both unacclimated (basal tolerance) and pre-heat-stressed (preHS = acclimated) plants. In C3 species, basal thermotolerance of net photosynthesis (Pn) was increased in high CO2, but in C4 species, P n thermotlerance was decreased by high CO2 (except Zea mays at low GT); CO2 effects in preHS plants were mostly small or absent, though high CO2 was detrimental in one C3 and one C4 species at warmer GT. Though high CO2 generally decreased stomatal conductance, decreases in Pn during heat stress were mostly due to non-stomatal effects. Photosystem II (PSII) efficiency was often decreased by high CO2 during heat stress, especially at high GT; CO2 effects on post-PSII electron transport were variable. Thus, high CO2 often affected photosynthetic theromotolerance, and the effects varied with photosynthetic pathway, growth temperature, and acclimation state. Most importantly, in heat-stressed plants at normal or warmer growth temperatures, high CO2 may often decrease, or not benefit as expected, tolerance of photosynthesis to acute heat stress. Therefore, interactive effects of elevated CO2 and warmer growth temperatures on acute heat tolerance may contribute to future changes in plant productivity, distribution, and diversity. © 2008 Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Carbon dioxide; Global climate change; Photosynthesis; Thermotolerance","carbon dioxide; acclimation; carbon dioxide; environmental stress; global change; global warming; growth rate; photosynthesis; temperature tolerance; Amaranthus; article; Chenopodium album; drug effect; electron transport; evapotranspiration; maize; metabolism; pea; photosynthesis; physiology; plant; temperature; Amaranthus; Carbon Dioxide; Chenopodium album; Electron Transport; Peas; Photosynthesis; Plant Transpiration; Plants; Temperature; Zea mays; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55049108566

Generating electricity from tidal range of the Severn Estuary has the potential to generate some 5% of UK electricity from a renewable indigenous resource. A study is underway to: • Assess in broad terms the costs, benefits and impact of a project to generate power from the tidal range of the Severn Estuary, including environmental, social, regional, economic, and energy market impacts; • Identify a single preferred tidal range project (which may be a single technology/location or a combination of these) from the number of options that have been proposed; • Consider what measures the Government could put in place to bring forward a project that fulfils regulatory requirements, and the steps that are necessary to achieve this; and • Decide, in the context of the Government's energy and climate change goals and the alternative options for achieving these, and after public consultation, whether the Government could support a tidal power project in the Severn Estuary and on what terms. The study is expected to last roughly two years (until January 2010). Under consideration is tidal range, including barrages, lagoons and other technologies, and includes a Strategic Environmental Assessment of plans for generating electricity from the Severn Estuary tidal range to ensure a detailed understanding of its environmental resource recognising the nature conservation significance of the Estuary. The scheme would use proven technology of a hydroelectric dam but filled by the incoming tide rather than by water flowing downstream.

At the same time, by using O2 as final electron acceptor, early heterotrophs could obtain more energy from reduced carbon and attain faster growth. However, fast growing aerobes were made more dependent on the availability of reduced carbon. In the fight for food, microorganisms colonized different niches including other organisms, which they parasitized or ate. With time, life-damaging ROS became signals used by cells to regulate growth and proliferation, cell differentiation and cell death. We have proposed that cell differentiation is a response to oxidative stress. In different eukaryotic microorganisms, the presence of ROS and the induction of antioxidant mechanisms are associated with development. Moreover, the superoxide-producing NADPH-oxidases proved essential for some developmental processes. The small GTPase RAS-1 also regulates the production of ROS and different mutations in the corresponding gene affect cell differentiation. The process of asexual reproduction (conidiation) in Neurospora crassa involves three morphogenetic transitions, each preceded by a hyperoxidant state. An accentuated redox imbalance, the oxidation and degradation of oxidized protein, oxidative inactivation of different enzyme activities, and increased production of ROS characterize the hyperoxidant state. Null mutants in catalase genes show increased levels of development. Strains without superoxide dismutase express a conidiation rhythm, similar to the ""band"" strain, which contains a semi-dominant ras-1 mutation. Mutation of NADPH-oxidase genes reduced or completely abolished different developmental processes. Together, these results support our view on cell differentiation as a response to oxidative stress. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48949105781

For each driving cycle, the following influences on vehicle fuel economy were examined: power-to-weight ratio, HCCI combustion mode operating range, driving cycle characteristics, requirements for transitions out of HCCI mode when engine speeds and loads are within the HCCI operating range, fuel consumption and emissions penalties for transitions into and out of HCCI mode, aftertreatment system performance and tailpipe emissions regulations. A key result of this work is that development priorities for attaining maximum fuel economy during urban driving cycles in the U.S. and Europe differ greatly due to the emissions regulations.

Even the most optimistic assessment of action to limit greenhouse pollution in the coming few decades will not prevent calamitous changes in Earth's climate. Arguments for international - that is, inter state - justice that have permeated international negotiations on climate change have been insufficient in fostering robust action by states. Indeed, by diverting all responsibility to states, focusing on international justice has not addressed consumption and pollution by hundreds of millions of affluent people around the world, including many millions living within developing states that have no treaty obligations to limit nationwide pollution. Increasingly, however, it is these individuals that matter: More and more of them who are not now subject to any climate-related legal obligations are able to afford lifestyles that lead to greenhouse gas emissions and more climate change. This is especially true given the very rapid increase in the numbers of affluent people in the developing world. Bearing this in mind, this article goes beyond the still important questions of international climate justice to explore cosmopolitan or global climate justice.

In 2003, the United States consumed roughly 84.3 billion m3 (7.6 billion kilograms) of hydrogen, the majority of which was produced via the widely established thermal process known as steam methane reforming (SMR). The electrolytic production of hydrogen, while not economically competitive today with SMR, is positioned to become the preferred method due to the inevitable price increase of natural gas and as environmental, social, and economic factors are weighed. SMR constitutes roughly 50% of the 450-500 billion m3 yr-1 (38-42 billion kg yr-1) of global production of the gas. SMR, like hydrogen production from all fossil fuels, suffers from supply issues and climate-altering carbon-based pollution. The reforming process generates CO 2 as well as carbon monoxide (CO), which is poisonous to humans because the oxygen-transporting hemoglobin has 200 times the affinity to CO than O Electrolysis currently supplies roughly 4% of the world's hydrogen. If hydrogen is to be used as a transportation fuel, the United State could conceivably replace the 140 billion gallons per year (gal yr-1) of gasoline consumed in 2004 with domestically produced hydrogen. The energy equivalent of this much gasoline is 17.3 × 1015 BTU, assuming approximately 5.2 million BTU bbl-1 of motor gasoline.4 The environmental gains hoped for by the transition to a hydrogen economy can only be achieved when renewable sources are ramped up to produce an increasing amount of the hydrogen gas. From the early 1800s to the mid 1900s town gas was comprised of roughly 50% hydrogen that brought light and heat to much of America and Europe and can still be found in some parts of Europe, China and Asia. Due to hydrogen's thermal conductivity and low density the gas is being used to cool many large thermal electrical power generators. Hydrogen is used in a wide variety of applications: • Chemicals-Ammonia and fertilizer manufacture-Synthesis of methanol-Sorbitol production-General pharmaceuticals and vitamins • Electronics-Polysilicon production-Epitaxial deposition-Fiber optics • Metals-Annealing/heat treating-Powder metallurgy • Fuels-Petroleum refinement-Liquid rocket fuel-Some use in fuel cells • Food and float glass-Fats/fatty acids-Blanketing Renewable sources of electricity and off-peak hydroelectric can be used to produce a sustainable supply of hydrogen for transportation, peak-shaving applications and in some special cases to smooth the variability in the renewable source. Powering millions of hydrogen internal combustion engines and/or fuel cell vehicles with hydrogen generated with traditional fossil fuel sources (without carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage or geological sequestration) is merely transferring the pollution from the tailpipe to the stack pipe. In the case of SMR, liquid natural gas imports would increase to replace today's 12.9 million bbl day-1 of oil imports here in the U.S.4. As developing countries fall in love with motorized transportation, much like the developed countries already have, transportation's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions will grow from the 25% it holds today. Still today, the electrolytic production of hydrogen using renewable sources is the only way to produce large quantities of hydrogen without emitting the traditional byproducts associated with fossil-fuels. The electrolysis of water is an electrochemical reaction requiring no moving parts and a direct electric current, making it one of the simplest ways to produce hydrogen. The electrochemical decomposition of water into its two constituent parts has been shown to be reliable, clean and with the removal of water vapor from the product capable of producing ultra-pure hydrogen (&gt; 99.999%). The primary disadvantage of electrolysis is the requirement of high-quality of electrical energy needed to disassociate the gas. Electricity is a convenient energy carrier as it can be transported to loads relatively easily. However, locating and constructing new transmission and distribution power lines is challenging and expensive. The cost of transporting electricity along power lines can constitute greater than 50% of the total cost at the point of end-use. Historically, hydrogen production via electrolysis has only been viable where large amounts of inexpensive electricity have been available or the high purity product gas was necessary in a downstream process. The potential environmental benefit of a hydrogen-based economy is hinged to a large degree on the ability to generate the gas from renewable resources in a costeffective manner. An apparently ideal solution is to use wind-generated electricity to electrolyze water. Today, hydrogen production via electrolysis only meets the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) goals of $2-$3 per kilogram (kg) in large installations where electrolyzer capital costs are low, less than $800 per kilowatt (kW), and those having access to inexpensive electricity, less than $0.04 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Electricity from large-scale wind farms in Class 4 or better resource can be generated in the range of $0.05-$0.08 kWh-1, not including today's $0.019 kWh-1 Federal production tax credit. The out-of-pocket cost of fossil-fuels, whether for electricity production or as transportation fuels, has remained relatively low; limiting the expansion of renewable forms of energy. For example, if the external costs of production were taken into account the cost of coal-generated electricity would rise an additional $0.03-$0.06 kWh-1. Further limiting market penetration of renewable sources is that fossil fuels continue to receive the bulk of tax incentives here in the U.S. The term renewable defines these technologies as driven by natural and sustainable processes which are inherently variable, not intermittent. Natural processes vary over time but are not subject to the on-off switching that, for example, a light bulb connected to a switch is subjected to. Advocates may want to begin training themselves to describe RE as variable, not intermittent, to better describe their naturally occurring behavior. RE sources of energy can provide cost-effective, emission-free electricity with zero-or low-carbon impact making it one of the preferred methods for supplying energy to society. The large-scale wind energy facilities being installed throughout the world are a testament to the growing demand, environmentally preferred and cost-effectiveness of this RE technology.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053464776

Then, provided the policies are effective, such insurance can be justified as a precautionary or minimax response. Even if the policies are potentially ineffective however, intervention can be justified as an attempt to minimise the regret experienced by future generations. This reasoning extends to justify 'all weather' policies provided such policies always reduce policy costs. If, however, policy decisions provide 'all weather' benefits in only certain states of the world, this rationale breaks down. Minimising regret can establish a case for 'mixed' policy responses provided adopting a policy mix precludes the chance that intervention will fail altogether.

At the same time, the rapid rise in mobility brings enormous challenges for the environment and infrastructure. There arc, therefore, areas of action in the powertrain technology sector that clearly put the focus on further enhanced efficiency and emissions reduction, the incorporation of alternative energy sources and the regional optimization of powertrain technology. A good example of this is the success story of the diesel engine, which now has a market share of around 50% in Western Europe and has become established in all classes, from the small car through to the luxury vehicle. Volkswagen's successful TDI technology combines maximum driving pleasure with low fuel consumption. To comply with future emissions legislation, intensive efforts arc required to place new technologies for exhaust treatment together with process enhancements on a solid financial footing. In terms of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, Volkswagen has applied the success story of the TDI - with its turbocharged direct-injection powerplants - to petrol engines, too. Turbocharged FSI technology made its debut, for example, in the Audi R8 racing car back in the year 2000. A broad initiative to optimise the driveline naturally also incorporates transmission technology that has been carefully matched to the new engines. The Volkswagen Group's dual-clutch technology combines the comfort and convenience of conventional automatic transmissions with the spottiness and superior efficiency of manual transmissions. The move away from oil is one of society's greatest challenges for the 21 thcentury. For the automotive industry, this means working at full speed on the development of alternative and regenerative energy sources as well as new ultra-efficient powertrain concepts; however, the rapidly increasing pressure to reduce CO 2 emissions requires swift action. An important alternative to conventional powertrains and fossil fuels is the use of renewable raw materials, particularly second-generation biofuels. The Volkswagen fuel and powertrain strategy documents the gradual move away from the fossil fuel age towards a regenerative fuel era. Yet the sustainability-oriented powertrain strategy is not only concerned with improvements to conventional combustion engines and regenerative fuels, but also with alternative powertrain systems. Development scenarios for regional markets already indicate that specific requirements will lead to substantial diversification in future with regard to powertrain systems and fuels. In a long-term context, though, we anticipate electric powertrains. Apart from the familiar micro, mild and full hybrids, this term also covers purely electric drives and vehicles powered by fuel cells. 1394.","Alternative powertrains; Electrification; Mobility; Powertrain technology; Sustainability","Alternative energy source; Automatic transmission; CO2 emissions; Conventional combustions; Development scenarios; Drivelines; Economic development; Electrification; Emerging markets; Emissions legislation; Emissions reduction; Enhanced efficiency; Individual mobility; Low fuel consumption; Luxury vehicles; Manual transmissions; Market share; Petrol engine; Power-train systems; Regenerative energy sources; Regional markets; Renewable raw materials; Small cars; Technology sectors; Transmission technologies; Volkswagen; Volkswagen groups; Western Europe; Automobile engines; Automotive industry; Carbon dioxide; Carrier mobility; Competition; Diesel engines; Electric drives; Electric utilities; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuels; Sustainable development; Technology; Vehicles; Powertrains",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866086152

The main objectives of the study were to examine the emissions, performance, and combustion characteristics of the engine using late intake valve closing (LIVC) to determine the benefits and limitations of this strategy to meet Tier 2 Bin 5 NOx requirements without after-treatment. The most significant benefit of LIVC is a reduction in particulates due to the longer ignition delay time and a subsequent reduction in local fuel rich combustion zones. More than a 95% reduction in particulates was observed at some operating conditions. Combustion noise was also reduced at low and medium loads due to slower heat release. Although it is difficult to assess the fuel economy benefits of LIVC using a single cylinder engine, LIVC shows the potential to improve the fuel economy through several approaches. First, because of the lower noise and smoke emissions, LIVC offers a promising strategy to expand early premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) operation to higher load ranges. Second, LIVC reduces CO emissions and improves combustion efficiency at low loads by optimizing the fuel injection timing. The current results show about 30%-50% NOx reduction is achievable depending on the operating conditions and injection strategies if the combustion phasing is fixed. For the same NOx emissions level, LIVC reduces the EGR requirement by 15-25%. A NOx emissions model in Arrhenius form was developed based on the FFVA experimental results. The model does a good job correlating engine-out NOx with intake valve closing time, EGR rate, engine speed, A/F ratio, and combustion phasing.

In parallel, global climate change and its current and potential consequences for life property and prosperity is now accepted as the major challenge for human society in the next 100 years. The translation of science into policy and practice that stems the acceleration of green-house gas production, particularly carbon, while also ensuring social and economic development is still in its infancy. Drawing on lessons learned from the planning and development of a new, low-carbon eco-city on an island opposite Shanghai in China, this paper explores the potential of an integrated urbanism approach. The objective being not only to mitigate factors contributing to climate change, but to manage risk, maximize resilience, and promote the successful economic and social growth of the urban community. We posit that no matter what the scale, integrated approaches - both in understanding the true nature of the issues and designing solutions - are predictive or more successful outcomes. Global populations are growing creating stress on existing resources; sprawl consumes natural buffers making metro areas more vulnerable; distributed governance responsibility confounds coordinated planning; a successful global economy is dependent on the resilience of public infrastructure and the metropolitan labor market. An integrated urbanism approach to planning may give us the tools to leapfrog the environmental and public health costs of economic progress and create a new model for cities across the developing world.","Carbon reduction; Integrated urbanism; Risk management","Carbon; Climate change; Developing countries; Ecology; Economics; Regional planning; Risk management; Carbon reduction; Global climate changes; Integrated urbanism; Low carbon eco cities; Planning and development; Public infrastructures; Risk management strategies; Social and economic development; Urban growth",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900849147

Warm mix asphalt (WMA) is produced by incorporating additives into asphalt mixtures to allow production and placement of the mix when heated to temperatures well below the 150°C+ temperatures of conventional hot mix asphalt (HMA). Potential benefits such as reduced plant emissions, improved compaction in the field, extension of the paving season into colder weather, and reduced energy consumption at the plant may be realized with different applications. Trial installations of WMA, including two sections using the Sasobit WMA additive, have been investigated in Virginia. This study presents the results of laboratory testing to evaluate the performance of the mixtures used in the two trial sections. The evaluation included comparisons of volumetric properties, moisture susceptibility, rutting resistance, and fatigue performance between the HMA and WMA mixtures used in each section. Few differences were found. In addition, the findings indicated that the performance of HMA and WMA should be equal when proper construction methods are used. © 2008 ASCE.","Asphalts; Fatigue; Laboratory tests; Material properties; Mixtures","Asphalt mixture; Construction method; Energy cost; Environmental awareness; Fatigue; Fatigue performance; Hot mix asphalt; Laboratory evaluation; Laboratory testing; Laboratory tests; Material properties; Moisture susceptibility; Plant emissions; Potential benefits; Reduced energy; Rutting resistance; Two section; Virginia; Volumetric properties; Warm mix asphalts; Additives; Energy utilization; Laboratories; Materials properties; Mixtures; Pavements; Volumetric analysis; Asphalt",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78049278228

The method combines CO2 laser heating of the coating surface with detection of the temperature variation in the laser induced Cr3+ luminescence signal from the thermally grown oxide (TGO) formed under the coating during service. The thermal diffusivity is determined from the delay between a surface heating laser pulse and the heating of the TGO. Data analysis is performed using a three layer heat equation model. Various locations on several coatings were investigated with different average heating laser powers and modulation frequencies. The normalized standard deviation was found to be of the order of 20%, which is thought to be largely due to localized variations in coating thickness and density. The advantage of the method described here is that it does not require knowledge of either the thermal properties of the alloy, its temperature, or thickness, and is therefore well suited for measurement on coated parts of complex shape, such as a hot section gas turbine blade. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",,"Coatings; Diffusion; Electric generators; Gas turbines; Heating; Laser heating; Lasers; Mathematical models; Modulation; Optical data processing; Plastic coatings; Pulsed laser applications; Thermal diffusion; Thermal diffusivity; Thermodynamic properties; Thickness measurement; Coated parts; Coating surfaces; Coating thicknesses; Complex shapes; Data analysis; Heat equations; Laser induced; Laser powers; Luminescence signals; Modulation frequencies; Optical measurements; Optical-; Standard deviations; Surface heating; Temperature variations; Thermal properties; Thermally grown oxides; Turbine blades; Thermal barrier coatings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149233883

Thereby, the agenda responds to the emerging consensus within the climate research community that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions - such as generated during combustion - would induce global warming with serious potential consequences. The ongoing climate debate about how much global warming should be mitigated serves as a starting point. While 'climate environmentalists' opt for strict emission reductions, influential economists proposed - at least at the beginning of the project - that the requested reductions would severely hamper the world economy. The 'metamethod' of the project disentangles the deterministic and normative arguments of the debate. Within that setting, the methodology of the project displays two main characteristics. Firstly, robust deterministic knowledge about the climate system and the energy technology sector is captured by mechanistic models. This 'deterministic branch' would allow us to represent the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on global warming as well as the effects of investment decisions on the competitive advantage of renewable sources over greenhouse gas emitting technologies. Secondly, the project distills the present line of normative settings involved in the climate debate - what impacts of global warming on the one hand, and of strict emission reduction targets on the other hand, are acceptable. A further normative issue is how to decide, under present-day uncertainties that modulate our knowledge, about the causal links from potential political actions to their impacts. The approach of the project is to search for climate policies that would observe the minimum requests of each of the two major disputing 'camps' and to thereby maximise the chance for societal consensus. The minimum request of the 'environmentalists' is to guarantee that global warming shall not transgress 2°C. The minimum request of economists is that welfare loss due to climate protection should be somewhat below 1%. As a primary result, the project has qualified the systems dynamics, enabling the identification of investment paths that are likely to observe the minimum requests of both parties. Key transdisciplinary challenges of the ongoing project are as follows: distilling the major epistemic (knowledge on systems dynamics) and major normative arguments, and alleged disagreements, as the two are intimately entangled within economic theory; finally, keeping track of assumptions and desires of major players to ensure that the project's stylised solutions will in fact catalyse a societal consensus. © 2008 Springer Science + Business Media B.V.","Climate change; Consensus driven approach; Costs of mitigation; Economic growth; Global warming mitigation",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892816819

The most realistic appraisal of negotiations that might extend and deepen a climate change regime built upon the architecture of the protocol is that they will meet a dead end. Put more diplomatically, there remains little chance that a regime so structured can be a credible foundation for sustained and effective movement toward the defined objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), namely, ""stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.""1 At first glance, after the Eleventh Conference of the Parties (COP-11) to the UNFCCC in December 2005, such a conclusion will be seen by many as overly bleak or at any rate premature. After all, the nations party to the Kyoto Protocol decided in Montreal that there would be a second period of commitments after the 2012 expiration of the current arrangements and that they would negotiate the shape and scale of those commitments in the coming several years. And the still wider group of nations party to the UNFCCC itself was able to agree that a dialogue about how to go forward toward the ultimate goal of stabilization of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations would also be initiated. The problem with the second-period negotiation decision is that it is explicitly limited to those nations established as part of Annex I under the UNFCCC, nations that already agreed to first-period mitigation commitments. The negotiation therefore explicitly excludes participation by emerging market, developing countries-with their rapidly rising total emissions-and it has been rejected by the United States, historically the world's leading GHG emitter. The accord to initiate a more comprehensive dialogue was achieved only when the original proposed text was amended to delink, or segregate, the agreed consultations from the UNFCCC process itself. As is the custom in diplomatic circles, delegates and observers left Montreal spinning themselves into a mood of optimism and self-congratulation about what they had pulled from the embers of the negotiations. After COP-11 it is more incumbent than ever upon those who regard climate change as a serious threat to environmental and social stability to think beyond the Kyoto architecture. To think beyond Kyoto implies both a reanalysis of why this first effort is failing and a reconception of what other regime or regimes might replace it. To that end, I divide this short essay into four parts. The first part focuses on the careful thought and process that resulted in the Kyoto architecture. I stress in particular that the problems experienced in the Kyoto process are neither the product of scientific uncertainties nor the consequence of a failure to think through and apply well-grounded orthodox forms of policy analysis. To the contrary, the real debates about climate science that currently demand research and resolution are largely confined to margins far removed from the low-level institutional steps being taken to found a multilateral climate regime. Nor has there ever previously been in any field of international policy a response to environmental risks so thorough and so crafted around an informed frame of theory. In the second part I briefly describe the somewhat ironic outcomes of this idealized policy design process, with emphasis on why the Kyoto principles as now conceived cannot be incrementally extended to solve the far deeper and more inclusive reductions in GHG emissions needed to move toward stabilized atmospheric concentrations. In the third part I focus on reasons, drawn from political economy, organizational sociology, and international relations that suggest why the Kyoto architecture so quickly reached its limits and cannot serve the more ambitious needs of climate policy. In the fourth and final part I simply sketch the constitutive elements of an alternative approach to climate change that does not discard what Kyoto has accomplished but rather tries to address the asserted criticisms of the current architecture in order to reimagine a more effective set of responses to the several discrete issues that underlie the activities that have put the global environment under stress.

During this process, choices have to be made with respect to construction, cladding material, climate conditioning equipment, energy sources and management, growing substrates, water and nutrient supply, internal logistics and labour, to mention a few.

To describe the spatial progress of the chemical reactions in three-dimensional simulations of CAI engine cycles an efficient combustion chemistry model was developed. To analyze the effects of mixture homogeneity on the progress of the reactions, thermodynamic analyses and numerical simulations of engine operation in HCCI mode have been performed based on experimental investigations with an optically-accessible single-cylinder engine. The numerical simulations were used to interpret the experimental observations in terms of mixing and reaction progress. Both experimental investigations and simulations show that injection timing is a feasible control parameter for the optimization of operating points because autoignition is influenced by the start of injection and the therewith connected temperature and mixture distribution. Furthermore spark assisted HCCI combustion at high load was investigated by thermodynamic analyses and combustion visualization. The results of the combustion visualization and heat release analyses suggest a superposition of flame front propagation and autoignition. Therefore the kinetic model to describe autoignition was coupled with a model to describe the turbulent flame propagation and three averaged cycles at different load were simulated. In all cases a good accordance between simulation and experiment can be stated. Like the results of the combustion visualization the simulations show a propagating flame front near the spark plug followed by sequential autoignition in the outer regions of the combustion chamber.

Traditionally, the approach to the conservation of CWRs has been ex situ-the collection and maintenance of seed accessions in national, regional, and international germplasm banks, supplemented by field genebanks for species with recalcitrant seeds. More recently the need to maintain CWRs in their natural habitats (in situ) has been advocated. This is very different from on-farm conservation of traditional land races and is a complex multidisciplinary process. Particular problems that have to be addressed include the adoption of a workable definition of what is a CWR, application of priority-determining mechanisms because of the large number of candidate species of CWRs, assessment of the effectiveness of conservation approaches, the relative costs of in situ and ex situ approaches, integration of CWR in situ conservation into national programmes, and the challenges posed by global change. CWRs may be conserved in both protected and non-protected areas. Presence in the former is no guarantee of their survival and in most cases some degree of management intervention is required. Experience derived from recent EU-and GEF-funded CWR conservation initiatives will be drawn upon. © TÜBİTAK.","Conservation; Crop wild relatives; Global climate change; In situ",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952009936

The soluble total organic carbon (TOC) reduction in the treated waste was 40% for both reactors, working with a high organic loading rate (OLR) of 10kg TOC·m-3d-1. The percentage of organic carbon removal rose until 90% when the organic loading rate decreased up to 3 kg TOC·m-3·d-1 (treating in this case only manure proceeding from the piglet room). The study shows imperceptible contents in acetic, propionic and butyric acids in the treated manure, whereas fatty acids of longer chain are detected. Microbial population developed inside reactors seems unable to degrade these long chain acids as fast as short chain ones because the biofilm is thinly populated by acidogenic bacteria. On the contrary, it seems to be large acetogenic and methanogenic population that carries out short chain fatty acid degradation. Kinetic studies reveal the existence of a remaining organic fraction in the anaerobic pig waste degradation caused by inhibition of hydrolysis step.

The inherent possibility of pre-combustion CO2 removal at modest additional cost-as practiced on a large scale in the ammonia industry-has increased the interest in gasification for the generation of electric power. This chapter explores gasification, the conversion of any carbonaceous feedstock into a gaseous product with a useful chemical heating value. Early processes for the production of gas from coal emphasized devolatilization and pyrolysis reactions creating a gas with significant hydrocarbon content for lighting purposes. Those were the town gas processes of the 19th century. With the introduction of the incandescent mantle and the development of chemical syntheses at the beginning of the 20th century, the emphasis shifted to water gas and partial oxidation processes generating synthesis gas (or syngas), in which carbon monoxide and hydrogen are the principal components. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882299685

The National Oncologic PET Registry (NOPR) was developed to meet these coverage requirements and to assess how PET affects care decisions. Methods: The NOPR collected questionnaire data from referring physicians on intended patient management before and after PET. After 1 year, the cohort included data from 22,975 studies (83.7% PET/CT) from 1,178 centers. The numbers of scans performed for diagnosis of suspected cancer (or unknown primary cancer), initial cancer staging, restaging, and suspected cancer recurrence were approximately equal. Prostatic, pancreatic and ovarian cancers represented approximately 30% of cases. Results: If PET data were not available, the most common pre-PET plan would have been other imaging. In these patients, the post-PET strategies changed to watching in 37% and treatment in 48%. In patients with planned biopsy before PET, biopsy was avoided in approximately 70%. If the pre-PET strategy was treatment, the post-PET strategy involved a major change in type in 8.7% and goal in 5.6%. When intended management was classified as either treatment or nontreatment, the post-PET plan was three-fold more likely to lead to treatment than nontreatment (28.3% v 8.2%; odds ratio = 3.4; 95% CI, 3.2 to 3.6). Overall, physicians changed their intended management in 36.5% (95% CI, 35.9 to 37.2) of cases after PET. Conclusion: This large, prospective, nationally representative registry of elderly cancer patients found that physicians often change their intended management on the basis of PET scan results across the full spectrum of its potential uses. © 2008 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,"adult; aged; article; cancer diagnosis; cancer of unknown primary site; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; computer assisted emission tomography; confidence interval; female; human; major clinical study; male; neoplasm; ovary cancer; pancreas cancer; patient care; positron emission tomography; priority journal; prostate cancer; questionnaire; risk assessment; tumor biopsy; biopsy; clinical trial; computer assisted tomography; government; medicare; middle aged; multicenter study; neoplasm; palliative therapy; patient care planning; patient selection; prospective study; radiography; register; risk; scintiscanning; treatment outcome; United States; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biopsy; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (U.S.); Female; Humans; Male; Medicare; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Neoplasms; Odds Ratio; Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care); Palliative Care; Patient Care Planning; Patient Selection; Positron-Emission Tomography; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Registries; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43749121858

Mortality and respiratory diseases caused by air pollution are believed to be endemic in cities of these countries. Regulations and standards are the first requirement for reducing emissions from both fixed and mobile sources. In order to reduce vehicle emissions, governments of the four countries are making efforts to introduce vehicle emission regulations for new vehicles. This paper attempts to estimate the 2015 car stock by emission regulation levels from past trends. Considering these car stock results, this paper emphasizes monitoring problems such as vehicle registration systems, inspection and maintenance (I/M) systems and fuel quality monitoring systems for vehicles in use. Monitoring problems in developing countries share similar characteristics such as a weakness in government initiatives and inadequate operation of government agencies, which results from a lack of human resources and analysis of facilities. Finally, this paper proposes a method to assure air quality improvement under the different shares of emission regulations in these four ASEAN countries and introduces an example of an evaluation method based on a policy survey to improve air quality.","Air pollution; Asia; Environment and development; Regulatory policies; Transportation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856905424

However, unlike traditional model intercomparisons, C-LAMP has established scientific model performance metrics based upon comparison against best-available satellite- and ground-based measurements. Moreover, C-LAMP has partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy's Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) to collect, archive, and distribute-via the Earth System Grid (ESG)-model results from C-LAMP experiments performed by international modeling groups in the same fashion as was done for the model results used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). In addition, because future IPCC Assessment Reports are expected to be based on results from integrated Earth System Models (ESMs), C-LAMP is helping to establish the metadata standards for model output from terrestrial biogeochemistry components of ESMs. Proposed as an extension to the netCDF Climate and Forecast (CF) 1.1 Convention, these metadata standards will facilitate future model-model and model-measurement intercomparisons. A prototype diagnostics tool has been developed for C-LAMP that summarizes model results, produce graphical representations of these results as compared with observational data sets, and score models on their scientific performance.","C-LAMP; Carbon cycle; Model Intercomparison; Model verification; Terrestrial biogeochemistry","Carbon cycle; Community climate system model; Diagnostics tools; Earth system grids; Earth system model; Evaluation metrics; Experimental protocols; Graphical representations; Ground based measurement; Intercomparisons; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Metadata Standards; Model diagnosis; Model intercomparisons; Model outputs; Model performance; Model results; Model verification; Observational data; Phase 1; Scientific performance; U.S. Department of Energy; Working groups; Biogeochemistry; C (programming language); Carbon; Climate change; Decision making; Environmental technology; Information technology; Metadata; Program diagnostics; Verification; Climate models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863345784

In turn, this means that power suppliers can differentiate their products to appeal to consumer tastes. While electricity is in some ways a commodity product, one major source of potential differentiation is the method of generating the power. Some renewables also clearly generate less carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per kWh of energy delivered, and they have the potential therefore to assist in meeting national or regional targets to reduce CO2 emissions. Renewable energy sources have been given great impetus by renewable portfolio standards in many US states. As a result of both consumer preferences and national targets for renewable energy production, there has been a growth in interest in renewable energy credits or ""tradable green certificates"" (TGCs) and other approaches to promote the development and deployment of renewable generation technologies. These have taken several forms, including the nature of the technologies covered by these credits and in terms of the reporting or payment obligations attached to these credits. There are many differences in national programs to promote renewable energy, by either discouraging non-renewables or encouraging renewables. The use of grants and projects to implement renewable subsidies encourages rent-seeking and bureaucratic intervention rather than integration of renewables within the overall energy market. TGCs and most REFIT programs, on the other hand, allow the government to provide subsidies to renewable energy sources in a manner that can be integrated with normal market operations. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Emission inputs for the CMAQ simulations were prepared with the SMOKE processing system and were based on 1990 and 1996– 2000 inventories. During this period, significant reductions in anthropogenic emissions of VOC, NOx, and SO2 have occurred in the point source and mobile source sectors. Model evaluation results show that the modelling system performs better in capturing temporal than spatial patterns. Moreover, the modelling system captured the effects of SO2 emission reductions on SO4 concentrations in ambient air and rain water.

Here, we study relations between reactive nitrogen wet deposition and air mass transport during summer and winter expressed in the form of climate indices, at seven sites in Southern Norway for the period 1980-2005. Atmospheric nitrate concentrations decreased with 0 to 50% in the period, particularly at sites with little precipitation, and mostly during 1990-2005. For comparison, reported reductions in emissions of oxidised nitrogen in Europe in 1989-2003 were 23%. Climate indices explained up to 36% of the variation in winter nitrate deposition at the western and northern sites - and also explained 60% of the variation in winter precipitation (R=0.77). This suggests that the variation in nitrate wet deposition is closely related to variation in precipitation, and that the climate indices seem to also partly control the variation in atmospheric nitrate concentrations (R=-0.45 at coastal sites). At the coastal sites, local air temperature was highly correlated (R=0.84) with winter nitrate deposition, suggesting that warm, humid winter weather results in increased wet nitrate deposition. For ammonia the pattern was similar, but this compound is more influenced by local sources. Expected severe increase in precipitation in western and northern regions as a consequence of climate change suggest that nitrogen deposition in these areas will increase under global warming if emissions are held constant.",,"air mass; air temperature; ammonia; climate change; climate variation; emission; global warming; mass transport; nitrate; nitrogen; oxygen; precipitation (climatology); summer; warming; wet deposition; winter; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40449094374

We are developing a portable, laser-based instrument for real-time, stand-off detection of Hg emissions that involves exciting the Hg (6 3P1 ← 6 1S0) transition at 253.7 nm and detecting the resulting resonant emission from Hg (6 3P1). The laser for this approach must be tunable over the Hg absorption line at 253.7 nm, while system performance modeling has indicated a desired output pulse energy ≥0.1 μJ and linewidth ≤5 GHz (full width at half-maximum, FWHM). In addition, the laser must have the requisite physical characteristics for use in coal-fired power plants. To meet these criteria, we are pursing a multistage frequency-conversion scheme involving an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The OPA is pumped by the frequency-doubled output of a passively Q-switched, monolithic Nd:YAG micro-laser operating at 10-Hz repetition rate and is seeded by a 761-nm, cw distributed-feedback diode laser. The resultant pulse-amplified seed beam is frequency tripled in two nonlinear frequency-conversion steps to generate 253.7-nm light. The laser system is mounted on a 45.7 cm × 30.5 cm breadboard and can be further condensed using custom optical mounts. Based on simulations of the nonlinear frequency-conversion processes and current results, we expect this laser architecture to exceed the desired pulse energy. Moreover, this approach provides a compact, all-solid-state source of tunable, narrow-linewidth visible and ultraviolet radiation, which is required for many chemical sensing applications.","Harmonic generation and mixing; Mercury monitoring; Optical parametric amplifier","Air pollution; Environmental protection; Lasers; Nonlinear programming; Pigments; Pulsed laser deposition; coal boilers; Emissions (asphalt); EPA regulations; High sensitivity (HS); High specificity; Mercury(III); Nonlinear frequency; Stand-off detection; Time responses; Tunable ultraviolet (TUV); Mercury (metal)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44849101415

The amount of emitted carbon dioxide remaining in the atmosphere is controlled by carbon cycle processes in the ocean and on land. These processes are themselves affected by climate. The resulting 'climate-carbon cycle feedback' has recently been quantified, but the policy implications have not. Using a scheme to emulate the range of state-of-the-art model results for climate feedback strength, including the modelled range of climate sensitivity and other key uncertainties, we analyse recent global targets. The G8 target of a 50% cut in emissions by 2050 leaves CO2 concentrations rising rapidly, approaching 1000ppm by 2300. The Stern Review's proposed 25% cut in emissions by 2050, continuing to an 80% cut, does in fact approach stabilization of CO2 concentration on a policy-relevant (century) timescale, with most models projecting concentrations between 500 and 600ppm by 2100. However concentrations continue to rise gradually. Long-term stabilization at 550ppm CO2 requires cuts in emissions of 81 to 90% by2300, and more beyond as a portion of the CO2 emitted persists for centuries to millennia. Reductions of other greenhouse gases cannot compensate for the long-term effects of emittingCO2. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Carbon cycle; Carbon dioxide; Climate; Emissions targets; Feedbacks; Policy; Stabilisation; Stern Review; Uncertainty","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Feedback; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Stabilization; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon cycle process; Carbon cycles; Climate; Climate feedbacks; Climate sensitivity; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Policy implications; Uncertainty; Climate models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62749100674

In response to the limitations of existing data on the volumes of HDDTs on surface streets, this study used direct video measurements of surface street traffic at 11 intersection's and line segments in these communities to document port-related truck traffic traveling to and from intermodal facilities, truck service sites, local amenities, and regional goods movement roadways. The volumes of HDDTs often reached 400 to 600/h for several hours immediately upwind of sensitive land uses, such as schools, open-field parks, and residences. Diurnal truck traffic patterns on surface streets varied by intersection, local conditions, and passenger car commute patterns. Given the documented health and environmental consequences of HDDT emissions, the results raise serious public health concerns for the inhabitants who reside, work, attend school, or recreate in close proximity to roadways with HDDT traffic in these communities adjacent to ports. This paper discusses the environmental justice implications of truck-related land use conflicts and current planning and emission control strategies to mitigate the local air pollution impacts of increasing port-related truck traffic in these low-income, minority communities.",,"Close proximity; Container traffic; Control strategies; Diesel truck; Health concerns; Line segments; Local conditions; Long Beach; Long Beach , California; Los Angeles (LA); Surface streets; Truck traffic; Wilmington; Air pollution control; Air quality; Automobiles; Beaches; Emission control; Environmental impact; Ferry boats; Geographical regions; Intersections; Land use; Landforms; Ports and harbors; Roads and streets; Trucks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58449120212

Therefore, likely flowering-time responses to global-change drivers are needed for predictions of global-change impacts on natural and managed ecosystems. Predicting responses of species to global changes would be simplified if functional, phylogenetic or biogeographical traits contributed substantially to a species' response. Here we investigate the role of growth form (grass, graminoid, forb, subshrub), longevity (annual, perennial), origin (native, exotic) and flowering time in determining the impact of elevated [CO 2] (550 μmolmol-1) and infrared warming (mean warming of +2°C) on flowering times of 31 co-occurring species of a range of species-types in a temperate grassland in 2004, 2005 and 2007. Warming reduced time to first flowering by an average of 20.3 days in 2004, 2.1 days in 2005 and 7.6 days in 2007; however, the response varied among species and was unrelated to growth form, origin or longevity. Elevated [CO2] did not alter flowering times; neither was there any [CO2] by species-type interaction. However, both warming and elevated [CO2] tended to have a greater effect on later-flowering species, with time to first flowering of later-flowering species being reduced by both elevated [CO2] (P&lt;0.001) and warming (P&lt;0.001) to a greater extent than that of earlier-flowering species. These results have ramifications for our predictions of community and ecosystem interactions in native grasslands in response to global change. © CSIRO 2008.",,"biogeography; carbon dioxide; climate effect; community response; flowering; functional response; global warming; grassland; life cycle; longevity; phenology; phylogenetics; temperate environment; Australasia; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57749180125

Such water bodies may be used as salinity gradient solar ponds (SGSPs) to generate clean electricity that can be used in desalination plants. The geologic and climatic conditions of this region are compared with El Paso, Texas, USA where there is a well-established SGSP technology.

Climate and atmospheric changes are likely to impact on the quantity and reliability of forage production; forage quality; thermal stress on livestock; water demands for both animal needs and for growing forage; pest, disease and weed challenges; land degradation processes; and various social and economic aspects including trade. Potential adaptation options are available for moderate climate changes, with these often being variations of existing climate risk management strategies. However, to date there are few Australian examples where these adaptations have been assessed systematically on any scale (e.g. enterprise, regional, whole of industry or national). Nor have many studies been undertaken in a way that (i) effectively harness industry knowledge, (ii) undertake climate change analyses in the framework of existing operational systems, or (iii) assess climate change in the context of other socioeconomic or technical changes. It is likely that there are limits to the effectiveness of existing adaptations under more severe climate changes. In such cases more systemic changes in resource allocation need considering, such as targeted diversification of production systems and livelihoods. Dealing with the many barriers to effective adaptation will require 'mainstreaming' climate change into policies covering a range of scales, responsibilities and issues. This mainstreaming will facilitate the development of comprehensive, dynamic and long lasting policy solutions. The integrative nature of climate change problems requires science to include integrative elements in the search for solutions: a willingness to apply integrated rather than disciplinary science and a strengthening of the interface with decision-makers. © CSIRO 2008.",,"agricultural policy; climate change; climate effect; decision making; environmental stress; food quality; forage; temperature effect; Australasia; Australia; Animalia; Harness",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45849142870

Thus, in this study a factor decomposition model of carbon emission in China is built and the contributions that economic scale, industrial structure, and carbon emission intensity make to carbon emission quantitatively from 1990 to 2005 are analyzed, in other words-scale effect, structural effect, and technical effect-using the decomposition method of average distribution cushion which is based on the environmental Kuznets curves model is studied. The result suggests that the average of the effect changes of carbon emission in China is 19.55%, the effects brought by economic scale, industrial structure, and carbon emission intensity are 15.76%, -0.86%, and 4.65%, respectively. In general, the relation between carbon emission and China's economy was more like an ""N"" curve; Economy scale is a primary drive factor and has incremental effect to carbon emission. Since otherness of different industry is getting bigger, the industrial restructure has certain decremental effect to carbon emission, but the restrictive function is not obvious, the industrial structure still need to be further optimized; the technical effect is positive and its volatility is large. From the perspective of reducing carbon emission, the current technology has not played to its advantages. This study will promote the understanding of the theory about the relationship between carbon emission and economy development and provide reference value by all means to the adjustment of industrial development.

In this paper, we report changes in ecosystem services in relation to land use and land cover over an 18-year period (1988-2006) in the Menglun Township, Xishuangbanna, Southwest China. We used Landsat TM/ETM and Quickbird data sets to estimate changes in ten land use and land cover categories, and generalized value coefficients to estimate changes in the ecosystem services provided by each land category. The results showed that over the 18-year period, the land use and land cover in the study area experienced significant changes. Rubber plantations increased from 12.10% of total land cover to 45.63%, while forested area and swidden field decreased from 48.73 and 13.14 to 27.57 and 0.46%, respectively. During this period, the estimated value of ecosystem services dropped by US $11.427 million (∼27.73%). Further analysis showed that there were significant changes in ecological functions such as nutrient cycling, erosion control, climate regulation and water treatment as well as recreation; the obvious increase in the ecological function is provision of raw material (natural rubber). Our findings conclude that an abrupt shift in land use from ecologically important tropical forests and traditionally managed swidden fields to large-scale rubber plantations result in a great loss of ecosystem services in this area. Further, the study suggests that provision of alternative economic opportunities would help in maintaining ecosystem services and for an appropriate compensation mechanisms need to be established based on rigorous valuation. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Biodiversity hotspot; Ecosystem services; Remote sensing; Rubber expansion; Tropical forest; Valuation","Chemicals removal (water treatment); Ecology; Environmental impact; Land use; Landforms; Offshore oil well production; Raw materials; Rubber; Rubber plantations; Water analysis; Water treatment; Biodiversity hotspot; Ecosystem services; Remote sensing; Rubber expansion; Tropical forest; Valuation; Ecosystems; rubber; biodiversity; data set; environmental impact; land cover; land use change; remote sensing; rubber; tropical forest; article; biodiversity; China; climate change; economic aspect; ecosystem; environmental erosion; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental monitoring; forest management; forest structure; forestry; geographic distribution; land use; landscape; nutrient cycling; plantation; recreation; remote sensing; tropical rain forest; water treatment; Agriculture; Biodiversity; China; Ecosystem; Fresh Water; Industry; Spacecraft; Trees; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Xishuangbanna; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53649083931

Numerical simulations were performed to predict the temperature, the flow and the species distributions in the furnace, with practical operational conditions taken into account. The calculated results agree well with the test data, and the burning behavior of municipal solid waste in the novel two-stage reciprocating incinerator can be demonstrated well. The thickness of waste bed, the initial moisture content, the excessive air coefficient and the secondary air are the major factors that influence the combustion process. If the initial moisture content of waste is high, both the heat value of waste and the temperature inside incinerator are low, and less oxygen is necessary for combustion. The air supply rate and the primary air distribution along the grate should be adjusted according to the initial moisture content of the waste. A reasonable bed thickness and an adequate excessive air coefficient can keep a higher temperature, promote the burnout of combustibles, and consequently reduce the emission of dioxin pollutants. When the total air supply is constant, reducing primary air and introducing secondary air properly can enhance turbulence and mixing, prolong the residence time of flue gas, and promote the complete combustion of combustibles.

While a 30 cm coarse gravel layer functioned as a gas distribution to balance gas fluxes, a 30 cm layer made of sand failed. Consequently, the methane mitigation efficiency of the cover designs varied strongly; the relative comparison with an uncovered reference area shows up to nearly 100% emission reduction in optimized biocovers over the entire year, while reduction efficiency in simplified biocovers or in conventionally styled covers including a compacted loamy material was smaller than 70%.

Here, especially toilets have to work absolutely reliable in order to ensure a high level of comfort for both - passengers and crew. Besides the functionality, the demand on comfort concerning cabin noise level has increased especially on long-distance flights. Thus, up to now substantial efforts have been made improving the turbojet-engines, significantly reducing the noise outside as well as inside the aircraft cabin. As one result, among others, the noise of the sewage systems became more dominant and noticeable. Within the scope of this work, a series-production sewage system with vacuum-assisted flush was analyzed concerning its vibro-acoustic behavior. A map of the systems sound radiation was plotted using the sound intensity technique to localize the sound sources. Furthermore, the minimum required system low-pressure was defined and the influence of a closed toilet lid was characterized. In summery a considerable room of improvement of current sewage systems could be shown including appropriate geometry modifications resulting in a comprehensive catalogue of measures could be given to engineer new and especially quieter toilets for aviation. © 2008 by the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Department of Mechanical Engineering All rights reserved.",,"Acoustic generators; Acoustic wave propagation; Aviation; Sewage; Turbojet engines; Cabin noise; Geometry modifications; Sewage system; Sound emission; Sound radiations; Sound source; Vibro-acoustic behaviors; Acoustic noise",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906344809

Mangrove sponge communities in the Caribbean mainly consist of species that are typical to this habitat and community compositions often differ from those found on coral reefs nearby. Heterogeneity in species distributions between locations and within locations between roots is often reported. This study quantifies the diversity and abundance of mangrove associated sponges in the inner bays of Curaçao and Aruba and correlates variability of regional sponge diversity with environmental variables measured along the surveyed sites. Tannin concentrations vary between mangrove roots, and were correlated to sponge cover as a possible cause for habitat heterogeneity on a smaller scale. A total of 22 species was observed. Heterogeneity in species richness and abundance was apparent, and several sponge species were restricted in their depth of occurrence. Statistical data reduction suggests that sponge diversity may be partly explained by the distance towards adjacent reefs and to the degree of eutrophication, in which the latter is comprised of rate of planktonic respiration, total carbon and turbidity. Tannin concentrations did not determine within locality species heterogeneity as a priori postulated, but were positively related to sponge cover for reasons not yet elucidated.","Epibionts; Heterogeneity; Mangroves; Spatial variations; Sponges; Tannins","Anthozoa; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149382223

Advanced injection strategies offer possible ways to improve the trade-offs between NOx, PM and fuel consumption. In particular, use of high EGR levels (&gt; 40%) together with multiple injection strategies provides possibilities to reduce both engine-out NOx and soot emissions. Comparisons of optical engine measurements with CFD simulations enable detailed analysis of such combustion concepts. Thus, CFD simulations are important aids to understanding combustion phenomena, but the models used need to be able to model cases with advanced injection strategies. Thus, in the study presented here, engine tests were performed with settings selected to simplify CFD simulation, with long dwell times between the injections and only injection changes between engine settings in test cases presented in this paper. The key to reducing both soot and NOx emissions by applying pilot injections is that the pilot injected fuel should not ignite before sufficient mixing/lean-out has occurred. Hence, substantial heat releases prior to the main injection must be prevented. Thus, high EGR levels are needed to increase the bulk gas mass and reduce the temperature so that there is sufficient time for the pilot injections to mix and become locally lean before ignition.

In the first approach a methane hydrate system was depressurized in incremental steps below the P-T stability curve, while the mole fraction of released methane was monitored. The second approach exposed a stable methane hydrate system to liquid CO2, which started in situ exchange between methane and CO2 that subsequently released methane from the hydrate formation. Methane production was monitored by a combination of magnetic resonance imaging, gas chromatography and PVT-data. Depressurization gave access to all of the methane through hydrate dissociation, however, major limitation of this approach was the production of free water from hydrate dissociation as well as heat transport limitations and local refreezing due to gas cooling. The CO2-sequestration maintained hydrate stability in the core with no evidence of excess free water released and at the same time was able to give access to around 70% of the methane originally trapped in the hydrate.",,,Abstract Report,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872158317

A sharp increase of fluorescence emission of local anaesthetics (LA) in aqueous surfactant solutions at concentrations close to the critical micelle concentration (cmc) was observed due to the formation of premicellar aggregates. Plots of the specific conductance, κ, against [SDS], measured in the presence of a fixed amount of LA, clearly had two break points. Rates of the alkaline hydrolysis of the ester function of LA were dramatically reduced in the presence of SDS at concentrations close to the cmc (∼8.3 mM). Both the increase in fluorescence emission intensity and the reduction of hydrolysis reaction rates occur within a very narrow range of SDS concentration near the cmc and then level off/down. The strongest incorporation into negatively charged micellar aggregates was observed for TCA, the anaesthetic having the strongest hydrophobicity, and the weakest incorporation was observed for PAM, the least hydrophobic molecule. This result is important in the correlation of the anaesthetic potency of LA with their hydrophobicity. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.",,"dodecyl sulfate sodium; procainamide; procaine; tetracaine; article; chemical reaction; electric conductivity; fluorescence spectroscopy; hydrolysis; hydrophobicity; physical chemistry; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40349100440

Prior to the Early Jurassic, biotic and abiotic carbonate sediments deposited in these epeiric seas represent the most important preserved record of marine global change. Shallow (neritic) epeiric watermasses and their carbon cycles, however, are commonly de-coupled from those of deep epicontinental basins and the open ocean. This has implications for the interpretation of global secular trends based on epeiric proxies. Herein are reviewed four case studies that display marked regional (as opposed to stratigraphical) isotope gradients across Recent, Lower Cretaceous, Pennsylvanian and Upper Ordovician carbonate platforms. The rock record is interpreted by applying lessons from present-day carbon cycling, syndepositional marine and early meteoric diagenesis, as well as the hydrography of modern marginal seas. Numerous patterns in datasets from fossil epeiric seas are readily explained using modern parameters of physico-chemical and biological oceanography, while others are explicitly non-actualistic. This outcome highlights the complex interaction of sedimentological, physical, chemical and biological processes that affect the rock record of epeiric seawater δ13 CDIC. Because global climate models are based on epeiric carbonates it is critical that there be a better understanding of carbon cycling in order to develop realistic projections of future climate. Hence, future research should focus on an improved grasp of this primary and early diagenetic variability of the epeiric rock record rather than on the uncritical compilation of large datasets.",,"carbon isotope; carbonate platform; conference proceeding; Cretaceous; inland sea; Ordovician; paleoceanography; Pennsylvanian",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-59649115238

Most installations are connected to existing rather than purpose designed distribution systems, and this is likely to continue for some time. Given that existing networks were not designed with such distributed generation in mind, a series of related problems can be caused by these new sources of generation, in particular local voltage rise and the potential to exceed thermal limits of the certain lines and transformers. Distribution network operators (DNOs) have legitimate concerns regarding these issues and also the efficacy of the existing protection arrangements. There are of course also potential benefits. Enthusiasts for micro-generation point to a reduction in CO2 emissions, a reduction in distribution losses and increased security of supply amongst others. Research has been underway in recent years to quantify both the problems and the benefits associated with micro-generation, and to determine limits to their penetration into existing networks. Moreover, new approaches to system design and operation are immerging. Research developments and progress with the installation of micro-generation in the UK will be used to highlight the key issues. The perceived technical, commercial and regulatory barriers to uptake of micro-generation are also discussed alongside current connection codes and requirements. © 2008 IEEE.","Distribution network charges; Network charging methodologies; Yardstick marginal cost","21st century; CO2 emissions; Distributed generation; Distribution losses; Distribution network charges; Distribution network operators; Distribution systems; Electrical energy; Market shares; Micro-CHP; Micro-generation; Network charging methodologies; New approaches; New sources; Photovoltaics; Policy makers; Potential benefits; Regulatory barriers; Research developments; Security of supply; System designs; Yardstick marginal cost; Air pollution; Competition; Distributed parameter networks; Distribution of goods; Electric equipment protection; Electric power distribution; Electric power generation; Energy conversion; Energy policy; Industrial economics; Industrial management; Installation; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Satellite observatories; Wind power; Power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349113441

The emissions of greenhouse relevant gases like carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides largely depend on physico-chemical conditions like substrate quality or the redox potential of the habitat. Manipulating these conditions has a great potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Such options are known from farm and waste management, as well as from wastewater treatment. In this paper examples are given how greenhouse gas production might be reduced by regulating microbial processes. Biogas production from manure, organic wastes, and landfills are given as examples how methanisation may be used to save fossil fuel. Methane oxidation, on the other hand, might alleviate the problem of methane already produced, or the conversion of aerobic wastewater treatment to anaerobic nitrogen elimination through the anaerobic ammonium oxidation process might reduce N2O release to the atmosphere. Changing the diet of ruminants, altering soil water potentials or a change of waste collection systems are other measures that affect microbial activities and that might contribute to a reduction of carbon dioxide equivalents being emitted to the atmosphere. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The source offers both telecommunication wavelength operation at 1.3 microns and Purcell enhancement of the spontaneous emission rate. Several emission lines from the InAs/GaAs quantum dot are identified, including the exciton-biexciton cascade and charged excitonic emission. We show an order of magnitude increase in the collected intensity of the emission from a charged excitonic state when temperature tuned onto resonance with the HE11 mode of the pillar microcavity, as compared to the off-resonance intensity. Above- and below-GaAs-bandgap optical excitation was used and the effect of the excitation energy on the photoluminescence investigated. Exciting below the GaAs-bandgap offers significant improvement in the quality of the single photon emission and a reduction of the multi-photon probability to 0.1 times the value for Poissonian light was measured, before subtraction of detector dark counts, the lowest value recorded to date for a quantum dot source at a fibre wavelength. We observe also the first evidence of Purcell enhancement of the spontaneous emission rate for a single telecommunication wavelength quantum dot in a pillar microcavity. We have incorporated the source into a phase encoded interferometric scheme implementing the BB84 quantum cryptography protocol and distributed a key, secure from the pulse splitting attack, over standard telecommunication optical fibre. We show a transmission distance advantage over that possible with (length-optimized) uniform intensity weak coherent pulses at 1310 nm in the same system.","fiber optic communication; III-V semiconductors; Molecular beam epitaxy; Optical correlation; Pillar microcavity; Qkd; Quantum cryptography; Quantum key distribution; Semiconductor quantum dots; Single photon source","Microcavities; Molecular beam epitaxy; Optical communication; Optical correlation; Photons; Quantum cryptography; Wavelength; Fiber optic communication; Pillar microcavity; Quantum key distribution; Single photon source; Semiconductor quantum dots",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40749085658

The magnitude of emissions and the relative importance of different sources vary widely, regionally and locally. The Indus Basin of Pakistan is the food basket of the country and agricultural activities are vulnerable to the effects of global warming due to accelerated emissions of GHGs. Many developments have taken place in the agricultural sector of Pakistan in recent decades in the background of the changing role of the government and the encouragement of the private sector for investment in new ventures. These interventions have considerable GHG emission potential. Unfortunately, no published information is currently available on GHG concentrations in the Indus Basin to assess their magnitude and emission trends. The present study is an attempt to estimate GHG (CO2, CH4 and N2O) emissions arising from different agro-ecosystems of Indus Basin. The GHGs were estimated mostly using the IPCC Guidelines and data from the published literature. The results showed that CH4 emissions were the highest (4.126 Tg yr-1) followed by N2O (0.265 Tg yr-1) and CO2 (52.6 Tg yr-1). The sources of CH4 are enteric fermentation, rice cultivation and cultivation of other crops. N2O is formed by microbial denitrification of NO3 produced from applied fertilizer-N on cropped soils or by mineralization of native organic matter on fallow soils. CO2 is formed by the burning of plant residue and by soil respiration due to the decomposition of soil organic matter. © Chinese National Committee for International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2008.","Agriculture; Greenhouse gases; Indus Basin; Pakistan",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-60049089850

Therefore, it is necessary to develop the methodologies, data sources, and tools for assessing the public health impact of air pollution reduction programs, also referred to as accountability analysis. Since air quality models are among the main tools that can be used to evaluate the impacts from emissions changes, either due to growth or implement-tation of source control strategies, these approaches play a vital role in most air accountability studies. In this study, we present a modeling methodology to estimate concentrations for multiple pollutants that include both local features (hot spots) and regional transport. The local impacts from mobile sources and significant stationary sources are estimated using a dispersion model (AERMOD). These local details are combined with regional background estimates computed by a photochemical grid model (CMAQ) in a “hybrid” approach to derive total concentrations required for the subsequent human exposure analysis. We demonstrate an application of this methodology in New Haven, Connecticut. The city of New Haven has implemented a comprehensive Clean Air Initiative, which includes a number of federally mandated and voluntary air pollution programs. This project is a collaborative effort with state and local agencies including government, academia, and the New Haven community, to apply and evaluate air quality and human exposure models that can be used with health data and to assess the feasibility of using this information to conduct an air accountability study. Although this study is based in one city, the methodologies developed through this project can have broad application to other areas within the United States and internationally. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2008.","Air quality; Exposure; Modeling",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051701426

That high thermal efficiency is attributed to a markedly reduced compressor work in the vicinity of critical point. In addition, the reaction between sodium (Na) and CO2 is milder than that between H2O and Na. Consequently, a more reliable and economically advantageous power generation system can be created by coupling with a Na-cooled fast breeder reactor. In a supercritical CO2 turbine system, a partial cooling cycle is employed to compensate a difference in heat capacity for the high-temperature - low-pressure side and low-temperature -high-pressure side of the recuperators to achieve high cycle thermal efficiency. In our previous work, a conceptual design of the system was produced for conditions of reactor thermal power of 600 MW, turbine inlet condition of 20 MPa/527°C, recuperators 1 and 2 effectiveness of 98%/95%, Intermediate Heat Exchanger (IHX) pressure loss of 8.65%, a turbine adiabatic efficiency of 93%, and a compressor adiabatic efficiency of 88%. Results revealed that high cycle thermal efficiency of 43% can be achieved. In this cycle, three different compressors, i.e., a low-pressure compressor, a high-pressure compressor, and a bypass compressor are included. In the compressor regime, the values of properties such as specific heat and density vary sharply and nonlinearly, dependent upon the pressure and temperature. Therefore, the influences of such property changes on compressor design should be clarified. To obtain experimental data for the compressor performance in the field near the critical point, a supercritical CO2 compressor test project was started at the Tokyo Institute of Technology on June 2007 with funding from MEXT, Japan. In this project, a small centrifugal CO2 compressor will be fabricated and tested. During fiscal year (FY) 2007, test loop components will be fabricated. During FY 2008, the test compressor will be fabricated and installed into the test loop. In FY 2009, tests will be conducted. This paper introduces the concept of a test loop and component designs for the cooler, heater, and control valves. A computer simulation program of static operation was developed based on detailed designs of components and a preliminary design of the compressor. The test operation regime is drawn for the test parameters.

This system is also capable of providing high-resolution aerosol profiles and cloud distributions. It is being developed as part of the NASA Earth Science Technology Office's Instrument Incubator Program. This three year program involves the design, development, evaluation, and fielding of a ground-based CO2 profiling system. At the end of a three-year development this instrument is expected to be capable of making measurements in the lower troposphere and boundary layer where the sources and sinks of CO 2 are located. It will be a valuable tool in the validation of NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) measurements of column CO2 and suitable for deployment in the North American Carbon Program (NACP) regional intensive field campaigns. The system can also be used as a test-bed for the evaluation of lidar technologies for space-application. This DIAL system leverages 2-μm laser technology developed under a number of NASA programs to develop new solid-state laser technology that provides high pulse energy, tunable, wavelength-stabilized, and double-pulsed lasers that are operable over pre-selected temperature insensitive strong CO2 absorption lines suitable for profiling of lower tropospheric CO2. It also incorporates new high quantum efficiency, high gain, and relatively low noise phototransistors, and a new receiver/signal processor system to achieve high precision DIAL measurements. Atmospheric tests of the laser have been conducted by operating it locked to the CO2 absorption line center, with off-set locking in the side-line mode, and in the off-line position. The reference laser is locked to center of absorption line within 390 kHz. This improves the level of stabilization by factor of 10 compared to earlier configuration. The detector has been characterized in the laboratory and by conducting atmospheric tests at The National Center of Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Boulder, Colorado. The receiver uses an F2.2 all aluminum 40 cm diameter telescope and the system is designed to focus light onto a 200 μm size detector. Subsystem level integration and testing has been completed in the second year. System level testing is planned in the third year along with validation in the late spring of 2008 that involves comparisons with ground-based and aircraft in situ CO2 sensors. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Atmospheric CO; Differential-absorption lidar; Ground-based; Receiver systems; Absorption; Optical radar; Atmospherics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49349084470

Therefore, the Forest Carbon Monitoring System (FCMS) toward Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation in Developing countries (REDD) was proposed. However, it is still difficult to evaluate the quantity of carbon release with high accuracy at regional scale, because of heterogeneity of land surface and long-term behavior of ecosystem carbon pools. In the joint NIES-JAXA-IIS-MRI project, we are developing a satellite- and model-based system of carbon budget focusing on tropical-temperate forests in Asia. We would present a basic idea and system plan of the model-oriented forest carbon accounting system. For the areas where forest cover change was detected by ALOS-PALSAR, a process-based model of terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle (VISIT: Vegetation Integrative SImulator for Trace gases) was applied to estimate carbon release from woody debris and soil organic matter at monthly to decadal time scale. The prototype system would be applied to several research sites at 100-m resolution. VISIT model incorporates plant biomass and soil carbon pools and then is able to conduct full carbon accounting. There remain, however, several problems in developing a regional accounting system: such as characterization of past disturbance impacts and evaluation of forest degradation.","Biomass; Carbon budget; Deforestation; Model simulation","Accounting system; Carbon accounting; Carbon budgets; Carbon cycles; Carbon emissions; Carbon pool; Decadal timescale; Ecosystem model; Forest cover change; Forest degradation; Land surface; Land-use change; Long-term behavior; Model simulation; Model-based systems; Monitoring system; Plant biomass; Process-based models; Prototype system; Regional scale; Soil carbon pool; Soil organic matters; Terrestrial ecosystems; Trace-gases; Woody debris; Biomass; Budget control; Debris; Deforestation; Degradation; Developing countries; Ecosystems; Emission control; Geologic models; Global warming; Lakes; Remote sensing; Carbon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865654845

Palaeontological studies of foraminifera, supplemented by studies of calcareous dinoflagellate cysts and corals, enabled the determination of the Oxfordian-Valanginian age of the analysed sequences. They were deposited on the Dragoman Block (western part of the Moesian Platform), and during Mid-Late Cretaceous included to the Srednogorie. A possible Middle to Late Callovian age of the lowermost part (overlying the Bajocian-Lower Bathonian Polaten Formation) of the studied sections assumed till now has not been confirmed by the present studies. Eleven facies have been distinguished and attributed to depositional environments. Marine sedimentation on a homoclinal ramp started in the Oxfordian and till the Early Kimmeridgian - in all three sections - was dominated by fine-grained peloidal-bioclastic wackestones to grainstones. Since the Late Kimmeridgian, when a rimmed platform established, facies pattern underwent differentiation into (i) the inner platform (lagoon and tidal flat facies) - only in Velinovo, (ii) reef and peri-reef facies/bioclastic shoals - mainly in Lyalintsi, and (iii) platform slope - mainly in Rebro. Sedimentation generally displays a shallowing-upward trend. Two stages in evolution of the rimmed platform are postulated. The mobile stage lasting till the Tithonian/Berriasian boundary was followed by a more stable stage in the Berriasian to Valanginian time. Reefs are developed mainly as coral-microbial biostromes, lower coral bioherms or coral thickets, in the environment of moderate energy and sedimentation. They contain highly diversified corals (72 species). Microbialites contributed to the reef framework, but they never dominated. Locally, microencrusters and cement crusts formed important part of reefal framework. During the mobile stage of the platform evolution a relative sea-level rise interrupted reef development, as evidenced by intercalations of limestones with Saccocoma. During the second stage high carbonate production and/or regressive eustatic events, not balanced by subsidence, decreased accommodation space, limiting reef growth and enhancing carbonate export to distal parts of the platform.","Biostratigraphy; Bulgaria; Carbonate sedimentology; Lyubash unit; Moesian Platform; Oxfordian-Valanginian; Reefs","biostratigraphy; carbonate platform; depositional environment; facies; foraminifera; Kimmeridgian; microbialite; Oxfordian; paleoenvironment; reef formation; sea level change; sedimentation; Valanginian; Bulgaria; Eurasia; Europe; Moesian Platform; Southern Europe; Anthozoa; Dinophyceae; Foraminifera; Saccocoma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63049121343

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been thoroughly assessing climate changes and their consequences over 20 years. It was noted that average global temperature over the last 100 years increased by 0.74°C. In the last report of the IPCC (2007), it was shown that to prevent warming by 2050 (at acceptable level) the CO2 global emission should be cut by 50-85%, what is technologically impossible.

Stochastic optimization is used to mimic how six independent climate model development efforts might use the same atmospheric general circulation model, set of observational constraints, and model skill criteria to choose different settings for parameters thought to be important sources of uncertainty related to clouds and convection. Each optimized model improved its skill with respect to observations selected as targets of model development. Of particular note were the improvements seen in reproducing observed extreme rainfall rates over the tropical Pacific, which was not specifically targeted during the optimization process. As compared to the default model sensitivity of 2.4°C, the ensemble of optimized model configurations had a larger and narrower range of sensitivities around 3°C but with different regional responses related to the uncertain choice in optimized parameter settings. These results suggest current generation models, if similarly optimized, may become more convergent in their measure of global sensitivity to greenhouse gas forcing. However, this exploration of the possible sources of modeling and observational uncertainty is not exhaustive. The optimization process illustrates an objective means for selecting an ensemble of plausible climate model configurations that quantify a portion of the uncertainty in the climate model development process. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climatology; Clouds; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Optimization; Rain; Uncertainty analysis; Atmospheric CO; Atmospheric general circulation models; Climate models; Climate predictions; Current generations; Default models; Error reductions; Extreme rainfalls; Greenhouse-gas forcing; Model configurations; Model development; Model skills; Optimization process; Optimized parameters; Regional response; Sources of uncertainties; Stochastic optimizations; Stochastic models; atmospheric convection; atmospheric general circulation model; carbon dioxide; climate modeling; climate prediction; ensemble forecasting; error analysis; optimization; sensitivity analysis; stochasticity; uncertainty analysis; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Tropical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-60749088614

Yet such factors can alter temperatures much more than carbon sequestration does, and often in a conflicting way. We outline a framework for examining biophysical factors in mitigation policies and provide some best-practice recommendations based on that framework. Tropical projects - avoided deforestation, forest restoration, and afforestation - provide the greatest climate value, because carbon storage and biophysics align to cool the Earth. In contrast, the climate benefits of carbon storage are often counteracted in boreal and other snow-covered regions, where darker trees trap more heat than snow does.

These stresses are becoming even more pronounced under changing climate, predicted to result in drier conditions, increasing temperatures, and greater variability, causing desertification. The project will work mainly in farmers’ communities to improve farming systems, by strengthening a diversified crop rotation and using marginal-quality water for supplemental irrigation, aiming at: • Introduce and test new climate-proof crops and cultivars with improved stress tolerance, selecting promising varieties of cereals, grain legumes and new crops. Climate-proof traits will be identified for breeding programmes using advanced physiological and biochemical screening tools. Supplemental irrigation will be performed as deficit irrigation by different sources of water. • Investigate the sustainable field applicability of the farming systems, such as environmental effects related to irrigation water quality assessed by monitoring groundwater and soil quality. Financial implications for the farmer and economic costs and benefits in the food sector will be analysed. • Develop a research synthesis in dialogue with food sector, based on experimental results and advanced simulation modelling to improve farming systems management, utilizing dynamic tools that ease adaptation to the effects of a variable and changing climate. The approach is participatory, involving the farmer’s community and the market and political level. The expected outcome is improved productivity and sustainable use of agricultural lands by developing a more diverse farming system, supporting economic development in non-European Mediterranean countries while ensuring mutual interest and benefit with the EU. It will accelerate adoption of improved agricultural practices and technologies to meet future constraints imposed by climate changes. © 2008, Page Press Publications.

Climate change threatens to have wide-ranging impacts on ecosystems and presents enormous challenges for conventional modes of socioeconomic governance. Against this backdrop, the last few years have seen the consolidation of a body of legal rules and principles organised around the central problems of mitigating and adapting to climate change. The new climate change law spans from international to local levels of governance, and encompasses the activities of a wide range of actors including governments, businesses and non-governmental environmental groups. This article surveys the scope of the new discipline of climate change law, providing a synopsis of its primary component areas. It also elaborates the main challenges climate change law is likely to face as its development proceeds apace, such as coping with internationalisation of the greenhouse problem, ensuring that avenues for widespread participation in climate change regulation exist, and integrating governance and regulatory frameworks across political and disciplinary boundaries. How climate change law responds to this last challenge, in particular, is likely to be determinative of its effectiveness and cohesiveness as a body of law for dealing with the broad predicted impacts of global warming.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951760184

To give support to this evolution, the statistical air pollution interpolation model RIO is developed. Due to the very low computational cost this interpolation model is an efficient tool for an environment agency when performing real-time air quality assessments. Beside this, a reliable interpolation model can be used to produce analysed maps of historical data records as well. RIO is an interpolation model that can be classified as a detrended Kriging model. In a first step the local character of the air pollution sampling values is removed in a detrending procedure. Subsequently, the site-independent data is interpolated by an Ordinary Kriging scheme. Finally, in a retrending step a local bias is added to the Kriging interpolation results. As spatially resolved driving force in the detrending process, a land use indicator is developed based on the CORINE land cover data set. The indicator is optimized independently for the three pollutants O3, NO2 and PM10. As a result, the RIO model is able to account for the local character of the air pollution phenomenon at locations where no monitoring stations are available. Through a cross-validation procedure the superiority of the RIO model over standard interpolation techniques, such as the Ordinary Kriging is demonstrated. Air quality maps are presented for the three pollutants mentioned and compared to maps based on standard interpolation techniques.","Air quality maps; CORINE Land Cover; Interpolation; Kriging","air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; conference proceeding; data set; interpolation; kriging; land use; mapping; real time",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56349109608

We used the climate-change field protocol of the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX), which measures plant responses to warming of 1 to 2°C inside small open-topped chambers. The field study was established on the Bogong High Plains, Australia, in subalpine open heathlands; the most common treeless plant community on the Bogong High Plains. The study included areas burnt by fire in 2003, and therefore considers the interactive effects of warming and fire, which have rarely been studied in high mountain environments. From November 2003 to March 2006, various phenological phases were monitored inside and outside chambers during the snow-free periods. Warming resulted in earlier occurrence of key phenological events in 7 of the 14 species studied. Burning altered phenology in 9 of 10 species studied, with both earlier and later phenological changes depending on the species. There were no common phenological responses to warming or burning among species of the same family, growth form or flowering type (i.e. early or late-flowering species), when all phenological events were examined. The proportion of plants that formed flower buds was influenced by fire in half of the species studied. The findings support previous findings of ITEX and other warming experiments; that is, species respond individualistically to experimental warming. The inter-year variation in phenological response, the idiosyncratic nature of the responses to experimental warming among species, and an inherent resilience to fire, may result in community resilience to short-term climate change. In the first 3 years of experimental warming, phenological responses do not appear to be driving community-level change. Our findings emphasise the value of examining multiple species in climate-change studies. © CSIRO 2008.",,"annual variation; climate effect; community response; ecosystem resilience; fire; global warming; heathland; open-top chamber; phenology; subalpine environment; temperature effect; Australasia; Australia; Bogong High Plains; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57749180362

The model is forced hourly with a variety of idealized diurnal wind and cloud profiles to investigate the sensitivity of the diurnal response and its effect on air-sea CO2 transfer at low to moderate wind speeds. In many cases a diurnal warm layer is formed and this affects gas fluxes. The results show that phase-dependent wind speed and cloud fraction with respect to solar insolation are important for determining the magnitude and shape of the diurnal variability and the depth of the diurnal mixed layer. Phasing the wind forcing could double the diurnal temperature difference (e.g. for solar insolation 12 h out of phase with maximum wind stress), and in the same case the net CO2 flux was increased by approximately 30%. Exact calculations of air-sea CO2 flux are compared to simplified calculations based on night-time temperatures, with or without a 'cool-skin' correction and average wind speed. These simplified calculations underestimate the net CO2 flux in a weak source region. When ΔT was at it largest the net daily air-sea CO2 flux was reduced by up to 61.7% if daily average values for wind speed and SST were used, compared to the flux obtained from the 1D model. Short-term wind speed variability leads to large discrepancies as a result of the non-linear relationship between wind speed and CO2 transfer, which is even further enhanced by diurnal processes and subsequent convective enhancement. Irrespective of varying winds or clouds, the formation of a diurnal warm layer has a significant effect on air-sea CO2 transfer resulting in increased ocean degassing.

Using an economic optimization model (MARKAL), we consider drivers including the level of sulfur dioxide emissions constraints set by the government, the cost of capital, the price and available supply of natural gas, and the rate of penetration of advanced technology on both supply and demand sides. The results from the model show that setting strict rules for SO 2 emissions will be instrumental in encouraging the use of natural gas, and may also cause some reduction in CO2 emissions. The currently differentiated cost of capital for various sectors within the Chinese economy, on the other hand, artificially boosts the economics of capitalintensive coal relative to natural gas.

In order to successfully address deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries, a compensation scheme must include the main actors involved in deforestation and provide incentives for forest stewards who protect forest carbon stores. Since each tropical forest country represents a different mix of public and private tenure of forested land, policies at the UNFCCC level will need to be sufficiently flexible to allow countries to tailor REDD programs to reflect these differences. At the same time, Parties need to negotiate a basic REDD structure that can apply to all countries as a framework under which to build their national programs. We propose an approach that will incorporate the three main actors of deforestation and forest protection in tropical regions: government, private forest owners, and public forest stewards (including indigenous people and others). These funds and the activities supported by them are envisoned to function most effectively under a combined market and non-market approach.","Deforestation; Degradation; Forest stewards; Land tenure; Market","climate change; conference proceeding; deforestation; developing world; environmental degradation; environmental protection; forest management; forestry policy; global change; international agreement; land tenure; negotiation process; tropical forest; United Nations",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649148122

Our experience with educators has shown that teachers feel ill-prepared to share the science and implications of climate change research with their students. As a result of the extensive exposure of this topic in the media and the controversy that sometimes surrounds it, teachers are highly motivated to engage in professional development on this subject. A variety of professional development approaches are needed to reach a wide spectrum of educators whose learning preferences and personal and professional constraints may preclude participation in some professional development opportunities. This paper provides lessons learned from successful climate change professional development for teachers, including the importance of inquiry-based curriculum activities, the importance of an opportunity to ""learn by doing"" and to share their perspectives with their colleagues. Finally, development and continuation of the learning community, both among participants as well as with instructors and scientists, provides critical support to classroom educators, who can at times experience a sense of professional isolation.

The article outlines the socio-political climate against which the legislation evolved and demonstrates how its detail engages with, and challenges, key notions at the heart of French republicanism such as, for instance, the public/ private division and questions of kinship, filiation, and the family. Through analysis of the writings of three key figures at the interface of sociological analysis and queer studies in France - FrÉdéric Martel, Eric Fassin, and Maxime Foerster - I examine how same-sex couples have come to act as figureheads for the problematic status of minority groupings more generally. Ultimately, the article seeks to examine whether this legislation can, through the dialogue and debate it has provoked, pave the way for what can be termed 'post-queer' French citizenship, a renegotiation of the relationship between queer citizens and the republic. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","Citizenship; French republicanism; PACS; Post-queer; Same-sex partnerships",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56349161726

The film cooling configuration consists of an upstream slot, representing the leakage flow area between the interface of the combustor and the turbine, and several rows of cylindrical and fan-shaped holes within the passage. With the transient method chosen, the heat transfer and adiabatic film cooling effectiveness distributions can be obtained simultaneously together with the local heat release within the heater foil. Therefore, the heat release in the foil is not required to be uniform, and the foil can contain discrete holes in the film cooling configuration. Some new developments are presented, which are directed towards improved application of the transient heater foil method for such a complex configuration. This includes tailoring the foil heat-release distribution towards the expected heat transfer patterns, supported by numerical Finite-Element computations and the use of a double-TLC mixture for improved time-wise TLC indications. Additionally, CFD-simulations were used to evaluate the recovery temperature distribution through the vane cascade without film cooling. The experiments were performed in the linear cascade facility at the EPFL-Lausanne. A compressor provides a continuous air flow at near-ambient temperature regulated with heat exchangers. Carbon dioxide is used as coolant in order to achieve engine-representative density ratio between coolant and main flow. Multiple experiments with the same main and coolant flow settings but varying heat flux levels and coolant injection temperatures have been performed and simultaneously analysed using nonlinear regression analysis. The time required between successive experiments to return to homogenous initial conditions, as required by the transient method, has been analysed using an analytical solution for heat-on-heat-off conditions. This permits the model assumption of one-dimensional conduction within a semi-infinite wall with a heat releasing layer on the top. Example results for cases without cooling, with film cooling from rows of discrete holes and the addition of slot film cooling are used to illustrate the benefit of the new approaches for the investigated vane cascade.",,"Adiabatic films; Air flow; Analytical solutions; CFD simulations; Complex configuration; Coolant flow; Coolant injection; Density ratio; End-wall; Film cooling; Film cooling configurations; Film cooling effectiveness; Finite-element; Foil technique; Heat release; Initial conditions; Leakage flow; Linear cascade; Local heat; Measurement techniques; Model assumptions; Near-ambient temperatures; New approaches; Non-linear regression analysis; Recovery temperature; Semi-infinite; Shaped holes; Thermochromic liquid crystals; Transient method; Transonic turbine; Turbine vanes; Carbon dioxide; Coal fueled gas turbines; Computational fluid dynamics; Coolants; Engines; Experiments; Heat exchangers; Leakage (fluid); Liquid crystals; Regression analysis; Temperature distribution; Turbines; Cooling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69949115576

Apart from wind, bio, solar and geo-thermal energy development, the most traditional hydro power is still the most predominant forms of new developments. This could be because of both the economical and geographical factors. One of such typical countries is Vietnam who has 40 percent electricity generated by hydro power plant. Because of the huge shortage in Vietnam power supply, which is 600 million kwh for 2007 as a result of fast economic growth, Vietnam has also undergo a fast development of hydro power plant. Another driving force is the added incentive from the carbon financing to these developments. However, a key evaluation leading to successful approval of financing is the estimation of Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR). Although Asian Development Bank (ADB) has given guidelines in evaluating process, there are still large amount of works have to be carried out in estimating the economic, financial, social and environmental benefits in the host country and to quantify these benefits. This paper will present a case study of a recent development of 28MWH hydro power plant with carbon finance option in central Vietnam.

This fact, along with the considerable energy consumption increase during the last 25 years, results in serious difficulties on fulfilling the EU Directives concerning the Large Combustion Plants and the reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions for Greece. On the other hand, renewable energy sources (RES) -like hydro, wind and solar energy- used extensively for electricity production throughout the world, are practically air-pollution free based on a life cycle assessment (LCA). In this context, the objective of the present work is to quantify the pollution caused from the Greek electricity generation system as is now and that avoided with the exploitation of RES. More precisely, the present work investigates the specific air pollution emission factors related with the electricity production from fossil fuels in Greece, estimates the air pollution avoided due to the exploitation of the available hydro and wind potential on annual basis since 1990 and the corresponding potential contribution of RES to significantly reducing the above mentioned pollutants. The results of the work indicate that the RES may, in the near future, contribute significantly to minimizing the environmental impacts of the electricity generation sector, including the emissions of CO2 and other various harmful gases, at rational investment cost. © by PSP 2008.","Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Electricity generation; Fossil fuels; Greece; Nitrogen oxides; Sulphur dioxide","atmospheric pollution; cost-benefit analysis; electricity generation; environmental effect; greenhouse gas; investment; life cycle analysis; lignite; pollution control; renewable resource; Eurasia; Europe; Greece; Southern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56849096341

To predict soot emission parameters, a gas-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) precursor formation model was coupled with a detailed phenomenological particle formation model, including soot nucleation from the precursors, surface growth/ oxidation, and particle coagulation, since changes in the surface area of particles and surface reaction rates had to be taken into account. In order to predict NOx emission parameters, the extended Zeldovich (thermal), intermediate N2O and NO2 from NO formation mechanisms were also included in the modelled elementary reactions. From the numerical simulation results, it was shown that the present code had sufficient performance for predicting the amount of exhaust soot and NOx with practical central processing unit (CPU) time. Comparison of the results of the numerical simulations with data obtained from empirical tests show that the applied code provides adequate predictions of soot and NOx emissions for engine design and optimization within practical CPU times. The results also show that the EGR rate does not greatly affect the soot surface growth rate, although it was previously thought to be a major determinant of soot masses. Instead, soot oxidation rates, especially rates of oxidation by OH radicals, were found to be the most influential factors affecting soot emissions under the tested engine operating conditions. © IMechE 2008.","Combustion simulation; Detailed chemistry; Diesel engine; KIVA-3V; Soot formation","Diesel engines; Models; Numerical analysis; Three dimensional; Combustion simulation; Detailed chemistry; Diesel engine; KIVA-3V; Soot formation; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50849140206

These deficiencies are, to a large extent, overcome with the recent development of the variable-focusing retarding field energy analyzer (RFEA), which has a cylindrical focusing electrode preceding the planar retarding grid. The principal concept of this analyzer is conversion of a divergent charged particle beam into a quasiparallel beam before analyzing it by the planar retarding field. This allows analysis of the beam particle total kinetic energy distribution with greatly improved energy resolution. Whereas this concept was first applied to analyze 5-10 keV pulsed electron beams, the present authors have adapted it to analyze the energy distribution of a low energy (≤1 KeV) broad ion beam. In this paper we describe the RFEA design, which was modified from the original, mainly as required by the specifics of broad ion beam energy analysis, and the device experimental characterization and modeling results. Among the modifications, an orifice electrode placed in front of the RFEA provides better spatial resolution of the broad ion beam ion optics emission region and reduces the beam plasma density in the vicinity of analyzer entry. An electron repeller grid placed in front of the RFEA collector was found critical for suppressing secondary electrons, both those incoming to the collector and those released from its surface, and improved energy spectrum measurement repeatability and accuracy. The use of finer mesh single- and double-grid retarding structures reduces the retarding grid lens effect and improves the analyzer energy resolution and accuracy of the measured spectrum mean energy. However, additional analyzer component and configuration improvements did not further change the analyzed IEDF shape or mean energy value. This led us to conclude that the optimized analyzer construction provides an energy resolution considerably narrower than the investigated ion beam energy spectrum full width at half maximum, and the derived energy spectrum is an objective and accurate representation of the analyzed broad ion beam energy distribution characteristics. A quantitative study of the focusing voltage and retarding grid field effects based on the experimental data and modeling results have supported this conclusion. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54749157444

One such treatment involves the use of thermal or kinetic energy to vaporize the hydrocarbon component. The oil content of the treated cuttings is reduced and the material classified as non-hazardous for re-use or disposal. The vaporized hydrocarbon fraction is condensed, separated and collected for re-use as a base for new drilling fluids. The recovered oil from such processes is often dark with a strong odor due to degradation of components in the drilling fluid. Oxidation processes however can reduce the color intensity and remove offensive odors to produce oil with improved properties for re-use. For example, ozone is a powerful oxidizing agent used in thousands of municipal plants, commercial and industrial installations as an oxidant. Injection of an ozone stream into the oil promotes reaction via direct and indirect oxidation mechanisms to remove the malodorous compounds. Laboratory-scale testing identified controlling parameters for ozone treatment of oil and allowed development of a larger treatment system. A corona discharge is used to apply energy to oxygen-bearing gas to produce ozone at the desired concentration. The ozone is injected into a continuous flow of oil passing through a vessel where the oxidation reactions occur. This paper presents data from lab and field studies showing the effectiveness of the treatment system, the improvement of color and odor of treated oil and the enhancement to cuttings treatment technology.",,"Color intensities; Continuous flows; Controlling parameters; Corona discharges; Field studies; Hydrocarbon components; Hydrocarbon contents; Hydrocarbon fractions; Industrial installations; Malodorous compounds; Oil contents; Oil recycling; Oxidation mechanisms; Oxidation processes; Oxidation reactions; Oxidizing agents; Ozone treatments; Treatment systems; Treatment technologies; Chemical oxygen demand; Concentration (process); Drilling; Electric corona; Emulsification; Gases; Heat treatment; Hydrocarbons; Industrial plants; Oil well drilling; Oil well drilling equipment; Oil well production; Organic compounds; Oxidation; Oxidation resistance; Oxygen; Ozone; Waste management; Waste treatment; Wastewater treatment; Well drilling; Drilling fluids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55849101173

The motivation for estimating historical inventories of cement stocks and flows is to provide accurate estimates of contemporary cement in-use stocks in U.S. infrastructure and future discards to relevant stakeholders in U.S. infrastructure, such as the federal and state highway administrators, departments of transportation, public and private utilities, and the construction and cement industries. Such information will assist in planning future rehabilitation projects and better life cycle management of infrastructure systems. In the present policy environment of climate negotiations, estimates of in-use cement infrastructure can provide insights about to what extent built environment can act as a carbon sink over its lifetime. The rate of addition of new stock, its composition, and the repair of existing stock are key determinants of infrastructure sustainability. Based upon a probability of failure approach, a dynamic stock and flow model was developed utilizing three statistical lifetime distributions - Weibull, gamma, and lognormal - for each cement end-use. The model-derived estimate of the ""in-use"" cement stocks in the United States is in the range of 4.2 to 4.4 billion metric tons (gigatonnes, Gt). This indicates that 82% to 87% of cement utilized during the last century is still in use. On a per capita basis, this is equivalent to 14.3 to 15.0 tonnes of in-use cement stock per person. The in-use cement stock per capita has doubled over the last 50 years, although the rate of growth has slowed. © 2008 by Yale University.","Industrial ecology; Infrastructure; Lifetime distribution; Material flow analysis (MFA); Probability of failure; Substance flow analysis","Cements; Failure analysis; Information management; Sustainable development; Weibull distribution; Industrial ecology; Infrastructure; Life-time distribution; Material flow analysis; Probability of failure; Substance flow analysis; Cement industry; carbon sink; cement; environmental policy; flow modeling; infrastructure; inventory; life cycle analysis; sustainability; twentieth century; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56749154572

A prerequisite to IWRM is the sound management of water resources system components. Reservoirs play a major role in droughts impacts mitigation especially in arid and semi arid regions where there is too much difference between water supply and demand. Using hedging rules beside water allocation policies and traditional rule curves, reduces the magnitude of water shortages during droughts. Hedging rules curtail deliveries over some range of water supply to retain storage for use in the next dry periods and provide assurances for higher priority water uses. Hedging rules are used when reservoir has low refill potential or uncertain inflows. In the present paper, Ahar-chay basin in the northwest of Iran has been considered as the case study. Historical climatologic and hydrologic data in this basin shows that it has experienced a drought event during years 1998-2006. This drought has highly affected the available water resources of the basin. The Sattarkhan dam is the only available surface water resource in the study area. The optimization model that incorporates hedging rules and the classical rule curves is developed for modifying the water allocation in drought periods. The composite objective function of the models is to minimize the shortages of demand supply and maximize the water storage volume in the reservoir. The results of applying the proposed reservoir operating model are compared with the results of a deterministic model optimized by Genetic Algorithm (GA). The extent at which a storage facility meets the demands has been measured by performance indices and the efficiency of the hedging rule in modifying the normal operation policies. The results show that using the hedging rules can decrease the shortage magnitude and expected drought damages considerably. © 2008 ASCE.","Algorithms; Droughts; Optimization models","Arid and semi-arid regions; Available water; Composite objective function; Contingency planning; Deterministic models; Drought periods; Hedging rules; Hydrologic data; Integrated water resources management; Normal operations; Optimization models; Performance indices; Sound management; Storage facilities; Study areas; Supply and demand; Water allocations; Water resources systems; Water shortages; Water storage; Water use; Arid regions; Curve fitting; Drought; Genetic algorithms; Mathematical models; Optimization; Water management; Water supply; Reservoirs (water)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79251474378

Today's green city now evokes not only a city that is physically greening its streets and its public and private spaces and byways, but also one that strategically embraces development of renewable energy, less-polluting fuels, widely available local food, efficient public transit, innovative treatment of wastes, polluted land and water, walkability, sufficient affordable housing, and green buildings. As recently as the mid-1980s, a ""green city"" was thought of solely as a city with a high concentration of street trees, parks, lawns, and green spaces. Whether a city had significant contaminated industrial sites, street or sidewalk litter problems, or noticeable air and water pollution might be additional criteria for judgment. The actors responsible for managing such issues included a patchwork of unaffiliated organizations or individuals: horticultural societies for tree planting and public space greening; public works and recreation departments for street greening and park maintenance; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for overseeing contaminated industrial site remediation and for penalizing air and water polluters; and city public works departments for litter control. After 1987, a systems-based perspective of green or ""sustainable"" cities began to emerge in the wake of the work of the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development (known as the Brundtland Commission after its chair, Gro Harlem Brundtland). The Brundtland Commission's definition of sustainable development- ""development that meets the needs of present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs""-broadened thinking to include not only quality-of-life and environmental analysis, but also ushered in an era of sophisticated rating systems, employing scientific, technical and economic measures, and comprehensive and specific policy goals and planning initiatives (""Our Common Journey"" 1987). In addition, the recent findings of the fourth UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Sustainable Development are prompting local assessments of greenhouse gas carbon emissions mitigation. These findings have also promoted localities to develop strategies to adapt to localized climate change effects that are expected to produce impacts on urban areas, including increased and more severe flooding, drought, and wildfires (WMO and UNEP 2007). Many states and cities are now involved in rigorous carbon emission inventories and carbon reduction action plans. The state of California and the cities of Portland, Oregon, Seattle, and New York are leaders in the practice of devising carbon greenhouse gas emissions inventories and mitigation action plans. The International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), an organization with more than 650 local governments involved in the Cities for Climate Protection Campaign, has also been an important participant in helping local governments devise carbon emission inventory and reduction standards and practices.1 While defining a green city or sustainable city is becoming conceptually clearer, evaluating ""greenness"" or sustainability across cities on a comparative basis is more difficult. Differing approaches have advantages and limitations. The term ""green city"" continues to undergo evolution, complicating longitudinal measurements.

This allowed CPChem to reduce stack heat losses as well as NOx emissions in the cracking heaters, while completely idling a low efficiency steam superheater and avoiding the NOx generated therein. Technical and design issues were addressed by a team incorporating members of CPChem; Lummus Technology Heat Transfer, who provided the heater thermal and mechanical design; and KBR, who engineered the ammonia delivery system and erected the new convection modules. Significant design issues needed to be addressed, in terms of the design of the ammonia delivery system and the Ammonia Injection Grid (AIG). As the revamp of the convection sections required additional heating surface for higher thermal efficiency and also new services (steam superheat), the height of the convection section would increase by 30 feet over the existing design. The associated increases in dead weight and wind load imposed on the structural members and foundations were concerns that ultimately required some additional bracing and fortifications of the supporting steel. In order to minimize the overall height, a very compact design was developed for the AIG that allowed it to be located a short six feet below the catalyst face. Heat transfer surface was located between the AIG and catalyst face to further reduce the height and promote mixing of the dilute ammonia with flue gas. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modelling allowed the grid design to be optimized for ammonia mixing, while external controls allowed the ammonia distribution to be biased to match any potential NOx maldistribution. Project execution planning for a major revamp in an operating unit, while minimizing lost production due to heater downtime, is key to any cracking heater SCR retrofit. Detailed and specific execution planning allowed 12 of the 13 cracking furnaces to be revamped in a 122-day period surrounding the plant turnaround, with eight of these furnaces revamped during the 52-day turnaround while the plant was down. The ethylene plant steam and fuel balances were impacted significantly by the revamp and the shutdown of the low efficiency steam superheater. The overall thermal efficiency of the cracker was improved from 83% to 92% LHV. Net fuel consumption was decreased by 150 MMBtu/hr (firing avoided), at equal throughput.

Elevated CO2 effects on C4 plants, though smaller than on C3 species, are mediated mostly via decreased stomatal conductance and thus water loss. Therefore, we characterized the interactive effect of elevated CO2 and drought on soil microbial communities associated with a dominant C4 prairie grass, Andropogon gerardii Vitman. Elevated CO2 and drought both affected resources available to the soil microbial community. For example, elevated CO2 increased the soil C:N ratio and water content during drought, whereas drought alone decreased both. Drought significantly decreased soil microbial biomass. In contrast, elevated CO2 increased biomass while ameliorating biomass decreases that were induced under drought. Total and active direct bacterial counts and carbon substrate use (overall use and number of used sources) increased significantly under elevated CO2. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that drought and elevated CO2, singly and combined, did not affect the soil bacteria community structure. We conclude that elevated CO2 alone increased bacterial abundance and microbial activity and carbon use, probably in response to increased root exudation. Elevated CO2 also limited drought-related impacts on microbial activity and biomass, which likely resulted from decreased plant water use under elevated CO2.

Thus, the wet soil at the lower end of the catchment is a functional site for the scavenging for NO3"" and N2O. Nitrite reductase gene (nirK and nirS) fragments from these soils were PCR amplified, cloned, and sequenced. Both nirK and nirS fragments were detected in the wet soil, whereas only nirK fragments were detected in the dry soil. All the nirK and nirS clones showed less than 90% similarity to known clones. Numerous operational taxonomic units for nirK and nirS were found in the wet soil. Considerable diversification within the largest clade on the nirK phylogenetic tree, which contained no known sequence, was observed in wet soil.

Biodiesel is usually blended to conventional diesel fuel in various proportions. It is possible that this biodiesel blending causes the problems on emission characteristics of modern diesel engine, because it could be confirmed that the application of neat biodiesel to modern diesel engines whose control parameters were optimized for conventional diesel fuel deteriorated the emission performances. It is necessary to clarify the effect of biodiesel blending on exhaust emissions of modern diesel engine. Rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) was selected as a biodiesel used in this study. Biodiesel blended fuels were applied to the multi-cylinder light-duty diesel engine which included the various latest technologies for low emission (e.g. common-rail injection system, cooled-EGR system, variable geometry turbocharger (VGT), and aftertreatment systems). RME blending increased in engine-out NOx emission, as mentioned by many researchers. The main reason for that is a decrease in EGR rate with blending RME. In addition, an increase in NOx emission by RME blending was clarified more at tail-pipe, because the rich spike blended with RME for lean NOx trap (LNT) degraded the NOx reduction performance of LNT. An increase in oxygen content in the fuel with blending RME caused the drastic reduction of engine-out smoke emission, but high blending rate of RME increased tail-pipe PM emission. This is caused by an increase in soluble organic fraction (SOF) emission derived from poor volatility of rich spike which contains the large amount of RME. The results of JE05 transient mode test showed the same tendency of tail-pipe emissions at steady-state operation as mentioned above. These test results denoted that biodiesel blending led to a simultaneous increase in NOx and PM emissions of modern diesel engine without engine modifications. However, the optimizations of intake air and rich spike injection conditions according to blending rate of biodiesel will make it possible to meet the future emission regulations. © 2008 SAE International.",,"Air intakes; Alternative fuels; Biodiesel; Blending; Diesel fuels; Engine cylinders; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Powertrains; Aftertreatment systems; Biodiesel-blended fuels; Common rail injection system; Emission characteristics; Light-duty diesel engines; Rapeseed oil methyl ester; Soluble organic fraction; Variable geometry turbocharger; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072456391

This is due primarily to several counties which have opposed this practice and enacted ordinances that severely restrict or ban it. As a result, many wastewater agencies are concerned that this practice may soon disappear. Southern California agencies have been hauling Class B biosolids to Arizona and Nevada since 2003, but these options are not guaranteed for the long term. Meanwhile, California and its two largest cities have set aggressive goals for increasing the amount of energy produced from renewable sources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Several California wastewater agencies have constructed thermal treatment technologies, such as direct thermal drying and incineration, as an alternative way to manage their biosolids. Although these are proven technologies, they are relatively expensive and energy inefficient. Now a new technology has emerged that is capable of economically producing a renewable fuel using much less energy. EnerTech is constructing an 883 wet tons per day regional biosolids processing facility in Rialto, California that should start receiving biosolids in September 2008. The energy efficient SlurryCarb™ process will produce a renewable fuel which will be used in lieu of coal in a cement kiln. This unique beneficial use reduces fossil fuel and raw material consumption and provides permanent recycling of the biosolids. This paper will describe the process, discuss its energy efficiency, and provide an update on construction of the Rialto facility.","Biosolids; Carbonization; Heat treatment; Renewable fuel; SlurryCarb™","Agricultural lands; Arizona; Beneficial uses; California; Cement kilns; Class B biosolids; Energy-efficient; Greenhouse gasses; Long terms; New technologies; Processing facilities; Raw material consumptions; Renewable fuel; Renewable fuels; Renewable sources; Southern california; Thermal treatments; Air pollution; Air pollution control; Biological materials; Biosolids; Carbonization; Chemical oxygen demand; Coal; Dewatering; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Heat treatment; Incineration; Kilns; Technology; Waste incineration; Waste management; Waste treatment; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55849125129

How can radical change be integrated with heritage interests as strong as these? This paper describes an ambitious attempt to create a 21 st century carbon-neutral future within a very regulated aesthetic. Nelson, as a Victorian boom-town, has no public space, and the housing is mainly terraces without gardens. The brief was to make difference without changing the historic character of the area. The competition-winning scheme for the Whitefield ward by CityLab and Maccreanor-Lavington starts with the insertion of a much-needed public space; this has several functions: It links the town with the canal; provides a pedestrian link to school and creates an edge to the town centre. However, beneath it, lie large water tanks that act as an inter-seasonal store. To regenerate the city as a sustainable entity, it is necessary to reduce dramatically its carbon footprint. The heritage-led constraints limit opportunities to reconfigure anything, so the design-team focussed on the co-generation of heat and power, using bio-diesel produced from waste cooking oil. The main issue with co-generation, is how to equalise the demands between the need for more heat in winter and the constant demand for electricity. The solution, is to use waste heat in summer to heat a large thermal store, which can then be used in winter - thus regulating the demand between seasons, and optimising the efficiency of the plant. With the CHP plant adjacent and the inter-seasonal store beneath and its urban design functions, the public space can be seen as a total sustainable solution to a complex political, social and ecological condition.","Heritage; Interseasonal; Urban design","Carbon footprint; Waste heat; Water tanks; Britain; CHP plant; Co-generation; Co-generation of heat and power; Ecological conditions; Heritage; Interseasonal; Public space; Sustainable solution; Thermal store; Town centre; Urban design; Waste cooking oil; Carbon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067740737

The perception that these materials are free and limitless, however, has undermined the actual value of healthy natural resources. In recent years this perception has begun to change. The high prices of petroleum and natural gas are invigorating the market for alternative energy technologies and products. The recently established CO2 trade community has brought economic value to reducing emissions. A similar identification of the value of clean water sources and reliable water infrastructure is needed to promote stronger water resource management practices. According to the World Bank, water should be thought of ""as a commodity, and full cost should be recovered for its supply, which would then, one hopes, amount to some kind of financial accountability in terms of supply costs, and presumably lead to improved efficiency"" (Mau and Leonard 2004). If the costs and benefits of water infrastructure are known and are accurately quantified and compared, then users and decision-makers will be better able to make profitable decisions. The Center for Neighborhood Technology (CNT), a Chicago-based nonprofit corporation that promotes the development of environmentally and economically equitable and sustainable communities, is supporting ""green"" or alternative stormwater management methods that can capitalize on the hidden assets of the urban environment by creating working landscapes in spaces that would be otherwise bare or would be green, but designed for aesthetic value alone. To this end, CNT has developed a quantitative tool, the Green Values Calculator, to compare the hydrologic and financial costs and benefits of green infrastructure to those of conventional stormwater management. With the value economics of stormwater management clear, determining and electing the improvement method that yields the maximum ecological and financial benefit can follow. Knowing the economic value of green infrastructure can lead to policy and behavior change. The Green Values Calculator provides a tool to inform the full spectrum of stormwater management decision-makers from elected officials to citizens. The calculator can be used to produce specific quantitative data desired by government officials and civil servants, support the implementation of green infrastructure on a municipal scale, and develop qualitative information that explains the benefits of green infrastructure to the citizens considering green infrastructure features for their individual properties.

US cities, followed a long way behind by Canadian and Australian cities, are the heaviest passenger transport energy users and CO2 producers from transport in the world, while Chinese cities are the lowest. The patterns demonstrate the energy and CO2 reduction potential of reducing the role of the automobile in urban transport systems and enhancing the role of public transport and non-motorized modes. Motorcycles are also relatively energy- and CO2-efficient modes, but they are associated with high local smog emissions, noise, and traffic danger, which can detract from their energy and greenhouse benefits. Urban passenger transport energy use and CO2 emissions can be linked directly and indirectly to a host of factors. Some significant factors found internationally include the extent and quality of the public transport system, especially the kilometers of dedicated public transport right-of-way and the amount of service provided by urban rail systems. Lower income cities provide comparatively high levels of public transport service, but little of it is rail. Freeways and high levels of parking in the CBD are associated with higher energy use and CO2 emissions in cities. Minimizing such infrastructure in cities will give energy and CO2 benefits. Passenger transport energy use and CO2 are of course dependent upon the modal share between private, public and non-motorized modes, but also upon the relative energy use of different modes. © 2008 Copyright © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Secondary inorganic aerosols like sulphate, nitrate and ammonium are related to emission and transformation of gaseous species, SO2, NOx and NH3, respectively. Secondary organic aerosol is related to emission and transformation of VOC, while elemental carbon and primary organic compounds stem from direct emissions and the mineral fraction from dust entrainment. Thus, PM10 concentrations are determined by different sources at different distances from a considered receptor site. The aim of this study is to analyse the importance of an extended urban agglomeration for the pollution in the rural surrounding areas and, vice versa, the relevance of remote sources for PM levels in the urban background. It could be shown that PM10 concentration levels in urban environment are influenced by long range transport form remote source areas. However, the same holds for rural background concentration levels which are strongly determined by urban emissions. High resolution measurements have shown that long range transport is responsible for up to 70% of the city PM10 background. The Aerosol Chemistry Transport Model REM_Calgrid (RCG) has been used to simulate the impact of local and remote emissions on the PM10 concentration field. Berlin emissions have been switched off in order to estimate the local influence on the surroundings areas. It has been shown that two thirds of the urban background concentration in the Berlin’s centre and one third of the PM10 levels in the suburbs are due to Berlin-specific PM10 and PM-precursor emissions. While only 10% of the secondary inorganic and organic aerosol concentrations in the city can be traced back to city-related emissions, more than 60% of primary particles in the centre and only 30% at the outskirts come from city sources. On the other hand, city-related emissions influence homogenously the rural air-pollution concentrations. In conclusion, while abatement measures to curb primary PM10 emissions ought to be focused on urban agglomerations, large scale coordinated emission control of precursor components of secondary PM would contribute to an essential reduction of the widespread exposure of the urban and the rural population to PM10. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2008.","Aerosol concentration; Emission reduction potential; Urban environment",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862739656

Realities include: relevant technological understanding lies mostly in the oil and gas sector, with the principle opportunity for CO2 capture lying in the power sector; lack of certainty surrounding technological improvement, legal and regulatory framework, policy drivers, and public acceptance and support; etc. Policy drivers and economics bases are not yet sufficient to overcome the added costs of CCS and animate CCS business models. Thus, there is currently no broadly viable business model for large-scale deployment of CCS. Institutions to govern and regulate potential CCS business are not fully developed, and in some regions they are non-existent.

The scope of this research focused on energy intensive operations such as subsoiling which are required to alleviate soil compaction often found in the Southeastern United States. An experiment was performed to investigate the effects of 3 different transmission gear selections on two different subsoiling implements. Three separate gears were chosen to achieve slow, normal, and fast operating speeds. The implements included a Kelley Manufacturing Company (KMC) in-row subsoiler and a Bigham Brothers Paratill™ both in 6 row configurations pulled by a John Deere 8300 MFWD agricultural tractor. Results indicated a 105% increase in fuel consumption rate, a 28% increase in implement draft, and a 255% increase in power between the slow and fast speed for the Paratill™ The KMC showed a 115% increase in fuel consumption rate, a 37% increase in implement draft, and a 283% increase in power between the slow and fast speeds.

These applications are very sensitive to measurement errors, and careful accuracy evaluations are mandatory. The dataset of the International H2O Project (IHOP_2002) gave a first opportunity for intercomparisons since three airborne lidar systems including the DLR DIAL participated. The overall biases between the lidar water vapor profiles are smaller than 10 % and confirm previous estimates of instrumental accuracies. Latent heat flux profiles in the convective boundary layer were obtained for the first time with this system and a wind lidar, both installed on board the DLR Falcon research aircraft during IHOP_2002 over the U.S. Southern Great Plains. The flux profiles range from 300 to 2500 m above ground and are computed from high spatial resolution (150 m horizontal and vertical) two-dimensional water vapor and vertical wind cross sections using the eddy covariance technique. A maximum of 700 ± 200 W/m2 is found at the boundary layer top, with a pronounced flux divergence indicative of boundary layer drying and consistent with observations by other instruments. The data allow statistical analyses of turbulence properties and a water vapor budget analysis, within the limits of the flux sampling uncertainty (55 %), instrument noise (15 %) and systematic uncertainties (7 %) encountered in that case study. Water vapor measurements in the tropical upper troposphere are a prerequisite to better understand the processes that govern stratospheric water vapor concentrations and trends in the context of a changing climate. They are sparse because of instrumental shortcomings and observational challenges. Therefore, the DLR DIAL participated in the Tropical Convection, Cirrus and Nitrogen Oxides Experiment (TROCCINOX) in 2004 and 2005 in Brazil to perform the first aircraft DIAL measurements in the tropical upper troposphere and the mid-latitudes lower stratosphere. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the DIAL profiles have an accuracy of ~5 % within altitudes of 8 and 16 km, and intercomparisons with in situ instruments confirm this encouraging result. In particular, the DIAL is found to have no altitude- or latitude-dependent bias. The DIAL profiles exhibit a smooth exponential decrease in water vapor mixing ratio in the tropical tropopause layer at altitudes from 11 km up to 16 km where the hygropause is located at a minimum mixing ratio of ∼2.5 μmol/mol. A high-resolution (2 km horizontal, ∼200 m vertical) DIAL cross section through the anvil outflow region of tropical convection shows that the ambient humidity is increased by a factor of three across 100 km. A promising platform for DIAL in the future is a low Earth orbit satellite. Space-borne integrated path differential absorption lidar would allow global observations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, important greenhouse gases whose concentrations are severely influenced by human activities. Measurements in the wings of absorption lines can provide column concentration measurements with a weighting function peaking near the surface. Performance simulations reveal that moderate-size instruments with a telescope aperture of 0.5 - 1.5 m and an average laser power of 0.4 4 W are basically able to fulfill the observational requirements of the scientific community for the analysis of surface greenhouse gas sources and sinks. The resulting measurement accuracy is 0.2 - 0.4 % for carbon dioxide, 0.4 - 0.6 % for methane and 0.3 % for nitrous oxide. A sensitivity analysis investigates various potential sources of systematic errors that amount to 0.08 % for carbon dioxide. Although challenging instrument requirements still exist, spaceborne DIAL can become a reality thanks to the steady improvement of laser accuracy, efficiency, and reliability. The general objective of this thesis is to document the quality of present airborne and future spaceborne DIAL and to highlight examples of meteorological applications.","Atmospheric boundary layer; Differential-Absorptions-Lidar (DIAL); Tropical tropopause layer (TTI); Water vapor","Absorption lines; Accuracy evaluations; Airborne lidar systems; Ambient humidities; Applications.; Atmospheric boundary layer; Case studies; Concentration measurements; Convective boundary layers; Cross sections; Differential absorption lidars; Differential-Absorptions-Lidar (DIAL); Eddy covariances; Flux divergences; Global observations; Greenhouse gasses; High resolutions; Human activities; In-situ; Instrument noises; Laser powers; Latent heat fluxes; Lidar measurements; Low earth orbit satellites; Lower stratospheres; Measurement accuracies; Meteorological phenomenons; Mixing ratios; Nitrous oxides; Out-flows; Performance simulations; Potential sources; Pre-requisites; Scientific communities; Short-comings; Southern great plains; Space borne; Spatial resolutions; Statistical analysis; Systematic uncertainties; Telescope apertures; Tropical convections; Tropical tropopause layer (TTI); Tropical tropopause layers; Tropospheric humidities; Turbulence properties; Upper tropospheres; Vertical winds; Water vapor concentrations; Water vapor measurements; Water vapor mixing ratios; Water vapor profiles; Weighting functions; Wind lidars; Absorption; Aerodynamics; Aircraft; Anesthetics; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric optics; Atmospherics; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Clouds; Concentration (process); Dewatering; Drag reduction; Errors; Fluxes; Forestry; Gas absorption; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Heat flux; Heating equipment; Hydrodynamics; Instruments; Latent heat; Measurement errors; Measurements; Meteorology; Methane; Mixing; Moisture; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Optical radar; Orbits; Oxides; Photography; Pulsed laser deposition; Research aircraft; Satellite observatories; Security of data; Sensitivity analysis; Spacecraft observatories; Sulfur compounds; Systematic errors; Tropical engineering; Tropics; Troposphere; Two dimensional; Uncertainty analysis; Vapors; Water absorption; Water analysis; Water content; Water vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56249087252

Mixing ratios of methane (CH4) and carbon monoxide (CO) at 8&amp;ndash;11 km altitude over the North Atlantic were elevated to 1843 ppbv and 134 ppbv respectively, while those of carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbonyl sulfide (COS) were reduced to 372.4 ppmv and 411 pptv respectively. In this region, urban and industrial influences were evidenced by elevated mixing ratios and good linear relationships between urban and industrial tracers compared to North Atlantic background air. Moreover, low mixing ratios and a good correlation between COS and CO2 showed a fingerprint of terrestrial uptake and minimal dilution during rapid transport over a 1&amp;ndash;2 day time period. Analysis of synoptic conditions, backward trajectories, and photochemical aging estimates based on C3H8/C 2H6 strongly suggested that elevated anthropogenic tracers in the upper troposphere of the flight region were the result of transport via convection and warm conveyor belt (WCB) uplifting of boundary layer air over the southeastern US. This mechanism is supported by the similar slope values of linear correlations between long-lived (months) anthropogenic tracers (e.g., C2Cl4 and CHCl3) from the flight region and the planetary boundary layer in the southeastern US. In addition, the aircraft measurements suggest that outflow from the US augmented the entire tropospheric column at mid-latitudes over the North Atlantic. Overall, the flight 13 data demonstrate a pervasive impact of US anthropogenic emissions on the troposphere over the North Atlantic.",,"airborne survey; atmospheric chemistry; boundary layer; carbon dioxide; carbonyl compound; measurement method; outflow; sulfide; troposphere; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41849151134

The government strictly enforces the implementation of emission standards to severely polluted industrial complexes designated as areas which need special control. Air quality regulation zones were designated based on regional air pollution levels. To reduce the SO2 concentration in the metropolitan areas including Seoul, the Ministry of Environment has strengthened the standard for sulfur content in fuels in stages since 1981, and is gradually expanding areas using the low-sulfur fuel. From 1985, the use of solid fuel like coal, coke, and combustible waste was prohibited in areas that exceed or are likely to exceed environmental standards. As the quality of the vehicle fuel is closely related to vehicle emissions, fuel standards were strengthened since 1991.

Until now, most of the monitoring methods has been used in an univariate approach which measures and monitors a single pollutant, such as particular matter(PM2.5 or PM10). Since it has a correlation relationship between variables, this study focuses on a multivariate statistical monitoring method for monitoring the indoor air quality in a subway. The proposed method consists of three main components: (1) principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of multivariate air pollutant data and to remove collinearity; (2) global model to monitor nine real-time air pollution data and diagnose the status of indoor air quality during one year; (3) local models to keep track of the seasonal variations of air pollutants. The seasonal models are suggested to consider the variations of the pollutant concentration according to the climate change in Korea. The multivariate monitoring method is applied to a real time TMS dataset of nine air pollutants in a real subway station. It shows the accurate and reliable result of air pollutants in a subway over univariate monitoring, which can significantly enhance the power of the monitoring system. And the seasonal models allow to isolate the characteristics of the seasonal variations for specific monitoring of air pollutants. The multivariate approach is useful to check the indoor air quality status using all information of the sensors and to predict effects of indoor air pollutants to the passenger's health.","Air quality monitoring; Health effect; Multivariate data analysis; Principal component analysis (PCA); Seasonal model; Subway station","Air pollution; Air quality; Climate change; Climatology; Flow of gases; Functional electric stimulation; Health; Indoor air pollution; Modal analysis; Monitoring; Multivariant analysis; Permanent magnets; Pollution; Quality control; Railroads; Statistical methods; Subway stations; Underpasses; Air quality monitoring; Health effect; Multivariate data analysis; Principal component analysis (PCA); Seasonal model; Principal component analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149101200

With the proper changes in the operational paradigm, it could generate and deliver the necessary energy to fuel the majority of the U.S. light-duty vehicle (LDV) fleet. In doing so, it would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve the economics of the electricity industry, and reduce the U.S. dependency on foreign oil. This paper estimates the regional percentages of the energy requirements for the U.S. LDV stock that could potentially be supported by the existing infrastructure, based on the 12 modified North American electric Reliability Council regions, as of 2002. For the United States as a whole, about 73% of LDV fleet in the U.S. could be supported by the existing infrastructure with some degree of load management. This has an estimated gasoline displacement potential of 6.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, or approximately 52% of the nation's oil imports. The paper also discusses the impact on overall emissions of criteria gases and greenhouse gases as a result of shifting emissions from millions of individual vehicles to a few hundred power plants. Overall, PHEVs could reduce greenhouse gas emissions with regional variations dependent on the local generation mix. Total NO x emissions may or may not increase, dependent on the use of coal generation in the region. Any additional SO 2 emissions associated with the expected increase in generation from coal power plants would need to be cleaned up to meet the existing SO 2 emissions constraints. Particulate emissions would increase in 8 of the 12 regions. The emissions in urban areas arc found to improve across all pollutants and regions as the emission sources shift from millions of tailpipes to a smaller number of large power plants in less-populated areas. This paper concludes with a discussion about possible grid impacts as a result of the PHEV load.","Electric grid impacts; Emissions; Gasoline displacement; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV)","Coal generation; Coal power plants; Displacement potentials; Electric grids; Electric power infrastructure; Electricity industry; Emission sources; Energy requirements; Generation mix; Light duty vehicles; North American electric reliability councils; Oil import; Plugin hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV); Regional variation; Shifting emission; Urban areas; Well-to-wheel analysis; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Particulate emissions; Power plants; Sulfur dioxide; Vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866128874

A single cylinder engine test and three dimensional numerical analysis were carried out in order to obtain necessary and useful information for designing a combustion chamber and a fuel injection nozzle that could realize reduced smoke emission. This study is focused particularly on the behavior of the fuel spray which impinges on the piston cavity wall in the case of a reentrant type combustion bowl. As a result, it was found that the spray wall-impingement angle performs an important role in promoting fuel-air mixing. It is thus an important parameter which controls the main combustion region. It was also found that the optimized spray wall-impingement angle contributes to the efficient utilization of the air trapped in the cylinder, leading to a reduction in smoke emission. © 2008 SAE International.",,"Combustion chambers; Engine cylinders; Fuel economy; Fuels; Nozzle design; Powertrains; Smoke; DI diesel engine; Fuel injection nozzle; Fuel-air mixing; Gas regulations; Heavy duty vehicles; Single cylinder engine; Spray wall impingement; Three-dimensional numerical analysis; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072468338

Post Pleistocene movements of most plants and animals into the region have generally followed East and North Greenland coastal routes, and the majority of the plants have North American affinities. Climatic change, bringing about reduction in the extent of sea ice adjacent to the coast and changes in seasonality and associated precipitation and air movements, influences patterns of activity, growth, reproduction, and dispersal of all life forms present. Climate-associated changes in the biotic communities of the region are altering inter-species interactions, notably pollination, seed dispersal and plant-herbivore relations. Sexual reproduction and dispersal of propagules, primarily seeds, are essential processes underlying maintenance of genetic diversity in plant communities in Northeast Greenland. Wind and water transport of seeds are primary methods by which plants disperse and become established in the High Arctic, particularly at shorter distances. Birds and mammals are also involved and may be of particular significance to long-distance seed dispersal. In Northeast Greenland, dispersal of viable seeds may frequently occur by passage through the guts of geese and musk oxen. Research at Zackenberg on the role of insects in pollination of flowering plants has shown that Diptera species, primarily flies, dominate among the insect species visiting flowers each summer. Diptera, Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Hymenoptera (bumble bees and small wasps), and one Hemiptera (true bugs) species have constituted the primary pollinators at Zackenberg. Arctic willow Salix arctica, white arctic bell heather Cassiope tetragona, and mountain avens Dryas octopetala are the primary species represented in the pollen present on pollinating insects at Zackenberg. The effects of climate warming that may enhance environmental conditions for plant growth in Northeast Greenland and accelerate invasion of new species will also be tied to the relationship of specific plant species to their insect pollinators. Those plants that are self-pollinated may have an initial advantage in an environment where insects and their plant relationships are being altered by the changing climate. An increase in growth and dispersal of shrubs in the Arctic is occurring as a consequence of climate warming. Increases in shrubs with more upright growth form, especially willows, will generate microhabitats not previously present in the High Arctic. The new habitats will make possible the invasion of new insect, mammal, and bird herbivores, as well as their parasites and predators. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

To avoid the cooling effect occurring in direct internal reforming, gradual internal reforming (GIR) can be used. GIR is based on local coupling between steam reforming and hydrogen oxidation. The steam required for the reforming reaction is obtained from hydrogen oxidation on the anode side. Previous studies have demonstrated that the cooling effect has disappeared. However, with GIR, the risk of carbon formation is greater. To deal with this issue, a different cell configuration was studied. This configuration combines a catalyst layer with a cermet anode, allowing GIR without coking. The study comprised simulations, using the CFD Research Corporation software package, of the behavior of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell when using GIR. A thermodynamic study based on the partial pressure distributions within the cell was also carried out to investigate the occurrence of carbon formation. A parametric analysis of the reforming rate and the thickness of the layer were then performed. The simulations indicate that the risk of carbon deposition is strongly reduced if the configuration is used for a catalyst layer of 900 μm and at a reforming rate in the catalyst only ten times higher than the reforming rate in nickel. © 2008 The Electrochemical Society.",,"Anodes; Coking; Cooling; Methane; Natural gas; Reforming reactions; Gradual internal reforming; Hydrogen oxidation; Partial pressure distributions; Steam reforming; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40549129103

Both are interrelated for many reasons. The ETS was established in the European Union (EU) in the hopes of providing an instrument for supporting efficient efforts to meet the Kyoto targets for the EU and the national burden-sharing requirements. It was constructed in such a way that it can be expanded beyond the borders of the European Union, and it has provisions to include the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol-namely, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI)-thus giving all nations access to the ETS. It is evident that the Kyoto Protocol will not lead to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, but it did establish an institutional structure that has the potential to provide a forum for a stronger contribution of states to future emissions reduction efforts. The ETS demonstrates that international emissions trading on a large scale is politically and administratively feasible. Also the ETS is strongly interlinked with the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol and its emissions caps. It thus seems worthwhile to look at the role that the ETS could play in the post-Kyoto era. In order to assess this role, the paper first describes the rules of the game of the ETS and its incentives for participating institutions-that is, firms as well as governments. Following that, it speculates about the impact of the changes that the ETS has brought to the global agenda for carbon management, in particular the attempts to integrate the non-Annex B countries into the Kyoto process.

This confronts current engine development with the need for ever more complex engine systems with a continuously increasing amount of parameters that have to be calibrated and controlled in continuously decreasing time frames. In order to keep the development costs within reasonable limits, the use of model-based approaches is currently widely spreadening. Due to their high potential for calibration, the role of statistical models is also gaining importance. The combination of static statistical models trained by measurement data gained by the classical DoE process has shown great success in recent years and is now state of the art. However, the ability of static models to predict the exhaust gas emissions during the start and the warm-up phase, which are currently coming into the focus of exhaust gas regulations, is still very limited.

Above limits require significant in-cylinder reductions of pollutants as well as exhaust gas aftertreatment for both, nitrogen oxides and particulates. Furthermore, due to the much discussed climate change, the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) are to be reduced. For EURO VI, the first step will be to reduce engine-out emissions by means of advanced combustion process development using improved fuel injection equipment, supercharging, exhaust gas recirculation, flexible engine systems, extended engine control and by the mechanical development. Then it would appear that exhaust gas aftertreatment systems are needed. Since approximately 30 % of the fuel input is lost in the exhaust gas, an exhaust gas energy recuperation might be a step forward to reduce fuel consumption and GHG-emissions. In a second part an overview of the EU R&D-project GREEN will be given. In this project, European HD engine manufacturers join forces with suppliers, academia and leading engineering institutes. The common goal is to promote future advanced engine technologies to achieve lower emissions, lower fuel consumption and improved sustainability for future fuels. The main objective of GREEN is to perform research, which will lead to innovative sub-systems for heavy duty engines. The project puts emphasis on diesel engines for trucks and rail applications and on natural gas engines for city transport applications.

To improve the understanding of consequences of climate change for annual plant communities, I used a detailed, grid-based model that simulates the effect of daily rainfall variability on individual plants in five climatic regions on a gradient from 100 to 800 mm mean annual precipitation (MAP). The model explicitly considers moisture storage in the soil. I manipulated daily rainfall variability by changing the daily mean rain (DMR, rain volume on rainy days averaged across years for each day of the year) by 20%. At the same time I adjusted intervals appropriately between rainy days for keeping the mean annual volume constant. In factorial combination with changing DMR I also changed MAP by 20%. Results. Increasing MAP generally increased water availability, establishment, and peak shoot biomass. Increasing DMR increased the time that water was continuously available to plants in the upper 15 to 30 cm of the soil (longest wet period, LWP). The effect of DMR diminished with increasing humidity of the climate. An interaction between water availability and density-dependent germination increased the establishment of seedlings in the arid region, but in the more humid regions the establishment of seedlings decreased with increasing DMR. As plants matured, competition among individuals and their productivity increased, but the size of these effects decreased with the humidity of the regions. Therefore, peak shoot biomass generally increased with increasing DMR but the effect size diminished from the semiarid to the mesic Mediterranean region. Increasing DMR reduced via LWP the annual variability of biomass in the semiarid and dry Mediterranean regions. Conclusion. More rainstorms (greater DMR) increased the recharge of soil water reservoirs in more arid sites with consequences for germination, establishment, productivity, and population persistence. The order of magnitudes of DMR and MAP overlapped partially so that their combined effect is important for projections of climate change effects on annual vegetation.",,"rain; article; biological model; climate; computer simulation; growth, development and aging; plant; plant seed; soil; Climate; Computer Simulation; Models, Biological; Plants; Rain; Seeds; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42949112600

This objective is even tougher where a large portion of generated power is already based on coal like in US power industry. All the large technology companies are continuing their long-term actions for CO2 capture or reduction technologies, but there are still many challenges to be solved before these technologies are commercially available. One approach to the same topic is to burn fuels, which net CO2 emission is zero, like biomass. Biomass introduces new technical challenges however, including bed agglomeration and high temperature corrosion. One way to manage this effectively is to gasify the most challenging fuels and burn the easier ones in fluidized bed boilers. Burning the biomass together with coal makes the chemistry much easier to handle. Metso Power has demonstrated experience providing coal and biomass co-combustion in CFB boilers. In Scandinavia the thinking was to make biomass fired CFB with coal backup. In coal dominant countries it could be reversed, coal is the base fuel and biomass in burned as can be purchased from local markets. The paper will introduce several operating co-combustion projects in Scandinavia, but also in the other part of the world. The sizes of these boilers are from 50 MWe up to 250 MWe.

The case used to illustrate emergent institutions involves market mechanisms for climate change, particularly emissions trading. This instrument is a crucial component of the Kyoto Protocol, which has started to be implemented, but is still surrounded by uncertainty and diversity across countries/regions. Design/methodology/approach - Information from MNCs' responses to the Carbon Disclosure Project is used to shed light on their bargaining and nonbargaining activities and how these seem to relate to their overall strategy and location. Findings - Both with regard to nonbargaining and bargaining strategies MNCs' prevailing view seems that they have to deal with distinctive national patterns, adopting a multidomestic, frequently home-country-focused approach. Their responses vary according to the national situation, with the level of activity in emissions trading frequently shaped by local management. Yet, the type of corporate structures created by some MNCs indicates that they take into account that EU-ETS may form the onset for a more global emissions trading scheme. Research limitations/applications - Since market mechanisms for climate change are just unfolding, follow-up studies into larger numbers of firms would be worthwhile to unravel the dynamics. The aspects identified in this paper can be used as starting point for such analyses. Practical implications - The information and corporate considerations regarding market mechanisms for climate change can be helpful for both managers and policymakers in designing future approaches and reflecting upon the limitations and opportunities for MNC involvement in global governance. Originality/value - The paper explores how MNCs may help shape an emergent institution, considering the fact that they face the dualility of managing a global context and multiple local contexts. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Global warming; Governance; Multinational companies; Organizations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50849134799

The most promising plants for these purposes seem to be the perennial rhizomatous grasses with the C4 photosynthetic pathway. One of them is the genus Miscanthus Anderss. originating from Southeast Asia. This genus includes Miscanthus x gigantheus Greef et Deuter, the most cultivated species with respect to biomass production across Europe. The genus Miscanthus Anderss. includes the two other genotypes such as Miscanthus sacchariflorus (Maxim.) Benth. et Hook. and Miscanthus sinensis Anderss. Very important advantage of M. sinensis genotypes over M. x gigantheus is their improved winter hardiness. The data from the field trails in Denmark [5] indicate that M. sinensis clones can out-yield M. x gigantheus genotypes. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a warm season perennial herbaceous C4 grass that is indigenous to North America and is found from Mexico to Canada. Switchgrass is established from seed and for that reason the start cost of cultivation is less expensive and involves less risk than that of Miscanthus, which is propagated by rhizomes. The general objective of this work is the evaluation of potential biomass productivity of M. sinensis, M. sacchariflorus and P. virgatum throughout Poland on the basis of empirical model and the regional meteorological data.

Although nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emissions can be reduced by operating with a positive ignition dwell, unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions typically increase. Sources of these emissions can stem from characteristics of the fuel spray after the end of injection, which may differ significantly from the main injection period where most spray models have been developed. To provide fundamental details of spray mixing during the end-of-injection transient, we have studied liquid-phase spray penetration and evaporation using simultaneous high-speed shadowgraph and Mie-scatter imaging for a single-hole, common-rail injector. Experiments were conducted over a wide range of ambient temperature and density in a constant-volume vessel. The experiments show that during the injection-rate ramp-down, the liquid penetration decreases (recedes towards the injector) from the quasi-steady-state distance for most diesel conditions. A transient jet entrainment model, coupled with the assumption of mixing-limited spray vaporization and direct measurement of the vaporized jet spreading angle, shows that this behavior is caused by a slower fuel delivery interacting with an increased rate of ambient entrainment during the injection-rate ramp-down. This increased mixing travels downstream as an ""entrainment wave"", permitting complete vaporization at distances closer to the injector than the quasi-steady liquid length. The position of the entrainment wave relative to the quasi-steady liquid length determines how far, and how quickly, the liquid recedes towards the injector. The tendency of recession increases with increasing ambient temperature and density because the transit time of the entrainment wave to the liquid length is shorter than the injection-rate ramp-down transient.

In recent years, however, it has been promoted as a means to pursue a multitude of public policy goals: reduce petroleum imports; improve vehicle emissions and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases; and stimulate rural development. Annual production of ethanol for fuel in the United States has trebled since 1999 and is expected to reach almost 7 billion gallons in 2007. This growth in production has been accompanied by billions of dollars of investment in transport and distribution infrastructure. Market factors, such as rising prices for petroleum products and state bans on methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), a blending agent for which ethanol is one of the few readily available substitutes, drove some of this increase. But the main driving factor has been government support, provided at every point in the supply chain and from the federal to the local level. This chapter reviews the major policy developments affecting the fuel-ethanol industry of the United States since the late 1970s, quantifies their value to the industry, and evaluates the efficacy of ethanol subsidization in achieving greenhouse gas reduction goals. We conclude that not only is total support for ethanol already substantial- $5.8-7.0 billion in 2006-and set to rise quickly, even under existing policy settings, but its cost effectiveness is low, especially as a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Agriculture; biofuel; corn; energy; ethanol; policy; renewable energy; subsidies; support; United States",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886017205

The etching rate of TiC is strongly affected by the chlorine concentration, but only slightly by the reaction temperature. No correlation was found between etching rate of TiC and specific surface area (SSA) of the resulting CDC with respect to temperature. Kinetic investigations show that for up to 80 min the etching process is controlled by the chemical reaction. At longer times a diffusion limitation has to be taken into account. Addition of hydrogen to the etching gas enhances the diffusion of the chlorine molecules, so that no diffusion limitation was observed. Microporous carbon with narrow pore size distribution was obtained at temperatures ranging from 400 to 800 °C. Treatment at higher temperatures leads to formation of mesopores. The CDC produced by chlorination of TiC at 400 °C is amorphous. Increased reaction temperature and addition of hydrogen to the chlorine gas lead to formation of regions with higher order like onion carbon and graphitic ribbons.

The pollution of the atmosphere and seas, the industrial waste, the climatic changes, the chaotic built-up extension threaten the health of all of us. The responsibility for the pollution of the environment is allocated in everybody. The State is accountable not only for the political planning and the policy that practises, but also for the frame it shapes for the citizens to follow. The improvement of the quality of environment must be combined with the economic progress and growth. The intensity of environmental problems worries the International Community, while the saving and growth of new green forms of energy appear as imperative need. We find already ourselves in a progressive but continuous growth, which has the conditions to develop in the future with spectacular rhythm. The methodology of present work is recommended for: a) bibliographic research, mainly Greek, b) comparison of the facts that are exported from research, connecting them with the given facts. This comparison leads to the necessary coexistence of a healthy environment and a viable growth. In the results of the research the essential conditions of coexistence are presented between these two. Thus we realise that: a) the configuration of an evener environmental conscience is required via the education which would guarantee the balanced and sustainable growth, b) the change of perception of people as lords of nature is considered necessary and its replacement by the awareness that the nature does not constitute an inexhaustible resource. With that in mind we conclude that: a) the research is required to lead to alternative sources of energy such as the creation of Aeolian parks. It is estimated that more investments in other types of renewable sources of energy such as geothermal and hydroelectric can constitute also advisable solutions. The use of renewable sources of energy limits the use of mining fuels, allows the reduction of emissions, leading to a smaller dependence on imported fuels and other pollutants b) the applications of policies such as the biological cleaning and the recycling of materials like paper, glass, plastic and aluminium are necessary, c) the protection of nature which will aim at the supervision of biodiversity for the survival of species that are in danger in order to maintain the balance of flora and the fauna of planet is considered mandatory and d) finally there is necessity an evener activation of management and protection institutions of the environment with staffing and training of control services. © 2008 Kavala Institute of Technology.","Aeolian parks; Energy; Environment; Viable growth","Biodiversity; Deterioration; Geothermal energy; Investments; Pollution; Alternative sources of energy; Energy; Environment; Environmental problems; Inexhaustible resources; International community; Recycling of materials; Reduction of emissions; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857329294

The objective of this study was to select the most promising oxygenate compounds as blending components in diesel fuel for further advanced testing and practical application. The results of the first part of the program were presented during the 31 st FISITA World Automotive Congress in Yokohama in the year 2006 (paper F2006P048). In that part of the program, oxygenates from the glycol ethers chemical family were tested and obtained results were promising. In the second part of the program - described in present paper, oxygenates from another chemical families i.e. maleates and carbonates were tested. The tests were conducted on a light-duty vehicle equipped with DI - Common Rail turbocharged engine, meeting the Euro IV emissions regulation and representing the latest technology in production at the start of the research program. The New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), with separate measurement of urban and extra-urban phase, was selected as a representative test for this study. The total PM, CO, HC, NO x and CO 2 as well as fuel consumption were measured. Four different synthetic oxygenated additives - two maleates and two carbonates - were tested. Each of them was evaluated as a fuel additive at a concentration of 5% v/v in the same base diesel fuel. The base diesel fuel was a Euro V diesel fuel. The studies have proven that oxygenated fuels containing malcatcs and carbonates significantly reduced the PM emissions in the NEDC cycle. The reduction in the PM emissions was from 14 to 32%, depending on the component - fuels containing carbonates were generally more effective. Such fuels, however, caused the growth of NO x emissions by 4 - 9% in the NEDC test, whereas the fuels containing maleates guaranteed the keeping of NO x emissions on the level obtained for fuelling with neat diesel fuel. The general observation may be that all the oxygenated fuels caused a significant improvement of the PM/NO x trade-off. The negative effect of using oxygenated fuels containing malcatcs and carbonates was the growth of CO and HC emissions. The glycol ethers tested earlier were more favorable in this respect. However, the glycol ethers were less effective in the reduction of PM emissions. The fuels containing maleates and carbonates were characterized with the same CO 2 emissions level as in fuelling with neat diesel fuel.","Diesel; Diesel fuel; Exhaust emissions; Fuel additives; Synthetic oxygenates","Chemical family; Common rail; Diesel; Diesel passenger cars; Emissions regulations; Environmental performance; Exhaust emission; Glycol ethers; HC emissions; Latest technology; Light duty vehicles; New european driving cycles; Oxygenated additive; Oxygenated fuel; PM emissions; Research programs; Synthetic oxygenates; Turbocharged engine; Blending; Carbon dioxide; Carbonates; Diesel fuels; Environmental management; Ethers; Fuel additives; Fueling; Glycols; Organic compounds; Particulate emissions; Passenger cars; Reduction; Research; Software testing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866069280

The mean R max values and the atomic H/C values of the bulk carbonaceous matter (BCM), together with rock structures and mineral assemblages, indicate that these carbon-rich rocks were metamorphosed to sub-greenschist and low-grade greenschist facies. X-ray diffraction reveals that the (002) 'graphite' peak width in half maximum (FWHM) ranges from 0.43 to 0.71°2θ in sub-greenschist facies and from 0.27 to 0.41°2θ in greenschist facies rocks, but the d (002) values in both groups of rocks are approximately the same (∼3.35Å). The BCM of individual samples is composed of particles with very variable shape, reflectance and Raman spectra. Type I particles that predominate in sub-greenschist facies are fine-grained, irregular or elongate bodies 1 to 3 μm in size. Their maximum reflectance (Rmax) ranges between 2.5% and 8.2%, and Raman parameters R1 and R2 range from 0.5 to 1.4 and 0.5 to 0.8, respectively. Type II particles are lath-shaped, up to 40 μm large bodies, commonly arranged parallel to white mica flakes. The number of these particles increases from sub-greenschist to greenschist facies. Maximum reflectance varies between 6% and 11.2% and R1 and R2 Raman parameters range from 0.05 to 0.7 and from 0.1 to 0.5, respectively. Type III particles occur in hydrothermally altered and sheared rocks; these are nodular aggregates composed of grains up to 10 μm in size. This type of particles has very high reflectance (Rmax = 11-15%) and its Raman spectra indicate a very high degree of structural ordering corresponding to well-ordered graphite. Type I particles represent original organic matter in the metasediments. Type II particles are believed to have been formed either in situ by solid-state transformation of Type I particles or by crystallization from metamorphic fluids. Gradual graphitization of the Type I organic particles and the growth of lath-shaped Type II particles from a fluid phase is assumed to have taken place under the peak metamorphic conditions associated with the burial of Birimian sediments during thrust tectonism, progressive tectonic accretion and crustal thickening during the D1 event of the Eburnean orogeny. The growth of equant, high-reflectance postkinematic nodular aggregates of Type III particles is ascribed to the reduction of CO2-rich fluids during a hydrothermal event associated with Late Eburnean D2 exhumation and strike-slip movements. Type I carbonaceous particles were only slightly affected by high-temperature, low-pressure contact metamorphism during intrusion of Late Eburnean magmatic bodies, whereas formation of Type II or III particles was not recorded in contact-metamorphosed rocks at all. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Birimian; Crystallinity; Graphite; Palaeoproterozoic; Raman spectra; Reflectance","Birrimian; black shale; contact metamorphism; crystallization; graphite; graphitization; greenschist facies; greenstone belt; organic matter; Raman spectroscopy; reflectance; tectonic setting; Africa; Burkina Faso; Sub-Saharan Africa; West Africa; Torreya nucifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56649113037

Developments in combustion technologies, advanced electronic fuel injection, refined engine and injection parameters have helped engineers tune eco-friendly diesel engines resulting in simultaneous NOx-PM reduction. Understanding engine and injection parameters and their effects on exhaust emissions is vital for producing cleaner diesel engines and is therefore a subject of intense research. The scope of this work was to optimize the influence of injection parameters on regulated emission constituents of diesel exhaust to meet Euro III emission norms on a heavy duty diesel DI engine. Carefully tailored design of experiments and Taguchi technique were used to meet the project objectives due to short development time. The best injection parameters were isolated from experimental results of L9 orthogonal array using Analysis of Means (ANOM), Signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The results from analysis are validated to meet Euro III emission targets consistently with defined engineering margins on emission components. In this investigation, influence of parameters namely cam velocity, nozzle through flow, nozzle tip protrusion into the combustion chamber and number of spray orifices were studied. Of the four injection parameters evaluated, cam velocity affecting injection rate and number of nozzle spray orifices affecting injection pressures and atomization of spray played an influential role in reduction of NOx and PM. In addition, nozzle tip protrusion affecting the point at which nozzle spray jet impinges into the combustion bowl only moderately influenced the PM and HC emissions. Nozzle through flow effect on emission constituents of diesel exhaust is almost negligible for meeting Euro III exhaust emission norms in the defined experimental region. Euro III emissions targets were met consistently in totality with more than 11.5% margins on NOx, 61.5% on CO, 76.5% on HC and 23% on PM compared to federal Euro III limits. Further, engine power and torque characteristics were enhanced by 30% compared to base engine performance together with 10.6% reduction in full load SFC with intent of improving overall driveability and fuel economy of the vehicle. © 2008 SAE International.",,"Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Cams; Combustion chambers; Design of experiments; Fuel economy; Fuel injection; Fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Orifices; Powertrains; Signal to noise ratio; Spray nozzles; Combustion technology; Diesel engine performance; Electronic fuel injections; Heavy-duty diesel engine; Injection parameters; L9 orthogonal arrays; Signal to noise (S/N) ratios; Torque characteristic; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072456086

There are various technologies which enable organisations to achieve large reductions in their emissions by employing resource saving, using new resources or following pollution controls. The costs of the available technologies decrease with use as adaptations are made based on practical experience. This rate of cost reduction is rapid for most industrial sectors. Environmental policies provide a further incentive for innovation, as the environmental demands of authorities can have short lead-time in preparation and fast and strict enforcement, or involve negotiations between stakeholders if the harmed interests use legal instruments to ensure that their demands can be enforced. Companies which undertake environmental innovations and adaptations can reduce their emissions down to levels that do not preclude sustainable environmental qualities, without increasing their costs and in many cases even enjoying cost savings. The first book to provide a systematic review of the forces that drive technologies towards sustainable development, Innovations and the Environment discusses the possibilities for fostering renewable energy and environmental quality oriented innovations from the perspective of decision makers in policy and business. The economy and management of the innovations are addressed regarding users' interests and the interests of technology suppliers. It is shown that technological progress enables the attainment of far reaching objectives at low cost and, in many cases, even at net benefit. Innovations and the Environment will be of interest to researchers in environmental management and policy, the staff of regional and national authorities, and those involved in management of corporate social responsibility and environmental management. © 2008 Springer-Verlag London Limited.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892793471

Evaluation o the materials for hydrogen utilisation machines is required. The objectives of this study are the characterisation of fretting fatigue strength of low-alloy steel SCM435H and heat-resistant steel SUH660, and the validation of effectiveness of nitriding in hydrogen gas environment. Fretting fatigue tests were conducted up to 3 × 107 cycles. The decrease of fretting fatigue strength in hydrogen gas environment was found at the long-life region exceeding 107 cycles. The amount of the decrease of the fretting fatigue limit at 3 × 107 cycles was 11% for SCM435H and 15% for SUH660. However, at the stress level above the fretting fatigue limit in air, the finite life in hydrogen gas increased more than that in air. The cause of extension of fatigue life was the delay of start of stable crack propagation. Fretting fatigue crack, which was smaller than 200 μm in length, consumed approximately 60% of the fatigue life in hydrogen gas environment. Fretting fatigue crack was steadily propagated after the test was started in air. Observations of the fretted surface showed that the fretting wear process in hydrogen gas environment was dominated by adhesion. Tangential force coefficient was higher in hydrogen gas environment than that in air. It is considered that the adhesion has a close relation to crack initiation in hydrogen gas environment, and as a result, the failure of specimen occurred at a lower stress level comparing the fretting fatigue limit in air.

We argue that (1) many proposals have ideas on how to reduce emissions, but fewer have a solution on how to stimulate technical innovation; (2) many proposals formulate climate policy in isolation, while there are fewer proposals that try to mainstream climate policies in other policy areas; (3) many proposals advocate market-based solutions, while fewer realize that there are certain drawbacks to this solution especially at the international level; (4) most proposals have a preference for a UN-based regime, while a more fragmented regime, based on regional and sectoral arrangements may be emerging; and (5) most proposals have ideas about mitigation, but not many have creative ideas on how to integrate mitigation with adaptation. © 2008 Earthscan.","Adaptation; Climate change policy; Climate policy frameworks; Energy policies; Mitigation; Policy design; Policy measures; Post-2012 negotiations","adaptation; climate change; emission control; energy policy; environmental policy; innovation; international agreement; mitigation; policy development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48549094436

The CO2(aq) profiles soon after the limnic eruptions were estimated for Lakes Monoun and Nyos using the CTD data obtained in October and November 1986, respectively. Based on the CO2(aq) profiles through time, the CO2 Content and its change over time were calculated for both lakes. The CO2 accumulation rate calculated from the pre-degassing data, was constant after the limnic eruption at Lake Nyos (1986-2001), whereas the rate appeared initially high (1986-1996) but later slowed down (1996-2003) at Lake Monoun. The CO2 concentration at 58 m depth in Lake Monoun in January 2003 was very close to saturation due to the CO2 accumulation. This situation is suggestive of a mechanism for the limnic eruption, because it may take place spontaneously without receiving an external trigger. The CO2 content of the lakes decreased significantly after controlled degassing started in March 2001 at Lake Nyos and in February 2003 at Lake Monoun. The current content is lower than the content estimated soon after the limnic eruption at both lakes. At Monoun the degassing rate increased greatly after February 2006 due to an increase of the number of degassing pipes and deepening of the pipe intake depth. The current CO2 content is ∼40% of the maximum content attained just before the degassing started. At current degassing rates the lower chemocline will subside to the degassing pipe intake depth of 93 m in about one year. After this depth is reached, the gas removal rate will progressively decline because water of lower CO2(aq) concentration will be tapped by the pipes. To keep the CO2 content of Lake Monoun as small as possible, it is recommended to set up a new, simple device that sends deep water to the surface since natural recharge of CO2 will continue. Controlled degassing at Lake Nyos since 2001 has also reduced the CO2 content. It is currently slightly below the level estimated after the limnic eruption in 1986. However, the current CO2 content still amounts to 80% of the maximum level of 14.8 giga moles observed in January 2001. The depth of the lower chemocline may reach the pipe intake depth of 203 m within a few years. After this situation is reached the degassing rate with the current system will progressively decline, and it would take decades to remove the majority of dissolved gases even if the degassing system keeps working continuously. Additional degassing pipes must be installed to speed up gas removal from Lake Nyos in order to make the area safer for local populations.

We used surfactant-modified zeolite (SMZ) adsorbent beds and a membrane bioreactor (MBR) in combination to reduce the organic carbon content of produced water prior to reverse osmosis (RO). Reduction of total influent organic carbon (TOC) to 5 mg/L or less is desirable for efficient RO system operation. Most water disposed at the facility is from coal-bed gas production, with oil production waters intermixed. Up to 20 gal/d of produced water was cycled through two SMZ adsorbent units to remove volatile organic compounds (BTEX, acetone) and semivolatile organic compounds (e.g., napthalene). Output water from the SMZ units was sent to the MBR for removal of the organic acid component of TOC. Removal of inorganic (Mn and Fe oxide) particulates by the SMZ system was observed. The SMZ columns removed up to 40% of the influent TOC (600 mg/L). BTEX concentrations were reduced from the initial input of 70 mg/L to 5 mg/L by the SMZ and to an average of 2 mg/L after the MBR. Removal rates of acetate (input 120-170 mg/L) and TOC (input up to 45 mg/L) were up to 100% and 92%, respectively. The water pH rose from 8.5 to 8.8 following organic acid removal in the MBR; this relatively high pH was likely responsible for observed scaling of the MBR internal membrane. Additional laboratory studies showed the scaling can be reduced by metered addition of acid to reduce the pH. Significantly, organic removal in the MBR was accomplished with a very low biomass concentration of 1 g/L throughout the field trial. An earlier engineering evaluation shows produced water treatment by the SMZ/MBR/RO system would cost from $0.13 to $0.20 per bbl at up to 40 gpm. Current estimated disposal costs for produced water are $1.75 to $4.91 per bbl when transportation costs are included, with even higher rates in some regions. Our results suggest that treatment by an SMZ/MBR/RO system may be a feasible alternative to current methods for produced water treatment and disposal.

The copper is the only substance that can be used against downy mildew; however, since it causes problems of environmental impact, incompatible with organic farming's objective of environmentally friendly farming, the Commission of the European Communities has fixed a ceiling on use expressed in terms of kilograms of copper per hectare per year (Regulation EC n. 473/2002). In order to identify natural products that are able to carry out an anti-downy mildew activity, and to evaluate the effectiveness of low rate copper formulations that can reduce the quantities of copper compound, four-year experimental trials were carried out in organic vineyards. The trials have been carried out according to the Guidelines EPPO/OEPP PP 1/31 (3). Among the low rate copper formulations, copper hydroxide and copper sulphate have been tested. Among the natural substances alternative to copper formulations we have tested: phytostimulant, homeopathic products, acid clay-based products (bentotamnio), resistance promoters (chitosan and lignosulfonate), plant extracts (orange extract, propolis and equisetum) and potassium bicarbonate. All natural substances, with the exception of plant extracts and potassium bicarbonate, were tested in association with low rate copper formulations. In the trials it has been possible to test the effectiveness of different formulations in condition of high, medium and low pressure of Plasmopara viticola (Berk. et Curt.) Berl. et De Toni. Both the copper compounds and the natural products were able to guarantee a satisfactory protection in condition of low and medium pressure of downy mildew. The trial carried out in 2004 was characterized by high pressure of P. viticola; under this condition only the copper formulations produced a satisfactory protection against downy mildew. However, in 2004, we tested only two products alternative to copper compounds. Further studies are needed to verify if the formulations alternative to copper, that gave good results in condition of low and medium pressure of P. viticola, are able to guarantee a satisfactory protection even in condition of high pressure of downy mildew. We would like to highlight that in the four-years of trials the copper formulations tested always guaranteed a metallic copper quantity under 6 kg/ha that is the maximum limit of use/year imposed by Regulation EC n. 473/2002.",,"copper; fungicide; agriculture; article; biological pest control; dose response; drug effect; grape; growth, development and aging; methodology; microbiology; Oomycetes; soil pollutant; Agriculture; Copper; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Fungicides, Industrial; Oomycetes; Pest Control, Biological; Soil Pollutants; Vitis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-64249118949

The growing awareness of these effects has revealed the need to take adequate measures to monitor and control the emissions of air pollutants. To control gas turbine emissions, the conventional approach is to monitor the gas turbine using on-line analyzers on a regular basis called Continuous Emission Monitors System (CEMS). Instead of this customary analyser, the operator has the opportunity, depending on the local authorities agreement, to use predictive system based on data that characterise the unit load. That's why GDF SUEZ R&D Division has developed an alternative solution to continuous monitoring for gas turbine : the Predictive Emission Monitoring System (PEMS). Instead of expensive sampling of the stack exhaust, the predictive system approach is to model the emissions, based on physics, thermodynamics and chemistry and using real-time data from the turbine (e.g., turbine temperatures, gas fuel flow, speed...). So as to refine the model, empirical parameters used for the algorithms must be periodically calibrated. PEMS is an efficient and competitive solution compared to CEMS. Actually, PEMS has been proven to be as accurate as CEMS and is in fact more economical from the cost and maintenance point of view. Furthermore, PEMS are included in main technical and commercial proposals from turbines manufacturers. Our secured PEMS application is directly integrated in the supervision (plant operational monitoring system) of the compressor stations. This ergonomic and easy-to-use software edits monthly reports for the operator and the local authorities. Today, this tool is an operational device available for GDF SUEZ compressor stations, which are required by law to monitor their NOx and CO emissions. To conclude, this finished product includes a support package to the site operators (installation, training, guidelines, hotline...).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953723350

Engine control strategies appear to be a powerful solution to address this issue. The problem is particularly complex since acceptable drivability must be maintained whilst at the same time reducing in-cylinder pollutant emissions and ensuring optimum conditions to attain high conversion efficiencies via exhaust gas after-treatment systems. The development of appropriate control strategies can only be achieved with an in-depth understanding of the engine behaviour, using experimental results and system numerical simulations. In this context, predictive combustion and pollutant emissions models, which are calibrated with experimental data, are particularly useful as they allow a wide range of parametric variations to be studied. This paper presents an advanced Diesel combustion model based on a Barba's approach [Barba C. et al. (2000)- A Phenomenological Combustion Model for Heat Release Rate Prediction in High Speed DI Diesel Engines with Common Rail Injection, SAE Technical Paper 2000-01-2933]. This model can be applied to multi-injection, defining a pre-mixed combustion zone for the pilot injection and a diffusion combustion mode for the main injection. To assess the in-cylinder pollutant emissions, a mixing model based on the turbulent kinetic energy generated by the spray, is added to define a burnt gas zone in which post-flame chemistry including CO, NOx and soot formation can be computed. This model is first validated using CHEMKIN and 3D CFD results. Then, using experimental results, a 4 cylinders D.I. Diesel engine is calibrated on steady state engine operating conditions and coupled to an engine control to predict the evolution of pollutant emissions under transient conditions.

In spite of intensive land use, such information concerning peat soils is still scarce. We analyzed the variation in peat mineral element concentrations in boreal peatland forests drained 50-60 years earlier. We wanted to quantify the proportions of variation deriving from differences between regions and peatland basins and from within-peatland heterogeneity, and to model the variation using relatively easily measurable site and soil characteristics. We utilized 878 peat samples representing the 0-20 cm layer and collected from 289 sites in 79 peatland basins. The sites represented three different drained peatland forest site types. The two strongest gradients in the element composition captured by principal component analysis were correlated with both the North-South gradient and the site type variation, and the East-West gradient. In general, most of the variation in the element concentrations was contributed by differences among peatland basins, and variation within the floristically determined sites. Most of the element concentrations were best modeled when either the bulk density or the ash content of the peat, or both, were used in addition to site type and geographical location. The explanatory power remained modest for most element concentrations. As for the P concentrations in soil, however, our models provide means for estimating a large part of the variation among drained pine mire sites.","Drainage; Nutrient deficiencies; Peat soil; Soil nutrients; Spatial variation","Drainage; Forestry; Land use; Nutrients; Peat; Principal component analysis; Soils; Element concentrations; Geographical locations; Information concerning; Land use and managements; Nutrient deficiency; Peat soils; Soil nutrients; Spatial variations; Wetlands; boreal forest; carbon cycle; concentration (composition); land use planning; nutrient availability; peat; peatland; principal component analysis; soil nutrient; Drainage; Forestry; Geology; Land Use; Nutrients; Peat; Silica; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56849133628

This need will be underlined by the regulations in Europe (ACEA C02 Self-Commitment) and in the U.S. (ZEV regulation). There are three steps towards the ""Energy for the Future"" at Daimler Chrysler: efficient cars based on improved internal combustion engines with or without hybridization, improved conventional and alternative fuels (e.g. biomass-to-liquid), and emissions-free vehicles with fuel-cell/battery drive. Additionally, improvements can be expected with respect to aerodynamics and (lightweight) body construction (see bionic concept car of Daimler). The benefits of hybrid technology are reduced fuel consumption and emissions (increased driving range, stop/start functionality, recuperation, zero emissions when stationary), increased comfort (pure electrical driving, option of connecting to internal/external electrical loads), and increased performance (agility, continuous and smooth torque characteristics, and performance boost function). The definition of hybrid powertrains and examples of operation modes will be given in the presentation. By the end of 2003, today's Daimler AG had delivered 30 Citaro fuel-cell buses containing fuel-cell systems as part of the European ""CUTE"" program to ten European cities. The experience and the feedback since then have been extraordinarily positive. In particular, the lifetime results in the real-world operation at the customers have been highly satisfactory. Furthermore, in 2004/5, Daimler Chrysler delivered 60 F-Cell cars to customers in four different regions of the world: the U.S.A. (mainly California), Singapore, Japan, and Germany. Within these programs, the fuel-cell technologies are evaluated for their ""fitness for daily use."" In 2004, a Sprinter van was delivered to UPS for use in the U.S.A. The actual range achieved for the F-Cell-fleet is more than 5,000,000 km. The high-voltage battery (> 60 V) will play a dominant role for both the hybrid powertrain and the fuel cell powertrain. Indeed, NiMH-battery systems are currently in the existing market for hybrid cars and fuel-cell cars. Li-ion batteries are on the verge of industrialization for the automotive industry.

RCMs are commonly thought to behave as a sort of sophisticated magnifying glass to perform dynamical downscaling, which is to add fine-scale details upon the large-scale flow provided as time-dependent lateral boundary condition. Regional climate modelling is a relatively new approach, initiated less than twenty years ago. The interest for the approach has grown rapidly as it offers a computationally affordable means of entering into appealing applications of timely societal relevance, such as high-resolution climate-change projections and seasonal prediction. There exists however a need for basic research aiming at establishing firmly the strengths and limitations of the technique. This paper synthesises the results of a stream of investigations on the merits and weaknesses of the nested approach, initiated almost a decade ago by some members of our team. This short paper revisits some commonly accepted notions amongst practitioners of Regional Climate Modelling, in the form of four tenets that will be challenged: (1) RCMs are capable of generating small-scale features absent in the driving fields supplied as lateral boundary conditions; (2) The generated small scales have the appropriate amplitudes and statistics; (3) The generated small scales accurately represent those that would be present in the driving data if it were not limited by resolution; (4) In performing dynamical downscaling, RCMs operate as a kind of sophisticated magnifying glass, in the sense that the small scales that are generated are uniquely defined for a given set of lateral boundary conditions (LBC). From the partial failure of the last two tenets emerges the notion of internal variability, which has often been thought to be negligible in one-way nested models due to the control exerted by the imposed lateral boundary conditions. A fifth tenet is also discussed, relating to the handling within the RCM domain of the large scales used to drive the RCM at the LBC. We close the article with an appeal to the RCM community to spend more effort in basic research in order to tackle a number of lingering issues that otherwise could jeopardize the credibility of the tool. © Springer-Verlag 2008.",,"boundary condition; climate change; climate modeling; global climate; regional climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50649123195

Belin, F-31400 Toulouse, France","The Liquiñe-Ofqui fault zone (LOFZ) is a long-lived, margin-parallel, intra-arc megastructure, which has played a significant role in both orogenic growth and magmatism during the Late Cenozoic. The LOFZ has been regarded as a Late Miocene-Pliocene dextral strike-slip fault zone within a bulk transpressional setting. Nevertheless, little geologic and morphological evidence exists for Quaternary right-lateral offsets. In contrast, vertical separation is the most outstanding feature observable along the master faults. The river network also shows local discontinuities (sinuosity, stream power index) where cut by these first-order faults. In humid climates, topographic equilibrium should be rapidly restored; therefore, at least part of the vertical displacement should be Holocene. Vertical movements can be caused by tectonic forces but are also enhanced by the postglacial isostatic rebound. The latter would have been intense during the Quaternary and especially after the Last Glacial Maximum (i.e., < ca. 14 ka) in the Southern Andes between 38° and 46°S. A consistent Quaternary NE-oriented maximum horizontal stress accompanies both compressional and transpressional tensors along the entire volcanic arc, which supports the argument that part of the vertical displacement could be tectonic in origin. Therefore, competing transpressional and compressional regimes, with both strike-slip and vertical displacement, occur along the entire intra-arc zone, and are spatially and causally related to a wide variety of volcanic outspurs. Compression and transpression can alternate along the intra-arc fault systems (by shifting σ2 and σ3; σ1 remaining constant) because of local or regional factors such as inherited discontinuities and/or variations of the angle between the convergence vector and the continental margin trend. The shifting between σ2 and σ3 should be common in highly oblique subduction zones, which develop ""pure shear-dominated"" strain regimes. Whatever the driving mechanism of vertical displacements, the most primitive Holocene basaltic magmas were erupted along the LOFZ master faults, where the vertical offsets are more clearly distinguished. At the regional scale, arc volcanism would be sustained by flux melting in the asthenosphere and magma ascent controlled by the bulk transpressional regime. Instead, sporadic vertical adjustments along the LOFZ, either by tectonic and/or climatic processes, would trigger monogenetic volcanism after induced decompressional melting. Thus, volcanic and orogenic processes are coupled and should be considered for understanding the global arc architecture and coeval relief building. Copyright © 2008 by Bellwether Publishing, Ltd.

This study concentrates on different process configurations of an oxyfuel combustion capture process. The studied concepts all have a cryogenic Air Separation Unit, a pulverized coal boiler, a steam turbine with feedwater preheaters and a CO2 separation process based on pressurizing the flue gas and liquefying the CO2. Some major parameters of six different configurations are studied using a steady-state process simulator.

However, this decrease of 2-oxoglutarate level only slightly affects the phosphorylation state of PII, a protein that regulates nitrogen and carbon metabolism according to the intracellular levels of 2-oxoglutarate. Properties of the SpkD mutant suggest that the Ser/Thr kinase SpkD could be involved in adjusting the pool of the TCA cycle metabolites according to Ci supply in the culture medium. © 2008 SGM.",,"2 oxoglutaric acid; ammonia; carbon; glucose; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate; nitrogen; protein serine threonine kinase; protein spkD; pyruvic acid; article; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; bacterium mutant; carbon metabolism; cell culture; cell mutant; citric acid cycle; controlled study; culture medium; gene inactivation; metabolite; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Synechocystis; wild type; Bacterial Proteins; Carbon; Citric Acid Cycle; Genome, Bacterial; Ketoglutaric Acids; Mutation; Phenotype; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Synechocystis; Synechocystis sp.; Synechocystis sp.

Therefore, since late 1980's, legislative efforts has been targeted towards bringing down the levels of these substances that arc mainly originating from the reactions of the intake air nitrogen and oxygen during the high-tempcrature combustion process in internal combustion engines. However, in recent years the ambient air quality monitoring in many European cities has shown that the recorded levels of NO 2 in urban environments exposed to exhaust gases from motor vehicles have not much improved, if changed at all. This has happened, despite the fact that more stringent NO x emission control has been implemented in all new motor vehicles and many types of quite effective emission reduction systems arc being employed by all OEMs. As many studies have shown that exposure to NO 2 has more adverse health effects than those of NO, it is of primary concern, even if after a transformation in air, all NO will eventually be turned into NO 2. Because this transformation usually takes place within minutes to a few hours, depending on many atmospheric parameters, emissions arc usually diluted and transported away from the immediate release and exposure areas thus alleviating the ill-effects. However, if more NO 2 is directly emitted in urban air, elevated concentrations arc an inevitable result. Usually, as legislative standards only regulate NO x, the sum of NO and NO 2, there has only been a few studies presenting NO 2 emission rates, or reporting of NO/NO 2 ratio in the NO xemissions. Therefore, in 2006 VTT initiated an effort to register typical levels of NO 2 associ-ated with different types of motor vehicles. For this purpose, NO and NO 2 were determined separately using real-world duty-cycles from a number of heavy duty vehicles run on a full vehicle transient chassis dynamometer. The emphasis has been on urban buses, as in many urban street canyons buses are a major source of NO x emissions.","Exhaust emissions; Heavy duty; Nitrogen dioxide; Nitrogen oxide; Real-world driving; Urban environment","Exhaust emission; Heavy duty; Nitrogen dioxides; Real-world driving; Urban environments; Air quality; Buses; Dynamometers; Emission control; Internal combustion engines; Urban planning; Vehicles; Nitrogen oxides",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866121635

DOE envisions increased use of gasification in the United States during the next 20 years. As such, the DOE Gasification Technologies Program, including the FutureGen initiative, will strive to approach a near-zero emissions goal, with respect to multiple pollutants, such as sulfur, mercury, and nitrogen oxides. Since nearly one-third of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are produced by coal-powered generation facilities, conventional coal-burning power plants, and advanced power generation plants, such as IGCC, present opportunities in which carbon can be removed and then permanently stored. Gas cleaning systems for IGCC power generation facilities have been effectively demonstrated and used in commercial operations for many years. These systems can reduce sulfur, mercury, and other contaminants in synthesis gas produced by gasifiers to the lowest level achievable in coal-based energy systems. Currently, DOE Fossil Energy's goals set for 2010 direct completion of R&D for advanced gasification combined cycle technology to produce electricity from coal at 45-50% plant efficiency. By 2012, completion of R&D to integrate this technology with carbon dioxide separation, capture, and sequestration into a zero-emissions configuration is targeted with a goal to provide electricity with less than a 10% increase in cost of electricity. By 2020, goals are set to develop zero-emissions plants that are fuel-flexible and capable of multiproduct output and thermal efficiencies of over 60% with coal. These objectives dictate that it is essential to not only reduce contaminant emissions into the generated synthesis gas, but also to increase the process or system operating temperature to that of humid gas cleaning criteria conditions (150 to 370°C), thus reducing the energy penalties that currently exist as a result of lowering process temperatures (-40 to 38°C) with subsequent reheat to the required higher temperatures. From a historical perspective, the evolution of advanced syngas cleaning systems applied in IGCC and chemical and fuel synthesis plants has followed a path of configuring a series of individual cleaning steps, one for each syngas contaminant, each step controlled to its individual temperature and sorbent and catalyst needs. As the number of syngas contaminants of interest has increased (particulates, hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, halides such as hydrogen chloride, ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, alkali metals, metal carbonyls, mercury, arsenic, selenium, and cadmium) and the degree of syngas cleaning has become more severe, the potential feasibility of advanced humid gas cleaning has diminished. A focus on multi-contaminant syngas cleaning is needed to enhance the potential cost savings, and performance of humid gas cleaning will focus on multi-contaminant syngas cleaning. Groups of several syngas contaminants to be removed simultaneously need to be considered, resulting in significant gas cleaning system intensification. Intensified, multi-contaminant cleaning processes need to be devised and their potential performance characteristics understood through small-scale testing, conceptual design evaluation, and scale-up assessment with integration into the power generation system. Results of a 1-year study undertaken by DOE/NETL are presented to define improved power plant configurations and technology for advanced multi-contaminant cleanup options.",,"Coal derived SYNGAS; Contaminant removal; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Nitrogen oxides; Power generation; Gasification",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44249111446

The index is based on the exceedance of local thresholds of the daily maximum wind speed. Positive trends for both the severity of storms during the historic ERA40 period (1960-2000), and under anthropogenic climate change (ACC) conditions (SRES A1B and A2) are identified. Additionally an increase in the spatial extent of storms is diagnosed, amounting up to about 10% between present day and the scenario climate. Two types of the index are introduced: One area integrated measure for the investigation domain of 50°W to 20°E, 45°N to 70°N, called ASSI (Area Storm Severity Index), per day; and one event integrated index, called ESSI (Event Storm Severity Index), per storm event. ASSI and ESSI clearly identify extreme ""cyclone bombs"" under ACC conditions, which exceed the range found in observed (ERA40) and simulated data for the recent climate. ASSI and ESSI identify an increase in the severity of storms for the Northeast Atlantic and western Central Europe under ACC conditions. The index can easily be calculated for large data sets, and is thus well applicable to multi-model ensemble simulations in order to objectively estimate climate change signals and related measures of uncertainty. Reasons for the increase in severity could be seen mainly in the occurrence of higher wind speeds, and in larger areas affected by storms. These larger areas result from longer tracks combined with a common broadening along the path. © Gebrüder Borntraeger, Berlin, Stuttgart 2008.",,"Anthropogenic climate change]; Central Europe; Large datasets; Maximum wind speed; Multi-model ensemble; North East Atlantic; Reanalysis; Severity index; Simulated data; Spatial extent; Storm events; Wind speed; Hurricane effects; Storms; Uncertainty analysis; Climate change; atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; conference proceeding; cyclone; data set; ensemble forecasting; estimation method; simulation; storm; wind velocity; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northeast); Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63649106398

UV-visible absorption measurement techniques have been used for ground-based remote sensing of atmospheric trace species. The multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) technique, one of the remote sensing techniques for air quality measurement, uses scattered sunlight as a light source and measures it at various elevation angles by sequential scanning with a stepper motor. Ground-based MAX-DOAS measurements were carried out to investigate ClO, SO2 and NO 2 levels in the mid-latitude coastal boundary layer from 27 May to 9 June, 2005, and SO2 and NO2 levels in fossil fuel power plant plumes from 10 to 14 January 2004. MAX-DOAS data were analyzed to identify and quantify ClO, SO2 and NO2 by utilizing their specifi c structured absorption features in the UV region. Differential slant column densities (dSCDs) for ClO, SO2 and NO2 were as high as 7.3 × 1014, 2.4 × 1016 and 6.7 × 10 16 molecules/cm2 (with mean dSCDs of 2.3 × 10 14, 8.0 × 1015 and 1.2 × 1016 molecules/cm 2), respectively, at a 3°elevation angle in the coastal boundary layer during the measurement period. Based on the assumption that the trace gases were well mixed in the 1 km height of the boundary layer, estimates of the mean mixing ratios of ClO, SO2 and NO2 during the measurement period were 8.4 (±4.3), 296 (±233) and 305 (±284) pptv, respectively. MAX-DOAS measurement of the power plant plumes involved making vertical scans through multiple elevation angles perpendicular to the plume dispersion direction to yield cross-sectional distributions of ClO, SO2 and NO2 in the plume in terms of SCDs. Mixing ratios based on the estimated cross-sections of the plumes were 15.5 (ClO), 354 (SO2) and 210 (NO2) ppbv in the plumes of the fossil fuel power plant.

It analyzes three potential PV based designs of the solar power plant - single-axis tracking flat plate, fixed flat plate, and two-axis tracking concentrating photovoltaics (CPV) based on the solar insolation on Kauai. Greenhouse gas (GHG) avoided, energy production projection, capital costs, operation & maintenance (O&M) costs, and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of each PV design is developed for comparison. Regardless of the PV technology, the following factors may position solar PV power plant as a competitive alternative to conventional fossil-powered power plant: • Recent technology advances have occurred in concentrating solar collectors increasing overall efficiency. • Use of renewable energy can lead to reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. • Fossil fuels (e.g. natural gas and oil) retail prices are near record highs, increasing electricity rates. The assessment results show that single-axis tracking flat plate PV system are best suited for sites in Kauai as they accommodate the intermittent cloud cover of the region while following the sun from dawn until dusk as it crosses the sky.

We find that emissions trading could lead to cost-savings for both the Annex-1 countries as a whole and for the individual countries, as compared with the case of no-trading. The sum of the compliance costs is minimized under the cost-effective condition where marginal costs of domestic abatement are equalized across the Annex-1 countries. However, such a condition of cost effectiveness in emissions trading does not imply cost effectiveness in terms of the compliance of individual countries. The buyers of emission allowances, consisting of the European Union, the United States and Japan, could have even lower costs of compliance in the trading case where the ancillary benefits are taken into consideration. This result supports the intervention that takes account of the ancillary benefit in designing national carbon mitigation policies. To achieve the cost effectiveness in national carbon abatement, there should be regulatory interventions so that the price of carbon emission allowances can reflect the ancillary benefits.","Ancillary benefits; Carbon mitigation; Cost effectiveness; International emissions trading",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957014995

The increasingly widespread effects of climate change and continuous uncertainty of conventional energy supplies are causing an increasing demand for the transition of the cities through sustainable urban development. The quickest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is by being more efficient with the way energy is consumed, by reducing consumption, and by transferring to renewable energy sources. Energy savings require the development and use of more efficient appliances and the retro-fitting of the existing building stocks to make the most of natural daylight, rainwater, cooling breezes, and solar exposure, or reducing or eliminating the need for artificial lighting, cooling, and heating. A general lack of training, education, and research activity in sustainability has been identified across the professions involved. The design criteria for major infrastructure, such as bridges, ports, campuses, shopping centers, etc. will need to be urgently redefined to facilitate the transformation of cities towards renewable sources, and readjusted for extreme climatic events, like floods, storm surges, global temperature increases, sea-level rise, water shortages, and droughts. This again illustrates the need to implement climate-responsive ""Green Urbanism"" and to transform the existing fossil-based energy infrastructure of the cities. © 2008 Copyright © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The framework allows the ex-ante simulation of agricultural or agri-environmental policy impacts on a wide range of environmental problems such as climate change (GHG emissions), air pollution and groundwater pollution. Those environmental impacts can be analyzed in the context of economic and social indicators as calculated by the economic model. The methodology consists of four steps: (i) definition of appropriate calculation units that can be considered as homogeneous in terms of economic behaviour and environmental response; (ii) downscaling of regional agricultural statistics and farm management information from a CAPRI simulation run into the spatial calculation units; (iii) designing environmental model scenarios and model runs; and finally (iv) aggregating results for interpretation.

Examining the debate about the role of nuclear power in the United States' response to climate change, the Article observes that first-and second-tier risks often differ in character, or require different types of regulatory solutions (market-based versus command-and-control). Due to these variations, the public may hold starkly different views about regulation of each tier, and those views may be differently ""sticky"" - that is, differently susceptible to persuasion. In the context of the nuclear power debate, this tiering of opinion has perverse implications. The first-tier risks of nuclear power are those associated with individual reactors, including the risks of accident or terrorist attack; the second-tier risks are those associated with mining, transport, processing, storage, and disposal of radioactive materials. Recent work asserts that despite entrenched public fear of nuclear power, it may be possible to induce people to support construction of low-emissions reactors as a strategy for mitigating climate change. But even if policymakers could employ the risk education strategies discussed in the literature to shift public opinion in favor of nuclear reactor development, there is no reason to think such strategies would be equally effective at changing attitudes toward the second-tier risks of radioactive materials and the command-and-control regulations necessary to address those risks. To the contrary, many people would likely continue to oppose certain types of government action on these derivative problems, even assuming complete success of the hypothetical first-tier education strategy and resulting support for expansion of nuclear facilities. As a result, the United States could find itself with a thriving nuclear power sector, but without the political will to address the grave collateral rish. These observations lead to two conclusions, one related to the nuclear power example, and one to risk regulation more broadly. First, differently sticky public attitudes toward first- and second-tier nuclear risks and their regulatory solutions may defeat any effort to respond to climate change via an increase in U.S. reliance on nuclear power. Second, efforts to change public risk perceptions may not advance a regulatory agenda, and may even prove counterproductive. Specifically, where multiple risk layers exist, a successful first-tier education effort and consequent policy changes could create or expose second-tier risks that defy regulatory solution, leaving policymakers stranded at the abrupt and unexpected end of a half-built bridge. Depending on the gravity of the second-tier risks, this regulatory dead end could be one that neither policymakers nor the public would have chosen beforehand.

The intent is to fully support the forthcoming June 2008 DOE submittal to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) based upon the latest DOE draft DOE/EIS-0250F-SID dated October 2007 which shows that the latest DOE YM doses would readily satisfy the anticipated NRC and Environmental Protection Agency (EP) standards. The proposed Advance Fuel Cycle can offer potential resolution of obstacles that might arise during the NRC review and, particularly, during the final hearings process to be held in Nevada. Another reason for the proposed concept is that a substantial capacity growth of the YM repository will be necessary to accommodate the SNF of Advance Light Water Reactors (ALWRs) currently under consideration for United States (U. S.) electricity production (1) and the results of the recently issued study by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) to reduce CO2 emissions (2). That study predicts that by 2030 U. S. nuclear power generation would grow by 64 GigaWatt electrical (GWe) and account for 25.5 percent of the overall U. S. electrical generation. The current annual SNF once-through fuel cycle accumulation would rise from 2000-2100 MT (Metric Tons) to about 3480 MT in 2030 and the total SNF inventory, would reach nearly 500,000 MT by 2100 if U. S. nuclear power continues to grow at 1.1 percent per year after 2030. That last projection does not account for any SNF reduction due to increased fuel burnup or any increased capacity needed ""to establish supply Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP,) arrangements among nations to provide nuclear fuel and taking back spent fuel for recycling without spreading enrichment and reprocessing technologies"" (3). The anticipated capacity of 120 MT planned to be authorized by the U. S. Congress for commercial SNF and nuclear weapons would amount to only one quarter of the needs by 2100. The contingency strategy proposes to Recognize the presence of Transuranics (TRUs) at YM due to defense wastes being disposed there. Discourage the accumulation of separated Pu to satisfy the National Energy Policy Development Group of May 2001. Dispose the ""oldest"" once-through fuel at YM due to its reduced burn up, decay heat, and Transuranics (TRUs) content and to use the NRC to be approved Total System Performance Analysis (TSPA) methodology to show that its impact on dose would be minimal compared to the dose ""performance floor"" set by defense wastes (4). Avoid disposal of radioactive products at YM which do not need long isolation periods, i.e. Uranium (U), short term fission products, including Cesium and Strontium which can be allowed to decay separately in order to reduce the heat produced in SNF at YM(5). That element of the strategy will reduce significantly the material volume reaching YM. Stabilize the fission products capable of migrating, e.g. fixing the technicium in a matrix with cladding hulls (3) and capturing iodine in a stable solid waste form because its meteorological release as carried out in France will not be allowed in the U. S. Burn TRUs in LWRs in 10 to 20 percent fertile free fuel (FFF) or annular inert matrix fuel (IMF) rods using zirconia, ZrO2 and its cubic phase stabilized with Ytria (Y2O3) and including a burnable poison (erbia for pressurized water and gadolinia for boiling water reactors). References (6) and (7) show that after one fuel cycle, the Pu content of IMF is ""highly undesirable"" or ""conceivably unusable "". Disposition the separable IMF fuel rods at YM after one cycle to avoid multiple costly recycles because, as noted in reference (8), ""cubic zirconia is attractive as both a nuclear fuel-form and a nuclear waste form because it is an actinide host phase"". The proposed SNF contingency plan at YM will start sooner, be safer, more responsible, and much more economical than the proposed GNEP strategy because it does not need advanced fast reactors and multiple recycles. There is a need for a strong and continued development program to assure the success of the proposed contingency fuel cycle strategy. As suggested by a DOE ""Path to Sustainable Nuclear Energy"" (9) it emphasizes waste forms reaching YM assures their compatibility with YM environment, and provides potential to grow the capacity of YM.

Their pursuit has been going on in the United States (U.S.) since 1941 and that development work could help support the penetration of SFRs into the current nuclear power market in three forms: 1. A breeding SFR to increase the supply of fissile material. It will not happen for many decades because of increased uranium (U) resources, nuclear market ability to absorb increased U prices, and/or switch to a Thorium (Th) fuel cycle (under development in India) until the anticipated stringent regulations for breeding SFRs are defined and tested. 2. An economic SFR capable of competing with the Advance Light Water Reactor (ALWR) expected to produce electricity in the near future. The Generation IV (Gen IV) program is pursuing that goal under conceptual studies in South Korea (1) and, particularly under the demonstration Japan Sodium Fast Reactor (JSFR) (2) forecasted to start up by 2025 followed by the deployment of commercial JSFRs before 2050. 3. To use the pyroprocessing and electro refining methodology developed under the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR) (3) to separate the Light Water Reactor (LWR) spent nuclear fuel (SNF) Transuranics (TRUs) and to burn them in SFRs referred to as Advanced Burner Reactors (ABR). That innovative approach can significantly increase the capacity of geological repositories for disposition of LWR SNF. That last form of SFR is needed urgently to cope with the continued increase in U.S. inventories of recyclable fissile and fertile materials and, particularly, with the projected growth in LWR SNF. According to a recent Electrical Power Research Institute (EPRI) study (4) to reduce C02 emissions, the U. S. nuclear generated electricity will increase by 64 GigaWatt electrical (GWe) by 2030. While it is realized that additional long term interim storage can alleviate this need, it is not a long term solution because it will have to be followed eventually by final disposal or recycling of SNF. That worsening situation explains why most of this presentation is dedicated to the development of ABRs as proposed by the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) (5). It is also important to recognize that features developed under Gen IV could find their way into ABRs to improve their economics. Also ABRs can be designed to vary their conversion ratio and to attain breeding.

Their willingness of uptaking local generation technologies is stimulated through capital grant schemes and new regulations imposed on new building stock. Further growth will require the support from both markets and tight and timely building regulations. It is possible to project the growth of micro-generation for a given area, thus to assess their potential contribution in energy provision and emission reduction. It is however very challenging to evaluate their collective effects on networks, i.e. their impact on network losses, operational costs, maintenance cost and capital cost. This is due to the extensiveness of the HV/LV network. This paper explores potentially different approaches to evaluate the cost/benefits associated with a given level of MG penetration in the network at different countries, analysing their relative strengths and weakness in deriving network charges, and their potential to influence the growth and the points of connection of future MGs. The paper then uses a practical network to analyse cost/benefits to a low voltage network from different MG penetration, from which, the paper suggests a number of potential approaches to HV/LV network charges. © 2008 IEEE.","Distribution network charges; Network charging methodologies; Yardstick marginal cost","Air pollution; Building codes; Energy conversion; Laws and legislation; Magnesium printing plates; Maintenance; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Power generation; 21st century; Building regulations; Capital costs; Capital grant schemes; Carbon emissions; Collective effects; Distribution network charges; Electrical energy; Electricity bills; Emission reductions; Energy provisioning; General Public; Low voltage networks; Maintenance costs; Micro-generation; Network charging methodologies; Network losses; Operational costs; Potential contribution; Yardstick marginal cost; Electric generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349106358

The exhaust emissions were measured and compared to those for conventional low sulphur (<50ppm) diesel fuel. The engine used was a 6 cylinder, turbocharged, intercooled Perkins Euro2 Phaser Engine, fitted with an oxidation catalyst. The engine out gaseous emissions results for WCOB100 showed a large decrease in CO and HC emissions, but a small increase in NOx emissions compared to diesel. However, for FCO the CO and HC increased relative to WCOB100 and CO was higher than for diesel, indicating deterioration in fuel/air mixing. The particulate matter (PM) emissions for WCOB100 were similar to those for diesel at the 23kw condition, but greatly reduced at 47kw. The FCO produced higher engine out PM at both power conditions due to a higher volatile organic fraction (VOF). FCO was found to have the highest number of nuclei mode particles from the engine, but the greatest reduction across the oxidation catalyst. After the oxidation catalyst both FCO and WCOB100 had lower nuclei mode particle number emissions than diesel in the smallest size ranges measured. This was due to a high proportion of liquid aerosol particles, that were removed by oxidation at the catalyst and the effect of the oxygenates in the FCO and WCOB100 fuels that was to reduce the carbon particulate emissions from the engine. © 2008 SAE International.",,"Catalysts; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Engine cylinders; Fuels; Gas emissions; Oils and fats; Oxidation; DI diesel engine; Oxidation catalysts; Particle number emission; Particulate matter emissions; Particulate size distribution; Steady-state condition; Volatile organic fractions; Waste cooking oil; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072482224

Recent lab studies showed a reduction of 40-60% in ammonia emissions for an experimental (EcoCal tm) diet as compared the standard or control diet. However, adoption of a mitigation technology at commercial production level should be preceded by substantial field verification tests to document not only MH3 emission reduction, but also impact of the strategy on production performance of the hens and cash returns. A study to assess the effects of feeding diets containing EcoCal on NH3, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and carbon dioxide (CO2 emissions, laying-hen production performance, and economic returns was conducted at a commercial laying-hen farm in central Iowa. Two houses (256,000 or 262,000 hens per house) were used for the study. Hens in one house were fed the EcoCal diet while hens in the other house were fed a standard or control diet containing no EcoCal. A state-of-the-art mobile air emissions monitoring unit (MAEMU) and the associated sampling system were used to continuously monitor the gaseous concentrations, ventilation rate and environmental conditions. Comparative data collected from December 2006 to May 2007 are presented in this paper. Data from this period showed that the EcoCal diet led to NH3 emission reduction by up to 23.2% (0.86±0.04 and 1.12±O.O3 g/d-hen for EcoCal and Control diet, respectively), at the same time, H2S emission increased by up to 134% (4.38±0.20 and l.82±0.07 mg/d-henfor EcoCal and Control diet, respectively), although the magnitude ofH-S emission is rather small for both dietary regimens.

To minimize the undesirable impact of carbon dioxide emissions on the environment, many new technologies are being developed to reduce its emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. A promising technology is the multi-cyclic Carbonation and Calcination Reaction (CCR) process. The CCR process utilizes a calcium-based sorbent in a high temperature reaction (carbonation) to capture the CO2 from the flue gas stream. The subsequent calcination reaction releases a pure, dry stream of CO2, which can be sequestered. A 20 pph-scale facility firing coal has been constructed at The Ohio State University to demonstrate the CCR process. A number of calcium-based sorbents were tested at this facility. The effect of residence time and Ca/C ratio were evaluated and over 90% CO 2 capture was achieved on a once-through basis.

The neural network was used to acquire the weights of reservoir parameters through sample training and genetic algorithm was used to optimize the initial connection weights of nerve cells in case the neural network fell into a local minimum. Additionally, subordinate functions of each parameter were established to normalize the actual values of parameters of coalbed methane reservoirs in the range between zero and unity. Eventually, evaluation values of all coalbed methane reservoirs could be obtained by using the comprehensive evaluation method, which is the basis to rank the coalbed methane reservoirs in the order of exploitation priority. The greater the evaluation value, the higher the exploitation priority. The ranking method was verified in this paper by ten exploited coalbed methane reservoirs in China. The evaluation results are in agreement with the actual exploitation cases. The method can ensure the truthfulness and credibility of the weights of parameters and avoid the subjectivity caused by experts.

The reduction is performed using the directed-relation-graph with error propagation (DRGEP) method, which is implemented using a modified breadth-first search algorithm. Subsequently, kinetic equations are formulated with respect to the active species, with consideration given to the roles of the inactive species as third bodies. The DAC method is tested by simulating HCCI combustion of n-heptane, and a 578-species mechanism is used as the baseline mechanism. The DAC scheme reproduces with high accuracy the pressure curves and species profiles obtained by using the detailed mechanism. It introduces minimal computational overhead and achieves a more than 30-fold time reduction.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955591178

Five cities experiencing elevated O3 and PM2.5 levels were considered, i.e., Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, and New York. Reductions in anthropogenic NO emissions, due to currently planned emission controls, were predicted to decrease peak maximum 8-hr average O3 (MDA8h O3) levels between 2001 and 2050. Because of VOC-sensitive environments for daily peak ozone formation, the results showed that reductions in anthropogenic NO emissions are expected to increase MDA8h O3 concentrations on more than half of the days in 2001 depending on the city. The response of the annual averages was quite different than peak daily levels for both O3 and PM2.5, thus, health effects associated with acute exposures will respond differently than health effects associated with chronic exposures.

This article examines these interactions using analytical and simulation research and offers some policy recommendations. The major conclusions are that both instruments are required in order to meet the objectives, and that their use in combination may be advantageous regarding consumer costs. However, they must be carefully coordinated, since part of the carbon allowance price may be incorporated into the RES certificate price. This will produce a reduction in the strength of the emissions reduction signal, and also a different distribution of the cost of the policies.

Adiox is a construction material in which carbon particles are dispersed in a polymer such as polypropylene. Several types of components such as tower packings for wet scrubbers, demisters (droplet separators) and dry or semi-wet fixed bed fillings can be produced from Adiox material. The majority of the Adiox installations can be divided into three main categories: a) Adiox as police filter to reduce or eliminate the memory effect in scrubber systems with upstream dioxin removal in bag house filters. b) Adiox in combination with other dioxin removal technologies in order to improve the overall dioxin removal and increase the safety margins. c) Adiox as the primary dioxin removal system for meeting the EU waste incineration directive with an emission requirement of &lt;0.1 ng TEQ/m (n., d.g., 11% O2). At Mbjergvrket in Denmark, wet Adiox scrubbers in combination with one electrostatic precipitator per line act as the main dioxin filter since the fall of 2004. The dioxin measurements carried out so far show stack concentrations far below the emission limit. If Adiox is employed in a dry absorber instead of a wet scrubber, the specific removal efficiency is higher, which leads to smaller equipment sizes. A full-scale dry absorber has been in operation at the Linkping municipal waste incineration facility since the end of 2006.

The spacecraft's most prominent feature is the thermal protection system (TPS), composed of a large carbon-carbon conical shield, designed to withstand the Sun's violent temperatures. Thermal testing will be conducted on various coatings on the carbon-carbon targets in order to study mass loss components using mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique used to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. It is more generally used to find the composition of a physical sample by generating a mass spectrum representing the masses of sample components. By using a quadrupole mass spectrometer, the effects of plasma on various coated targets were analyzed and the effects of various gases on the plasma were studied on the PUPR Mirror/Cusp (M/C) plasma machine. A series of five tests was performed for this experiment; the first four tests consist of creating plasma with four different gases, and studying the effects of each gas on the plasma using mass spectrometry, in order to decide which plasma resembles the Sun's atmosphere or corona. The fifth test consists of introducing various coated targets, which represent the spacecraft's shield, inside the PUPR M/C plasma machine, to study how the different coatings react with the plasma that best bears a resemblance to the Sun's atmosphere, for approximately 12 h of exposure. After studying the results for the first four tests, it is evident that each gas has a distinctive effect on the plasma. For the fifth test following the study of the mass spectrometry results, it is clear that the quadrupole mass spectrometer was able to detect mass loss components for the introduced targets, and the presence of the coatings were successfully identified inside the PUPR M/C plasma machine, therefore assisting in the shield coating selection for the solar probe aircraft. © 2008 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.",,"Analytical techniques; Carbon targets; Coating selection; Mass loss; Mass spectra; Mass-to-charge ratio; Plasma machines; Quadrupole mass spectrometer; Space missions; Thermal Protection System; Thermal testing; Aircraft; Coatings; Heat shielding; Machine components; Mass spectrometers; Mass spectrometry; NASA; Probes; Solar wind; Space flight; Spacecraft; Sun; Targets; Testing; Space probes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350666754

The oncoming increasingly stringent emission limits demand improvements to the emission level especially in the cold start and engine warm-up phase when the catalyst is still inactivate. In this phase it is necessary to produce raw emissions on a very low level and to reach the catalyst light-off temperature as fast as possible using a suitable injection strategy. In this paper the potentials and risks of injection strategies for efficient catalyst heating (lean warm-up without secondary-air pump) with piezo and solenoid GDI combustion systems, in side and central mounting position, are introduced. The main emphasis is to obtain low HC emissions and high exhaust heat flow with acceptable engine smoothness by deriving suitable tuning parameters. During the investigations the various degrees of freedom of the applied GDI Engine were used in the best possible way. The basic investigations were carried out with steady state single cylinder engine dyno tests and cold engine conditions. For a deeper understanding of the in-cylinder processes, such as spray penetration and soot formation, an optical measurement technique based on high-speed video-endoscopy was used. It is shown that the Piezo and Solenoid GDI Combustion Systems of the Continental Automotive GmbH have the potential to perform a highly efficient catalyst heating engine operation, by means of suitable double and triple injection strategies. © 2008 SAE International.",,"Catalysts; Combustion; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Emission control; Endoscopy; Fuel systems; Fuels; High speed cameras; Optical data processing; Powertrains; Solenoids; Combustion systems; Demand improvement; Efficient catalysts; Experimental investigations; Fuel consumption reduction; Light-off temperatures; Optical measurement techniques; Single cylinder engine; Engine cylinders",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072456816

From the geological point of view, the Tremiti Islands are made of a sequence of bioclastic limestone, dolomitic limestone, calcilutite and calcarenite, with the age ranging from Paleocene to Middle Pliocene. These rocks are covered by a calcareous crust and loess deposits (Upper Pleistocene- Holocene). The structural set up of the major islands of the Tremiti (San Nicola and San Domino) is controlled by predominant NE-SW and E-W fault systems, which mark the coasdines of the islands. Along the cliffs, severe erosive processes are produced by different factors, as the climate and sea actions, and the effects of these processes are worsened by the seismic activity which affects the evolution of the cliff stability with time. Deeper instability processes are also observed at the Island of San Nicola as an effect of the presence of weak and low-cemented rock formations that are composed of dolomitic calcarenites, at the top of the island, and calcilutites. These processes are mainly represented by block topplings, slidings, rockfalls and roto-translative mass movements in some limited areas. These processes mainly threaten the cultural heritage buildings located on the island, as the Santa Maria Abbey, which have already suffered significant damages in the past. This study has represented the background for the engineering design of both the restoration works of the monumental area and the stabilization works of the cliffs below.","Cultural heritage; Geomorphology; Landslides; Rock cliff erosion; Tectonics; Tremiti Archipelago","cliff; cultural heritage; environmental restoration; erosion; geomorphology; instability; landslide; Pliocene; rockfall; toppling; Adriatic Sea; California; Channel Islands [California]; Eurasia; Europe; Foggia; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; North America; Puglia; San Nicolas Island; Southern Europe; Tremiti Islands; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-59049099129

In the end of 2003 oil shale circulating fluidised bed (CFB) combustion was introduced. The paper reviews results of operational experience and runtime tests of CFB boilers. The tests were carried out with the aim of upgrading the fuel supply chain for raising fuel utilisation efficiency, decreasing air emissions and fuel costs. Several fuel classes with various composition and heating values (8.5-11 MJ/kg) were fired. The corresponding thermal efficiency determination of the CFB steam boiler was carried out. The efficiency estimations were performed on the basis of the EN 12952-15:2003 standard and took into account the peculiarity of the used oil shale fuel: the heat and/or mass effects caused by dissociation of carbonates, pyrite combustion, calcium sulphate and new minerals formation. The results of the CFB units' environmental impact-related measurements of air emissions, including in addition to conventional gaseous components and solid particles also determination of heavy metals, PCDD/F, PCB and PAH and comparison with previous measurements at PF boilers are presented here. With the CFB technology a significant reduction of air emissions was achieved: SO2 concentration in flue gases dropped about 100 times to several ppm and NO x is about 2 times lower - 70-80 ppm. The long residence duration of fuel particles in circulating flow in the CFB case results in very low emissions of PAH and dioxins (1.472 pg I-TEQ/Nm3) as well.",,"Air pollution; Calcium carbonate; Environmental impact; Fluidized bed combustion; Fluidized beds; Fuels; Heavy metals; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Pulverized fuel fired boilers; Sulfur dioxide; Supply chains; Calcium sulphate; Circulating fluidised bed; Efficiency estimation; Estonian oil shale; Fuel utilisation efficiency; Operational experience; Power production; Thermal efficiency; Oil shale",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904823799

Sophistication of ships and marine platforms and expansion of offshore activities to non-investigated regions means increasing of probability of being damaged by high waves. Hindcasting of wave fields, using the hydrodynamic models is main approach to wave climate investigation. Offshore wave measurements are used, mainly, for model verification. In compliance with existent regulatory documents and accepted practice applied statistical characteristics of wind waves are prescribed to operational and extreme. Operational statistics describe wind and wave conditions for the life span of a ship or an offshore structure. Extreme characteristics determine the so-called ""structure survival regime"". There are a lot of approaches to calculations of extreme wave heights at a point (classical unconditional extremes). Their comparison shows the advantages and disadvantages of each of them. Freak (rogue) waves have some principal difference from extreme wave, mainly due to their form and asymmetry. In this sense freak wave is a multidimensional extreme. Contaminated distribution may be used for probability density approximation of joint extreme and freak wave. The example of recent freak wave event is the loss of ship ""Aurelia"" (Class of Russian Register of shipping) in February 2005 in the North Pacific. ""Aurelia"" sunk during passing of atmospheric front with veering wind, changing wind waves. Any wave has at least three dimensions: height, length, and crest length. The last parameter in mean is 3 times greater than wave length. Any information about three dimensional waves is of interest, as such measurements are unique. Some results of unique stereo wave measurements in the South Pacific where the wave as high as 24.9m was fixed (probably still almost the highest measured in the World Ocean), is presented and discussed.

This implies the implementation of innovative decisional tools for policy assessment to support the policy makers in the definition of effective energy-environmental strategies, coherent at different spatial scales. In this framework partial equilibrium models as the TIMES models generator, developed under the IEA-ETSAP Programme, represent a powerful tool to analyse global, national and local issues and to support the formulation of comprehensive policies. These tools are utilized in the framework of the Integrated Project NEEDS of the VI Framework Programme to implement a unique modelling platform, the Pan European NEEDS TIMES model, based on the integration of the energy system models of 30 EU countries, which are linked by energy and emissions trades.

In this regard, apart from the vehicle, fuel choice is also important, considering that the same vehicle accept both diesel and biodiesel. However, it is necessary to analyze the effects of this fleet renewal and the effectiveness of using biodiesel in stead of conventional diesel. This analysis has involved tests on test tracks and in real operating conditions. The most important drawbacks of real tests are the difficulty when comparing results and the lack of repeatability. These problems increase if tests should be carried out in different places or cities. On the other hand, tests on test tracks make us to define a set of tests that reproduces the most common situations that can be found in normal driving conditions. Furthermore, these tests should be easy to carry out by a driver in order to achieve high repeatability. For previous reasons in the project that this paper describes, speed profile was obtained for different vehicles in real working conditions. A device was developed for this data acquisition by the research team. Data was stored in a memory card and no driver action was required, so he is not aware about what the device is doing. Using these data, tests for driving in urban areas, driving along rural roads, garbage collection cycles, streets water operations, etc were defined. Exhaust emissions have been measured using the Horiba OBS 2200 onboard emission measurement system. This equipment measures CO, C02, NO x and HC emissions and fuel consumption, and data is stored in a laptop. For particulates matter, the diesel exhaust particulate onboard analyser OPMS-04 equipment of Maha was used. Different comparisons have been carried out. Among others, present vehicles and new vehicles that are replacing old ones have been compared and different fuels were used in tests: diesel and biodiesel with different cases (B50 and B100). These comparisons were possible thanks to previous tests definition. Finally, extrapolation to real operating conditions involve variable load. At this point, tests on real operating conditions provided us correcting factors for fuel emissions results that should be used in order to consider changes in the vehicle load. Furthermore, the methodology has been validated dividing the whole real tests in shorter tests and comparing the accumulated exhaust emissions that onboard equipment provides and the addition of emissions produced during theoretical tests, corrected by the previously mentioned factors.","Biofuel; Consumption; Exhaust emissions; Onboard measurement; Refuse truck","Consumption; Correcting factor; Diesel exhaust particulates; Emission measurement systems; Exhaust emission; Fuel choices; Fuel emissions; Garbage collection; HC emissions; Memory card; Normal driving; On-board equipment; On-board measurements; Particulates matters; Real operating conditions; Refuse truck; Research teams; Speed profile; Test track; Urban areas; Variable loads; Vehicle load; Water operations; Working conditions; Biodiesel; Biofuels; Equipment; Fuels; Laptop computers; Refuse collection; Tankers (ships); Vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866075951

Tramp air is unwanted air that leaks into the process downstream of the combustion chambers. We have been utilizing instrumentation to evaluate the levels of oxygen in different stages in the system to determining where there might be additional air coming in. We have installed a series of instrument ports along the air pollution control system where, using portable oxygen monitors, we are able to see unexpected increases in oxygen levels. Through further evaluation, we have been able determine the extent of specific leaks and correct them. Through the location and correction of air in leakage, we have dropped oxygen content of the stack approximately 3%. This helps improve the performance in three ways. First the overall system load is reduced, allowing the ID fan to operate more efficiently for better pressure control overall. Second, less air downstream allows more combustion air to be placed into the combustion process, where it is needed. Third, a lower stack oxygen concentration allows for a more favorable oxygen correction factor for our THC monitor in the stack. One other advantage of removing sources of tramp air is that is will reduce spot corrosion through the system. The materials of construction are designed around the temperature remaining above the dew point. Air leaking into the wrong locations can create localized temperature drops, which can condense acid from the flue gas.",,"Air pollution control systems; Combustion airs; Combustion processes; Correction factors; Dew points; Localized temperatures; Materials of constructions; Overall systems; Oxygen concentrations; Oxygen contents; Oxygen levels; Oxygen monitors; Acids; Air quality; Combustion; Combustion chambers; Concentration (process); Control systems; Digital signal processing; Flue gases; Heat treatment; Leakage (fluid); Location; Nonmetals; Oxygen; Refuse incinerators; Smoke; Thermochemistry; Waste incineration; Waste management; Waste treatment; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55849093659

Their valuable goods and services are fundamental to the livelihood of large coastal populations in the tropics. The health of many of the world's coral reefs, and the goods and services they provide, have already been severely compromised, largely due to over-exploitation by a range of human activities. These local-scale impacts, with the appropriate government instruments, support and management actions, can potentially be controlled and even ameliorated. Unfortunately, other human actions (largely in countries outside of the tropics), by changing global climate, have added additional global-scale threats to the continued survival of present-day coral reefs. Moderate warming of the tropical oceans has already resulted in an increase in mass coral bleaching events, affecting nearly all of the world's coral reef regions. The frequency of these events will only increase as global temperatures continue to rise. Weakening of coral reef structures will be a more insidious effect of changing ocean chemistry, as the oceans absorb part of the excess atmospheric carbon dioxide. More intense tropical cyclones, changed atmospheric and ocean circulation patterns will all affect coral reef ecosystems and the many associated plants and animals. Coral reefs will not disappear but their appearance, structure and community make-up will radically change. Drastic greenhouse gas mitigation strategies are necessary to prevent the full consequences of human activities causing such alterations to coral reef ecosystems. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"carbon dioxide; acidification; biodiversity; climate change; coral reef; environmental impact; global climate; greenhouse effect; marine environment; priority journal; review; salinity; sea; sea level; water temperature; Animals; Anthozoa; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Greenhouse Effect; Animalia; Anthozoa",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37849023116

Climatology databases are usually constructed as lookup tables with discrete regular latitude, longitude and time grids. The lookup table climatologies not only require large amount of memory, but also retrieving information from the climatology databases can be very time consuming as it usually requires search and interpolation on a multi-dimensional space. This paper presents a neural network approach for creating climatology databases that overcome the problems of the classical lookup tables. The neural networks provide in addition to the output parameters their first-order partial derivatives (Jacobian matrix) required for statistical analysis and retrieval algorithms. Moreover, the neural networks can use new proxies to efficiently fetch data from the climatology; the parameters obtained are therefore closer to the real state of the Earth's system. The proposed approach is applied to the development of a neural network based temperature profile climatology and the results are discussed in detail. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Climatology; Database systems; Digital circuits; Image classification; Meteorology; Ozone; Remote sensing; Space optics; Table lookup; Temperature control; Vegetation; Climate researches; Environmental forecasting; First orders; Geophysical parameters; Global temperatures; Look-up tables; Multi-dimensional; Output parameters; Partial derivatives; Real states; Retrieval algorithms; Statistical analysis; Surface albedos; Temperature profiles; Time consuming; Time grids; Neural networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56349123375

To confirm the location of the lesion before tissue sampling, an additional confirmation scan is often obtained to view and adjust the needle position. For Positron Emission Mammography (PEM) guided localization procedures, a low activity radioactive line source is used to confirm the biopsy device position relative to the targeted lesion. However the typical time for a confirmation scan of 5 minutes makes real-time adjustments infeasible. We have developed a method to view PEM images in nearly real-time so as to visualize lesion displacement within 30 seconds. Phantom and patient data were collected on a high-resolution, small-organ, PET scanner (PEM Flex, Naviscan Inc., San Diego, USA). The real-time display is realized by showing only one imaging plane and calculating the intersection point of each line of response (LOR) through a plane where the lesion was targeted. A variety of refresh and persistence times from 2 to 30 seconds were evaluated. In a phantom study the point source and line source movements were successfully visualized in real-time with a refresh time of two seconds and a persistence time of 10 to 15 seconds.

In January, NOx reductions increase ozone, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde everywhere. VOC reductions decrease aldehydes but have little effect on ozone in this domain. A combination of VOC and NOx reductions reflects the cumulative behavior of each of the emission reductions separately, and minimizes disbenefits for both HAPs and ozone. A comparison of these changes in terms of their effect on health shows that differing behavior of PM2.5 and ozone can counterbalance each other to some extent. While changes in HAPs are affected by changes to reduce ozone and PM2.5, their effect on health impacts is smaller than PM2.5 and ozone.

The blast furnace/converter route will remain dominant within the EU 27 on a long term with a share of 60%. The basic pre-product for this route is hot metal from blast furnaces. Blast furnaces cannot be operated without coke and they are dependent on high grade coke supply. Many young and high tech coke plants are operated in Europe, but some are old and need lifetime enlargement measurements or revamping. The new batteries of the coke plant Schwelgern in Germany represent the most advanced state of development of the multi chamber system. This plant has by far the biggest coking chambers in the world. The European integrated steel works operate successfully blast furnaces at low reductant rates, high productivities and long campaign lives. This can only be achieved with the use of cokes having excellent properties, especially for the operation of large volume blast furnaces. The coke demand and supply balance of the EU was characterized by a steady decrease in available coke plant capacities since 1990 and a coke shortage since 2000 for the former EU 15. Poland is the main internal coke supplier for other EU 27 countries. The projects for new coke batteries or revamping of batteries will result in an enlargement of available coke capacity within the EU 27 from 2008 on.

In this study, a seasonal hydrologic ensemble prediction system is developed and evaluated over the eastern United States, with a focus on the Ohio River basin. The system uses a hydrologic model (i.e., the Variable Infiltration Capacity model) as the central element for producing ensemble predictions of soil moisture, snow, and streamflow with lead times up to six months. One unique feature of this system is in the method for generating ensemble atmospheric forcings for the forecast period. It merges seasonal climate forecasts from multiple climate models with observed climatology in a Bayesian framework, such that the uncertainties related to the atmospheric forcings can be better quantified while the signals from individual models are combined. Simultaneously, climate model forecasts are downscaled to an appropriate spatial scale for hydrologic predictions. When generating daily meteorological forcing, the system uses the rank structures of selected historical forcing records to ensure reasonable weather patterns in space and time. Seasonal hydrologic predictions are made with this system, using seasonal climate forecast from the NCEP Climate Forecast System (CFS), and from a combination of the NCEP CFS and seven climate models in the European Union's Development of a European Multimodel Ensemble System for Seasonal-to-Interannual Prediction (CFS+DEMETER). Forecasts of these two types are made for the summer periods (May to October) of 1981-99 and are compared to forecasts produced with the traditional Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) approach used in operational seasonal streamflow predictions. The forecasts from this system for the summer of 1988 show very promising skill in precipitation, soil moisture, and streamflow over the Ohio River basin, especially the multimodel CFS+DEMETER forecast. The evaluation with all 19 summer forecasts shows that the multimodel CFS+DEMETER forecast is significantly better than the ESP forecast during the first two months of the forecasts. The advantage is marginal to moderate when only the CFS forecast is used. This study validates the approach of using seasonal climate predictions from dynamic climate models in hydrological predictions, and it also emphasizes the need for international collaborations to develop multimodel seasonal predictions. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"atmospheric forcing; Bayesian analysis; ensemble forecasting; hydrological modeling; streamflow; uncertainty analysis; North America; Ohio River; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049125782

Respiratory alkalosis is a result of hyperventilation, i.e., reduced partial CO2 pressure in alveolar air and blood. Yet another type of alkalosis, i.e., metabolic alkalosis, is associated with an absolute or relative increase in the levels of alkaline compounds in the organism. Despite high toxicity of the latter, mechanisms whereby these compounds exert their toxic effects remain obscure. In multicellular organisms, cell survival is controlled by a vast variety of factors, such as autocrine survival factors (AF) specifically targeted at cells that secrete them. Our previous studies (Lutsenko and Diachkova, 2003) demonstrated that AF control cell survival and energy metabolism in T-lymphocytes. In this study, combined effects of AF deficiency and alkalosis (pH 8.3) on cell survival, intracellular content of ATP and mitochondrial transmembrane potential of T-lymphocytes were studied using an IL-2-dependent cell line CTLL-2. It was found that in the absence of AF deficiency, alkalosis had no effect on survival of cultured CTLL-2 cells. The main mechanism of protection of CTLL-2 cells against cytotoxic effects of alkalosis was an enhanced anaerobic glycolysis and consequential increase in the lactate production. In contrast, alkalosis combined with AF deficiency caused a substantial decrease of cell survival, which lowered down to 53% after 6 h and to about 10 % after 20 h of culturing under these conditions. The ATP content dropped down sharply under the AF deficiency even at pH 7.3 but gradually restored to the initial level within the next 2-3 h; cell survival was at a high level under these conditions. Alkalosis combined with the AF deficiency notably worsened the functional state of the cells; ATP content in them remained at a low level over the whole period of the alkaline stress. After a 2-h incubation under alkalosis and AF deficiency, 23% of cells contained depolarized mitochondria; lactate production was notably suppressed. The data obtained suggest that the reduction of the intracellular ATP level in CTLL-2 cells under alkalosis and AF deficiency are due to inhibition of anaerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction.

At the same time the market requires dynamic vehicles with improved fuel economy. The direct injection turbocharged engine is ideal to meet the market requirements and the corresponding BMW Efficient Dynamics strategy: more power, less weight and less fuel consumption. It is therefore important to build up know-how concerning turbocharged engines with minimal emissions. The key factor for low emissions is the heating up phase in the beginning of the FTP test. Due to the turbocharger as an additional heat sink new emission reduction strategies are required. A systematic development approach for emission systems considering three elements is introduced: raw emissions, exhaust system heating up and catalyst conversion. For each element BMW develops physical and/or empirical models to discover the potential of different emission reduction measures and to evaluate emission concepts. All three elements -raw emissions, heating up and conversion - are subject to optimizations. Selected examples of optimization are presented and an outlook of the emission potential is given. With the help of consistent application of innovative development methods and the benefits of the direct injection turbocharged engine it is possible to achieve minimal emissions accompanied by high performance and improved fuel economy.","Direct injection; Efficient dynamics; Emission; SULEV; Turbocharged engine","California; Catalyst conversion; Development approach; Development method; Emission legislation; Emission potential; Emission reduction; Emission reduction strategy; Emission standard; Empirical model; Heating up; Key factors; Low emission; Market requirements; Selected examples; SULEV; Turbocharged engine; Direct injection; Dynamics; Emission control; Fuel economy; Neutron emission; Optimization; Technology transfer; Vehicles; Exhaust systems (engine)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866120153

The time and cost of a transition to a hydrogen infrastructure cause some to look instead for more incremental changes to reduce emissions. This paper examines the potential for reducing GHG emissions by technological improvements, under the assumption that end-use activity continues to grow. The scope is limited to two major energy sectors: light-duty vehicles (LDV) and electricity generation. These two sectors are natural targets for regulations on CO 2 emissions, because they already are regulated for pollutants, such as CO and NO x. In the United States, the LDV sector is also regulated with respect to fuel economy, with manufacturers required to sell fleets of cars and trucks that meet the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. This study looks at two of the ""wedges"" of the growth triangle that Pacala and Socolow (2004) suggested could be part of a GHG stabilization strategy. The scope is also limited to the US. While the US did not ratify the Kyoto treaty, which intended to limit emissions to 5% below 1990 levels, individual states are trying to establish mandates, and there is speculation that the US will limit GHG emissions in the future.",,"CO and NO; Corporate average fuel-economy standards; Electricity generation; End-uses; Energy sector; GHG emission; Hydrogen infrastructure; Hydrogen technologies; Incremental changes; Kyoto treaty; Light duty vehicles; Natural targets; Technological improvements; Carbon dioxide; Electric generators; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Hydrogen; Laws and legislation; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866335821

Any reduction in vehicle fuel consumption will also reduce CO2 emissions, and any reduction in CO2 emissions requires a reduction in fuel consumption. In 2004, pursuant to Assembly Bill (AB) 1493, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) adopted greenhouse gas emission standards for new vehicles that would require substantial reductions in CO2 emissions and fuel consumption from light-duty motor vehicles. In December 2007, Congress made significant amendments to the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program with the passage of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA2007). After the President signed EISA2007 into law, U.S. EPA announced its decision to deny an application for a waiver of federal Clean Air Act preemption that CARB was seeking in order to enforce its AB 1493 regulations. CARB has challenged U.S. EPA's decision to deny the waiver, claiming that the AB 1493 regulations and a second phase of standards that are not yet adopted would achieve the following: 1Yield a new vehicle fleet with higher fuel economy ratings than will occur under the CAFE regulations, and 2Yield greater GHG emission reductions than will occur under the federal program. This paper-which is the first of a two-part series-addresses the issue of whether the California rules do, in fact, yield a new vehicle fleet with higher fuel economy ratings than under the CAFE regulations. The second paper1 addresses the issue of whether the California rules yield greater fuel consumption and GHG emission reductions. A comparative analysis of the AB 1493 regulations and the federal CAFE standards required under EISA2007 indicates that the federal CAFE standards require greater reductions in fuel consumption. CARB's conclusion that the AB 1493 standards are superior to those under the CAFE program rests on the assumption that a second round of AB 1493 standards (referred to as Pavley 2) will ultimately be adopted in California, even though CARB has not yet started the process required under State law to adopt new standards. Further, CARB has not even attempted to demonstrate that compliance with the Pavley 2 standards is either technically feasible or cost effective. Absent CARB's assumption that compliance with the hypothetical Pavley 2 standards is both feasible and cost effective, the federal CAFE program will result in greater improvements in new vehicle fuel economy than the California standards.

The results indicate that the major alkanes of heavy fuel oil include C8 to C33 (including pristane and phytane). The major aromatics of heavy fuel oil include CnB (B:benzene), CnN (N:naphthalene), CnP (P:phenanthrene), and CnD (D:dibenzothiophene). The 24-week weathering experiment indicates that n-C8∼n-C15 evaporate in order of increasing carbon number as time passes and the relative abundance of alkanes with long chains (>n-C19) increases noticeably. The CnB, C0N, C1N, C2N, and C3N evaporate in order of increasing carbon and ring number as time passes and CnP and CnD become the major aromatics in heavy fuel oil after 24 weeks. The ratios of n-C17/pristane (Pr) and n-C18/phytane (Ph) declined noticeably after 6 weeks. The ratios of n-C17/n-C18 and Pr/Ph noticeably changed after 24 weeks.

The aviation industry is responding with the development of new technologies towards achieving those goals. A significant reduction in noise and improved fuel consumption can be achieved by varying the area of a commercial jet engine's fan nozzle. A larger diameter at takeoff and approach can reduce jet velocity reducing noise. Adjusting the diameter in cruise, to account for varying Mach number, altitude, etc, can optimize fan loading and reduce fuel consumption and emissions. Boeing recently tested a scaled variable area jet nozzle capable of a 20% area change. Shape Memory Alloy actuators were used to position 12 interlocking panels at the nozzle exit. A closed loop control system was used to maintain a range of constant diameters with varying flow conditions and to vary the diameter under constant flow conditions. Acoustic data by side line microphones and flow field measurements at several cross-sections using PIV was collected at each condition. In this paper the variable area nozzle's design is described.

Palaeobiogeographers working on Cenozoic fossil records and other lines of evidence are producing important insights into the dynamic nature of climate and the equally dynamic response of species, populations and communities. Climatic variations ranging in length from multimillennia to decades run throughout the palaeo-records of the Quaternary and earlier Cenozoic and have been shown to have had impacts ranging from changes in the genetic structure and morphology of individual species, population sizes and distributions, community composition to large-scale bio-diversity gradients. The biogeographical impacts of climate change may be due directly to the effects of alterations in temperature and moisture on species, or they may arise due to changes in factors such as disturbance regimes. Much of the recent progress in the application of palaeobiogegraphy to issues of climate change and its impacts can be attributed to developments along a number of still advancing methodological frontiers. These include increasingly finely resolved chronological resolution, more refined atmosphere-biosphere modelling, new biological and chemical techniques in reconstructing past species distributions and past climates, the development of large and readily accessible geo-referenced databases of biogeographical and climatic information, and new approaches in fossil morphological analysis and new molecular DNA techniques. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","Cenozoic; Climate change; Dendrochronology; DNA; Palaeobiogeography; Palaeolimnology; Palynology; Vertebrate palaeontology","atmosphere-biosphere interaction; Cenozoic; climate change; climate effect; climate variation; DNA; ecological impact; fossil record; paleobiogeography; paleoclimate; population size; reconstruction; species diversity; temperature effect; twenty first century; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55249103634

To find the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed methodologies, the developers of both method have teamed up to do a comparative study on the Sacramento Municipal Utility District's (SMUD) hydropower facilities. Better understanding of the differences and similarities of the two approaches makes it possible to more accurately extrapolate the impacts of climate change at the SMUD facility to other systems in California's Sierra Nevada.

Peat columns were collected from mires of varying depth, age and degree of natural state in the aapa mire and raised bog regions and coastal mires of southern and central Finland and Russian Karelia. The quantities of carbon sequestered during recent centuries and over the entire lifetimes of the mires were determined using a total of 367 dates (186 14CAMS and 181 conventional dates) and age-depth models derived from bulk density measurements. Particular attention was paid to accumulation over the last 100 and 300 years, as these periods encompass the best estimates of the acrotelm age across the range of sites investigated. The average carbon pool of layers younger than 300 years was determined as 101 ± 8 tonnes ha-1 in the aapa mire region, 115 ± 9 tonnes ha-1 in the raised bog region and 184 ± 20 tonnes ha-1 in coastal mires. Overall, the mean carbon pool of layers younger than 300 years was calculated to be 121 ± 7 tonnes ha -1 (range 44-259 tonnes ha-1) and of layers younger than 100 years 63 ±4 tonnes ha-1 (range 17-141 tonnes ha -1)-The size and dynamics of the carbon pool represented by these surface layers depends upon the mire site type, vegetation and natural state; variations reflect differences in plant communities as well as factors that affect biomass production and decay rates. The high carbon accumulation in surface layers is temporary and mainly related to the development of the mire. The surface layers are still undergoing a rapid carbon cycle. A relatively rapid accumulation and turnover of carbon is taking place in surface layers (&lt;300 years) in the same way as in a growing forest. Therefore, this ""pre-peat"" in the surface layers of mires should be distinguished as a separate class from the peat underneath, Our results indicate how important it is to understand the carbon accumulation rates of surface layers and the long-term dynamics of mire carbon accumulation in order to set the current flux estimates in perspective. © 2008 Suoseura - Finnish Peatland Society Helsinki.","Acrotelm; Carbon pool; Finland; Peat accumulation; Peatland; Turnover","biomass; Boreal; carbon sequestration; ecological modeling; flux measurement; forest ecosystem; paleoenvironment; peatland; plant community; raised bog; size structure; vegetation type; Finland; Karelia [(ADS) Russian Federation]; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77649164911

The total PAH concentration in the leaves of Ledum palustre collected from peatlands in NE Poland ranged from 232 ng/g to 1523 ng/g and was higher than the total PAH concentration in pine needles (Pinus sylvestris) taken from those same peatlands (the values ranged from 181 to307 ng/g). A similar trend was observed in the case of plants from the peatlands in SE Poland, except that the overall PAH concentration in the majority of the plant samples was found to be higher than those found in NE Poland. Phenanthrene and fluoranthene had the biggest share in the overall PAH concentration in all the peat and plant samples. The lack of 5- and 6-ringed PAHs in the plant and soil material indicates the lack of any direct emission sources of these compounds in regions adjacent to those examined in the study. Total sum of PAH pollution levels in peats and plants as well as vertical distribution of the concentrations in the soil profile of particular study sites integrates long-range pollution sources.

This study evaluates the effects of climate change in a real-life mixed land-use situation where there are adjacent urban and industrial activities and also fugitive emissions from stockpiles and unpaved roads. For this example we show how wind-speed and time-of-day dependent 'bi-polar plots' created from ambient monitoring data can be used to learn more about the nature of sources responsible for exceedances of particulate matter air quality standards, and hence to assess how sensitive their impacts are to climate change. Unpaved roads and wind-blown fugitive sources such as stockpiles and coal handling beds in the industrial area appear to contribute substantially to raised air-quality impacts. The effect of climate change on impacts from these sources may differ from its effect on impacts from conventional combustion sources.","Climate change; Fugitive source; Industrial regulation; Particulate matter","air quality; atmospheric pollution; climate change; conference proceeding; industrial emission; land use change; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollution effect; wind velocity; England; Eurasia; Europe; North Lincolnshire; Scunthorpe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56349166744

In particular, in Italy the O3 concentrations exceed the limits established for the protection of both human health and vegetation. More integrative studies are revealing that urban trees could concretely help in improving air quality, not only because of their well known aesthetic and recreational benefit, but also for their capability to reduce air temperature and to remove air pollutants. This reduction takes place both directly, by dry deposition to plant surfaces and uptake through stomata, and indirectly, by mitigation of the urban heat island intensity by canopy transpiration and building shading, that lowers the activity of chemical reactions that led to the formation of photochemical pollutants in air. This is of particular importance especially for those cities located in the Mediterranean Basin, whose urban vegetation is often characterized by VOC-emitting species that can contribute significantly to the O3 formation and destruction dynamics. The aim of this paper is to present a short review of ecological research performed on vegetation of the metropolitan area of Rome, at different spatial and temporal scale, in order to evaluate the functional role of urban green to monitor and improve urban air quality. In the frame of the project HEREPLUS (EU FP7), all of this information, opportunely integrated with climatic and pollutant data, will be implemented in a GIS and, by the use of geo-statistical methods, the ameliorating effect of urban vegetation will be quantified and mapped.","Air quality improvement; GIS; O3; PM; Pollutants uptake; Urban vegetation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67749103547

A similar technology is envisaged for long-distance transport of Hydrogen as an energy carrier. Two power plants with integration of the re-gasification process are proposed: the first proposal is a Hydrogen-fired steam power plant, while the second considers the use of LNG in an oxy-combustion arrangement with subsequent CO2 separation. Both power plants are of the reactive type, and use the heat sink provided by the cryogenic fuel and oxidant for heat rejection. Since CO2 removal is to be included in the steam power plant, the heat sink is in this case integrated in the compressor train of the separated carbon dioxide. These power plants seem suitable for peak load energy production. The power cycle performance was verified in both proposed cases by exergy analysis.","Cryogenic technology; Exergy; Hydrogen; Industrial applications; LNG","Carbon dioxide; Cryogenics; Environmental impact; Exergy; Heat sinks; Hydrogen; Industrial applications; Liquefied natural gas; Natural gas transportation; Seawater; Cryogenic technologies; Energy productions; Environmental compatibility; Exergy Analysis; Long-distance transport; Oxy combustions; Power plant performance; Re-gasification; Steam power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875165456

The magnitude and risks of climate change are now being more widely appreciated and the need for adaptation, including land use, is becoming a social imperative. Profound changes to ecosystems and biodiversity are predicted, and climate induced migration of biota is envisaged and is already being observed. Although the exact changes remain uncertain, landscapes and biota will be affected at all scales — from the local to sub-continental level. Space for biodiversity to ‘self-adapt’ is required. Maintaining and restoring ecological connectivity and resilience — biolinks — across landscapes are likely to be crucial aspects of adaptation to climate change. This is particularly so across human modified landscapes (e.g. agricultural landscapes) where the environmental legacy of habitat fragmentation and degradation is already a major global conservation issue. Past and current spatial patterns of human land use and management will also be affected by biophysical drivers and human adaptation. What will be the function, patterns and processes of future landscapes that we bequeath to future generations under climate change? What they look like will be product of societal choices informed by the community’s ‘sense of place’, that now includes biodiversity conservation. Visualisation tools, particularly when accurately linked to Geographic Information Systems, ecological perspectives and realistic photographic libraries, offer powerful facilities to assist the community, scientists, planners and all major stakeholders to plan for new landscapes that consider climate change, including biolinks. These digitally created landscapes that display physical properties of the real world can provide a useful medium for visualising the results from experimenting with outcomes of different management approaches building in biodiversity conservation. ‘Seeing’ can augment meaning and ‘sense of future place’, particularly when linked to a realism derived from ecology.

Mixing ratios of Hg° at TF showed distinct seasonality with maxima in March and minima in October. Hg° at AI tracked the trend at TF but with higher minima, while at PM the diurnal and annual cycles were dampened. In winter, Hg° was correlated most strongly with CO and NOy, indicative of anthropogenic emissions as their primary source. Our analysis indicates that Hg° had a regional background level of ∼160fmol/mol in winter, a dry deposition velocity of ∼0.20cms-1 witha ∼16 day lifetime in the coastal boundary layer in summer. The influence of oceanic emissions on ambient Hg° levels was identified using the Hg°-CHBr3 correlation at both TF and AI. Moreover, the lower Hg° levels and steeper decreasing warm season trend at TF (0.5-0.6 fmol/mold-1) compared to PM (0.2-0.3 fmol/mol d-1) likely reflected the impact of marine halogen chemistry. Large interannual variability in warm season Hg° levels in 2004 versus 2005/2006 may be due to the role of precipitation patterns in influencing surface evasion of Hg°. In contrast, changes in wintertime maximum levels of Hg° were small compared to drastic reductions in CO, CO2, NOy, and SO2 from 2004/2005 to 2006/2007. These trends could be explained by a homogeneous distribution of Hg° over North American in winter due to its long lifetime and/or rapid removal of reactive mercury from anthropogenic sources. We caution that during warmer winters, the Hg°-CO slope possibly reflects Hg° loss relative to changes in CO more than their emission ratio.",,"annual variation; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; diurnal variation; emission; mercury (element); particulate matter; seasonal variation; New England; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40549121990

To revert the increase in the Earth's temperature, developed country parties to the Kyoto Protocol committed to limit their greenhouse gas emissions. The 15 Member States that made up the European Community in 1997 have a combined reduction target of 8% in CO2-equivalent emissions in the period 2008-2012 compared to 1990. The role of soil, both as a source and a sink for carbon, is particularly important. How can soil organic matter be maintained or increased? There is no single answer, and a broad range of options need to be explored. Among the different measures proposed, the promotion of organic input on arable land (crop residues, cover crops, farm yard manure, compost, sewage sludge) has been mentioned. The challenge is to ensure that organic wastes of good quality are used to increase soil organic matter in carbon depleted soils and that appropriate monitoring is established. On the waste management front, the European Commission intends to produce guidance for Member States on the management of biowaste that will take into account all related environmental issues, including soil aspects. As for monitoring, the European Commission has put forward legislation according to which Member States would have to identify the areas at risk of soil organic matter decline in their national territory. Such legislation should be regarded as a major step forward for Europe, as it would ensure a high level of soil protection across the Community. This development will have the potential to enable the kind of estimation, measurement or modelling of crop or grazing land management needed for accounting under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The principle of carsharing is simple: individuals gain the benefits of private vehicle use without the costs and responsibilities of ownership. Carsharing is most common in major urban areas where transportation alternatives are easily accessible. Individuals typically access vehicles by joining an organization that maintains a fleet of cars and light trucks in a network of locations. Vehicles are most frequently deployed from lots located in neighborhoods, transit stations, employment centers, and colleges/universities. An increasing body of empirical evidence affirms that carsharing organizations provide numerous transportation, land use, social, and environmental benefits, including reduced vehicle miles/kilometers traveled and CO2 emissions. In this study, the authors outline the necessary factors that need to be considered in developing a obust estimate of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission impacts resulting from carsharing. A discussion of the theoretical foundations and methodological framework for calculating the impacts is presented. The methodology will be applied to evaluate member reductions across numerous carsharing organizations in Canada and the United States, simultaneously. Results derived from this methodology will characterize emission impacts by member profile, business model, market segment, pricing plan, and the type of environment (e.g., urban) in which the member uses carsharing.",,"Business models; Emission reduction; Employment Center; Environmental benefits; Market segment; Methodological frameworks; Private vehicles; Theoretical foundations; Carbon dioxide; Economics; Emission control; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Traffic control; Vehicles; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879012251

Deforestation is often driven by a desire to acquire land as a source of collateral, as a store of wealth and as a hedge against inflation. Changing the trajectory of deforestation will require policy programmes that reduce incentives for forest cover removal as a basis for land titling. More importantly, developing countries will need to be able to realize development goals through other means. Otherwise governments will continue to see land development as one of the few means within their reach to meet their goals for economic competitiveness and security. To realize contributions from forests in the context of climate change, the forestry community may need to return to its roots and explain with greater effectiveness the potential of sustainable forest management to boost the long-term carbon carrying capacity of forest biomass and soils. For the reasons indicated above, the political, social and economic costs associated with reducing deforestation are likely to be perceived as higher than the low opportunity cost from agricultural conversion. Discouraging economic a gents seeking fo capture land from engaging in deforestation will be politically challenging for governments. For commercial interests that can mobilize significant capital and access international markets competitively to produce the commodities in growing demand, the low level of carbon payments that could be foreseen will not be adequate to defer developments that can achieve scale economies. Furthermore, those who convert forest land may not own it, and would not necessarily be the recipients ofpayments made to discourage its conversion to other uses. A more feasible scenario would be one where actions to reward carbon sequestration more broadly in the rural environment are acknowledged; and where governments have more flexibility to use funds gained under an international compensation mechanism to apply a variety of initiatives such as land-use planning, zoning, conservation easements, forest management planning and training for underemployed rural and indigenous populations. In this scenario, economic agents - government, individuals and business - would be compensated for producing something additional (new carbon stored) rather than rewarded for ""not doing something"" (not deforesting or not degrading). Special attention must be given to providing support to traditional forest users and subsistence farmers to promote carbon-rich, community-friendly sustainable forest management.",,"carbon sequestration; deforestation; developing world; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; forest management; governance approach; land use change; sustainable forestry; trade-environment relations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69949156964

A great deal of human effort has been put into the careful use of finite resources and environmental impact reduction. The appropriate processing and the effective use of waste are really in demand in light of our social responsibility for manufacturing and energy development. In addition, the construction of a new recycle system for production is also important from the standpoint of the manufacturer's responsibility. A procedure is being developed to process industrial and municipal wet wastes to solid fuel, called Refuse paper &amp; plastic fuel (RPF), using superheated steam. A drying system using superheated steam is drawing much attention for use with drying high water content materials due to its high thermal efficiency. A material recycle system for processing high water content waste to solid fuel will be introduced in the present study using a demonstration system, and the optimum conditions for the system operation will be examined. The temperature and the quantity of superheated steam required for material drying are evaluated, and the energy consumption and emissions from the system are theoretically estimated and compared. The purpose of this paper is to test-operate a practical waste recycle system, and the results of this new system are compared with the results from a waste incinerator. The effectiveness of a drying system using superheated steam is shown from the standpoint of the reduction of CO2 emissions and energy consumption for the waste processing.

In this study, the atmospheric fields from NCEP R1 for the years 1948-2003 are used to drive an ocean biogeochemical model to probe how changes in the heat and freshwater fluxes and in the winds affect the Southern Ocean's uptake of carbon. Over this period, the model simulations herein show that the increases in heat and freshwater fluxes drive a net increase in Southern Ocean uptake (south of 40°S) while the increases in wind stresses drive a net decrease in uptake. The total Southern Ocean response is nearly identical with the simulation without climate change because the heat and freshwater flux response is approximately both equal and opposite to the wind stress response. It is also shown that any change in the Southern Ocean anthropogenic carbon uptake is always opposed by a much larger change in the natural carbon air-sea exchange. For the 1948-2003 period, the changes in the natural carbon cycle dominate the Southern Ocean carbon uptake response to climate change. However, it is shown with a simple box model that when atmospheric CO2 levels exceed the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of the upwelled Circumpolar Deep Water (≈450 μatm) the Southern Ocean uptake response will be dominated by the changes in anthropogenic carbon uptake. Therefore, the suggestion that the Southern Ocean carbon uptake is a positive feedback to global warming is only a transient response that will change to a negative feedback in the near future if the present climate trend continues. Associated with the increased outgassing of carbon from the natural carbon cycle was a reduction in the aragonite saturation state of the high-latitude Southern Ocean (south of 60°S). In the simulation with just wind stress changes, the reduction in the high-latitude Southern Ocean aragonite saturation state (≈0.2) was comparable to the magnitude of the decline in the aragonite saturation state over the last 4 decades because of rising atmospheric CO2 levels (≈0.2). The simulation showed that climate change could significantly impact aragonite saturation state in the Southern Ocean. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"Biogeochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Carbonate minerals; Climatology; Feedback; Global warming; Ocean engineering; Seawater; Wind stress; Air-sea exchanges; Anthropogenic carbons; Atmospheric CO; Atmospheric fields; Biogeochemical models; Box models; Carbon uptakes; Climate trends; Deep waters; Fresh-water fluxes; Model simulations; Natural carbons; Negative feedbacks; Positive feedbacks; Saturation state; Southern oceans; Stress changes; Stress response; Transient response; Oceanography; anthropogenic source; biogeochemical cycle; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate effect; gas exchange; global warming; heat flux; historical perspective; hydrological response; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57049170499

First, existing empirical evidence relating to state climate change policy adoption is reviewed. Following this brief discussion, several analytic approaches are presented that test specific hypotheses derived from the internal determinants and regional diffusion models of policy adoption. Policy diffusion is tested as a function of the motivations, resources, and obstacles of policy change. Motivations for policy innovation include environmental conditions and demands of citizens. Resources include state financial and geographic resources, such as wind and solar potential. Obstacles include a state's reliance on carbon-intensive industries such as coal and natural gas. The results show that internal factors, particularly citizens' demands, are stronger predictors of states' policies than are diffusion effects from neighboring states. © 2008 Policy Studies Organization.","Climate change policy; Energy policy; Green housegas policy; Internal determinants; Regional diffusion; Renewable portfolio standards; State policy adoption; State policy innovation","climate change; empirical analysis; energy policy; environmental conditions; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; quantitative analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56849111105

This engine is a second generation diesel engine, following the first diesel engine for vehicles at Honda, which was launched in 2004. This engine has realized large reductions in exhaust emissions, to allow compliance with EURO-V standards, and enhancements in output and NV performance. To enhance low exhaust emission performance, this engine adopted a 180 MPa common-rail system and optimized the shape of the combustion-chamber. Moreover, to enhance control accuracy under steady state and transient conditions, a Universal Exhaust Gas Oxygen (UEGO) sensor system was applied, and an electric-controlled EGR valve and electric swirl control valve newly developed. In order to enhance output, a newly developed highly efficient variable nozzle turbine (VNT) was adopted, and intake and exhaust system performance have been enhanced. The maximum power and maximum torque of this engine have been increased to 132 kW/380 Nm from 103 kW/340 Nm, compared to the previous model engine. NV performance is a vital concern for diesel passenger vehicles. The structural attenuation of the cylinder block has been improved by optimizing the cylinder block structure, and a new chain drive line layout and chain cover structure, which are able to reduce vibration and noise, have been developed. As a result, the NV performance of this engine exhibits extremely enhanced performance, compared to that of the first generation diesel engine. © 2008 SAE International.",,"Chains; Combustion chambers; Cylinder blocks; Diesel engines; Gas emissions; Passenger cars; Regulatory compliance; Common rail system; Diesel passenger vehicles; High performance diesel engines; Intake and exhaust systems; Steady state and transients; Swirl control valves; Turbocharged diesel engine; Universal exhaust gas oxygen sensor; Exhaust systems (engine)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072459784

Our primary aim is to investigate mass-loss rate and gas compositions of these stars as a function of metallicity, by comparing AGB stars in several galaxies with different metallicities. These stars were observed using the Infrared Spectrometer (IRS) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope which covers 5-35 μm region, and the Infrared Spectrometer And Array Camera (ISAAC) on the Very Large Telescope which covers the 2.9-4.1 μm region. HCN, CH and C2H2 molecular bands, as well as SiC and MgS dust features are identified in the spectra. We find no evidence that mass-loss rates depend on metallicity. Carbon stars are strongly affected by carbon production during the AGB phase; primarily mass-loss of carbon-rich stars are driven by amorphous carbon dust grains, that explains the little metallicity dependence of mass-loss rate for carbon-rich stars. We found that C2H2 bands are prominent features at 3-15 μm among extragalactic carbon stars, which is not always the case for Galactic carbon stars. We argue that carbon produced in AGB stars dominate the gas and dust chemistry in these stars in low metallicities. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.","Stars: AGB and post-AGB; Stars: atmospheres; Stars:mass-loss stars: carbon",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036530821

Historical data used in this study have been assembled for the normal climate period 1961–1990 (CNTRL). Future conditions are calculated based on the period 2071–2100, for which simulated datasets are available, based on GCMs integrated with scenarios. The scenarios used here are the Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) second report on emission scenarios (SRES) A1F and B1A, which represent a worst and a moderate climate case. The results are shown for December, January and February (DJF, winter months in the northern hemisphere), and for June, July and August (JJA, summer months in the northern hemisphere). Areas with extreme and uncomfortable thermal conditions and heat stress affections can be identified. In many regions of the world, e.g. the Mediterranean and North America, changes in thermal perception by humans are shown to outpace changes in air temperature. This has major implications for the assessment of the health effects of climate change. It is highly likely that the effects of climate change on human health and well-being have been underestimated in past studies, because these were based on air temperature changes rather than changes in PET, which describes the effects of meteorological and thermo-physiological parameters. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2008.","Heat Stress; Physiologically Equivalent Temperature; Thermal comfort",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976405190

Here, a simple two-tier statistical method is used to hindcast seasonal precipitation over the continental United States, and the resulting skill is compared with that of ENSO phase systems based on Niño-3 sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) and Southern Oscillation index (SOI) persistence. The two-tier approach first predicts Niño-3 winter season SSTA, and then converts those predictions to categorical precipitation hindcasts via a simple phase translation process. The hindcasting problem used to make these comparisons is relevant to winter wheat production over the central United States. Thus, given the state of seasonal SOI and Niño-3 indicators defined before August, the goal is to predict the tercile category of the following November-March precipitation. Generally, it was found that the methods based on either predicted or persisted winter Niño-3 conditions were skillful over areas where ENSO affects U.S. winter precipitation - that is, the Southeast and the Gulf Coast, Texas, the southern and central plains, the Southwest, Northwest, and the Ohio River valley - and that the two-tier approach based on predicted Niño-3 conditions was more likely to provide the best skill. Skill based on SOI persistence was generally lower over many of those regions and was insignificant over broad parts of the central and southwest United States, but did lead the other methods over the Ohio River valley and the northwest. A more restrictive test of leading hindcast skill showed that the skill advantages of the two-tier approach over the central, and western United States were not substantial, and mainly highlighted SOI persistence's lack of skill over the central United States and leading skill over the Ohio River valley. However, two-tier hindcasts based on neural-network-predicted Niño-3 SSTA were clearly more skillful than both ENSO phase methods over areas of the Southeast. It is suggested that the relative skill advantage of the two-tier approach may be due in part to the use of aribitrary thresholds in ENSO phase systems.",,"Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Forecasting; Information management; Landforms; Management; Nickel compounds; Resource allocation; Rivers; Soil conservation; Timing devices; Water conservation; Water management; Forecast informations; Gulf coasts; Hindcast; Hindcasting; Hindcasts; Neural-network; Ohio River valleys; Phase methods; Phase systems; Resource managements; Sea surface temperature anomalies; Seasonal precipitations; Southern oscillation indices; Statistical forecasts; Translation processes; United States; Watershed managements; Winter precipitations; Winter seasons; Winter wheats; Statistical methods; agricultural management; climate prediction; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; hindcasting; precipitation (climatology); statistical analysis; North America; United States; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57649213362

However, replacing natural gas by hydrogen causes flame temperature to raise and NOx emissions to increase (×3 to ×4 in NOx emissions between CH4 flame and H2 flame). As a consequence, careful studies of natural gas/hydrogen mixtures combustion are required in order minimize the impact of hydrogen on NOx emissions. Different mixtures of natural gas/hydrogen, ranging from 0% to 50% in volume of H2 in the fuel have been tested. Theses tests have been carried out on a steam boiler in the R&amp;D experimental facility of GDF SUEZ. A dedicated burner (LNTA0 from Babcock Wanson) was designed to handle a mixing up to 50% of H2 in the natural gas. The thermal input was fixed at 200 kW. The main results are described below: NOx concentration increases in proportion with H2 concentration (% vol.), Even with a small hydrogen concentration (7%), the flame gets closer to the flame arrester, The mean temperature is almost the same whatever the configuration all along this burner axis. However, locally, it increases with the H2 concentration, Hydrogen has been measured even far away from the burner (beyond 5D); it should become from a decomposition of CH4 to CO+ H2 instead of CO2.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953692966

Thus far, every federal court to consider these claims has held that they raise non-justiciable political questions consigned to the coordinate branches. These courts reason that federal courts lack jurisdiction over climate cases because climate change is textually committed elsewhere, there are no judicial standards to apply, and the elected branches have yet to render an initial policy determination about the subject. This article concludes that these courts either misapply or misapprehend the doctrine. It concedes that federal common law is not the optimal or only legal response to climate change. Yet it maintains that the political question doctrine is a false basis for dismissing climate cases that invoke these causes of action. The Constitution does not commit climate change to Congress or the executive. Federal common law provides ample and long-applied standards in cases involving disparate transboundary pollution. The elected branches have made initial policy determinations about climate change policies. Furthermore, there is good reason to question both the doctrine's jurisprudential bases and whether its framers meant it to be applied to federal common law in general, and climate cases in particular.

In this paper we discuss results from novel ion implantation schemes employed to maximize carbon incorporation and to achieve defect free, strained Si:C layers. In addition, high activation of the dopant is maintained even in the presence of relatively high carbon incorporation. Several anneal techniques including SPE anneal, spike RTP, and laser spike anneals have been used to optimize carbon incorporation, strain and activation.

While polling research indicates that most American adults believe climate change is happening, the data also show there is widespread confusion about the causes of the change and the degree of scientific consensus around the human impacts on the climate system. Consumers and corporations, who may lack an understanding of the important role of carbon in the climate system, are encouraged to reduce carbon emissions, purchase carbon offsets, and consider carbon labels that show the amount of embedded greenhouse gases in products and services. Utility companies promoting the use of smart meters find that many consumers do not understand how their electricity is generated or the role played by fossil fuels, which are in effect concentrated forms of buried solar energy linking energy use today to past and future climates. While aggressive media, corporate, and political forces are often regarded as the primary cause of the public's climate confusion, a review of five decades of science education relating to climate in general and climate change in particular reveals that basic climate science has not been well addressed in national and state education standards or science education curricula. Moreover, key misconceptions and misinformation about basic climate science are strongly held by students, teachers, and public audiences. We review research on these misconceptions and call upon educators and communicators to address systemic holes and pedagogical gaps with high-quality resources and professional development. The recently developed Essential Principles of Climate Literacy provides an authoritative, comprehensive framework for educators and communicators to frame climate science. However, to be effectively used as a tool for increasing broad climate literacy, effective mental models to address misconceptions will need to be integral to the high-quality resources and professional development programs required to significantly increase climate literacy throughout society.

The MOM is highly efficient as the aerosol distribution is represented by its lower-order moments and only these, not the full distribution itself, are tracked during simulation. Quadrature is introduced to close the moment equations under very general growth laws and to compute aerosol physical and optical properties directly from moments. In this paper the quadrature method of moments (QMOM) is used in a bivariate test tracking of aerosol mixing state. Two aerosol populations, one enriched in soot and the other in sulfate, are allowed to interact through coagulation to form a generally-mixed third particle population. Quadratures of varying complexity (including two candidate schemes for use in climate models) are described and compared with benchmark results obtained by using particle-resolved simulation. Low-order quadratures are found to be highly accurate, and Gauss and Gauss-Radau quadratures appear to give nested lower and upper bounds, respectively, to aerosol mixing rate. These results suggest that the QMOM makes it feasible to represent the generallymixed states of aerosols and track their evolution in climate models. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65549165197

The co-electrolysis process allows for direct electrochemical reduction of the steam - carbon dioxide gas mixture, yielding hydrogen and carbon monoxide, or syngas. The process model has been developed using the Honeywell UniSim systems analysis code. Using this code, a detailed process flow sheet has been defined that includes all the components that would be present in an actual plant such as pumps, compressors, heat exchangers, turbines, and the electrolyzer. Since the electrolyzer is not a standard UniSim component, a custom one-dimensional co-electrolysis model was developed for incorporation into the overall UniSim process flow sheet. The one dimensional co-electrolysis model assumes local chemical equilibrium among the four process-gas species via the gas shift reaction. The electrolyzer model allows for the determination of co-electrolysis outlet temperature, composition (anode and cathode sides); mean Nemst potential, operating voltage and electrolyzer power based on specified inlet gas flow rates, heat loss or gain, current density, and cell area-specific resistance. The one-dimensional electrolyzer model was validated by comparison with results obtained from a fully three dimensional computational fluid dynamics model developed using FLUENT, and by comparison to experimental data. This paper provides representative results obtained from the UniSim flow sheet model for a 300 MW co-electrolysis plant, coupled to a high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor. The coelectrolysis process, coupled to a nuclear reactor, provides a means of recycling carbon dioxide back into a useful liquid fuel. If the carbon dioxide source is based on biomass, the entire process would be climate neutral.

Given the high impact of the transport sector, this paper asks whether shipping companies are demonstrating environmental responsibility. The question has become more pertinent in the light of recent research which suggests that investors should take account of climate change or carbon risk in their portfolio selection. Indeed, the development and subsequent performance of socially responsible stock indices also provide persuasive financial arguments for the need to address the climate change issue. This research conducts a preliminary investigation of environmental awareness and reporting of the shipping industry from the investment perspective. It does this by examining information provided by leading shipping companies against criteria laid down by the FTSE4Good index on environmental reporting. It finds that relatively few companies are seriously embracing this challenge. Although many recognise the need for an environmental policy, measurement of environmental impact and target setting is rare. Much of the policy is ostensibly directed towards IMO regulation with climate change often ignored.

This estimate, generally based on the Penman-Monteith equation, could be conditioned by the availability of coefficient values from different climatic regions and the approach to LAI evolution. In this study we propose two methods to adjust the P-M equation to the water requirements of a soilless tomato crop under greenhouse conditions where crop development was estimated by means of: i) A regression in function on the days after transplanting corrected using the daily drain flow measured with a tipping-bucket flow sensor and ii) the LAI prediction in function on the inside greenhouse daily thermal time. Based on these transpiration estimates, the irrigation methods were tested and compared to current irrigation practices. All irrigation managements showed the same water use efficiency but the method i) needed fewer human intervention, during the 202 days of crop cycle, than the others irrigation methods. The use of a transpiration model, together with on-line information of changes in leaf are provide an accurate irrigation method for soilless crop production which canopy is continuously modified.","Greenhouse; LAI; Radiation; VPD; Water use efficiency","Lycopersicon esculentum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71449116746

The effort to date includes site selection, preliminary test design and implementation, and development of data objectives consistent with overall program goals. An iterative approach was implemented to enhance our understanding of the local and regional geologic conditions and limits at each stage. First steps included building a geologic model of injection and caprock formations based on regional well logs and other existing data as well as performing a 2-D surface seismic survey around the proposed well location. This information was then used to design the stratigraphic test well and data collection methodology. The test well was drilled in early 2007 and completed in January 2008. Wireline logs and rock samples collected during the drilling are being used to refine the geologic model and to develop plans for the injection tests scheduled for fall 2008. The site is one of the three locations selected for testing geologic storage of CO2 under the Midwestern Regional Carbon Sequestration Program (MRCSP) led by Battelle. Information collected to date is being analyzed to indicate the potential for carbon sequestration in regional reservoirs. In general, the reservoirs are well-contained with good caprock. Drilling, logging, and collection and laboratory testing of sidewall cores have provided the data to design injection tests in up to three potential injection targets between approximately 5,000 and 8,000 feet below ground surface. Approximately 3,000 tons of supercritical-phase CO2 is planned to be injected in these formations. Targets include a Lower Silurian sandstone known regionally as a gas-producer; Silurian sequences consisting of interbedded layers of halite, anhydrite, limestone, and porosity-preserving dolomite; and a Lower Devonian sandstone. The upcoming injection tests will help to further refine local and regional injectivity and capacity in the target reservoirs; caprock integrity, and single-well monitoring techniques. Field projects like this add to knowledge and understanding of how to select and characterize potential injection reservoirs, establish familiarity of the technology with the public and regulatory agencies, and aid in the selection of appropriate testing and monitoring techniques for each location.

In equilibrium, the atomic charge-exchange process consists of both electron ionization (stripping), and electron capture, which can proceed through Radiative Electron Capture (REC) or Non-Radiative Electron Capture (NREC). Unfortunately, a complete description of the atomic charge-exchange process is lacking. As a result, a largely phenomenological approach has been used, which has not been tested for high beam energies. In this work, ratios of equilibrium charge-state yields for singly to doubly ionized 3He ions were measured using the Grand Raiden Spectrometer at the Research Center for Nuclear Physics (RCNP).

Shell has long recognized the trilemna of providing for cheap, convenient and clean energy and has taken a proactive approach towards managing its greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprint. In this paper, we discuss how we have addressed the challenge to manage greenhouse gas emissions from Shell's Exploration and Production operations in the Asia-Pacific region to prepare for a carbon-constrained future. We also discuss some of the actions we have taken to support our corporate voluntary target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 by at least 5% below 1990 levels, even while continuing to grow the business. These actions include: End continuous gas flaring and minimize gas venting from existing operations Improve energy efficiency in the design of our assets and in our production operations Include the future cost of emitting greenhouse gases into business investment decisions Advocate the role of governments to develop a globally applicable CO2 policy framework Support opportunities for capacity-building in carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) In tandem, at the Shell Group level, we continue to invest and nurture development of alternative clean and renewable fuel options such as solar and biofuels so that they mature as viable alternatives in the fuel-mix portfolio to meet world energy needs. We conclude with a summary of our journey forward to further mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from our operations in the region while continuing to maintain our position as a responsible energy producer capable of delivering profitable, socially responsible, and sustainable growth in a carbon-constrained future.

Momentum is building within society to take greater action in response to climate change and implement specific actions to reduce absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In the United States (cities, states and the federal government) regulatory pressure is mounting and legislative activities increasing to enact GHG emission reduction legislation. In response to this global ecological and societal challenge, many organizations are quickly stepping up their activities to develop and deploy more aggressive GHG reduction strategies. An important element for institutions to successfully meet the climate change challenge will be to identify effective strategies and corresponding initiatives that lead to cost effective reductions in GHG emissions. This paper reviews an approach to identify and rank climate leader companies in one industrial group based upon their success to reduce absolute GHG emissions. Second, the paper focuses on key emission reduction strategies used by the defined ""climate leader"" companies and provides examples of the results achieved over the research period.","Climate leader companies; GHG emission reduction strategies; Global climate change; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions","Air pollution; Climate control; Climatology; Cost effectiveness; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Leakage (fluid); Reduction; Research; Societies and institutions; Technical presentations; Climate leader companies; Emission reduction strategies; Federal governments; GHG emission reduction strategies; GHG emissions; Global climate change; Green house gas emissions; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; Group based; International symposium; Legislative activities; Reduction strategies; Regulatory pressures; United States; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51849107028

In establishing these targets, City Council recognized that approximately one-third of the locally-generated GHG emissions and a significant portion of smog-causing pollutants come from the operation of motor vehicles. Consequently, the City is developing a Sustainable Transportation Implementation Strategy that will look to long-term structural changes, such as the implementation of the ""Transit City"" plan, which will create significant and lasting changes in aggregate travel behaviour. In the meantime, City Council has approved a series of short-term Sustainable Transportation Initiatives. This report provides a description of the short-term initiatives being considered, the issues and implications associated with these initiatives, and where implemented, their effectiveness and impacts. It is recognized that these short-term sustainable transportation initiatives are modest in scope and, by themselves, do not go very far in achieving the City's reduction targets for GHG emissions and smog-causing pollutants. However, collectively, they signal a new way of looking at, implementing, and operating the City's transportation system.

With actual direct injection engines which exhibit a compression ratio between 17:1 and 18:1 single or multiple early injections called ""pilot injections"" are also added in order to reduce the combustion noise. For after-treatment reasons a late injection during the expansion stroke named ""post injection"" may also be used in some operating conditions. Investigations have been conducted on lower compression ratio Diesel engine and in high EGR rate operating conditions to evaluate the benefits of multiple injection strategies to improve the trade off between engine emissions, noise and fuel economy. These experiments have highlighted that in the thermodynamic conditions specific to low CR engines and high EGR rate interesting effects on the combustion process could be achieved via multiple injections strategies involving the following phenomena: 1Fuel introduction and heat release splitting 2Control of the fuel distribution in the combustion chamber 3Cooling effect of the vaporizing fuel Decreasing the peak heat release by splitting the heat release process appears to be adequate for controlling the combustion noise. It is achieved by using several injections in the appropriate thermodynamic and auto-ignition delay conditions in order to reduce the instantaneous fuel burning rate. Thanks to this resulting noise reduction, the engine settings can be re-optimized toward a new trade off. Multiple injection strategies can also be used to better control the spatial fuel distribution to enhance the air use in the combustion chamber. Generally, this effect can lead to a reduction in particulate emissions at intermediate engine loads, allowing for potentially higher EGR rate. The cooling effect associated with fuel vaporization lowers locally and globally the temperature of the gases contained in the combustion chamber. If well-understood, these phenomena can be applied to increase the ignition delay, allowing for a longer mixing period and thus a more homogeneous fuel/air mixture, and/or to modify the rate of heat release in the early stage of combustion. Appropriate use of the cooling effect provides a valuable degree of freedom in the optimization of the noise/emission/fuel economy trade off.

Although the manufacture of materials such as PCBs has been banned in most parts of the world for some time, they are still found in significant concentrations in the environment. In view of this, it has become important to understand not only their sources, but also the mechanisms responsible for their transport in the environment. Since they are semi-volatile, it is necessary to consider their transport by atmospheric particulate matter as well as in the gas phase. We have developed a capability to simulate the atmospheric behaviour of PCBs and PCDD/Fs within the framework of the CMAQ modelling system. To describe transport on particulate matter, we have added two gas/particle partitioning models – the Junge-Pankow adsorption model and the KOA absorption model to the basic CMAQ system. We have also included gas phase chemistry of these semi-volatile organic materials as well as their atmosphere/water surface exchange processes. Using this modified model system, we have conducted simulations of the atom-spheric behaviour of these materials for the years 2000 and 2002 on a domain covering most of North America. Validation studies show that both partitioning models give reasonable results when compared with available measurements of deposition rates and air concentrations. The simulations confirm that long range transport occurs by both gas phase and heterogeneous mechanisms. This causes these toxic materials to be deposited in pristine regions far from emission sources. In cases where they have entered the water table, large water bodies such as the Great Lakes can also become net sources. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2008.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051750077

However, converting grasslands to forests could affect ecosystem-atmosphere exchanges of other greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide and methane (CH4), effects that are rarely considered. Here, we show that afforestation on a well-aerated grassland in Siberia reduces soil CH4 uptake by a factor of 3 after 35 years of tree growth. The decline in CH4 oxidation was observed both in the field and in laboratory incubation studies under controlled environmental conditions, suggesting that not only physical but also biological factors are responsible for the observed effect. Using incubation experiments with 13CH4 and tracking 13C incorporation into bacterial phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA), we found that, at low CH4 concentrations, most of the 13C was incorporated into only two PLFAs, 18:1ω7 and 16:0. High CH4 concentration increased total 13C incorporation and the number of PLFA peaks that became labeled, suggesting that the microbial assemblage oxidizing CH4 shifts with ambient CH4 concentration. Forests and grasslands exhibited similar labeling profiles for the high-affinity methanotrophs, suggesting that largely the same general groups of methanotrophs were active in both ecosystems. Both PLFA concentration and labeling patterns indicate a threefold decline in the biomass of active methanotrophs due to afforestation, but little change in the methanotroph community. Because the grassland consumed CH4 at a rate five times higher than forest soils under laboratory conditions, we concluded that not only biomass but also cell-specific activity was higher in grassland than in afforested plots. While the decline in biomass of active methanotrophs can be explained by site preparation (plowing), inorganic N (especially NH4+) could be responsible for the change in cell-specific activity. Overall, the negative effect of afforestation of upland grassland on soil CH4 uptake can be largely explained by the reduction in biomass and to a lesser extent by reduced cell-specific activity of CH4-oxidizing bacteria. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.","Afforestation; Atmospheric CH4 oxidation; Soil inorganic N cycle; Soil methanotrophs; Stable isotopes in PLFA","afforestation; biomass; carbon dioxide; land use change; methanotrophy; nitrogen cycle; oxidation; stable isotope; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52449110776

Most likely, such problems will be solved with the development of a gas transportation mode alternative to traditional pipelines: liquefied natural gas (LNG). The global LNG trade has increased rapidly during recent years. A significant amount of energy is consumed to produce low-temperature LNG, which has plenty of cryogenic exergy/energy. Therefore, the effective utilization of the cryogenic energy associated with LNG vaporization is very important. Sicily, with more than five million inhabitants, is the second biggest region of Italy and in this region will be realized two of the 11 gasification plants planned in Italy according to the regional energy master-plan. This paper shows some interesting applications for the cold produced in gasification plants, e.g. for seawater desalination and for fresh and frozen food production and conservation. These applications seem very interesting for Sicilian situation and also can contribute to energy saving and greenhouse gases reduction to match Kyoto Protocol targets.

Energy intensity can be reduced by improving efficiency in the use of energy or by moving away from energy-intensive activities. At the national level, I show that roughly three-quarters of the improvements in U.S. energy intensity since 1970 results from efficiency improvements. This should reduce concerns that the United States is off-shoring its carbon emissions. A state-level analysis shows that rising per capita income and higher energy prices have played an important part in lowering energy intensity. Price and income predominantly influence intensity through changes in energy efficiency rather than through changes in economic activity. In addition, the empirical analysis suggests that little policy intervention will be needed to achieve the Bush Administration goal of an 18 percent reduction in carbon intensity by the end of this decade.

Energy savings certificates (ESCs) - instruments assigning the property rights to energy savings or attributes of those savings - are becoming an effective tool for meeting energy savings and GHG targets. The efficacy of ESCs will depend on the market's ability to (1) verify the amount of savings that they certify along with the uncertainty of those savings (i.e., quantify their value), (2) clearly assign ownership rights to that value (i.e., state exactly who owns what) and (3) efficiently buy and sell those rights between interested parties (i.e., conduct simple transactions). The measurement and verification (M&V) system governing ESCs will critically impact whether these three criteria are satisfied. An M&V system for ESCs requires the fundamental elements of an M&V system for any regulated energy-efficiency program, but must also address more explicitly the above-mentioned criteria.

An analysis of a digital elevation model and maps derived from the model have allowed for re-assessment of some of those hypotheses and concepts. It confirms that differential tectonics explains best the morphological layout of the Sudetes, but its effects are superimposed on a variety of rock - landform relationships. Neither the model emphasizing the occurrence of tiered levels of relict planation surfaces, nor one assuming the widespread existence of distinctive landforms of tropical morphogenesis find support in the light of region-wide DEM analysis.

An upstream system at the refinery or importer level would be administratively simple but would lead to minimal reductions in transportation emissions as a result of inelastic demand for driving. In effect, emissions reductions would be ""exported"" to the electricity generation and industrial sectors. A downstream system at the household level would lead to similar changes in emissions but would raise major administrative and privacy issues. Greater changes in behavior might result from a vehicle manufacturer-based scheme, but there are complex administrative issues. Tailpipe standards appear to be achieving the same result. An offset system would provide financial incentives for a wider range of abatement measures, including those undertaken by local governments such as smart growth zoning, parking pricing, and transit improvements. Empirical experience with the Clean Development Mechanism, however, suggests that transportation offsets, particularly those reliant on travel behavior changes, face significant hurdles in proving ""additionally"" and documenting emissions savings. This paper therefore proposes a ""municipal mobility manager"" trading design, under which local governments would assume responsibility for transportation emissions. This would give them the same financial incentives to implement abatement measures as under an offset scheme but would avoid the methodological and administrative challenges. The paper also argues that any design for including transportation in a carbon trading program will be beneficial because it would avoid the tendency to overallocate allowances to other sectors and force more realism in the expected emissions reductions from transportation.",,"A carbons; Cap-and-trade programs; Carbon trading; Clean development mechanisms; Electricity generations; Emissions reductions; Financial incentives; Household levels; Industrial sectors; Local governments; Privacy issues; Smart growths; Transportation sectors; Travel behaviors; Up-stream systems; Vehicle manufacturers; Commerce; Electric generators; Emission control; Land use; Managers; Industrial emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61349151704

The plant is owned and operated by Dakota Gasification Company (DGC), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Basin Electric Power Cooperative (BEPC), based in Bismarck, North Dakota. The concept for the Synfuels Plant began in the 1970's and grew from a desire to alleviate the United States dependence on foreign oil. Today upwards of 150 million standard cubic feet per day of SNG are produced and exported to consumers throughout the Midwest via the Northern Border Pipeline. Numerous by-products and co-products, including anhydrous ammonia, ammonium sulfate fertilizer, phenol, cresylic acid, krypton/xenon, naphtha and carbon dioxide (Co2) enhance the viability of the facility. The Great Plains Synfuels Plant has operated 14 Lurgi Mark IV gasifiers for over twenty years. On April 24, 1984 the gasification plant began producing an intermediate raw gas. Subsequently, the first synthetic natural gas entered the nation's interstate pipeline network on July 28, 1984. While the facility had its challenges, it is a technical success story. Under current energy markets, it is an economic success as well. The idea for selling Co2 from the gasification plant arose well before the project was being built in the early 1980's. This became a reality in October of 2000 when Dakota Gasification Company began exporting up to 95 million standard cubic feet per day high pressure CO2 from the Synfuels Plant. Today the plant has two Canadian customers and exports approximately 150 million standard cubic feet of CO2 per day. This paper discusses the original project and the expansion.

The NPS is a large region of enhanced soft X-ray and radio emission projected above the plane of the Galaxy, likely produced by a series of supernovae and stellar winds from the nearby Sco-Cen OB association. The exceptional sensitivity and spectral resolution of the XIS below 1 keV allow unprecedented probing of low-energy spectral lines, including C VI (0.37 keV) and N VII (0.50 keV), and we have detected highly-ionized nitrogen toward the NPS for the first time. For this single pointing toward the brightest 3/4 keV emission (l = 26.°8, b = +22.°0), the best-fit NPS emission model implies a hot (kT ≈ 0.3 keV), collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) plasma with depleted C, O, Ne, Mg, and Fe abundances of less than 0.5 solar, but an enhanced N abundance, with N/O = (4.0-0.5+0.4)times solar. The temperature and total thermal energy of the gas suggest heating by one or more supernovae, while the enhanced nitrogen abundance is best explained by enrichment from stellar material that has been processed by the CNO cycle. Due to the time required to develop AGB stars, we conclude that this N/O enhancement cannot be caused by the Sco-Cen OB association, but may result from a previous enrichment episode in the solar neighborhood. © 2008.

In this paper I will present an update of this work, which is also due to be published by the WMO. When Chandler's work was completed, the field of urban climatology was still in its scientific infancy. His work focuses mainly on the characteristic features of the urban atmosphere (which were still being discovered) and emphasizes changes in temperature, humidity, etc. that are caused by urban development. For example, there is little in the observational section on the energy budget of urban environments, something that has changed significantly in the last 30 years. Since its publication our understanding of urban climates has improved considerably and this provides an opportunity to re-evaluate the relevance of urban climatology to urban design. In addition, there is now a substantial body of case-study materials and a growing area of guidelines for climate-based planning, which did not exist when Chandler produced his survey. The new publication will: focus on human health and comfort; emphasize the populated areas of the world; provide links between urban planning & design and buildingscale decision making; demonstrate useful tools; provide guidelines where available and; provide case-studies of climate-based planning & design.

Ocean storage of the captured CO2 from fossil-fuel burning is a possible option for mitigating the increase of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. That is, CO2 would be separated from exhaust gas and collected at the large sources, and injected into the subterranean reservoirs or into the deep ocean to be isolated from the atmosphere for a sufficiently long time period. The moving-ship type of CO2 ocean storage is a concept whereby captured and liquefied CO2 is delivered by ship to a site and injected into the ocean depths by means of a pipe suspended beneath a ship as it slowly moves through the water. The released CO2 will form plenty of droplets, and then they will rise gently due to the buoyancy, while reducing in the size to disappear by dissolution into the ambient seawater. Such vertical journey of CO2 droplets as well as the horizontal movement of release point could distribute CO2 to the planned region all over and control the initial pH changes. In case of bad weather conditions, CO 2 marine transport and operation on the sea should be adjourned although CO2 would be captured at the plant every day. It is, therefore, required that the system would have the buffer storage at the port and the extra shipping ability to recover the delay of schedule. Since the large scale of such spare capability might lead to the increase in cost, it is needed to investigate how to plan the system allowed for weather conditions reasonably. In the previous studies of cost estimation for CO2 marine transport and ocean storage, the rate of operation in total system was assumed as a constant value, and the necessary capacity of storage at the port was assumed as some specified days' amount of captured CO2 at the plant. In this study, the time series model of sea state through one year is generated for the hypothetical ocean storage site off Japan, based on the wind data observed with satellite remote sensing, and then the simulations of CO 2 marine transport and operation on the sea are carried out considering the operational limit of sea state day by day. In this approach, the continuing bad weather days or the frequent occurrences of rough sea condition during the specific season are counted. In order to pursue higher efficiency of the operation on the sea, three kinds of system are applied for the simulations as; 1) CO2 carrier and release ship are used separately and moored in parallel for CO2 shift at the storage site, 2) CO2 carrier and release ship are used separately and moored tandem for CO 2 shift, 3) ship is used as both a CO2 carrier and release ship. The third one would not need mooring and CO2 shift operations on the sea which are sensitive to the sea state, but would need long- and every-time operation of pipe handling. Finally, the results are assessed as the capital and running cost per CO2-tonne to be treated. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Global climate changes; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51449113189

On August 11, 2007, the twin structures, 4 lanes and weighing 650 tonnes each, were removed by self propelled modular transporters and replaced with two new structures that were constructed in a nearby staging area. The removal and replacement of the bridges required a complete closure of Highway 417 (Ottawa Queensway). The ultimate context sensitive design converted the bridges to semi-integral abutments, used adjustable bridge bearings and increased worker safety by allowing construction to be performed in a safe environment without exposure to traffic. The design included a full risk assessment and required a coordinated team effort. Experts from the ministry, City of Ottawa, the contractor and representatives of the heavy lift technology and transporters worked together to ensure project success with minimal impact on the environment. What normally would have required two full construction seasons with traditional staging, traffic shifts and delays was completed overnight saving an estimated $2.4M, significantly reducing the length of traffic delays, societal costs and resulting environmental impacts. Although this project did not specifically track vehicle emission levels, theoretical estimates indicate that utilizing rapid bridge replacement technology can reduce hydrocarbon, CO and NO emissions compared to a conventional construction approach. Since the successful completion of the Island Park Bridge replacement, the ministry has awarded the next pair of twin structure removal and replacements at Clyde Avenue and will continue with the removal and replacement of three more twin bridges on Highway 417.",,"Environmental impact; Highway bridges; Risk assessment; Sustainable development; Transportation; Bridge replacement; Construction season; Context sensitive design; Conventional constructions; Coordinated teams; Impact on the environment; Project success; Semiintegral abutments; Bridges",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896639527

Molecules are represented by particles interacting with Lennard-Jones forces plus the thermally averaged quadrupole-quadrupole interaction. The properties discussed include the vapor-liquid coexistence curve, the vapor pressure along coexistence, and the surface tension. The full isotherms are also accessible over a wide range of temperatures and densities. It is shown that the critical parameters (critical temperature, density, and pressure) depend almost linearly on a quadrupolar parameter q= Q*4 T*, where Q* is the reduced quadrupole moment of the molecule and T* the reduced temperature. The model can be applied to a variety of small quadrupolar molecules. We focus on carbon dioxide as a test case, but consider nitrogen and benzene, too. Experimental critical temperature, density, and quadrupolar moment are sufficient to fix the parameters of the model. The resulting agreement with experiments is excellent and marks a significant improvement over approaches which neglect quadrupolar effects. The same coarse-grained model was also applied in the framework of perturbation theory in the mean spherical approximation. As expected, the latter deviates from the Monte Carlo results in the critical region, but is reasonably accurate at lower temperatures. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",,"Mathematical models; Molecular interactions; Perturbation techniques; Thermal effects; Thermodynamic properties; Coarse-grained models; Quadrupolar fluids; Quadrupole-quadrupole interaction; Vapor-liquid coexistence curves; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40849097793

The Plant Dynamics Code developed at Argonne National Laboratory for systems level transient analysis of the S-CO2 Brayton cycle has been improved to specifically address the effects of property variations near the critical point on component design and performance as well as the controllability and stability of the entire cycle. The Plant Dynamics Code has been used to develop an automatic control strategy for the S-CO2 Brayton cycle with emphasis on operation with the minimum temperature close to the critical point but with sufficient margin to prevent the minimum temperature from dropping below the critical value. Controllability of the cycle is analytically demonstrated for analyzed operational transients. Potential accident conditions which are relevant to cycle operation near the critical point are explored.",,"Accident conditions; Argonne National Laboratory; Automatic control; Component design; Critical points; Critical temperatures; Critical value; Cycle operation; Efficiency gain; Operational transients; Plant dynamics; Supercritical carbon dioxides; Systems levels; Automation; Brayton cycle; Carbon dioxide; Control; Controllability; Equations of state; Nuclear energy; Nuclear industry; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactor accidents; Transient analysis; Supercritical fluid extraction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349972713

To economically respond to the global environmental problems ahead, progress must be made both on more sustainable technologies and on the design methodology, which needs to adopt a more holistic approach. Heat pumps and, in particular systems integrating heat pumps and cogeneration units, offer a significant potential for greenhouse gas reduction. This paper illustrates the application of a multi-objective and multi-modal evolutionary algorithm to facilitate the design and planning of a district heating network based on a combination of centralized and decentralized heat pumps combined with onsite cogeneration. Comparisons are made with an earlier study based on a single objective environomic optimisation of the same overall model. The advantage of the two objective approach is illustrated with the concurrent minimisation of CO2 emissions and heating cost for the given yearly requirement of part of a city. For the given 62.7 kW thermal rated plant meeting the needs of a set of new buildings with predominantly low temperature heating systems, Pareto curves illustrate the tradeoffs as well as the optimum supply temperature trends. The evolution of the optimum configuration of the central cogeneration and heat pump plant as a function of the CO2 emissions is also shown.","District heating; Heat pump; Multi-objective optimisation","Carbon dioxide; Cogeneration plants; Costs; Design; District heating; Environmental design; Environmental technology; Greenhouse gases; Heat pump systems; Heating; Heating equipment; Investments; Multiobjective optimization; Operating costs; Pumps; Temperature; Zoning; District heating networks; Global environmental problems; Greenhouse gas reductions; Heat pumps; Low temperature heating; Objective approaches; Optimum configurations; Sustainable technology; Environmental impact",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924311101

The object of this optimization process is to minimize fuel consumption while fulfilling exhaust emissions regulations. In order to address this problem, black box models based on classical Design of Experiments (DoE) arc frequently used. This steady state approach is time consuming in bench tests, particularly when dealing with a large number of control parameters acting upon DoE dimensions. This paper reviews this dilemma in an effort to provide a description of the global process for engine emissions modeling at PSA Peugeot Citroen. We present here a local dynamic modeling approach that is based on dynamic Design of Experiments. We, then, used measured data to identify nonlinear models. Variable selection methods arc considered in order to enhance the generalization performance of our models. Next; we propose a mixture of the local models to generate a global model that applies in a large area of the (torque, rpm) plane. The mixture method is based on Support Vector Machines. Lastly, we conclude this paper with a brief perspective concerning the use of our global model to optimize consumption while complying with exhaust emissions regulation.","Design of experiments; Dynamic modeling; LARS; Mutual information; Pollutants emissions; Variable selection; Volterra series","LARS; Mutual informations; Pollutants emissions; Variable selection; Volterra Series; Dynamic models; Optimization; Design of experiments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866137429

Storm surge is addressed principally by federal flood-insurance maps, now available over the Internet but severely encumbered by a 1970s strategy requiring a huge number of large-scale paper map sheets. In addition, some states and localities address storm surge with storm evacuation maps, typically at a smaller scale that makes Web distribution more straightforward. Dynamic graphics, though not common, provide dramatic illustrations of plausible local impacts of coastal flooding. By contrast, coverage of sea level rise is not only biased toward scientists and policy makers interested in climate change or wetlands preservation but also marked by a heavy reliance on related text and graphics to communicate uncertainty and impact. Important maps embedded in PDF files are not easily located by search engines in image-mode, and a set of spatially detailed but politically sensitive maps made available online to confidential reviewers has not been released to the public.

One of the main issues on group hole nozzle is the arrangement of orifices with various distances and angles. In this study, the ignition and combustion characteristics of wall-impinging diesel sprays from group-hole nozzles were investigated with various angles between two micro-orifices (included angles). A laser absorption scattering (LAS) technique for non-axisymmetric sprays, developed based on a LAS technique for axisymmetric spray, was applied to investigate the liquid/vapor mass distribution of wall-impinging sprays. The direct flame images and OH radical images inside a high pressure constant volume vessel were captured to analyze the effect of included angle on spray ignition and combustion characteristics. The group hole nozzles showed improved fuel evaporation and increased spray tip penetration compared to the conventional single hole nozzle. In group hole nozzles, the longer spray penetration after impingement was observed at parallel direction compared to the vertical direction and the same trend was observed in the flame geometry. The spray penetration in parallel direction was increased at high included angles while there was not so much change in vertical direction. The vapor mass concentration in both view directions was enhanced when the included angle was increased due to the reduced droplet collision region. Owing to the enhanced fuel evaporation, the ignition delay of wall-impinging sprays was shortened and the intensity of OH chemiluminescence increased at high included angles. The shorter flame length and longer flame height were observed at high included angles since the ignition occurs before the spray-wall interaction is fully developed. © 2008 SAE International.",,"Diesel engines; Direct injection; Evaporation; Free radicals; Fuels; High pressure effects; Ignition; Orifices; Powertrains; Combustion characteristics; Constant-volume vessel; Direct injection diesel engines; Droplet collision; Mass distribution; OH chemiluminescence; Spray tip penetration; Vertical direction; Spray nozzles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072476449

Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power plants offer an alternative to pulverized coal plants because the carbon dioxide may be separated from the process gas stream prior to combustion. The compression of the captured carbon dioxide stream requires a sizeable amount of power, which impacts plant availability, capital expenditures and operational cost. Preliminary analysis has estimated that the CO2 compression process reduces the plant efficiency by 8% to 12% for a typical IGCC plant. The detailed thermodynamic analysis presented here examines methods to minimize the power penalty to the producer through integrated, low-power compression concepts. The goal of the present research is to reduce this penalty through novel compression concepts and integration with existing IGCC processes. The research supports the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) objectives of reducing the energy requirements for carbon capture and sequestration in electrical power production. The primary objective of this study is to boost the pressure of CO2 to pipeline pressures with the minimal amount of energy required.

Most of biomass resources in a focused region e.g. wood biomass, livestock biomass, and crop residues are considered in the model. Conversion technologies considered are energy utilization technologies e.g. direct combustion and methane fermentation, and material utilization technologies e.g. composting and carbonization. Case study in Miyakojima, Okinawa prefecture, has been carried out for several objective functions and constraint conditions. Considering economics of the utilization system as a priority requirement, composting and combustion heat utilization are mainly chosen in the optimal system configuration. However gasification power plant and methane fermentation are included in optimal solutions, only when both biomass energy utilization and CO2 reduction have been set as higher priorities. External benefit of CO2 reduction has large impacts on the system configuration. Provided marginal external benefit of more than 50,000 JPY/t-C, external benefit becomes greater than the revenue from electricity and compost etc. Considering technological learning in the future, expensive technologies such as gasification power plant and methane fermentation will have economic feasibility as well as market competitiveness. © 2008 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.","Biomass; CO2 reduction; Economic feasibility; External benefit; Rural area; Technological learning","Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Carbonization; Combustion; Competition; Composting; Economics; Energy utilization; Fermentation; Gas generators; Gasification; Methane; Optimal systems; Optimization; Rural areas; Technology; Account balance; Bio-mass energy; Biomass resources; Biomass utilization; Combustion heat; Constraint conditions; Conversion technology; Crop residue; Direct combustion; Economic feasibilities; Energy utilization technologies; External benefit; External benefits; Material utilization; Methane fermentation; Objective functions; Optimal design; Optimal solutions; Optimal system configuration; Optimization models; System configurations; Technological learning; Utilization systems; Wood biomass; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72149116696

However, quality of diesel fuel, particularly the sulfur content, varies significantly in other parts of the world. Due to logistical issues in various theaters of operation, the Army is often forced to rely on local fuel supplies, which exposes vehicles to diesel fuel or jet fuel (JP-8) with elevated levels of sulfur. Modern engines typically use cooled Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) to meet emissions regulations. Using high-sulfur fuels and cooled EGR elevates problems associated with cooler fouling and corrosion of engine components. Hence, an experimental study has been carried out in a heavy-duty diesel engine running on standard JP-8 fuel and fuel doped with 2870 ppm of sulfur. Gas was sampled from the EGR cooler and analyzed using a condensate collection device developed according to a modified ASTM 3226-73T standard. Engine-out emissions were analyzed in parallel. Analysis of results indicates significantly increased levels of sulfur-dioxide and particulate mass with high-sulfur fuel, but negligible amounts of condensed sulfuric acid under normal operating temperatures.

Over the past 100 years the average global temperature has risen by around 0.75°C and the sea level increases by 3 millimetres a year. There is a consensus on the impact of this climate change phenomena on the planning and operation of the electric power systems: winds are growing in strength, resulting in a greater frequency of operations interruption (falling trees, avalanches, etc.). Furthermore, due to the increasing incidence of heavy precipitation, lines and substations are often flooded, damaged or destroyed. Repairing the resultant damage is often very time-consuming. And also the temperature of permafrost layers is rising. As a result the bedrock is becoming loose. This in turn increases the risk of landslides, which also damage and destroy lines and substations. There are many cases of extreme weather which have caused enormous damage to electric power systems, e.g. the ice storm in Canada (1998) or the hurricane ""Lothar"" in Western Europe (1999). Considering the climate change at the planning of electric power systems is therefore highly relevant. In order to plan the power system we need to evaluate the risk of outages due to extreme weather. The vulnerability is assessed, based on historic meteorological data. It results in geographic and seasonal exposure maps. E.g. in Switzerland, alpine regions are more prone to extreme conditions which can vary from one valley to the other. In this paper, the planning methodology uses scenarios to assess the uncertainty related to the vulnerability of the power system under extreme weather conditions. These scenarios are based on weather-related contingencies and reference cases of the Swiss transmission system. The climate change has also to be considered at the operation of electric power systems. At the control centres new operating tools have to be introduced which take into account the impact of the climate change, e.g. an early warning weather system, or a Geographic Information System (GIS) which pinpoints (together with information of protection systems), the location of a damaged line so that the repair staff can be on the spot very quickly, thereby minimising downtime. Furthermore the dispatchers must be trained on how to manage their electric power system during extreme weather conditions. Finally experienced crisis organisations must be established.","Climate change; Operation of electric power systems; Planning of electric power systems","Extreme weather conditions; Extreme weather events; Frequency of operation; Global temperatures; Heavy precipitation; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Planning methodology; Transmission systems; Electric power system protection; Geographic information systems; Repair; Sea level; Storms; Uncertainty analysis; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876753006

The Humane Society International sought to require Australia to enforce domestic legislation imposing a whale sanctuary in waters off Antarctica to which Australia has a claim. Although the prospect of claimant states exercising jurisdiction over non nationals in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean might be superficially attractive, the potential consequences for the Antarctic Treaty System are severe. New Zealand's approach to legislating in respect of maritime zones in Antarctica is more restrained than Australia, and is to be preferred for its deference to the Antarctic Treaty System.

The annual mean N2O fluxes ranged from 2.95 to 164.17 μgN/(m2·h), with the lowest observed in a grassland and the highest in an onion field. The instantaneous N2O fluxes showed a large temporal variation with peak emissions generally occurring following fertilization and heavy rainfall events around harvesting in autumn. No clear common factor regulating instantaneous N2O fluxes was found at any of the study sites. Instead, instantaneous N2O fluxes at different sites were affected by different soil variables.

The thermal energy consumptions of ventilation systems operating for CO2 exposure concentrations between 800 ppmv and 1200 ppmv for typical office buildings and the corresponding formaldehyde exposure risks were evaluated. The results showed that, for a reference indoor environment at a CO2 exposure concentration of 1000 ppmv, the average thermal energy saving of ventilation system for a unit increment of the acceptable formaldehyde exposure limit of 1 h (loss of life expectancy of 0.0417 day) was 280 MJ m-2 yr-1; and for a unit decrement of the exposure limit of 1 h, an additional average thermal energy consumption of 480 MJ m-2 yr-1 was expected.

The calculation is driven by meteorological fields - air temperature, cloud cover, downward solar irradiance, windspeed, volumetric soil moisture in 4 soil layers - provided by analyses of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The estimated annual global isoprene emission ranges between 374Tg (in 1996) and 449Tg (in 1998 and 2005), for an average of ca. 410Tg/year over the whole period, i.e. about 30% less than the standard MEGAN estimate (Guenther et al., 2006). This difference is due, to a large extent, to the impact of the soil moisture stress factor, which is found here to decrease the global emissions by more than 20%. In qualitative agreement with past studies, high annual emissions are found to be generally associated with El Niño events. The emission inventory is evaluated against flux measurement campaigns at Harvard forest (Massachussets) and Tapajós in Amazonia, showing that the model can capture quite well the short-term variability of emissions, but that it fails to reproduce the observed seasonal variation at the tropical rainforest site, with largely overestimated wet season fluxes. The comparison of the HCHO vertical columns calculated by a chemistry and transport model (CTM) with HCHO distributions retrieved from space provides useful insights on tropical isoprene emissions. For example, the relatively low emissions calculated over Western Amazonia (compared to the corresponding estimates in the inventory of Guenther et al., 1995) are validated by the excellent agreement found between the CTM and HCHO data over this region. The parameterized impact of the soil moisture stress on isoprene emissions is found to reduce the model/data bias over Australia, but it leads to underestimated emissions near the end of the dry season over subtropical Africa.",,"air temperature; canopy; cloud cover; emission inventory; environmental modeling; estimation method; flux measurement; isoprene; rainforest; soil moisture; Amazonia; Brazil; Harvard Forest; Massachusetts; North America; Para [Brazil]; Santarem [Para]; South America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40449096912

The LPCOR utilizes the fundamental design features of the 'four bed molecular sieve' (4BMS) CO2 removal technology of the International Space Station (ISS). LPCOR improves power efficiency by replacing the desiccant beds of the 4BMS with a membrane dryer and a state-of-the-art, structured adsorbent device that collectively require 25% of the thermal energy required by the 4BMS desiccant beds for regeneration. Compared to the 4BMS technology, it has the added functionality to deliver pure, compressed CO2 for oxygen recovery. The CO2 removal and recovery functions are performed in a two-stage adsorption compressor. CO2 is removed from the cabin air and partially compressed in the first stage. The second stage performs further compression and delivers the compressed CO2 to a reduction unit such as a Sabatier reactor for oxygen recovery. This paper describes the development status of the LPCOR system, including the breadboard experiments to determine the performance parameters of the full-scale LPCOR drying components for an optimized process. Development and validation of the laboratory test platform for LPCOR, the cabin air simulator (CAS), to generate air at simulated temperature, humidity, and ventilation rates of a space cabin is also discussed.

Wind-induced upwelling predominates in late spring and summer, coinciding with the maximum in solar radiation, leading to increased accumulations of phytoplankton biomass. Chlorophyll concentrations varied from 2 to 10 mg/m3 and were generally lower in January-April and maximal in May-September. Chlorophyll concentrations along the coast followed a similar seasonal pattern (ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/m3); however, concentrations were always greater on the Trivendrum and Cochin coast compared to the Calicut and Mangalore coast. The southwest coast is often cloud covered; data density maps provide an index of confidence in the 'regional' applicability of the summary statistics. One consequence of the 1997-1998 El Nino appears to be a reduction in chlorophyll concentration off Trivendrum and Cochin in 1998. An increased frequency of El Nino events may lead to a reduction in offshore carbon in this dynamic upwelling region.

The two-dimensional cylindrical coordinate system has been employed and assumes axial symmetry, and numerical domain is bounded by a solid wall. A chemical reaction scheme for a methane-air mixture consists of 34 species and 164 reactions. The thermodynamics and transport properties have been evaluated by a theoretical model in detail. In order to capture the blast wave behavior, a TVD scheme is employed in all equations. Fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme is used to integrate a set of conservation equations in time. In the early stage, the behavior of the hot gas is dominated by a flow which is induced by the blast wave with an application of high ignition energy. Although a high temperature gas, which spurts out from the electrode gap, quenches, the gas at the electrode gap is self-sustained with an application of low ignition energy. After a certain period of time, the flame kernel gradually grows out of the electrode gap. The induction time of the flame kernel initiation increases with decrease in ignition energy. In the process of the flame kernel development, the local equivalence ratio at the electrode gap is larger than that in the outer region with an application of low ignition energy. Diffusion of methane into the hot gas region is recognized.

The 3D area of investigation is settled in Sava depression along the southern margin of the Pannonian basin (Figure 1). This is the area of small but numerous oil and gas fields. Due its position the structural features are mainly due to regional tectonic. The reservoir rocks are mostly Miocene sandstones but some hydrocarbons occur on the uplifted edges and weathered top of the Paleozoic basement. Reservoir rocks in the Lower Miocene (Ottnangian stage) are coarse grained clastics (conglomeratic sandstones and conglomerates). The most frequent reservoirs in the Upper Miocene (Pannonian stage) are coarse-grained clastics (conglomeratic sandstones and conglomerates). The fields were discovered 30 years ago and although a long period of time has elapsed since discovery, because od their geological complexity the area is still the subject of detailed geological studies. According to seismic structural interpretation, palinspastic, thickness maps construction, and well data incorporation new insight into the Sava Depression is given.",,"Engineering exhibitions; Gas industry; Hydrocarbons; Oil fields; Petroleum engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Rocks; Sandstone; Solar radiation; Structural geology; Tectonics; Three dimensional; Clastics; Coarse-grained; Geological complexity; Hydrocarbon traps; Middle Miocene; Miocene; Oil and gas fields; Paleozoic; Pannonian basin; Regional tectonics; Reservoir rock; Structural feature; Structural interpretation; Thickness map; Upper Miocene; Well data; Petroleum reservoir evaluation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71049147483

In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) the dissipation of kinetic energy during braking can be recovered advantageously by controlling power electronics. The recovered energy can be retuned to the battery for future use. An HEV combines an Electric Vehicle power-train system with conventional power-train components, such as an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE). Combining an auxiliary powerplant, such as an ICE/Generator combination, with an Electric Vehicle power-train, not only the vehicle performance and fuel economy of an HEV can be extended but also the emission is reduced in comparison with a conventional ICE power-train. Most of the HEVs employ both a conventional braking system and a regenerative one. The conventional braking system typically includes frictional drum or disc braking assemblies selectively actuated by a hydraulic or pneumatic system. Auxiliary brake systems such as hydraulic retarders can provide significant brake retardation levels that take some load off the service brake system. Through the hybridization of a conventional city bus the gearbox and its hydraulic retarder may completely be removed. Therefore, the retarder should be replaced in such a way that no extra load is exerted on the service brake in hybrid bus comparing with the conventional one. In this paper, the retarder braking performance of one of the Iran-Khodro city buses, 0457, is compared with the regenerative braking performance of the developing series hybrid electric bus in Vehicle, Fuel, and Environment Researeh Institute of University of Tehran, employing AVL/CRUISE vehicle simulation.","City bus; Hybrid electric vehicle; Mechanical brake; Regenerative Braking; Retarder","Brake systems; Braking system; City bus; Electric bus; Electrical energy; Hybrid bus; Hydraulic retarder; In-vehicle; Mechanical brakes; Pneumatic system; Power-train systems; Powertrain components; Recovered energy; Retarder; Service brakes; University of Tehran; Vehicle simulation; Brakes; Braking performance; Buses; Electric vehicles; Fuel economy; Internal combustion engines; Kinetic energy; Power electronics; Regenerative braking; Secondary batteries; Hybrid vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866077891

Environmental impacts of CEA can be aggressively reduced through carbon neutral energy supply, water recapture and recycling, and siting on pre-existing or underutilized structures. As a pilot study, a 120 m2 greenhouse was constructed on the steel deck of a 460 m2 barge moored in central Manhattan in New York City. All power demands are met on site by a 2.4 kW solar array, a 2 kW wind turbine array, and a 5 kW generator running on biofuels. All water needs are met on site by rooftop rainwater catchment and by desalination of river water. Greenhouse operations are maintained for 8 months per year, with supplemental heating available from a biofuel furnace. Data were collected from a 24 m2 cucumber plot within the greenhouse during summer months. Cucumber yields averaged 1.3 kg m-2 per week, with consumption of electricity and water averaging 1.4 kWh m-2 and 22.9 L m-2 per week, respectively. A ratio of approximately 3:1 between greenhouse floor area and solar panel area (or 40 peak watts per m2 of greenhouse) would allow 100% solar operation, and a ratio of approximately 1:1 between greenhouse floor area and rainwater catchment area is sufficient to meet all irrigation demands. These ratios suggest design parameters for rooftop applications in urban settings, where substantial unused area could be utilized for food production. Potential benefits include an environmentally sustainable food supply, increased urban green space, greater control of rooftop thermal fluxes in supporting buildings, and educational opportunities. Future research should address costs, suitability in different climates, and constraints on building integration.","Rain water catchment; Recirculating hydroponics; Renewable energy; Sustainability; Urban agriculture","Cucumis sativus",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71449117442

It is an exciting, well-written account that sheds light on how people have survived changes in climate, plant life, animals, and human events over the past 14,000 years.-Choice MagazineA vivid account of the prehistory and history of Denver as revealed in its archaeological record, Denver: An Archaeological History invites us to imagine Denver as it once was. Around 12,000 B.C., groups of leather-clad Paleoindians passed through the juncture of the South Platte River and Cherry Creek, following the herds of mammoth or buffalo they hunted. In the Archaic period, people rested under the shade of trees along the riverbanks, with baskets full of plums as they waited for rabbits to be caught in their nearby snares. In the early Ceramic period, a group of mourners adorned with yellow pigment on their faces and beads of eagle bone followed Cherry Creek to the South Platte to attend a funeral at a neighboring village. And in 1858, the area was populated by the crude cottonwood log shacks with dirt floors and glassless windows, the homes of Denver's first inhabitants. For at least 10,000 years, Greater Denver has been a collection of diverse lifeways and survival strategies, a crossroads of interaction, and a locus of cultural coexistence. Setting the scene with detailed descriptions of the natural environment, summaries of prehistoric sites, and archaeologists' knowledge of Denver's early inhabitants, Nelson and her colleagues bring the region's history to life. From prehistory to the present, this is a compelling narrative of Denver's cultural heritage that will fascinate lay readers, amateur archaeologists, professional archaeologists, and academic historians alike. © 2008 by The University Press of Colorado All rights reserved.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898392983

Subjacent to the carbonate rocks, emerald mineralization has been recognized recently in the Neoproterozoic Red Pine Shale. Two types of fibrous calcites are recognized on the basis of appearance and geochemical characteristics. Fibrous orange calcite is translucent, similar to ""Mexican calcite"" commonly sold at gem-and-mineral shows, and is being mined and used in carvings and for other decorative purposes. Recently recognized fibrous brown calcite is also present in the same general vicinity. Calcite veins hosted with Mississippian carbonate rocks are located a few kilometers south of the South Flank fault zone (SFFZ) in the vicinity of a swarm of north-trending faults. Parts of the Red Pine Shale along the SFFZ contain abundant secondary pyrite. Altered shale also contains quartz and calcite veins as well as albitized feldspar in some arkosic units and is variably enriched in Cu and Zn. At least three emeralds have been discovered in altered Red Pine Shale. δ18 OVSMOW values of calcite (-10 to -13‰) would be in equilibrium with basin brines (assumed to be -3 to +5‰), suggesting precipitation in the range of 100°-300° C. Our work suggests that sulfate-bearing basinal brines from the Uinta Basin may have migrated upward along the SFFZ and interacted with the carbon-rich shale. As sulfate was reduced by organic carbon to form sulfides, emerald was produced and a CO2-rich fluid migrated upward and dissolved parts of the Mississippian carbonates. The fluid experienced intermittent loss of CO2 gas, which allowed fibrous calcite with cone-in-cone textures to precipitate rapidly. This model and geologic setting have broad similarities to both Mississippi Valley and Colombian emerald deposits. The genesis of fibrous brown calcite, however, is less certain. These calcites lack critical geochemical characteristics that tie orange calcite to precipitation from hot brines; rather stable isotope data are permissive of origin from low-temperature ground water.","Emerald; Fibrous calcite; Karst; Stable isotopes; Uinta mountains; Utah","calcite; carbon dioxide; carbonate rock; emerald; fault zone; geochemistry; karst; mineralization; organic carbon; petrogenesis; quartz; shale; stable isotope; North America; Rocky Mountains; Uinta Mountains; United States; Utah; Pinus resinosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46249102351

Increasing demand response has also been discussed as a way to reduce carbon emissions in the U.S. electricity industry. We examine the short-run effectiveness of a policy combining demand response with a carbon tax. Using plant-level operational data, we construct short-run cost curves for three U.S. regional electric systems, and examine the impacts on prices and carbon emissions. In the short run, a carbon tax in the range of $30 - $40 and a price elasticity of demand in the range of -0.1 to -0.2 could reduce carbon emissions in coal-intensive regions by 10% to 25%. With this same set of carbon prices, achieving a 50% reduction in emissions would require a price elasticity of demand in the range of -0.25 to -0.4. Percentage reductions of this magnitude in less carbon-intensive systems are unlikely, even with highly elastic demand and high carbon prices. © 2008 IEEE.","Carbon tax; Climate change; Demand response","Carbon emissions; Carbon tax; Climate change; Demand response; Air pollution; Alternative fuels; Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Carbonization; Coal; Computer networks; Elasticity; Electric generators; Electric industry; Electricity; Forestry; Global warming; Hydroelectric power; Oxides; Reduction; Carbon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51449112456

A survey is made of candidate designs and, for the most promising, the likely efficiency of energy conversion and methods of installing them are considered.

The key factors to reduce these emissions include the spray characteristics, mixture formation, ignition, and injection control. In order to understand cold start combustion in a cylinder, the air-to-fuel ratio (A/F) near the spark plug was measured using a micro Cassegrain system (MCS). The local A/F and flame propagation speed were detected under the cold start conditions. This optical system consisted of a micro Cassegrain sensor (MC sensor), a spectroscopic unit with optical filters, photo-multipliers, and associated software. The A/F was determined from the intensity ratio of the radicals measured using their flame chemiluminescence. A practical engine and an M14 spark plug MC sensor were used for the measurements. The A/F and the THC concentration at the exhaust pipe were also measured by a conventional oxygen sensor and a flame ionization detector (FID). The A/F near the spark plug was compared to the A/F and THC concentration at the exhaust pipe. The A/F cyclic variation, which can barely be measured by an O2 sensor, could be measured by the MCS just after starting the engine. The A/F near the spark plug was around 10 immediately after starting the engine, which is considered rich. It became leaner and converged after 50 cycles. The initial flame propagation became slower as the A/F near the spark plug became richer because the ignition delay and initial flame propagation were slower. The THC concentration was higher when the A/F was rich just after starting the engine. The MCS could evaluate the mixture formation of different injectors under cold start conditions and is therefore useful for achieving a reduction in the THC emissions.

Regional climate model scenarios developed by dynamically downscaling outputs from the GISS GCM are used by CMAQ to simulate present air pollution climatology, and modeled surface ozone mixing ratios are compared with recent observations. Though the model accurately simulates ozone in the northeast U.S. and in central California, a positive bias of 10-15 ppb exists throughout most of the central and southeast U.S. The model is also applied to a simulated 2050 climate based on the IPCC AlB greenhouse gas scenario. Two future simulations are conducted, one with anthropogenic emissions held at 2001 levels, and one with anthropogenic emissions reduced in accordance with the AlB scenario. Without ozone precursor emissions changes, increases from 2-5 ppb in summer mean 8-h ozone mixing ratios are projected in Texas and parts of the eastern U.S., while high ozone episodes become more frequent. Increases of 2-8 ppb during the autumn are predicted over a large area in the central and southwest U.S., suggesting a lengthening of the ozone season. These increases within the regional modeling domain are predicted despite large decreases in the future global background ozone mixing ratio. Substantial decreases exceeding 15 ppb during the summer are predicted for the future reduced emissions case.

It compares quantity-oriented control mechanisms like the Kyoto Protocol with price-type control mechanisms such as internationally harmonized carbon taxes. The pros and cons of the two approaches are compared, focusing on such issues as performance under conditions of uncertainty, the volatility of induced carbon prices, the excess burden of taxation and regulation, accounting finagling, corruption, and implementation. Although virtually all policies involving economic global public goods rely on quantitative approaches, price-type approaches are likely to be more effective and more efficient. After more than a decade of negotiations and planning under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the first binding international agreement to control the emissions of greenhouse gases has come into effect in the Kyoto Protocol. The first budget period of 2008-12 is at hand. Moreover, the scientific evidence on greenhouse warming strengthens steadily as observational evidence of warming accumulates. The institutional framework of the protocol has taken hold solidly in the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), which covers almost half of Europe's CO2 emissions. Notwithstanding this apparent success, the Kyoto Protocol is widely seen as somewhere between troubled and terminal. Early troubles came with the failure (Figure presented) to include the major developing countries along with lack of an agreed-upon mechanism for including new countries and extending the agreement to new periods. The major blow came when the United States withdrew from the treaty in 2001. By 2002, the protocol covered only 30 percent of global emissions, while the hard enforcement mechanism in the ETS accounts for about 8 percent of global emissions (see figure 6-1). Even if the current protocol is extended, models indicate that it will have little impact on global temperature change. Modeling estimates indicate that global emissions under the revised Kyoto Protocol will be very close to ""business as usual."" Global emissions in 2010 under the current protocol are estimated to be 1.5 percent lower than a no-controls scenario, if the new forestry offsets are ignored (see figure 6-2). Unless there is a dramatic breakthrough or a new design, the protocol threatens to be seen as a monument to institutional overreach. (Figure presented) Nations are beginning to consider the structure of climate change policies for the period after 2008-12. Some countries, states, cities, companies, and even universities are adopting their own climate change policies. Are there in fact alternatives to the scheme of tradable emissions permits embodied in the protocol? The fact is that alterative approaches have not received a serious hearing among natural scientists or among policymakers. What are some of the alternatives?1 For global public goods, there are three potential approaches: command-and-control regulation, quantity-oriented market approaches, and tax- or price-based regimes.2 Of these, only the tradable-quantity and price-based regimes have any hope of being reasonably efficient. Under a tradable-quantity approach, an agreement proceeds by setting limits on emissions by different countries. The limits are partially or wholly transferable among countries. This is the approach taken under the Kyoto Protocol. This approach has very limited international experience under existing protocols such as the chlorofluorocarbon mechanisms and somewhat broader experience under national trading regimes, such as the U.S. SO2 (sulfur dioxide) regime. A radically different approach is to use harmonized prices, fees, or taxes as a method of coordinating policies among countries. This approach has no international experience in the environmental area, although it has modest experience nationally in such areas as the U.S. tax on ozone-depleting chemicals. In contrast, the use of harmonized price-type measures has extensive international experience in fiscal and trade policies, such as harmonized taxes in the EU and harmonized tariffs in international trade.

Particulate matter emissions from coal-fired electric utility boilers in the United States have decreased significantly since implementation of the 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments. Several particulate control technologies are available for coal-fired power plants, including electrostatic precipitators (ESPs), fabric filters (baghouses), wet particulate scrubbers, mechanical collectors (cyclones), and hot-gas particulate filters. Of these, ESPs and fabric filters are currently the technologies of choice because they can meet current and pending legislation for particulate matter levels. While cleaning large volumes of flue gas, they achieve very high collection efficiencies and can remove fine particles. presents options for controlling mercury, the newest pollutant to be regulated. It also discusses carbon dioxide capture from flue gas streams, which is anticipated to be regulated in the future. The increased CO2 concentration in the atmosphere from fossil fuel combustion is causing concerns for global warming. The capture and sequestration of CO2 from stationary combustion sources is considered an important option for the control of CO2 emission because CO2 is likely to be regulated in the future as part of a carbon management program. The leading candidate technology for CO2 capture from coal-fired power plants is also briefly discussed in this chapter. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882301780

When lime is added to dewatered sludge, it must first be made into a slurry before the pH can be measured to demonstrate regulatory compliance. In this study, pH 12 was achieved in slurries prepared from lime-amended dewatered sludge, even when the lime was poorly incorporated and relatively high fecal coliform levels were detected. Thus, quantitative indicators of lime incorporation are needed to complement slurry pH measurements and ensure that sufficient contact occurs between lime and sludge particles to achieve adequate stabilization. In this study, the usefulness of several potential measures of lime incorporation-pH, CO2 consumption, distribution of calcium, fecal coliforms, NH3 and reduced sulfur compound production, and ATP-was systematically evaluated using a bench-scale system. Sludge pH and CO2 consumption were not influenced by the extent of lime incorporation. The distribution of calcium and fecal coliform levels appear to be useful measures of lime incorporation. NH3 and reduced sulfur compound emissions and ATP levels can also be used to assess lime incorporation provided recommended experimental techniques are used. © 2008 ASCE.","Dewatering; Full-scale tests; Laboratory tests; Lime; Mixing; pH; Sludge","Bench-scale; Bench-scale system; Class A; Dewatered sludge; Dewatering; Experimental techniques; Fecal coliform; Fecal coliforms; Full-scale tests; Laboratory tests; Mixing; Municipal sludge; pH; PH measurements; Quantitative indicators; Sludge; Air pollution; Arsenic compounds; Biosolids; Calcium; Calcium alloys; Chlorine compounds; Regulatory compliance; Slurries; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; Sulfur determination; Water pollution; Water resources; Lime; ammonium; biosolid; calcium; carbon dioxide; dewatering; experimental study; fecal coliform; laboratory method; lime; municipal solid waste; pH; quantitative analysis; sludge; slurry; sulfur compound; waste treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49749141501

By computing a vegetation feedback parameter based on lagged autocovariances, the simulated impact of North African vegetation on precipitation is statistically quantified. The feedback is also dynamically assessed through initial value ensemble experiments, in which North African grass cover is initially reduced and the climatic response analyzed. The statistical and dynamical assessments of the negative vegetation feedback agree in sign and relative magnitude for FOAM-LPJ. The negative feedback on annual precipitation largely results from a competition between bare soil evaporation and plant transpiration, with increases in the former outweighing reductions in the latter given reduced grass cover.

At the same time there is a need to increase the use of renewable energy sources in order to reduce climate change. Awareness is growing that solar energy, which is available in abundance in many countries, should be used for the production of environmentally friendly fuel and electricity. The use of solar energy is determined by availability of new materials that are able to efficiently convert solar-energy into other types of energy. It becomes increasingly clear that oxide semiconductors are the most promising candidates for solar energy conversion. These semiconductors can be used for a wide range of environmentally friendly applications, including the production of solar-hydrogen fuel and solar-driven water purification.

Climate change science has established that sea level rise, changes in snow melt regimes, hydrological cycles, fish stock, nutrient and heat flows, and coral bleaching are all effects that will impact on coastal communities. The costs of addressing climate change however are likely to fall disproportionately on local government, industries, communities, and workers. Responding to these changes will require more than good science, but the development of institutional strategies and political solutions that address the social, cultural and economic factors that profoundly influence how a problem of this magnitude can be resolved at local levels. This paper reports on a social science research project into climate change and local governments in Australia. This project applied discourse analysis to investigate the flexibility and capacity of local governments to respond to the effects of climate change predicted by the science. The paper highlights how the use of discourse enables an overview of both scientific and social science information to enable an inter-disciplinary understanding of issues within, and the socio-ecological resilience to, climate change in local government contexts. In turn this gives insights into what the core adaptation solutions might be to forge action on climate change. © Common Ground.","Australia; Climate change; Local government; Social science",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960763952

In the experiment chemical and stable C and H isotope analyses were used to determine the processes of CH4 formation. The isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon, δ13CDIC, indicates three different processes occurring during incubation: (a) oxic degradation of organic matter (OM), (b) transition between oxic degradation and methanogenesis (""transition"") and (c) methanogenesis. During oxic degradation of OM δ13 CDIC values decreased from -7.9‰ to -13.5‰, and stayed relatively constant during ""transition"" with mean δ13CDIC value of -12.6 ± 0.6‰. After 56 days the δ13CDIC value reached -7.6‰ and did not change much until the end of incubation. 13C enrichment coincided with the formation of CH4, which started to increase at the same time. The methane produced had a measured average δ13CCH4 value of -70.1 ± 1.1‰ and δDCH4 value of -208 ± 10‰ indicating the formation of methane through bacterial CO2 reduction. The flux-weighted 13C/12C content of DIC and CH4 is equivalent to the isotopic composition of the deposited metabolizable organic carbon and plankton. Thus, at least at the surface of the sediment, oxidized carbon reflects the reactivity of planktonic OM, since the δ13C of remineralized carbon was estimated to be -40.1‰. A lower δ13Crem value of -48.1‰ was calculated during methanogenesis due to selective lipid degradation of planktonic origin and/or to δ13C depleted microbial lipid degradation. According to FTIR and solid state 13C NMR measurements of lake sedimentary organic matter, the most degradable components are polysaccharides and aromatic/olefinic organic compounds, while carbonyl and amide structures as well as and alkyl components seem more resistant. The contribution of the dissolution of calcite to DIC decreased during the incubation from 20% during the oxic degradation of OM to 7% during methanogenesis.","Extreme lacustrine system; Hydrogenotrophy; Incubation experiment; Methane","carbon isotope; degradation; dissolved inorganic carbon; eutrophic environment; FTIR spectroscopy; hydrogen isotope; incubation; isotopic analysis; isotopic composition; lacustrine deposit; methane; methanogenesis; nuclear magnetic resonance; organic matter; stable isotope; Eurasia; Europe; Lake Planina; Slovenia; Southern Europe; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54049111015

Currently, the introduction of a number-based Particulate Matter (PM) emission regulation is being discussed in the European region and the DPF must fulfill the stronger requirement of PM filtration performance. In this study, the influence of the DPF's pore size, pore distribution and catalyst coating condition on the number-based filtration efficiency was examined. The experiment was performed by using an engine bench so that the filtration efficiency was measured during 3 cycles of the NEDC mode. As a result, it was found that pore structure with a sharp pore distribution had higher filtration efficiency than one with a broad pore distribution. Based on a analysis by 3-dimensional simulation of gas flow in the porous material, it was suggested that the gas flow through the porous wall with broad pore distribution was non-uniform and the flow rate of large pore was relatively high, and particles were easily passed though the large pore. It was also found that the filtration efficiency is greatly influenced by how one coats the catalyst on the DPF. As the result, it was recognized that SiC-DPF having a relatively sharper pore distribution is favorable for future number-based PM emission regulation and it is possible to improve the filtration efficiency further depending on the catalyst coating condition.",,"3-dimensional; After-treatment; Catalyst coating; Diesel exhausts; Diesel particulate filters; Engine bench; Filtration efficiency; Filtration performance; Flowthrough; Large pores; Particulate Matter; Particulate matter emissions; PM emissions; Pore distribution; Porous walls; Catalysts; Coatings; Diesel engines; Flow of gases; Particulate emissions; Pore structure; Powertrains; Propulsion; Silicon carbide; Efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866910671

The purpose of the demonstration is two fold 1) efficient low cost energy generation and 2) hydrogen production. Although a next generation plant could be developed as a single-purpose facility dedicated to hydrogen production, early designs are expected to be dual purpose. While hydrogen production and advanced energy cycles are still in its early stages of development, research towards coupling a high temperature reactor with electrical generation and hydrogen production is under way. Many aspects of the NGNP must be researched and developed in order to make recommendations on the final design of the plant. Parameters such as working conditions, cycle components, working fluids, and power conversion unit configurations must be understood. Three configurations of the power conversion unit were demonstrated in this study. A three-shaft design with three turbines and four compressors, a combined cycle with a Brayton top cycle and a Rankine bottoming cycle, and a reheated cycle with three stages of reheat were investigated. An intermediate heat transport loop for transporting process heat to a High Temperature Steam Electrolysis (HTSE) hydrogen production plant was used. Helium, CO2, and a 80% nitrogen, 20% helium mixture (by weight) were studied to determine the best working fluid in terms cycle efficiency and development cost. In each of these configurations the relative component sizes were estimated for the different working fluids. Parametric studies were carried out on reactor outlet temperature, mass flow, pressure, and turbine cooling. Recommendations on the optimal working fluid for each configuration were made. Engineering analyses were performed for several configurations of the intermediate heat transport loop that transfers heat from the nuclear reactor to the hydrogen production plant. The analyses evaluated parallel and concentric piping arrangements and two different working fluids, including helium and a liquid salt. The thermal-hydraulic analyses determined the size and insulation requirements for the hot and cold leg pipes in the different configurations. Mechanical analyses were performed to determine hoop stresses and thermal expansion characteristics for the different configurations.

This study performs experimental investigation to obtain a better understanding of THC emission characteristic at engine restart and deceleration driving on a HEV powertrain of parallel motor/generator type. Using a Fast response Flame Ionization Detector (FFID) and specified tool for cycle by cycle, cylinder to cylinder combustion and engine control characteristic analysis during transient state of HEV powertrain. The experimental conditions cover variation of high voltage battery State of Charge (SoC), spark ignition timing and injected fuel mass. As an experimental result, the effect of the spark timing control is so little, but the reasonable injection duration for stable combustion is more than 7 (ms) at the first cycle shortly after engine start-up by motor although the injection rate is 2.7 ∼ 3 (ms) at idle state. The reason why more fuel was injected was that the deposited fuel in the cylinder and intake port was reduced due to discharging and vaporization during deceleration step before idle stop.

The photophysically designed DNA showed strong emission when it hybridized with the target strand, whereas the emission was suppressed strongly in the single-stranded state. The present approach using an excitonic interaction exhibits a quenching ability that is high enough to work as an on-off probe, and also includes many advantages quite different from conventional assays.",,"benzothiazole derivative; DNA; fluorescent dye; messenger RNA; quinoline derivative; RNA; thiazole orange; DNA; DNA probe; fluorescent dye; RNA; article; chemistry; DNA probe; HeLa cell; human; spectrofluorometry; synthesis; DNA probe; HeLa cell line; Benzothiazoles; DNA; DNA Probes; Fluorescent Dyes; Hela Cells; Humans; Quinolines; RNA; RNA, Messenger; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Benzothiazoles; DNA; DNA Probes; Fluorescent Dyes; HeLa Cells; Humans; Quinolines; RNA; RNA, Messenger; Spectrometry, Fluorescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-75149189476

While carbon-emission reduction goals are plentiful in the building industry, there are relatively few reliable tools to actually quantify the carbon emissions produced by buildings. Carbon quantifying tools are obviously a necessity as validating design intent becomes more critical as more and more developers and architecture firms commit to low-carbon design policies. Our research team is developing a tool called GreenFoot to quantify the ecological footprint, including carbon emissions from any size or type of building. A unique aspect of this calculator is that it not only quantifies the carbon emissions produced by a building, but also relates this quantity to the capacity of the building site, using the ecological footprint methodology initially developed by Rees and Wakernagel. Eventually the tool will not only account for operational energy, but also account for the buildings embodied energy. Including a building's water and waste footprint are being developed as aspects of GreenFoot. By comparing building impacts to the ecological capacity of a site, GreenFoot creates a common language for architectural and ecological disciplines. The tool allows for the overall size of the impact and ecological efficiency to be measured through unique metrics initially described in a 2004 paper published in Solar Energy 77 entitled, ""The Application of Ecosystems Services Criteria for Green Building Assessment."" A common baseline of hectare/year allows projects of different sizes and typologies to be objectively compared. The time and area metrics of GreenFoot provides designers with the ability to plan the ecological debit and return of their buildings, similar to the life cycle analysis of a financial plan. GreenFoot can be used at the preliminary design phase (with estimated data) or at a final assessment stage with accurate data. The comparison feature allows your project to be measured against a reference project (base case) to show the degree of improvement. The calculation methods and results from Greenfoot have been verified against several carbon calculators, and have a high degree of accuracy. Future modifications may include providing options for aligning our emissions factors with those used by WRI calculators for the GHG Protocol. This tool will be demonstrated in its current state of development using case studies. The directions for further research and development of the tool will also be shown.",,"Building industry; Building sites; Carbon emissions; Common languages; Design intent; Design policy; Different sizes; Ecological capacity; Ecological efficiency; Ecological footprint; Embodied energy; Emissions factors; Financial plan; Green buildings; High degree of accuracy; Life cycle analysis; Low-carbon; Operational energy; Preliminary design phase; Research and development; Research teams; Buildings; Carbon; Commerce; Construction industry; Emission control; Energy policy; Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Marketing; Mathematical instruments; Research; Solar energy; Structural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868611718

Progress and development is shown through the inclusion of air-conditioners, while choices made in the construction of buildings ignore concerns about the wider environmental context in which architecture is situated. Although architects in Uganda are aware of sustainability and environmental issues and the need for strategies to reduce the carbon footprint of buildings, the ability to translate information into built form is limited by the fact that many have not been given the appropriate tools to apply this information in the local context. The introduction to environmental and sustainable issues for many architects in Uganda has been through the traditional mode, in which environmental issues were presented as 'addon' courses, delivered by 'specialists', in independent lecture sessions, with little if any attempt made to integrate this knowledge into design projects. The design studio viewed as a place for aesthetic exploration, with technical and environmental issues regarded as an impediment to this. Introducing Sustainability and Environmental design into the curriculum as an integrated component in the design studio is an important strategy to enabling graduating architects to make decisions concerning sustainability and environmental design as part of the design process, rather than as an add on extra. Over the past three years, the School of the Built Environment at the Uganda Martyrs University has transformed its curriculum in an effort to make the architecture curriculum more responsive to environmental concerns. The new integrated curriculum sought to make sustainability and environmental design integral to the design studio in an effort to address growing environmental concerns in Uganda.

Defined as plausible, challenging and relevant stories about how the future might unfold that integrate quantitative models with qualitative assessments of social and political trends, scenarios are a central component in assessment processes for a range of global issues, including climate change, biodiversity, agriculture, and energy. Yet, despite their prevalence, systematic analysis of scenarios is in its beginning stages. Fundamental questions remain about both the epistemology and scientific credibility of scenarios and their roles in policymaking and social change. Answers to these questions have the potential to determine the future of scenario analyses. Is scenario analysis moving in the direction of earth system governance informed by global scenarios generated through increasingly complex and comprehensive models integrating socio-economic and earth systems? Or will global environmental scenario analyses lose favour compared to more focused, policy-driven, regionally specific modelling? These questions come at an important time for the climate change issue, given that the scenario community, catalyzed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), is currently preparing to embark on a new round of scenario development processes aimed at coordinating research and assessment, and informing policy, over the next five to ten years. These and related questions about where next to go with global environmental scenarios animated a workshop held at Brown University (Note1) that brought together leading practitioners and scholars of global environmental change scenarios from research, policy-making, advocacy, and business settings. The workshop aimed to provide an overview of current practices/best practices in scenario production and scenario use across a range of global environmental change arenas. Participants worked to bring the experience generated from over four decades of scenario development in other issue domains, including energy and security, to bear on environmental scenarios, and to bring into dialogue scenario practitioners, both producers and users, with social science scholars. The set of contributions to this focus issue of Environmental Research Letters arose out of this workshop and collectively examines key challenges facing the scenario community, synthesizes lessons, and offers recommendations for new research and practice in this field. One theme that emerged in many of the discussions at the workshop revolved around the distinction between two broad perspectives on the goals of scenario exercises: scenarios as products and scenarios as processes. Most global environmental change scenario exercises are product-oriented; the content of the scenarios developed is the main goal of many participants and those who commission or organize the scenario development process. Typically, what is of most interest are the environmental outcomes produced, how they relate to the various factors driving them, and what the results tell us about the prospects for future environmental change, for impacts, and for mitigation. A product-oriented perspective assumes that once produced, scenario products have lives of their own, divorced from the processes that generated them and able to serve multiple, often unspecified purposes. Thus, it is often assumed that the scenario products can be 'taken up' by a variety of users in a variety of fora. A contrasting scenario approach is process-oriented and self-consciously privileges the process of scenario development as the primary goal, for example as a means to motivate organizational learning, find commonalities across different perspectives, achieve consensus on goals, or come to a shared understanding of challenges. Focusing on scenarios as processes highlights the social contexts in which scenarios are created and used. Process-oriented scenario exercises also generate scenario products, but such products are recognized as meaningful mostly (or only) in the social context in which they were developed. It should be noted that those seeking to understand the functions, implications and utility of scenarios can approach analysis of scenarios and their impacts from either perspective - focusing attention on product outcomes and influence or assessing procedural and contextual dynamics and implications. Papers in this issue examine various aspects of scenario products, scenario processes and their interactions, with specific reference to global environmental change scenarios. Hulme and Dessai (2008) use the product-process distinction as a starting point for developing a framework to evaluate the success of scenario exercises. They identify 'prediction success', 'decision success' and 'learning success' as three evaluation metrics for scenarios, with the first two most relevant to scenario products and the last emphasizing procedural aspects of scenarios. They suggest that viewing scenarios primarily as products implies examining how closely actual outcomes have matched envisioned outcomes, while viewing them primarily as processes suggests evaluating the extent to which scenarios engaged participants and enabled their learning. O'Neill and Nakicenovic (2008) focus on Hulme and Dessai's evaluation metric, learning. Based on a review of six scenario/assessment exercises, they ask if and how scenario products have incorporated comparative assessments of results in order to enable cumulative learning across scenario efforts. The authors conclude that, although participating modelling teams have benefited greatly from the process of scenario activities and applied that learning to other scenario exercises in which they engage, learning from comparative assessments of scenario products has been rather limited; the latter due to the limited time and resources invested in comparative analysis. Pitcher (2009) speaks to a similar audience, namely the emissions scenario communities that are organizing to undertake a new round of scenario development in the lead-up to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. His focus is primarily on a set of concerns that need to be addressed if the new set of socio-economic and emissions scenario products are to adequately support climate model runs, mitigation analyses, and impacts, adaptation and vulnerability research. Pitcher flags issues associated with assessment and measurement of economic growth, challenges associated with downscaling long-term, global scenarios to finer geographic and time scales, and possible ways to grapple with probability and uncertainty in scenario analyses. Garb et al (2008) shift focus to the process aspects of scenarios, focusing on how scenarios simultaneously shape and embed their social contexts. They outline and give examples from a research agenda, drawing on concepts and methods from sociology, political science, and science and technology studies, aimed at redressing the growing imbalance between the increasing technical sophistication of the quantitative components of scenarios on the one hand, and the continued simplicity of our understandings of the social origins, linkages, and implications of the narratives to which they are coupled on the other. Focusing on the treatment of equity concerns in the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios, Baer (2009) offers a concrete example of how particular social assumptions and definitions of equity are built into scenarios which then create particular worldviews about rights and responsibilities. Baer argues that incorporating distributions of income within - and not only between - countries in quantitative scenario exercises makes visible questions regarding the assignment of rights and the distribution of costs and benefits; such equity considerations, he argues, are central to engendering the cooperation necessary to address the climate crisis. For Parson (2008), the product-process distinction serves to highlight the unique characteristics and challenges of scenarios for global environmental change, including their use in large-scale official assessments, basis in biophysical modelling, weak connections to decision-makers, and roles as sites of public controversy. Parson argues that these characteristics of global environmental change scenarios prohibit process-oriented approaches, which rely on pre-identifying intended users and engaging them in the scenario development process. Instead, he proposes ways in which scenario products can be enhanced to support use by multiple, non-participant user communities. Wilkinson and Eidinow (2008) reach a different conclusion. They too identify the particular challenges of grappling with global environmental change. They examine approaches to past scenario efforts and categorize them into two groups that map loosely onto the product-process distinction: 'problem-focused' and 'actor-centric' approaches. They propose that progress in global environmental issues can best be made through a new, third type of approach ('reflexive interventionist or multi-agent based') that would combine elements of problem- and actor-focused approaches, creating scenario processes that can simultaneously support longer-term thinking as well as more immediate actions. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Biodiversity; Climate change; Computer supported cooperative work; Ecology; Economic analysis; Focusing; Reaction kinetics; Research; Social sciences; Environmental researches; Global environmental change; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Organizational learning; Process-oriented approaches; Rights and responsibilities; Science and technology studies; Special report on emissions scenarios; Uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62749166416

The increase of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) is likely to cause the elevation of the global average temperature. Additionally, 13.5% of anthropogenic GHG emissions are from agricultural activities. Thus, we should make efforts to reduce GHG emissions, even in the agricultural field. However, quantitative discussion about GHG emissions in the agricultural field is not sufficient yet. The purpose of this study is to estimate GHG emissions in agricultural activities up to the present date on le Island, Okinawa as a study region, and to examine the direction of reduction of GHG emissions in agricultural activities on the assumption that agricultural activities will be a part of the framework for emissions trading. First, we estimated GHG emissions using the DNDC model and the LCA method. And then, we did an economic appraisal of GHG emissions. Next, from those results, we examined the direction of the reduction of GHG emissions. As a result, we have obtained the following: (1) GHG emissions from soil were prominent in agricultural activities. And it was considered that the cause of this was the fertilization; (2) the environmental load was equivalent to 18% of the product in 2005; (3) a critical point was to be found in a relationship between the amount of fertilizer applied and the product. In conclusion, when agricultural activity becomes a part of the framework for emissions trading, the agricultural field will be able to get benefit by optimized fertilization.","Agricultural development; DNDC; GHG; LCA","Air quality; Equations of state; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Leakage (fluid); Life cycle; Agricultural activities; Agricultural development; Agricultural fields; Average temperatures; Critical points; DNDC; Emissions trading; Environmental loads; GHG; Ghg emissions; Green house gas; Green house gas emissions; LCA; Lca methods; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63049133361

At Nissan, we developed an emission control system for meeting Tier 2 Bin 5 requirements in 2003. On the basis of that technology, a new HC-NOx trap catalyst system has now been developed that complies with the SULEV standards without increasing the catalyst volume and precious metal loading. Compliance with the SULEV standards requires a further reduction of HC (NMHC) emissions by 84% and NOx by 60% compared with the emission performance Tier 2 Bin 5 compliant catalyst system. Consequently high conversion performance for both HCs and NOx is needed. An investigation of HC emission behavior under the FTP75 mode showed that a reduction of cold-phase HCs was critical for meeting the standard. Large quantities of HCs above C4 are emitted in the cold state. Thus, a HC trap type three-way catalyst (HCT-TWC) which contains a relatively big pore size zeolite was selected for reducing cold-phase HCs corresponding to the size of HCs. This catalyst has the capability to convert not only HCs but also NOx effectively. The possibility of integrating the HCT-TWC and a LNT catalyst was investigated with an eye toward downsizing the catalyst system. This catalyst combination was also investigated with the expectation of obtaining functional synergies. That led to the development of an HC-NOx trap catalyst. The NOx reduction capability was improved by increasing the dispersion of precious metal and the NOx trapping agent in the LNT catalyst layer. It was found that this HC-NOx trap catalyst system maintains good conversion performance even after aging equivalent to driving 120,000miles.That confirmed the possibility of meeting the SULEV standards without increasing the catalyst volume and precious metal loading over the Tier 2 Bin 5 compliant system.

They form a link between biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems via carbon and nutrient fluxes that pass between plants and fungi in the soil (O'Neill et al. 1991). The global carbon flux from plants to AM fungi has been estimated as 5 billion tons per year (Bago et al. 2000). The global biomass of the Glomeromycota has been estimated as 1.4 Pg (Treseder and Cross 2006), compared with the estimation of global soil microbial biomass of 13.9 Pg (Wardle 1992). Thus, Glomeromycota is a considerable but largely overlooked sink in the carbon cycle, whilst these fungi possess ecologically important functions in plant nutrition, pathogen resistance and water relations (Smith and Read 1997). A formerly prevailing understanding that all AM fungi are functionally similar is under question and is being replaced by more complex view including gradients of host selection/preference and variation in AM fungal life strategies with evidence of generalists and specialists, ruderals, K- and r-strategists (Helgason et al. 2007; Mathimaran et al. 2007). In this chapter, we aim to provide an overview about what is known about AM fungal natural (taxonomic) diversity patterns without attempting to cite every relevant publication. We discuss taxon delimitation and methodological issues affecting the revealed diversity and its interpretation. We outline the evidence of functional diversity and ways to link it with taxonomic diversity patterns in nature.

It is shown that dedicated measures on the vehicles can lead to significantly reduced emissions at locations where people are mostly disturbed.

After the Estonian re-independence in 1991, the increase of motorization has been fast and car usage has intensified. During the same period, the average age of cars has decreased and thanks to improvements in engine technology, the emissions per km have been reduced. The objective was to see how these factors have reflected in air quality. This paper also aim to present an analytical approach to estimate the air pollution levels in recent years, when air quality monitoring has not been conducted, and available traffic data are limited. Based on traffic counts in 25 points across the city the amounts of traffic were modelled for 680 street segments with CUBE software. As air quality is monitored irregularly in Tartu, dispersion modelling was used to estimate pollution levels. Annual concentrations of exhaust particles (PMexhaust), particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in 1993, 2000 and 2006 were calculated with AEROPOL software. The traffic increase in the city centre of Tartu was especially rapid in the 1990s. In recent years, it has slowed due to congestion. Overall, traffic levels have increased more than 3 times since 1993. In residential areas, the increase is still rapid - up to 6 times from 1993 to 2006. However, the changes in air quality are less dramatic. Increases from 1993 to 2000 were followed by stable or slightly increasing pollution levels in recent years, especially in case of PMexhaust. The study showed that 2 factors, namely, increase of traffic and improvement of vehicles, have been compensating each other in the dynamics of air pollution.","Air pollution; Emission coefficient; Exposure; Flow; Health; Modelling; Traffic",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149287893

The article develops a model for comparing the environmental net benefits of three policy instruments for Santiago, Chile, when the policy problem is to meet a given ambient quality standard. Two market-based instruments - the ambient permit system and a simpler emission permit system - are examined along with an emission standard, a command and control instrument usually favored by regulators. Both emission permit system and emission standard are costlier than the ambient permit system, sometimes in large part because they improve ambient emission concentrations beyond the required target in much of the city, but the ambient permit system requires a lower degree of control to comply with the standard. The somewhat costlier emission permit system and emission standard provide much higher net benefits than the ambient permit system when the health benefits of their ""excessive"" air quality improvements are taken into account. These benefits are different from the fact that an ambient permit system is administratively costlier to implement. © The Author 2007.

This energy, designated as ""Spilled Turbinable Energy"", could be used advantageously to generate other products or an energy vector that could be stored for later use, since in these occasions the dam is full. The present work studies the feasibility of using the spilled turbinable energy of the Itaipu Hydroelectric Power Plant to produce electrolytic hydrogen that, together with the nitrogen from air, is an important feedstock for the ammonia synthesis, used to produce nitrogen fertilizers. The minimum production cost of electrolytic hydrogen was estimated in US$ 0,253/m3 or US$ 2,832/kg, for a plant with capacity of 55.000 m3/h, which correspond to 247,5 MW of electrical power deriving from 82% of spilled turbinable energy and 18% of guaranteed energy. Next to that hydrogen plant it is possible to install an ammonia plant of approximately 500 t/day, operating 350 days/year, with a production cost of approximately US$ 562,81/t. This capacity is enough to supply 38,5% of the ammonia demand estimated for the region focused in the project, 1.300 t/day. Nowadays, ammonia is commercialized in the Brazilian market by approximately US$ 525,60/t. For that reason, it can be concluded that ammonia production through the association of spilled turbinable and guaranteed energy next to Itaipu Hydroelectric Power Plant is not economically feasible by the moment due to the high cost of imported electrolysers. Nevertheless, with the installation of an ammonia plant based on water electrolysis next to Itaipu Hydroelectric Power Plant and considering methane and carbon dioxide emissions of the Itaipu's reservoir could be avoid an annual carbon emission of 234 thousand tons. If the project is approved by the Clean Development Mechanism, that environmental impact decrease would represent an amount of approximately US$ 5,5 million. Considering that revenue, the project is not economically feasible.","Ammonia; Electrolytic hydrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Spilled turbinable energy","Ammonia; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Emission control; Environmental impact; Fertilizers; Global warming; Hydroelectric power; Hydrogen; Methane; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Reservoirs (water); Ammonia production; Ammonia synthesis; Carbon dioxide emissions; Clean Development Mechanism; Electrical power; Electrolytic hydrogen; Spilled turbinable energy; Water electrolysis; Hydroelectric power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924322677

Annual total Hg inputs (mainly wet deposition, coastal erosion, seawater import, and ?excess' deposition due to atmospheric Hg depletion events) are nearly in balance with outputs (mainly shelf sedimentation and seawater export), with a net 0.3% year?1 increase in total mass. Marine biota represent a small fraction of the ocean's existing total Hg and methyl-Hg (MeHg) inventories. The inertia associated with these large non-biological reservoirs means that ?bottom-up' processes (control of bioavailable Hg concentrations by mass inputs or Hg speciation) are probably incapable of explaining recent biotic Hg trends, contrary to prevailing opinion. Instead, varying rates of bioaccumulation and trophic transfer from the abiotic MeHg reservoir may be key, and are susceptible to ecological, climatic and biogeochemical influences. Deep and sustained cuts to global anthropogenic Hg emissions are required to return biotic Hg levels to their natural state. However, because of mass inertia and the less dominant role of atmospheric inputs, the decline of seawater and biotic Hg concentrations in the Arctic Ocean will be more gradual than the rate of emission reduction and slower than in other oceans and freshwaters. Climate warming has likely already influenced Arctic Hg dynamics, with shrinking sea-ice cover one of the defining variables. Future warming will probably force more Hg out of the ocean's euphotic zone through greater evasion to air and faster Hg sedimentation driven by higher primary productivity; these losses will be countered by enhanced inputs from coastal erosion and rivers. © CSIRO 2008.",,"anthropogenic effect; bioaccumulation; bioavailability; biogeochemistry; biota; coastal erosion; emission inventory; mass balance; mercury (element); seawater; speciation (chemistry); wet deposition; Arctic Ocean",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42949135896

Many strategies to reduce emissions are targeting the methanogens that inhabit the rumen, but such an approach can only be successful if it targets all the major groups of ruminant methanogens. Therefore, a thorough knowledge of the diversity of these microbes in different breeds of cattle and sheep, as well as in response to different diets, is required. A study was undertaken using the molecular techniques denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, DNA cloning and DNA sequence analysis to define the extent of diversity among methanogens in ruminants, particularly Bos indicus cross cattle, on differing forages in Queensland. It was found that the diversity of methanogens in forage-fed cattle in Queensland was greater than in grain-fed cattle but there was little variability in methanogen community composition between cattle fed different forages. The species that dominate the rumen microbial communities of B. indicus cross cattle are from the genus Methanobrevibacter, although rumen-fluid inoculated digestors fed Leucaena leucocephala leaf were populated with Methanosphaera-like strains, with the Methanobrevibacter-like strains displaced. If ruminant methane emissions are to be reduced, then antimethanogen bioactives that target both broad groups of ruminant methanogens are most likely to be needed, and as a part of an integrated suite of approaches that redirect rumen fermentation towards other more useful end products. © CSIRO 2008.","Archaea; Pasture","cattle; community composition; fermentation; global warming; methanogenic bacterium; microbial community; ruminant; species diversity; Australasia; Australia; Queensland; Animalia; Archaea; Bos; Bos indicus; Bovidae; Leucaena leucocephala; Methanobrevibacter; Methanosphaera; Ovis aries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45849102004

Pine bark based substrates provide excellent aeration and a moderate amount of available water (AW), however, they have little water buffering capacity. Thus, frequent irrigation events are required to maintain adequate water. This often leads to low water use efficiency. Current studies have shown reduced water application needs and increased plant stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation when plants were grown in a mineral aggregate amended pine bark substrate compared to pine bark alone. An increase in water buffering capacity was reported which may explain the plant response. Our objective was to determine if increased substrate water buffering capacity could be explained as a function of substrate physical properties. To accomplish this objective, pine bark was amended with a calcined Georgiana palygorksite-bentonite aggregate (0.85-0.25 mm) at 0%, 4%, 8%, 12%, 16%, 20% and 24% (by vol.). Physica properties consisting of total porosity, container capacity, air space (AS), bulk density, AW, and unavailable water (UW) were determined. Soil moisture characteristic curves were determined for amendment rates of 0%, 8%, 12%, 16% and 20% (by vol.). Container capacity and AW increased linearly with increasing amendment rate, whereas UW and AS decreased linearly with increasing rate of mineral aggregate. Substrate moisture characteristic curves showed that more water was retained at greater substrate moisture tensions with increasing mineral aggregate rate, thereby increasing readily available water. Volumetric water content was initially greater at the 0% rate, however it quickly decreased at approximately 2 cm substrate moisture tension below those substrates amended with the mineral. The physical properties of the substrate in association with the inherent zeolitic and absorbed water of the mineral increased water content, resulting in increased buffering capacity which could reduce plant water stress.","Air space; Available water; Clay; Container capacity; Sand; Soil moisture; Water",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61449247337

A significant portion of this increased demand will be met by natural gas. In recent times, there has been increasing attention worldwide on global climate change caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It is now widely accepted that the combustion of fossil fuels is a contributor to this buildup. This poses a challenge of meeting the growing energy demand while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Proposals to curb, or even to reduce, industrial CO2 emissions have been gathering momentum. Some of these include increased efficiency, fuel switching and carbon capture and sequestration. The United States power generation infrastructure is aging and will need to be retrofitted or replaced. Natural gas has become a preferred fuel since the early 1990's due to its clean-burning nature and its relatively lower cost. However, the global distribution of natural gas reserves does not coincide with major consuming centers. Much of the larger reserves of natural gas are located in remote locations of the world where there is limited demand for the gas. Liquefying natural gas and transporting it by ship is the preferred method for moving large volumes of natural gas over long distances.

These extreme Mach number flows are sufficiently energetic to initiate gas ionization processes and thermal and chemical ablation processes. The generated charged particles affect nonequilibrium atomic and molecular energy distributions and shock layer radiation. In this work, we present the first loosely coupled direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) simulations with the particle-based photon Monte Carlo (p-PMC) method to simulate Stardust reentry flows in the transitional flow regime. Eleven species including 5 ionization processes were modeled in DSMC, and the average ion velocity model was used to simulate electron motion. at these altitudes, the degree of ionization is predicted to be between 3 - 7 % along the stagnation line, and the maximum translational and electron temperatures are approximately 60,000 K and 20,000 K, respectively. to efficiently capture high nonequilibrium effects, emission and absorption cross section databases using the Nonequilibrium Air Radiation (NEQAIR) were generated, and N and O radiation was calculated by the p-PMC method. It was found that the N emission is approximately one order of magnitude higher than the O emission along the stagnation line due to the higher concentration of N at this altitude. The radiation energy change calculated by the p-PMC method has been coupled in the DSMC calculations. It was found that while the N and O atomic radiation does not have impact on the flow field at 81 km, at 68.9 km, the stronger radiation affected the flow field. The radiation resulted in lowering the gas temperatures in the high emission region, but slight increase of temperatures near the body as well as convective heat flux to the Stardust surface.",,"Atoms; Automobile bodies; Charged particles; Flow fields; Heat flux; Hypersonic vehicles; Ionization of gases; Photons; Radiation effects; Reentry; Degree of ionization; Direct simulation Monte Carlo; Emission and absorption cross-section; Hypersonic re-entry; Molecular energies; Non-equilibrium effects; Photon Monte Carlo method; Transitional flow regimes; Monte Carlo methods",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78049418712

There are many challenges facing the oil sands. The demanding climate conditions cost of extraction, environmental, energy constraints as well as the rising construction costs are examples. To develop this huge petroleum reserve, these factors must be considered. It also requires the utilization of unique technologies unusual to the oil & gas industry. These techniques include: open pit mining, and in situ techniques such as Steam Assist Gravity Drainage (SAGD) and Toe to Heel Air Injection (THAI) processes. Open pit mining requires the handling of vast quantities of ore material by utilizing mining and material handling equipment as well as slurry conditioning and transfer pump stations. This equipment is involved in the extraction process. Further along in the process are the froth and tailings operations which have high pump utilization. In-situ techniques do not require material handling but make use of a variety of specialized pumps. These include Progressive Cavity Pumps (PCP) and Electric Submersible Pumps (ESP) for the SAGD and THAI processes. This paper will discuss various techniques & considerations as well as approaches to project design, construction and management when dealing with large projects in the booming Alberta economy. A number of factors have influenced the extensive use of ASDs (Adjustable Speed Drives) on the associated applications. These factors Include: the unique techniques required for flow and process control, the high torque requirements common to the materials handling portion of the process (Shovels, crushers, apron feeders, and conveyors drives) as well as environmental factors. The need for efficiency, energy conservation and emission reductions are important environmental considerations. A unique application to the open pit mining process is the slurry conditioning and handling system as well as tailings pumps. These specialized pumps are required to transfer the large quantities of slurry and tailing materials involved in the process. Pumps and other applications will be discussed relative to the above factors.","Adjustable Speed Drive (ASD); Bitumen; Hydro-transport; Mega projects; Oil sand technologies","Agricultural engineering; Chemical industry; Conservation; Control theory; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Gas industry; Industrial chemicals; Injection (oil wells); Liquefied petroleum gas; Materials handling; Materials handling equipment; Mining; Oil fields; Oil sands; Oil well production; Oil well pumps; Ores; Petroleum deposits; Petroleum industry; Petroleum refineries; Plant layout; Production control; Project management; Pumps; Sand; Submersible pumps; Tailings; Tailings disposal; Trucks; Variable speed drives; Well equipment; Adjustable Speed Drive (ASD); Adjustable-speed drives; Air injection; Alberta; Alberta oil sands; Applications.; Bitumen; Chemical-; Climate conditions; Construction costs; Electric submersible pumps; Emission reductions; Energy constraints; Environmental considerations; Environmental factors; Extraction processing; Gravity drainage; High torque; Hydro-transport; In-situ techniques; Material handling; Mega projects; Oil sand technologies; Ore materials; Petroleum reserves; Progressive cavity pumps; Project designs; Pump stations; Tailing materials; Under construction; Open pit mining",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51849159147

In particular, the effect of ongoing land-use changes in the course of population growth, shifting cultivation and overgrazing has to be taken into account. New ensemble simulations with a regional climate model are presented, which are subject to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and land cover changes. The model predicts dryer conditions, near-surface warming and an intensification of heat stress. There is some indication that reforestation and regional protection of natural vegetation may be more effective for mitigating climate change in Africa than reduced greenhouse gas emissions. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2008.","African rainfall; Rainfall anomaly; Regional climate model; Sahelian rainfall; Summer monsoon rainfall",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051958793

Ecobalancing provides a basis for efficient utilization of material resources and energies and for reduction of environmental harmful emissions and waste. Reference models in material flow analysis (e.g. with Material Flow Networks) serve as templates for the development of more refined models in the same domain. They facilitate material flow analyses by reducing effort in time and costs in the model building process by reutilization of predefined structures. In the context of a Thai-German cooperation project a reference model for the Thai agro-industrial branch of native starch production has been designed which reduces the entry level for material flow network modelling in Thai starch industry. Material flow analyses should help to reduce environmental impacts such as water pollution as well as to improve production processes on an economic level. Process improvements for eco-efficiency are targeted on a reduction of starch losses during starch production while a better yield of starch is allowed. The reference model has been developed with the software tool Umberto® which is a graphical modeling tool for Material Flow Networks. The software supports a modular design of the reference model in order to make it easily adaptable to specific production processes in different starch factories. The general, well structured reference model approach for material flow analysis, developed to reduce environmental burdens and financial losses in Thai starch industry, is easily transferable to other industrial branches beyond Thai agro-industry as well as to other regions.","Eco-efficiency; Material flow analysis; Native starch production; Reference models","Agro-industry; Building process; Eco-efficiency; Economic level; Environmental burdens; Financial loss; Graphical modeling; Harmful emissions; Industrial branches; Material and energy flows; Material flow analysis; Material flow networks; Material resources; Modular designs; Native starch; Process Improvement; Production process; Re-utilization; Reference models; Refined model; Software support; Starch industry; Starch production; Umberto; Decision making; Environmental impact; Industry; Information technology; Losses; Models; Optimization; Production engineering; Starch; Materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858315792

We present new radio observations of two regions of the spiral galaxy NGC 3627, including new radio continuum observations at 1.4 GHz with the Very Large Array, and also new observations in the CO line, taken with the Plateau de Bure interferometer. Comparing these observations with archival Spitzer and Hα data we study the correlation of the radio continuum (RC), infrared-8 μm, and CO emissions at a spatial resolution of 100 pc. Methods. We compare the point-by-point variations of the RC, CO, and 8 μm brightnesses in two distinct regions of 2 kpc ×2 kpc in size of NGC 3627. We also present a three-dimensional fit of the observed data. Results. We examined scale much lower than the electron diffusion scale, where a breakdown of the correlations would be expected. However, no evidence for such correlation breakdown has been found. The RC emission follows the distribution of CO well, and the widths of several structures, measured along slices across them, are comparable. Furthermore, we found that down to a spatial scale of 100 pc, the radio continuum emission is correlated with dust emissions at 4.5, 5.8, and 8 μm, which trace different dust temperatures. We present a new perspective, a three-dimensional representation, with which to visualize and study the RC-CO-24 μm and RC-CO-8 μm correlations. We fit the observed data with a three-dimensional line, obtaining a rms of 0.25 dex. Conclusions. The observed correlation enhances the complexity of the electrons diffusion, losses, and injection mechanisms, and of their connection to star formation processes described by molecular and dust emissions. We plan to further investigate this connection using spatially resolved spectral index studies at low radio frequencies where the thermal emission component is seemingly negligible. © ESO 2008.","Formation; Galaxies; Galaxies; Individual; ISM; Molecules; NGC 3627; Radio continuum; Stars","Dust; Molecules; Stars; Thermionic emission; Dimensional representation; Formation; Individual; Injection mechanisms; Molecular emissions; NGC 3627; Radio continuum; Star-formation process; Galaxies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975707260

The MIT Integrated Global System Model (IGSM) - and its economic component, the Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model - were used to assess these proposals. In the absence of policy, the EPPA model projects a doubling of US greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Global emissions, driven by growth in developing countries, are projected to increase even more. Unrestrained, these emissions would lead to an increase in global CO2 concentration from a current level of 380 ppmv to about 550 ppmv by 2050 and to near 900 ppmv by 2100, resulting in a year 2100 global temperature 3.5-4.5°C above the current level. The more ambitious of the Congressional proposals could limit this increase to around 2°C, but only if other nations, including developing countries, also strongly controlled greenhouse gas emissions. With these more aggressive reductions, the economic cost measured in terms of changes in total welfare in the United States could range from 1.5% to almost 2% by the 2040-2050 period, with 2015 CO2-equivalent prices between $30 and $55, rising to between $120 and $210 by 2050. This level of cost would not seriously affect US GDP growth but would imply large-scale changes in its energy system. © 2008 Earthscan.","Cap-and-trade; Climate policy; Economic cost; Energy system; Greenhouse gas emission reductions; United States; US Congress","carbon dioxide; developing world; emission control; emissions trading; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; Gross Domestic Product; transaction cost; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51449113854

Available C estimates to date are predominantly for the tilled and flood-irrigated surface topsoil (ca. 30 cm). Such estimates cannot be used to extrapolate to soil depths of 100 cm since soil organic carbon (SOC) generally shows a sharp decrease with depth. In this research, composite soil samples were collected at several depths to 100 cm from three representative paddy soils in the Taihu Lake region, China. Soil organic carbon distribution in the profiles and in aggregate-size fractions was determined. Results showed that while SOC decreased exponentially with depth to 100 cm, a substantial proportion of the total SOC (30%-40%) is stored below the 30 cm depth. In the carbon-enriched paddy topsoils, SOC was found to accumulate preferentially in the 2-0.25 and 0.25-0.02 mm aggregate size fractions. ∂13C analysis of the coarse micro-aggregate fraction showed that the high degree of C stratification in the paddy topsoil was in agreement with the occurrence of lighter ∂1313C in the upper 30 cm depth. These results suggest that SOC stratification within profiles varies with different pedogenetical types of paddy soils with regards to clay and iron oxyhydrates distributions. Sand-sized fractions of aggregates in paddy soil systems may play a very important role in carbon sequestration and turnover, dissimilar to other studied agricultural systems. © 2008 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","carbon storage; organic carbon; paddy soils; profile stratification; size fractions; soil aggregates","Iron compounds; Organic carbon; Sand; Size distribution; Carbon storage; Iron oxyhydrates; Organic carbon stratification; Paddy soils; Soil aggregates; Topsoils; Soils; carbon; Iron compounds; Organic carbon; Sand; Size distribution; Soils; alternative agriculture; carbon sequestration; irrigation; organic carbon; paddy farming; size distribution; soil; soil aggregate; tillage; topsoil; article; chemistry; China; soil; Carbon; China; Soil; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Taihu Lake",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42049114091

This paper investigates the evolving role that Chinese trade is playing in the response to climate change by estimating the scale of emissions embodied in China's current trade pattern and demonstrating the magnitude of the difference between the emissions it produces (some of which are incurred to meet the consumption demands of the rest of the world) and the emissions embodied in the goods it consumes. Estimating China's emissions on a consumption rather than a production basis both lowers its responsibility for carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions in 2006 from 5,500 to 3,840mtCO2 and reduces the growth rate of emissions from an average of 12.5 per cent p.a. to 8.7 per cent p.a. between 2001 and 2006. The analysis indicates that a reliable consumption-based accounting methodology is feasible and could improve our understanding of which actors and states are responsible for emissions. For example, recent emissions reductions by developed countries may lack credibility if production has merely been displaced to countries such as China. Moreover, in the current institutional context, production methodologies encourage leakages through trade that may do more to displace than to reduce emissions. Both equity and efficiency concerns therefore suggest that emissions embodied in trade should receive special attention in the distribution of post-Kyoto abatement burdens. © The Authors 2008.

For the EPR to remain competitive on the worldwide nuclear energy market, standardization and high unit net electrical output are key features of EPR deployment. The first EPR, the only Generation III+ advanced reactor design that is currently being built, is being constructed at Olkiluoto, Finland. Many of the plant systems for this first-of-a-kind unit are optimized for the climate and heat rejection method (once-through cooling) used at Olkiluoto. Two such systems are the Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS) and the Turbine/Generator (T/G) system. To achieve the EPR's target net electrical output for tropical climates and various condenser heat rejection methods, design studies were performed that showed that the NSSS and T/G system designs developed for the Olkiluoto site conditions required modification. Tropical climates are more representative of the continental United States, and reflect sites with an average ambient temperature above 60°F. To optimize the EPR design for tropical climates, two sets of parametric studies were performed to determine the maximum NSSS power level that could be achieved, and to evaluate the effects of tropicalization on T/G performance for a range in condenser heat rejection methods (e.g., once-through cooling, natural draft cooling towers, etc.). These parametric studies explored a range of design considerations with four goals: (1) to maintain a highly reliable design, (2) to minimize changes to the Olkiluoto standardized design, (3) to optimize T/G performance for tropical conditions, and (4) to achieve the target net electrical output. This paper reports the results of these studies, and demonstrates how the net electrical output goal for U.S. EPR is met with tropical heat sink conditions and a range of condenser heat rejection methods.",,"Condensers (liquefiers); Cooling; Cooling systems; Electric power plants; Electron resonance; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Energy resources; Heat sinks; Heat storage; Industrial engineering; Labeling; Labels; Nuclear energy; Nuclear engineering; Nuclear industry; Nuclear power plants; Optimization; Paramagnetic resonance; Quantum theory; Standardization; Steam power plants; Tropics; Uncertain systems; Advanced reactor design; Ambient temperatures; Condenser heat; Continental United States; Design considerations; Design studies; Heat rejection; International Congress on Advances in Nuclear Power Plants; Natural draft cooling towers; Net electrical output; Nuclear energy market; Nuclear power; Nuclear renaissance; Nuclear steam supply system; Olkiluoto , Finland; Parametric studies; Plant designs; Plant systems; Power leveling; Reliable design; Site conditions; System designs; Tropical climates; Tropical conditions; Tropicalization; Power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52249098589

Along with global problems like ocean pollution and species extinction, and local problems such as pollution of air and water as well as the degradation of soil and forests, the problem of climate change has to be addressed in the context of sustainable development. Development activities and poverty alleviation programs also increase emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) recognized the need for the development of developing nations while expecting contributions from all signatory nations. Given that 75 percent of global GHG emissions were emitted by the 25 percent of the world's population who live in developed countries (these are listed in UNFCCC Annex I and hence called Annex I countries), the UNFCCC required the developed countries to lead the efforts to reduce GHG emissions.1 Developing countries were exempt from any commitment to reduce emissions but were asked to do their best. Since then, emissions of developing countries, which have risen, now pose challenges and cause concern. One should not lose the perspective that accumulated emissions, and not annual emissions, should be the criterion for reductions in the near term of twenty years-because, once emitted, greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for centuries. The 1997 the Kyoto Protocol brought developing countries closer to the ambit of GHG reduction by making it attractive for them to reduce emissions by providing carbon credits under the proposal of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Each year, numerous training programs, workshops, and consultations take place involving Annex I states, non-Annex I states, policymakers, experts from public and private sectors, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and academic organizations. The discussion in this chapter covers the following: -India's efforts to reduce GHG emissions, -The problems of India's adaptation to climate change, -Future scenarios on India's GHG emissions, especially carbon dioxide (CO2), -Suggestions for resolving the impasse about developing countries' participation in the UNFCCC Framework, -Concluding remarks.

On-road traffic, power facilities and other industries, vegetation, services stations and solvent use were considered as emission sources, under the following scenarios: 1) without oil palm, 2) with oil palm plantation in 2003; and, 3) with an expected future plantation. Two groups of emission rates were used: 1) a group of mid-range emission factors (up to 51 g g-1 h-1) and 2) a high isoprene emission factor (172.9 g g-1 h-1). Results indicate that increasing areas of oil palm plantations in the future could increase O3 concentrations.

Cleaner and less polluting city transit buses are paramount if cities are to attain their ambitious emissions reduction targets, as transit buses are high usage vehicles that operate in heavily congested areas where air quality improvements and reductions in public exposure to harmful air contaminants are critical. Decision to invest in a new bus is based on the cost, technology and emission standards. Frequent changes in the emission standards and evolution of bus technology adds to the uncertainty in decision making. A bus has a life expectancy of about 20 years - during its lifespan if the emission standards change and the bus can no longer satisfy the requirements then it has to be phased out or upgraded to comply with the emission requirements - which costs money and time thus leading to financial and service losses. The objective of a decision maker while investing is to optimize the returns of investments - low costs and lower emissions.

In 2004, the American Petroleum Institute (API) published Risk Based Screening Levels for the Protection of Livestock Exposed to Petroleum Hydrocarbons [1]. The API framework, conceptual site model, and screening-level procedures were used in a case study to evaluate potential risks to livestock at the oilfield sites in northeastern Ecuador. API's toxicity reference values (TRVs) as well as their drinking water and soil risk-based screening levels (RBSLs) for livestock were used to evaluate whether levels of hydrocarbons in soil and water could pose a health risk to cattle, calves, sheep, goats, or horses. RBSLs are threshold concentrations in site media (e.g. soil, water, and air) below which no significant unacceptable risks to livestock are expected. Since pigs, chickens, and ducks are also commonly raised in northeastern Ecuador, new TRVs were calculated for them based on a review of all published toxicity values. RBSLs for pigs, chickens, and ducks were then calculated using exposure assumptions aligned with API's conceptual site model. The evaluation presented herein was a screening-level risk assessment using a conservative approach to evaluate potential risks to livestock from exposure to petroleum at the oilfield sites. The RBSLs and TRVs were conservative because they are based on non-lethal endpoints protective of individual livestock, and the mammalian RBSLs for TPH were based on fresh crude oil rather than on the weathered, less toxic oil that is typically found in soils in tropical climates. In this case study, data from over 300 surface soil and 100 surface water samples from seven oilfields in northeastern Ecuador were collected during field inspections conducted from 2004 through 2006.

Each row included 1 plant (upwind) or 2 plants (downwind) per species per row. When measured with a photoacoustic NH3 detector at the same elevation as the fan (1.5 m), NH3 concentration decreased sharply with greater distance, from 51.54 ppm at 0 m (at the fan) to 1.89 ppm at 5.5 m (between row 2 and 3), 0.27 ppm at 10 m (after row 5), and 0 ppm at 50 m (control).

Significantly lower NH3 concentrations were recorded when the trees were present downwind of the fans compared with when the trees were removed (16.45 vs. 19.35 ppm), suggesting a portion of the atmospheric NH3 was being held by the plants. This was further supported by a marked decrease in foliar N status of the plants with greater distance from the source.

It is therefore timely to consider the present situation in respect of power consumption within corporate IT systems, and to explore the potential avenues for reducing that consumption. In this paper, we will briefly overview the area of power usage in IT, before reporting on the outcomes of a specific project in which we explored the operation of the ""wake on LAN"" method in a real situation.","Energy savings in corporate IT; Power management; Wake on LAN","Electric power measurement; Electronic commerce; Energy management; Energy policy; Information technology; Local area networks; Wakes; Carbon reductions; Energy consumption.; Energy savings in corporate IT; Human activities; IT systems; Leadership teams; Power consumptions; Power management; Power requirements; Power usages; Present situations; Real situations; Environmental impact",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049150715

OMV is committed to identify opportunities in the renewable energy area which can be integrated into the group's business activities. To foster these activities the OMV Future Energy Fund was founded. OMV Austria produces app. 13.6 MM boe per year. For the production of 1 boe of hydrocarbons 0.049 boe are used. The usage of primary energy is calculated at 58.1 kWh for the production of 1 boe. OMV discovered with the well Strasshof T4 a sour gas field in the proximity of Vienna in April 2005. Acid gas injection is an integral part of the field development plan. Greenhouse gases emissions will be reduced by more than 150,000 t carbon dioxide per year compared to a conventional process. At present, OMV operates in Austria approx. 1,000 oil and natural gas wells. Instead of plugging and abandoning them after production, they can be used to produce geothermal energy. A comparison of the emissions between oil, gas and geothermal energy shows a CO2 reduction potential of up to 380 t (3,500 m well vs. fuel oil). OMV is the biggest investor and employer in the Weinviertel region in the Vienna basin. There is a strong commitment on the local level.

NAVFAC ESC categorized technologies that can be applied to climate change as mitigation, adaptation, and intervention. An essential element of the Navy's response to climate change is assessment of the potential impacts on Navy infrastructure. Adaptation technologies primarily focus on infrastructure changes to accommodate future climate conditions, including relocating facilities. Mitigation technologies seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are driving climate change, typically through energy conservation or adoption of alternative energy sources. NAVFAC ESC has also identified approaches for intervention technologies that seek to alter the impacts of climate change through such means as carbon sequestration and storm abatement. copyright.",,"Alternative energy source; California; Carbon sequestration; Climatic shifts; Disease vectors; Environmental issues; Environmental planning; Environmental programs; Environmental stewardship; Essential elements; Extreme weather events; Future climate; Global environment; IS assessment; National security; Naval facilities; Port Hueneme; Potential impacts; United States Navy; Electroslag process; Energy conservation; Environmental protection; Food supply; Forestry; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Leakage (fluid); Regulatory compliance; Sea level; Technology; Water resources; Facilities",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350126670

This development is predicated on the assumption that micro wind turbines have the potential to reduce built environment CO2 emissions. Current methods of estimating the wind speed are reported to over predict by approximately 2.0 m/s. The energy yields of a range of typical micro wind turbines (in the 0.4-2.5 kW size range) were estimated here using two wind speed datasets sited within 1 km of each other recorded with a temporal precision of 10 min. The annual energy yield of a 1.5 kW turbine was found to be 277 kWh and 2541 kWh for the two sites analysed indicating the problem with the current method of yield estimation. Between 33 and 55% of the electricity generated would be exported dependant on the dwelling's electrical demand.

Many studies investigating the ecosystem effects of global climate change have focused on arctic ecosystems because the Arctic is expected to undergo the earliest and most pronounced changes in response to increasing global temperatures, and arctic ecosystems are considerably limited by low temperatures and permafrost. In these nutrient limited systems, a warmer climate is expected to increase plant biomass production, primarily through increases in shrubs over graminoids and forbs. But, the influence of vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores has been largely absent in studies investigating the effects of vegetation responses to climate change, despite the fact that herbivory can have a major influence on plant community composition, biomass and nutrient cycling. Here, we present results from a multi-annual field experiment investigating the effects of vertebrate herbivory on plant biomass response to simulated climate warming in arctic Greenland. Results. The results after four years of treatments did not give any clear evidence of increased biomass of shrubs in response climate warming. Nor did our study indicate that vertebrate grazing mediated any increased domination of shrubs over other functional plant groups in response to warming. However, our results indicate an important role of insect outbreaks on aboveground biomass. Intense caterpillar foraging from a two-year outbreak of the moth Eurois occulta during two growing seasons may have concealed any treatment effects. However, there was some evidence suggesting that vertebrate herbivores constrain the biomass production of shrubs over graminoids and forbs. Conclusion. Although inconclusive, our results were likely constrained by the overwhelming influence of an unexpected caterpillar outbreak on aboveground biomass. It is likely that the role of large vertebrate herbivores in vegetation response to warming will become more evident as this experiment proceeds and the plant community recovers from the caterpillar outbreak. Due to the greater influence of invertebrate herbivory in this study, it is advisable to consider both the effect of invertebrate and vertebrate herbivores in studies investigating climate change effects on plant communities. © 2008 Pedersen and Post; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Eurois occulta; Hexapoda; Invertebrata; Lepidoptera; Vertebrata; animal; Arctic; article; biodiversity; biomass; bovids; cold climate; environmental monitoring; feeding behavior; growth, development and aging; moth; physiology; plant; reindeer; temperature; Animals; Arctic Regions; Biodiversity; Biomass; Cold Climate; Environmental Monitoring; Feeding Behavior; Moths; Plants; Reindeer; Ruminants; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55149101542

Eutrophic, polymictic Lake Ülemiste is characterized by a prevalence of high filamentous cyanobacteria biomass, rotifers in the zooplankton community, mature bream in the fish biomass, and a high density of planktivores (YOY perch). Several prerequisites for being a potential target for biomanipulation were identified, including (i) decreased external total phosphorus (TP) loading; and (ii) a sufficient stock of piscivorous fish in the lake. Prohibition of fishing should favour biomanipulation efforts. The potential for recolonization of macrophytes and large Daphnia species in Lake Ülemiste could be judged from historical data. The in-lake TP concentrations are within the limits that facilitate successful restoration. As phytoplankton biomass was significantly limited by phosphorus in Lake Ülemiste, its water quality improvement will be driven primarily by reduced nutrient concentrations, and then by zooplankton grazing. Internal TP loading and a new phytoplankton species community were assessed as major challenges for successful implementation of biomanipulation as a means of improving the water quality of Lake Ülemiste. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.","Biomanipulation; Drinking water reservoir; Water quality management","biomanipulation; biomass; capital city; drinking water; lake water; water management; water quality; zooplankton; Baltic States; Estonia; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Tallinn; Cyanobacteria; Daphnia; Hyperoglyphe porosa; Rotifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56549123123

São Paulo State, a Brazilian province, has the largest Brazilian energy demand and a net importer of this strategic input. State produces 49.3% of its energy needs, of which 99% are from renewable sources, including bioelectricity from sugar cane bagasse and hydro energy. In terms of energy consumption, 50% of the São Paulo consumption is covered from renewable, 33% from sugar cane products and 17% from hydropower, indicating a reasonable equilibrium. Focusing bioenergy, the province is responsible for 60 to 70% of Brazilian ethanol production, which truly makes the dispersed generation based on bioelectricity from bagasse a real alternative for power expansion, as an internal security of supply target. Concerning these factors the São Paulo Energy, Water & Sanitation Secretary (SP-EW&S) is developing the Energetic Matrix to cope with important issues including, technological & environmental boundaries, legal & regulatory aspects, and economical attractiveness. The bioelectricity from sugar cane bagasse is a good example of a new trend arrangement. Up until nineties the plants were operated as cogeneration biomass-fueled, providing mainly electricity, steam and heat for fermentation, and net exports were a by-product. Brazilian power sector reforms are providing new horizons, considering grid open-access and competitive trading. Currently sugar & ethanol sector in São Paulo has 1.7 GW installed capacity running in, from which around 50% (900MW.avg of energy) is externally traded. Up till 2015 there is a huge projected potential over 10 GW due to the following complementary factors: (i) expansion of sugar & ethanol sector around 20% in next years; (ii) implementation of ""Environmental Protocol for the Sugar & Ethanol Sector"" reducing carbon emissions by eliminating the practice of burning sugarcane leaves before harvest cycles, which in turn would mean gather and separate the entire above ground portion and leaves of the plant; (iii) retrofit of existing cogeneration assets meaning more efficiency in the process. Clearly there are energy gains, since local farmers are recognizing the economic benefit of waste to energy, recovering a ""low-tech"" means of carbon capture. The paper intends to analyze the bioelectricity focusing the sugar cane production chain, given São Paulo conditions. It will be treated, among others, aspects to qualify sugar cane as a ""sustainable agriculture"", linked to the competition of agricultural areas -food versus energy, the impact of the emissions in the harvest and electric generation and the perspectives of generation substitution for ethanol through cellulose hydrolysis process in R&D.","Bioenergy; Economics & Regulations; Sugarcane bagasse cogeneration; Sustainable agriculture","Bio-energy; Brazilian Power Systems; Cellulose hydrolysis; Dispersed Generation; Electric energy generation; Environmental boundaries; Sugar-cane bagasse; Sustainable agriculture; Agriculture; Bagasse; Cogeneration plants; Electrophysiology; Energy utilization; Environmental regulations; Ethanol; International trade; Laws and legislation; Plant expansion; Plants (botany); Sugar cane; Bioelectric phenomena",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876746893

In order to isolate causal climatic factors, it is very important to assess the response of seasonal variation of NPP to climate. In this paper, NPP in Xinjiang was estimated by NOAA/AVHRR Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. The impact of climatic factors (air temperature, precipitation and sunshine percentage) on seasonal variations of NPP was studied by time lag and serial correlation ageing analysis. The results showed that the NPP for different land cover types have a similar correlation with any one of the three climatic factors, and precipitation is the major climatic factor influencing the seasonal variation of NPP in Xinjiang. It was found that the positive correlation at 0 lag appeared between NPP and precipitation and the serial correlation ageing was 0 d in most areas of Xinjiang, which indicated that the response of NPP to precipitation was immediate. However, NPP of different land cover types showed significant positive correlation at 2 month lag with air temperature, and the impact of which could persist 1month as a whole. No correlation was found between NPP and sunshine percentage. © 2008 Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Climate; Geographic information system techniques; Net primary productivity; Remote sensing; Seasonal variation; Serial correlation ageing; Time lag","climate change; GIS; global change; NDVI; net primary production; NOAA satellite; remote sensing; seasonal variation; terrestrial ecosystem; article; biomass; China; climate; comparative study; geographic information system; geography; remote sensing; season; statistical model; weather; Biomass; China; Climate; Geographic Information Systems; Geography; Linear Models; Remote Sensing Technology; Seasons; Weather; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Xinjiang Uygur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57049116087

The increasing amounts of greenhouse gases, particularly CO 2 in the atmosphere, is believed to have induced climate change and global warming. With the ability to remove CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, forests play a critical role in the carbon cycle and carbon sequestration at both global and local scales. It is necessary to understand the relationship between forest soil carbon dynamics and carbon sequestration capacity, and the impact of forest management practices on soil CO2 efflux for sustainable carbon management in forest ecosystems. This paper reviews a number of current issues related to (1) carbon allocation, (2) soil respiration, and (3) carbon sequestration in the forest ecosystems through forest management strategies. The contribution made by forests and forest management in sequestrating carbon to reduce the CO2 concentration level in the atmosphere is now well recognized. The overall carbon cycle, carbon allocation of the above- and belowground compartments of the forests, soil carbon storage and soil respiration in forest ecosystems and impacts of forest management practices on soil respiration are described. The potential influences of forest soils on the buildup of atmospheric carbon are reviewed. © 2008 NRC Canada.","Carbon sequestration; CO2 concentration; Forest ecosystem; Greenhouse gas; Review","Climatology; Ecosystems; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Land use; Management; Photosynthesis; Soils; Atmospheric carbons; Carbon allocations; Carbon cycles; Carbon managements; Carbon sequestration; CO2 concentration; Concentration levels; Forest ecosystem; Forest harvesting; Forest management practices; Forest managements; Forest soils; Fossil fuel burning; Greenhouse gas; Human activities; Industrial revolutions; Land-use changes; Soil carbon storages; Soil CO; Soil respirations; Forestry; Carbon Dioxide; Chelation; Concentration; Ecosystems; Forest Management; Fossil Fuels; Greenhouse Gases; Land Use; Meteorology; Photosynthesis; Respiration; Soil Analysis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61449097814

Bio-fuels are an important technology for reducing the CO2 emission in transport. For fuels produced from biomass, various conversion routes are available that follow from the different types of biomass feedstock's. Although insights on technological and cost developments and the expected commercial availability of these bio-fuels are changing continuously, it can be stated that these bio-fuels will probably not be produced and applied on a commercial scale before 2010. Currently, only ethanol, (and its derivative ETBE) are applied on a commercial basis on the European market. They will remain the dominant bio-fuels in the coming decade, as alternative bio-fuel technologies are still in the development stage. At present, the biofuel producing countries in the European Union only have a small share in global production of bio-fuels, (&lt;6%). The main ethanol producers are the USA and Brazil. However, Europe is the most important producer of bio-diesel on the global market. Although the importance of the use of bio-fuels in transport has already been stressed in the EU White Paper on renewable sources of energy (1997) and the Green Paper on a European strategy for the security of energy supply (2000), this has not led to the development of concrete bio-fuel specific national policies in many EU Member States.","Bio-fuel; Biomass; Pyrolysis; Soil organic matter",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053064478

A two-energy equation model was employed to predict solid and gas phase temperatures. Governing equations were solved on a two-dimensional axisymmetric computational domain of 2.15 x 20 cm. An air-blast atomizer model was used to inject kerosene fuel spray on to the porous medium. Combustion in porous media was simulated by using a uniform volumetric heat source in the porous region. Numerical results were obtained with a commercial code Fluent 6.0. For a heat feedback rate of 1% of average heat input, the porous medium attained a temperature of 465 K. This data agreed well with experimental data obtained by infrared imaging. With an increase in heat feedback rate, the porous medium temperature also increased. Surface temperature distribution in porous media for different heat feedback rates was predicted. Results indicate that the transverse distribution was uniform within 1.5% of the mean value. Droplet diameter was smaller in spray core upstream of porous medium and increased radially due to the swirling action imparted to the atomizing air. Transverse vapor concentration results downstream of porous medium show that the distribution was uniform within 5% of the mean value, which demonstrates that porous medium uniformly distributes the fuel vapor-air mixture. The spatially homogeneous reactant mixture is important to achieve good combustion, reduce pollutant formation, and minimize instabilities in practical combustors. Effects of equivalence ratio and flame temperature on transverse vapor concentration profiles were also numerically studied. Porous media combustors could be used in gas turbine and industrial burner applications to reduce pollutant emissions.

The proposal foresees the inclusion of internal EU flights as well as external flights to and from the Union within the EU ETS. On 20 December 2007, EU Environment Ministers reached political agreement in the Environment Council on the basis of a new compromise text tabled by the Presidency. However, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), as well as various stakeholders, does not consider that the EU has the competence to include aviation within the EU ETS. A crucial point concerning the legality of including aviation in the EU ETS is the fact that Article 2(2) of the Kyoto Protocol states that the parties 'shall pursue limitation or reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol from aviation...working through the International Civil Aviation Organization...'.

The PEATLAND-VU model was used to simulate the emissions. The CH4 module of PEATLANDVU is based on the Walter-Heimann model. The first site is located in northeast Siberia, lndigirka lowlands, Kytalyk reserve (70° N, 147° E) in a continuous permafrost region with mean annual temperatures of - 14.3°C. The other site is Stordalen mire in the eastern part of Lake Torneträsk (68° N, 19° E) ten kilometres east of Abisko, northern Sweden. It is located in a discontinuous permafrost region. Stordalen has a sub arctic climate with a mean annual temperature of - 0.7°C. Model input consisted of observed temperature, precipitation and snow cover data. In all cases, modelled CH4 emissions show a direct correlation between variations in water table and soil temperature variations. The differences in CH4 emissions between the two sites are caused by different climate, hydrology, soil physical properties, vegetation type and NPP. For Kytalyk the simulated CH 4 fluxes show similar trends during the growing season, having average values for 2004 to 2006 between 1.29-2.09 mg CH4 m -2hr-1. At Stordalen the simulated fluxes show a slightly lower average value for the same years (3.52 mg CH4m -2Hr-1) than the observed 4.7 mg CH4 m -2 hr-1. The effect of the longer growing season at Stordalen is simulated correctly.Our study shows that modelling of arctic CH4 fluxes is improved by adding a relatively simple hydrological model that simulates the water table position from generic weather data. Our results support the generalization in literature that CH4 fluxes in northern wetland are regulated more tightly by water table than temperature. Furthermore, parameter uncertainty at site level in wetland CH4 process models is an important factor in large scale modelling of CH4 fluxes.",,"annual variation; arctic environment; comparative study; emission; growing season; methane; modeling; parameterization; permafrost; soil temperature; temperature effect; water table; wetland; Abisko; Eurasia; Europe; Norrbotten; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Siberia; Siberian Lowland; Stordalen Mire; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849155737

In all cases discussed here the Monte Carlo technique without self consistent field is driven to a much greater level of complexity than usually found in swarm studies. We discuss three conceptually quite different situations that require exact modelling by Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS). The first is the case of transport in gases where degree of dissociation is large and thereby radicals formed by the discharge may affect the transport coefficients. Based on recent calculations for electron CFX radical cross sections we calculated how transport coefficients would be affected by the presence of radicals in pure CF4 and CF4/Ar mixtures covering range of abundances often found in plasma etching devices. The second case studied here is modelling of thermalization of high energy electrons in the atmospheric gases as an attempt to provide the basis for detection of very high energy cosmic particles. In that case pressure dependent emission efficiency is studied as a function of electron energy and the system is developed to an arbitrary degree of secondary electron production. Finally we give some recent advances and current status of modelling of high E/N discharges operating in Townsend's regime in hydrogen where anomalous broadening was observed and explained by fast neutral excitation in both directions along and against the acceleration due to electric field. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65349130822

Special attention is paid to the dissemination of renewable power technologies following climate policy initiatives in Sweden and Eastern Europe. An overall conclusion is that carbon policy will affect new investments in renewable power technologies in both Sweden and Eastern Europe, but it is difficult to provide a comprehensive assessment of the future power generation technology mix. In the Swedish case, it is suggested that in general it is not certain that compliance with the Kyoto commitments implies substantial increases in renewable power sources. If, therefore, renewable power sources are favoured for reasons beyond climate policy, additional policy instruments will be needed. In the Eastern European case it is indicated that although it is clear that the Eastern European countries are not homogeneous in terms of CO2 abatement potential and costs, no single country emerges as particularly low-cost. This may have important implications for future JI/CDM activities. For instance, risk factors such as policy uncertainty and institutional obstacles may become crucial in determining the future allocation of JI/CDM projects across the region.",,"abatement cost; emissions trading; environmental policy; investment; Kyoto Protocol; power generation; renewable resource; risk factor; Eastern Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50549095111

The carbons are produced in a multi-step process from corncob, have surface areas of up to 3500 m 2/g, porosities of up to 0.8, and reversibly store, by physisorption, record amounts of methane and hydrogen. Current best gravimetric and volumetric storage capacities are: 250 g CH4/kg carbon and 130 g CH 4/liter carbon (199 V/V) at 35 bar and 293 K; and 80 g H 2/kg carbon and 47 g H2/liter carbon at 47 bar and 77 K. This is the first time the DOE methane storage target of 180 V/V at 35 bar and ambient temperature has been reached and exceeded. The hydrogen values compare favorably with the 2010 DOE targets for hydrogen, excluding cryogenic components. A prototype adsorbed natural gas (ANG) tank, loaded with carbon monoliths produced accordingly and currently undergoing a road test in Kansas City, is described. A preliminary analysis of the surface and pore structure is given that may shed light on the mechanisms leading to the extraordinary storage capacities of these materials. The analysis includes pore-size distributions from nitrogen adsorption isotherms; spatial organization of pores across the entire solid from small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS); pore entrances from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM); H2 binding energies from temperature-programmed desorption (TPD); and analysis of surface defects from Raman spectra. For future materials, expected to have higher H2 binding energies via appropriate surface functionalization, preliminary projections of H2 storage capacities based on molecular dynamics simulations of adsorption of H2 on graphite, are reported. © 2008 Materials Research Society.",,"Biocarbon; Life-cycle analysis; Materials Research Society; Molecular hydrogen; Multi-step; Nanoporous carbons; Storage materials; Storage systems; Surface areas; Automobile fuel tanks; Automobile parts and equipment; Automotive fuels; Fuel storage; Fuel tanks; Gas fuel storage; Gas industry; Gases; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Life cycle; Methane; Natural gas; Nonmetals; Nuclear fuel reprocessing; Energy conversion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349114385

Ltd, Level 3, 910 Pacific Highway, Gordon, NSW  2072, Australia","The Riverside development site at Tea Gardens, NSW is approximately 230 hectares in area. Riverside at Tea Gardens is subject to flooding from both the Myall River and from runoff from the local catchment. Sensitivity assessments of climate change were undertaken for the scenarios given in the 2007 DECC Guideline titled “Practical Consideration of Climate Change”. These scenarios include +0.18m, +0.55 m and +0.91 rises in sea level as well as 10%, 20% and 30% increase in rainfall intensities. The assessments of the impacts on Myall River flood levels of sea level rise and increases in rainfall intensities and impacts of rainfall increases on local flooding are outlined. As a results of these assessments it is proposed by the Developer to adopt an additional freeboard of 0.3 m for mimimum floor levels over and above Council's adopted minimum floor level of 2.6 m AHD in areas subject to inundation from the Myall River to avoid over floor flooding in a 100 yr ARI event under all climate change scenarios. The adoption of a minimum floor level of 2.9 m AHD for all homes in Riverside will provide all homes in the development with a far greater level of protection against climate change than a large number of existing properties in Tea Gardens. Elsewhere in the development consideration a minimum floor level of 0.5 m above the local 100 yr ARI flood level (under no climate change) would provide a minimum 0.22 m freeboard above the local 100 yr ARI flood level under a high climate change scenario. While under a high climate change scenario there would be increased inundation of a number of planned roads by up to 0.8 m (which would be still Low Hazard due to the expected very low velocity of flow on the fringes of the river flooding through the development) but would comply with the requirements for safe wading. Even under a high climate change scenario, planned roads would provide flood free egress via a number of roads for residents evacuating from threatened properties to higher ground on the northern and north western boundaries of the development. It is concluded that the case study demonstrates the need for planned new development in coastal areas to consider and respond to the potential flooding impacts of climate change. It is also concluded that the approach to considering climate change impacts on sea level and on rainfall intensities adopted in NSW is practical and based on the precautionary principle because whatever climate change scenario is adopted may be exceeded in the future as climate change continues. © 2008 Hydraulics.","Climate change; Local flooding; Rainfall; River flooding; Sea level rise","Catchments; Floods; Floors; Highway planning; Hydraulics; Rain; Rivers; Sea level; Tea; Climate change impact; Climate change scenarios; Low velocities; Precautionary principle; Rainfall intensity; River flooding; Sea level rise; Western boundary; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091966563

Therefore, it is necessary to preliminarily identify the areas most prone to this type of process, in order to pursue a territorial planning with consciousness of hazards and risks. Rock-fall hazard analysis over wide territories is anyhow rather difficult, because many variables have to be taken into account (i.e., fracturing of rock masses, presence of water etc.) that are difficult to identify at that scale. Hence the necessity to identify methodologies of analysis capable of reproducing the complex processes that are involved in rock-fall occurrence and propagation and to preliminarily identify the areas most susceptible to this type of hazard. Taking into account previous works carried out on this topic, different simulation models, both empirical and kinematic, have been analysed in order to assess their suitability (in terms of quality, time and costs) when applied over wide territories. The most suitable model was found to be an empirical one that assumes the dissipation of rock-fall energy proportional to the distance reached by the falling rock mass. This model has been used, after a specific calibration, with reference to two different study areas characterised by different geological and morpho-climatic characteristics, in order to assess its applicability and validate the quality of the results. The study areas are located in the Dolomites and in the northern Apennines (Italy). The comparison of the results obtained with respect to the two study sites has shown that the empirical model selected can be an efficient analys S method to obtain reliable results over wide territories, indepen dendy from the geological and morpho-climatic characteristics of a certain study site.","Apennines; Dolomites; Empirical models; Italy; Rock falls; Runout","calibration; comparative study; dolomite; empirical analysis; hazard assessment; kinematics; mountain; risk assessment; rockfall; Apennines; Eurasia; Europe; Italy; Southern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-59049085444

Here, we present a review of first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory, focusing in particular on i) several mechanisms that are predicted to destroy half-metallicity and ii) magneto-optical properties such as the Kerr rotation. We show that defect-induced states at the Fermi level in Co-based Heusler-alloys such as Co2 MnSican drastically reduce the degree of spin-polarization, pointing to the necessity of keeping point-defects under control during experimental growth. In the context of spin-injection into mainstream semiconductors, interface states are also predicted to be induced by the junction between a full-Heusler and GaAs. A careful analysis of the magneto-optical Kerr effect is performed for several Co-based full-Heusler alloys. Although the size of the Kerr rotation is found to be of the order of 0.5° and therefore not technologically appealing, we show that first-principles calculations can be efficiently used as a tool to predict novel half-metals with large Kerr angles. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2008.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56349168119

Objective and unambiguous methods of defining the demand of economies for emission of greenhouse gases and also principles of dividing emission limits among the individual sectors of the economy or enterprises have not yet been worked so far. The consequence of basing European climate policy on the emissions trade is introduction to the legal system of the Union of the instrument significantly different from instruments applied so far, and at the same time rejection of solutions already functioning in Member Countries without regard on their efficiency. System of the instruments of the environment protection based on ecological taxes which was and is effective system, still working in Poland is the example. The confirmation of this fact is essential improvement of the environment condition in past twenty years, the scale of pro-ecological enterprises, and also fulfilling by Poland - as one of few countries - obligations of Kioto Protocol. The main foundations of the emission trade system as the main instrument of the realization of European Union climate the policy were created in the period before extending the Union. As a result it does not take into account conditions connected with the considerable developmental distance dividing new and old member countries. On the one hand levelling of developmental disproportions in new member countries, which is the aim of the coherence policy, requires many investment activities, and this causes inevitable growth of greenhouse gases emission. Meanwhile on the other hand - old member countries because of the higher level of the development have bigger possibilities of funding activities connected with reduction of emissions. Emission limitations forced by the Committee decisions cause the limitation of developmental possibilities of less developed countries, and this is contrary to principles of the Union coherence policy. At the same time they cause real threat of occurring phenomena of production transfer beyond European Union, which will cause negative economic, social and ecological consequences.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052710294

This is due to its great potentiality in the analysis of solid samples. On the way to contributing to the development of the technique, we in this work studied the laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) in conditions of micro ablation for future studies of coverings and micro crates analysis. Craters between 2 and 7 micrometers of diameter were made using an Nd-YAG nanosecond laser in their fundamental emission of 1064 nm. In order to create these craters we use an objective lens of long distance work and 0.45 of numerical aperture. The atomic emission versus the energy of the laser and its effect on the size of craters was study. We found that below 3 micrometers although there was evidence of material removal by the formation of a crater, it was no detectable atomic emission for our instruments. In order to try to understand this, curves of size of crater versus plasma temperature using the Boltzmann distribution graphs taking the Copper emission lines in the visible region were made. In addition calibration curves for Copper and aluminum were made in two different matrices; one of it was a Cu/Zn alloy and the other a Zinc Matrix. The atomic lines Cu I (521.78 nm) and Al I (396.15 nm) was used. From the Calibration curve the analytical limit of detection and other analytical parameters were obtained. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.","Laser ablation; Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy; Micro- Craters",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43649100787

The identification of a well-defined limit temperature allows extinguishing concentrations for buoyancy-dominated methane flames to be predicted. Predicted extinguishing volume fractions are shown to be in good agreement with experimental results for opposed flow methane flames. It is further demonstrated that the calculations provide reliable estimates of relative thermal agent extinguishing effectiveness for both methane coflow flames and liquid-fueled heptane flames burning in a surrounding coflow, even though the required volume fractions of a given agent can differ substantially from those predicted for the opposed flow methane flames. This is the case despite the fact that the extinction mechanisms for the opposed-flow (global flame extinction due to flame cooling) and coflow (blow off of an edge flame stabilized in the local flow field by a reaction kernel) flames are believed to be different. The results of the calculations demonstrate the dependence of extinguishment mechanism on the local flow fields at the flame and the need for thermal agents to lower the temperature of the flame zone to a well defined limit temperature.

In this paper, we consider a diesel engine equipped with an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve and two turbochargers in series. The low pressure turbine is of fixed geometry and the high pressure turbine is a variable geometry turbine (VGT). The control objective is to regulate air-to-fuel (AFR), EGR exhaust fraction and the power ratio of the two turbines by coordinated manipulation of the EGR and VGT actuators. Unlike engines with a single turbocharger, in two-staged turbocharged engines, regulation of the power ratio of the turbines is also needed in order to adequately define the equilibrium point of the engine airpath. First, a mean value engine model (MVEM) is proposed to physically describe the air path dynamics. With rich excitation of the controls in the MVEM, we identify several linear models for different areas of the engine speed-torque envelope. Local Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controllers are designed, with each of them enabled within a specific operating area.

The basic pilot plant was developed with the idea of applying carbon dioxide in order to maintain the carbonate equilibria in water, pumped from under the ground. The optimal content of this natural component in underground water, used in urban areas for different purposes (e.g. drinking water, heating systems etc), simultaneously prevents corrosion and precipitated mineral deposits. The adaptation of an existing pilot plant started with operational testing and preliminary measurements. An appropriate sensor system for the online monitoring of the tap water's heating process measuring parameters such as the temperature, the concentration of dissolved carbondioxide, the conductivity and the pH value was built in. Different amounts of carbon dioxide were applied during the two experimental stages. The composition of the water was regularly analysed using automatic titration and ionic chromatography. The gas-dosing control in the first phase was volumetric. Due to an observed inaccuracy in the gasdosing system, the volumetric dosing control was replaced with a system for the mass control of the introduced gas. Closing the system was considered to be suitable, as the water composition remained almost constant during the entire experiment. Improvements to the gas-dosing control and the closing of the system were carried out in the final phase of the pilot plant's adaptation. Further measurements were made in different seasons to test the seasonal influences on underground water's composition and the efficiency of the carbon dioxide supply.","Carbon dioxide; Carbonate equilibria; Drinking water quality; Pilot plant; Precipitation; Scale; Underground water",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859344246

Vacuum arc discharges exhibit certain regularities in their behavior that allow the performance of these thrusters to be described by simple semiempirical models. Empirical data on the current density distribution, charge state and velocity of ions created in vacuum arc discharges, and the total cathode mass loss rate are used to develop expressions for the expected thrust and specific impulse as a function of thruster geometry. Thruster electrical efficiency and thrust-to-power ratio are calculated based on measurements of the burning voltage for given thruster operating parameters. Estimates of achievable thruster performance for a wide range of cathode materials are presented. This analysis suggests that thrusters using vacuum arc sources can be operated efficiently with a range of propellant options that gives great flexibility in specific impulse. In addition, the efficiency of plasma production in these devices appears to be largely independent of scale because the metal vapor is ionized within tens of micrometers of the cathode electron emission sites, so this approach is well suited for micropropulsion. © 2008 IEEE.","Anodes; Cathodes; Discharges; Geometry; Plasma arc devices; Plasmas; Propulsion; Space vehicle propulsion; Vacuum arcs","Anodes; Cathodes; Cavity resonators; Computational geometry; Electric discharges; Electric network analysis; Electrodes; Electron tubes; Plasma sources; Plasmas; Propulsion; Thickness measurement; Vacuum; Vacuum applications; Vapors; Vehicles; Discharges; Geometry; Plasma arc devices; Space vehicle propulsion; Vacuum arcs; Vacuum technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-59749086078

Almond harvesting has been cited as the highest dust-discharging field crop agricultural activity in the San Joaquin Valley, the largest almond producer in the United States. Almonds and other nuts are harvested by collecting them from the orchard floor and pneumatically separating them from other orchard debris. In current industrial gas-particle separating devices, significant power is required due to the high pressure drop necessary to sufficiently separate fine particles from the flow. For mobile equipment, the power and size demands prohibit most conventional designs. In this project Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modeling was applied to improve a nut harvester design to reduce the emission of particulate matter while maintaining the quality of the nut product. CFD modeling provided a convenient way to optimize the essential parameters with significantly lower cost than physical prototyping. This paper presents a numerical study of gas-particle flow using Realizable k-ε Model to simulate the gas flow and Stochastic Lagrangian Discrete Phase Model to track the particles using a commercial CFD product. The simulated results were validated with the experimental measurements on a harvester. The results show a good agreement between the simulated and the measured values of pressure and velocity.","Almond harvest; CFD; Gas-particle flow; Particulate air pollution; Turbulence","Air quality; Computational fluid dynamics; Crops; Debris; Fluid dynamics; Gas dynamics; Gases; Harvesters; Harvesting; Landforms; Models; Orchards; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Permanent magnets; Stochastic models; Turbulence; Almond harvest; CFD; Gas-particle flow; Particulate air pollution; Leakage (fluid)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63049100153

The role of geography is introduced from three viewpoints: the existence of regional markets, the fact that EU producers may operate multiple plants across these regions, and the possibility of production capacity constraints. A typical EU state is divided into a coastal region which is initially exposed to international competition, and an inland region which is initially protected. Assuming pure auctioning of EU Allowances and a range of CO2 prices up to €50/t, our model predicts a large increase of imports into the coastal region. Consequences for the inland producers include reduced attractiveness of the coastal market, as well as increased competition from coastal producers and from non-EU imports. The model includes a number of simplifications and therefore does not claim to offer definitive predictions, but our results do suggest that an increase in non-EU imports could feasibly offset more than 70% of the decrease in EU cement sector emissions. The likely impact on producer profits is considered for each region, and the advantages and disadvantages of potential mitigating policy measures are reviewed for either the EU Allowance allocation process or border adjustments on cement products. © 2008 Earthscan.","Carbon leakage; Cement; Clinker; Competitiveness; EU Emissions Trading Scheme","cement; competition (economics); competitiveness; construction industry; emissions trading; European Union; oligopoly; policy strategy; profitability; spatial analysis; trade-environment relations; Eurasia; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54749141616

This paper introduces a new approach for mapping large intact forest landscapes (IFL), defined as an unbroken expanse of natural ecosystems within areas of current forest extent, without signs of significant human activity, and having an area of at least 500 km2. We have created a global IFL map using existing fine-scale maps and a global coverage of high spatial resolution satellite imagery. We estimate the global area of IFL within the current extent of forest ecosystems (forest zone) to be 13.1 million km2 or 23.5% of the forest zone. The vast majority of IFL are found in two biomes: Dense Tropical and Subtropical Forests (45.3%) and Boreal Forests (43.8%). The lowest proportion of IFL is found in Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests. The IFL exist in 66 of the 149 countries that together make up the forest zone. Three of them Canada, Russia, and Brazil-contain 63.8% of the total IFL area. Of the world's IFL area, 18.9% has some form of protection, but only 9.7% is strictly protected, i.e., belongs to IUCN protected areas categories I-III. The world IFL map presented here is intended to underpin the development of a general strategy for nature conservation at the global and regional scales. It also defines a baseline for monitoring deforestation and forest degradation that is well suited for use with operational and cost-effective satellite data.

The primary objective of Smart Energy 2020 is to achieve a 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from current levels by 2020. Smart Energy 2020 is designed to accelerate local, ""smart"" distributed generation, with an emphasis on energy efficiency, commercial PV systems, and combined heat and power installations. Implementation of Smart Energy 2020 will: 1) maximize GHG reduction, 2) enhance energy security by minimizing dependence on natural gas for power generation, and 3) greatly expand local clean peak generation capacity to minimize reliance on power imports during periods of high demand when competition for these power imports is greatest. Smart Energy 2020 calls for the addition of 2,040 MW of rooftop solar, with an emphasis on large commercial installations. It also includes the addition of 700 MW of clean distributed generation from combined heat and power (CHP) sources. Under Smart Energy 2020, renewable energy resources will provide 50 percent of San Diego County's energy demand in 2020. The San Diego Solar Initiative is the cornerstone of the Smart Energy 2020 strategy. The San Diego Solar Initiative is a $1.5 billion PV incentive program. The PV systems will be equipped with sufficient battery storage to allow full use of this 2,040 MW during peak demand periods. A limited San Diego Solar Initiative with a reduced PV incentive budget of $700 million is also evaluated. Under current cost allocation policy, San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) customers will be charged only 10 percent, or $700 million, of the $7 billion lifecycle cost of the proposed Sunrise Powerlink (SPL) transmission project. A $700 million San Diego Solar Initiative will provide for 920 MW of PV capacity by 2020 equipped with sufficient battery storage for reliable peaking power duty. Smart Energy 2020 increases local peak generation in 2020 by 2,670 MW beyond the level of local peak generation achieved in the SDG&E plan. The projected peak demand in SDG&E service territory, following aggressive implementation of cost-effective energy efficiency and demand response measures, would be 3,500 MW. The greatly increased amount of local peak power generation capacity under Smart Energy 2020 would eliminate the need to build new transmission to provide reliability during periods of peak power demand. Under Smart Energy 2020, new residential and commercial buildings would incorporate state-of-the-art green building principles and sufficient rooftop solar to address expected electric energy consumption. These building would be net zero energy consumers from the standpoint of strategic energy planning.",,"Airconditioning systems; Battery storage; Combined heat and power; Combined heat and power installations; Commercial building; Commercial installation; Cost allocation; Current levels; Demand response; E-services; Efficiency measure; Electric energy consumption; Energy consumer; Energy demands; Energy plan; Energy planning; Energy security; Green building design; Green buildings; Greenhouse gas reductions; High demand; Incentive programs; Lifecycle costs; Monitor and control; Natural gas fired power plants; New constructions; Peak demand; Peak generation; Peak power; Photovoltaic panels; Powerlink; Primary objective; PV system; San Diego; Smart grid; Transmission projects; Cost accounting; Distributed power generation; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; International trade; Marketing; Natural gas; Office buildings; Power generation; Smart power grids; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868629216

The major rivers of the country contribute to almost 85% of the freshwater resources and provide irrigation to more than 50% of the land under agriculture. Changes in climate, government policies, and the non-scientific exploitation of water resources generally, and over exploitation of groundwater resources have led to inefficient management of water resources. It is time that the algorithms required to effectively evaluate and quantify local water resources, which incorporate the heterogeneities in terms of hydrological variables at small and medium scales, were developed. Based on the experience gained in understanding the large river basins on a regional scale, both the local and the central governments have adopted the concept of micro basins to handle water resources. The water quantity and quality variations relative to the rainfall and hydrogeological conditions of the country illustrate the need for more scientific management of water resources.

Most distribution models predicting species responses to climate change include climate variables and occasionally topographic and edaphic parameters, rarely are biotic interactions included. Here, we incorporate biotic interactions into niche models to predict suitable habitat for species under altered climates. We constructed and evaluated niche models for an endangered butterfly and a threatened bird species, both are habitat specialists restricted to semiarid shrublands of southern California. To incorporate their dependency on shrubs, we first developed climate-based niche models for shrubland vegetation and individual shrub species. We also developed models for the butterfly's larval host plants. Outputs from these models were included in the environmental variable dataset used to create butterfly and bird niche models. For both animal species, abiotic-biotic models outperformed the climate-only model, with climate-only models over-predicting suitable habitat under current climate conditions. We used the climate-only and abiotic-biotic models to calculate amounts of suitable habitat under altered climates and to evaluate species' sensitivities to climate change. We varied temperature (+0.6, +1.7, and +2.8°C) and precipitation (50%, 90%, 100%;, 110%, and 150%) relative to current climate averages and within ranges predicted by global climate change models. Suitable habitat for each species was reduced at all levels of temperature increase. Both species were sensitive to precipitation changes, particularly increases. Under altered climates, including biotic variables reduced habitat by 68-100% relative to the climate-only model. To design reserve systems conserving sensitive species under global warming, it is important to consider biotic interactions, particularly for habitat specialists and species with strong dependencies on other species. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.","Biotic interactions; Climate change; Climate envelope; Endangered species; Euphydryas editha quino; Niche model; Polioptila californica californica; Southern California; Species distributions","biotic factor; bird; butterfly; climate change; climate conditions; endangered species; global warming; habitat structure; modeling; niche; California; North America; United States; Animalia; Aves; Euphydryas editha; Polioptila californica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54449086865

Gaseous energy sources, like natural and bio gas should become an essential fundament as fuel, which offer lower CO 2 and pollutant emission even because of their chemical composition, higher energy density and knocking resistance. The research within the project CNG600 was focused on the development of a monofucl CNG standard van with an operation range of more than 600 km. The use of new simulation and experimental methods, the optimization of the manual gear shift powertrain, application of a light weight storage system and new gas valve technology lead to extremely low CO 2 emission of about 120 g/km. The gas system of the vehicle was developed for monofucl operation. The methane storage system was extended, which resulted in increased fuel mass in the vehicle. The application of low weight pressure vessels made of composite materials helped to keep the overall vehicle mass low. The gas system was equipped with a new valve technology and separated in high pressure, middle pressure and low pressure sections resulting in an overall optimized system for an automotive application. The vehicle longitudinal performance and fuel consumption were simulated during the development process. Consequently, necessary drive train improvements were defined to ensure lower fuel consumptions in city as well as on highway driving routes. In order to support the fuel efficiency of the propulsion system by low power demand of the vehicle, driving resistance minimization measures were implemented as well. The developed concept was applied on a standard van and realized as prototype. Finally, real world measurements conducted with the prototype vehicle on different driving routes supported the validation of the expected results. Under different driving conditions the CO 2 emissions stayed on a very low level.","CNG-Vehicle; Monofuel; Real-world; Simulation","Automotive applications; Chemical compositions; CNG-Vehicle; Development process; Drive train; Driving conditions; Energy source; European Countries; Experimental methods; Fuel efficiency; Fuel mass; Gas systems; Gas valves; Gear-shifts; High pressure; Higher energy density; Light weight; Low level; Low Power; Low pressures; Methane storage; Monofuel; Operation range; Optimized system; Pollutant emission; Propulsion system; Prototype vehicles; Real-world; Simulation; Storage systems; Valve technology; Vehicle mass; Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Fuel consumption; Fuel storage; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866095303

GmbH, Austria","Bio fuels are already used as additive to conventional fuels due to their nearly closed CO 2cycle. However, nowadays a share of about 5% of the fuel is substituted by bio fuels. In order to reach national CO 2 emission reduction targets as formulated in the Kyoto agreement increased bio fuel shares are considered. Thus a fuel blend with a share of 10% bio fuel was investigated in high efficient propulsions systems. The measurements were conducted with reference fuels and reference fuel blended with a bio fuel share of 10%. For the test drives representative routes of 77 km total length in the area of Vienna were defined, which include sections with significantly different driving conditions. Furthermore test drives at different constant speeds on freeway sections were carried out. So gained measurement results were therefore based on thousands of detailed measurements sets, which were averagely weighted. The chosen test vehicles were equipped with the new ultra compact On-Board Measurement System (OBM) to determine the exhaust mass emissions in real time. The measurement method is based on modal analysis of the emission concentrations in the tailpipe of the vehicle. For the investigations in real world traffic two premium class SUVs, one with a Diesel engine and automatic transmission and one with a gasoline hybrid system were chosen. It is to state in general that the CO 2 and pollutant emissions were dependant on the propulsion system of the vehicle. For the hybrid SUV in comparison to the SUV with Diesel engine and automatic gearbox, 30% lower CO 2 emissions on city routes were measured. The nitrous oxide emissions of the different propulsion systems were determined in detail as well. The application of the fuel blend in the different vehicles and propulsion systems with 10% bio fuel share, lead to diversified results. On city routes a reduction in CO 2 emissions in the conventional propulsion system was observed, whereas for the hybrid vehicle an increase was measured. On freeway routes the results were the other way round, the fuel consumption of the Diesel SUV increased. The fuel consumption of the hybrid SUV was slightly decreased. In full load tests, the gasoline hybrid vehicle showed lowered acceleration performance and the Diesel powered SUV increased CO 2 emissions.","Bio fuels; Real-world measurement; SUV","Acceleration performance; Automatic gearboxes; Automatic transmission; Constant speed; Conventional fuel; Conventional propulsion; Driving conditions; Emission concentration; Emission reduction; Exhaust mass; Fuel blends; Full-load; Kyoto agreements; Light duty vehicles; Measurement methods; Measurement results; Nitrous oxide emissions; On-board measurements; Pollutant emission; Propulsion system; Real time; Real-world emission; SUV; Test drive; Test vehicle; Total length; Carbon dioxide; Diesel engines; Emission control; Gasoline; Hybrid systems; Hybrid vehicles; Land vehicle propulsion; Modal analysis; Nitrogen oxides; Fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866129129

Raman redshifts of 2-4 cm-1 and shorter phonon lifetimes for the Bi0.8 Ce0.2 FeO3 film might be related to anharmonic interactions among Bi-O, Ce-O, (Bi, Ce)-O, and Fe-O bonds in the distorted oxygen octahedron. Compared to the pure counterparts, the dielectric and ferroelectric properties of the Bi0.8 Ce0.2 FeO3 film are improved due to the decreased oxygen vacancies by the stabilized oxygen octahedron. Current density values for the BFO and Bi0.8 Ce0.2 FeO3 film capacitors are 9.89× 10-4 and 5.86× 10-5 A/ cm2 at 10 V, respectively. The current density-applied voltage characteristics indicate that the main conduction mechanism for the BCFO capacitors is the interface-controlled Schottky emission. Both the in-plane and out-of-plane magnetization-magnetic field hysteresis loops reveal that the saturation magnetization values of the BCFO films increase with increasing the Ce concentration. The enhanced magnetic properties for the BCFO films might be attributed to the presence of Fe2+ caused by oxygen vacancies, the suppressed spiral spin structure, and/or the increased canting angle induced by Ce doping. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",,"Binding energy; Capacitance; Capacitors; Cerium; Cerium compounds; Colloids; Concentration (process); Current voltage characteristics; Dielectric devices; Electric equipment; Fluorine; Gelation; Hysteresis; Hysteresis loops; Magnetic fields; Magnetic materials; Magnetic properties; Magnets; Microstructure; Oxygen; Saturation magnetization; Semiconducting bismuth compounds; Semiconducting silicon compounds; Silicon; Thick films; Thin films; Vacancies; Anharmonic interactions; Applied voltages; Binding energy regions; Canting angles; Ce concentrations; Conduction mechanisms; Dielectric and ferroelectric properties; Electrical and magnetic properties; Film capacitors; Film shifts; Glass substrates; Oxygen octahedrons; Phonon lifetimes; Red shifts; Schottky emissions; Sol - gels; Spiral spin structures; Oxygen vacancies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55249103877

PM10 and PM2.5 daily levels varied between 50&amp;ndash;56μg/m3 and 24&amp;ndash;46μg/m3 at the urban sites, 22&amp;ndash;35μg/ m3 and 13&amp;ndash;25μg/m3 at the rural sites, and 75μg/m3 and 31μg/m3 at the industrial hotspot, lower than those recorded at some Asian mega-cities and similar to those recorded at other Latin American cities. At the urban sites, hourly PM2.5 and PM1 concentrations showed a marked impact of road traffic emissions (at rush hours), with levels of coarse PM remaining elevated during daytime. At the suburban and rural sites different PM daily patterns were registered according to the influence of the pollution plume from MCMA, and also of local soil resuspension. The speciation studies showed that mineral matter accounted for 25&amp;ndash;27% of bulk PM10 at the urban sites and a higher proportion (up to 43%) at the suburban and rural sites. This pattern is repeated in PM2.5, with 15% at urban and 28% at suburban and rural sites. Carbonaceous compounds accounted for a significant proportion at the urban and industrial sites (32&amp;ndash;46% in PM 10, and 51&amp;ndash;55% in PM2.5), markedly reduced at the suburban and rural sites (16&amp;ndash;23% in PM10, and 30% in PM2.5). The secondary inorganic aerosols accounted for 10&amp;ndash;20% of bulk PM10 at urban, suburban, rural and industrial sites, with a higher proportion (40%) at the industrial background site. A relatively high proportion of nitrate in rural sites was present in the coarse fraction. Typically anthropogenic elements (As, Cr, Zn, Cu, Pb, Sn, Sb, Ba, among others) showed considerably high levels at the urban sites; however levels of particulate Hg and crustal trace elements (Rb, Ti, La, Sc, Ga) were generally higher at the suburban site. Principal component analysis identified three major common factors: crustal, regional background and road traffic.

We interpret soil together with its plant cover as primary climate modifier for organisms living on, and within it. At the same time evaporating soil together with its transpiring vegetation is affecting the climate, and functioning as secondary climate modifier in context of bioclimatology. Selected Hungarian studies are used to highlight four primary and three secondary soil modifier actions connected to bioclimatology. Both primary and secondary soil modifier roles coupled mainly to soil hydro-physical properties. The first primary soil climate modifier action is the dew formation in the surface of sandy soils. As dew 80 mm of water can annually be transported from the subsoil to soil surface. Positive water resource value of dew is still not completely accepted. The second primary soil climate modifier example presents different amounts of usable soil moisture resource in two oak forest habitats with different species composition of herbs. In the third primary soil example the microclimate of the wetter habitat with deeper soil and denser herb vegetation of the oak forest - estimated by inverse modelling - showed higher shading, air moisture content and lower soil coverage than that of dry one. In the fourth primary soil modifier example forest hydrology is quantified for a Scots pine forest. Amount of transpiration, evaporation, interception, and change in the soil water storage were quantified and modelled. As secondary soil climate modifier role CO2 emitting of different plant production forms and land-uses is shown. Estimated CO2 production burning fuels for soil and plant cultivation is one to threefold of the organic extensive and intensive plant production farm consecutively in 2001. For the estimative calculations cost data of the farms are used. Amount of CO2 fixed in the crop biomass is also one to threefold as estimated with the regional scale formula of CEEMA (Canadian Economic and Emission Model for Agriculture). Two secondary soil modifier examples of soil texture and land use pattern's influence on local weather phenomena and near surface atmospheric processes as storm move and development are presented yet. Both studies demonstrate the significance of site-specific soil hydraulic parameters - as field capacity, usable and actual water storage - in formation of the local weather through the soil evaporation and plant transpiration in modelling studies. Of course variety of soil's role is much wider as the examples show and even it is not known completely at present. Soil's role in bioclimatology as new discipline will expectably be formulated in the future.","Evaporation; Soil hydraulic parameters; Stand microclimate; Storm formation; Transpiration",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947762691

A conversion to a diesel fleet of passenger vehicles using a synthetic diesel fuel generated with biomass would provide the most efficient fuel/vehicle mix for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and cost/km using a fully sustainable feedstock (switch grass).

The product gas stream contains a significant amount of methane and has a high calorific value. The presence of steam during the traditional hydrogasification reaction significantly increases the rate of methane formation. The efficiency of the process and the product gas composition are governed by the feedstock composition (H20/Feed and H2/C ratios), temperature, pressure and residence time. The product gas stream from a steam hydrogasifier can be reformed to generate synthesis gas (H2 and CO) that can be used in Gas to Liquid processes. Gasification of co-mingled coal-biomass feedstocks offers several advantages such as the reduction in the net CO2 emissions from the process. In this study, steam hydrogasification of coal-wood mixtures at various ratios have been performed in a batch reactor. Coal from the state of Utah and cedar wood have been used as the feedstock. The carbon conversions were measured at 700 and 800C at a H20/Feed ratio of 2. Effects of water and hydrogen were also investigated. The results demonstrate that the carbon conversion depends on the reaction temperature and the ratio of coal to wood in the feed does not influence the conversion. The carbon conversion varies from 70-80 % at 800C and 50-60 % at 700C. The data also show that the relative composition of CH4, CO and CO2 vary with the coal to wood ratio. The results show that the percentage of CO in the outlet gas composition increases with the increase in the amount of wood in the feed.

Lower Manhattan is one of the largest business districts in the nation, and the two projects - the South Ferry Terminal Station and the Fulton Street Transit Center - will improve transit access to, and help to revitalize, downtown Manhattan. With dozens of large-scale projects in the planning and construction stages in Lower Manhattan, many having lengthy and overlapping construction periods, MTA CC has aggressively implemented Environmental Performance Commitments (EPCs), developed in conjunction with other agencies building in Lower Manhattan. Heightened community awareness of air quality issues in Lower Manhattan has made the clean diesel emissions program one of the most important of the EPCs to implement. The U.S. EPA is using MTA CCs clean diesel emissions program as a model of success to induce its implementation in other areas of the country. The clean diesel emissions program includes use of Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) fuel, use of Tier 2 engines and diesel particulate filters (DPF) on all off-road construction engines of 50 horsepower (hp) or greater. MTA CC worked closely with retrofit vendors, equipment/engine dealers, rental agencies, and contractors to implement and manage this program. Between the two projects almost 150 pieces of equipment have been eligible for the retrofit technology and an approximate 86 percent compliance rate has been maintained. Given that these measures reduce particulate matter emissions by more than 90 percent, and that construction diesel equipment is a significant contributor to poor air quality, the program provides significant air quality benefits to Lower Manhattan.

One way to reduce the consumption is to charge the engine with the auxiliaries only in its most efficient operating points. Another way is to separate the auxiliaries completely from the propulsion engine. This may reduce the main engines' fuel consumption by 12 %. But now the auxiliary power has to be provided by some additional power supply system (APU - Auxiliary Power Unit). Possible technical approaches are a fuel cell of the PEM- or SOFC-type, a second ICe, or a steam engine. The drawbacks and benefits of such concepts result from the energy requirements of the vehicle as expressed largely through the driving cycle but also through other factors like air conditioning, electric loads independent from the cycle, type and size of energy storing devices in the vehicle, weight of the APU-system, its efficiency, ramp up behaviour, idling losses etc. In sum, this results in a quite complex optimisation problem. To become able to systematically design such systems, a vehicle model has been developed which represents all relevant features and their time dependent energy demands. This holistic energy flow vehicle model was created in a modular way, which allows to set up component networks in different topologies and different sizes of components in a given topology. The models arc implemented in Modelica 2.2 and the simulation runs under Dymola 6.4. This is an object-oriented modelling tool. A concrete model is created by linking of more fundamental objects which arc modelled with their input and output data connected by their internal properties represented by the underlying physics. A suitable set of algebraic differential equation is automatically set up and solved. Energy flows in a real medium van where recorded over a large variety of different driving cycles (such as urban, extra urban and freeway cycles), differing from conventional cycles. The operation of the auxiliaries was monitored in detail. These recordings where used as a basis to model energy demand in the simulations. This gives the possibility to perform an in-depth analysis of the power taken up by the auxiliaries. With this information (total amount of energy, average power, peak power) it is possible to ""design"" an optimized APU-system for a given size of passenger car and type of usage. Due to the modular structure of the simulation model, variants of APU-systems can be plugged in and simulated easily. It can be proven by simulation, whether a certain APU fits the requirements or not. At least, a prognosis about the consumption reduction potential can be given according to vehicle type and usage.","Autonomic air conditioning; Auxiliary power unit; Electrification of vehicle auxiliaries; Energy management; Fuel consumption","Algebraic differential equation; Auxiliary power; Auxiliary power units; Average power; Concrete model; Different sizes; Driving cycle; Electrification of vehicle auxiliaries; Energy demands; Energy flow; Energy requirements; In-depth analysis; Input and outputs; Its efficiencies; Modelica; Modular structures; Object oriented modelling; Operating points; Optimisations; Peak power; Power supply; Propulsion engine; Reduction potential; Set-up components; Simulation model; Time dependent; Vehicle model; Vehicle types; Air conditioning; Auxiliary power systems; Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Differential equations; Electric power systems; Electric utilities; Energy management; Fuel consumption; Optimization; Propulsion; Topology; Vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866060168

Hovensa is anticipating that heating oil will have individual state regulation reductions rather than a federal change in sulfur levels and are using a 2012-2013 time frame for when the first reductions will be made from 2000-wt-ppm to 500-wt-ppm sulfur with the expectation that the sulfur level will eventually be reduced to ULSD levels. Hovensa also anticipate jet fuel and kerosene will eventually go down to USLD levels in the next 5-10 yr. Sulfur levels in marine diesel oil and marine bunker fuels are anticipated to be reduced to 0.1 wt % and 1-1.5 wt %, respectively, in the next 5-10 yr, and this may be state regulated, or port specific, rather than nationwide. According to UOP, there were discussions regarding possible changes aimed at reducing sulfur content with regards to kerosene, but to date, no changes to qualities such as sulfur content have been agreed upon, and none are currently forthcoming. This may change as the EU is requesting airlines to reduce emissions, but issues of fuel performance reliability have to be addressed.

These large, unshaded tracts of land are perfect for solar power generation. And, when coupled with plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV), emissions reductions of up to 50% and fuel consumption reductions of 60% can be realized. In addition, when linked to an electric grid, this tandem pair can become a demand resource for utilities in a strategy called ""Vehicle to Grid"" (V2G). A standard parking space on Long Island is 200 square feet. If it were covered with a high output photovoltaic (PV) panel, it would produce 3362 kWh AC per year. In a net metering scenario, this translates to roughly 9 kWh AC per day. When the parking lots are empty, clean power is delivered to the grid. However, PV parking structures at busy shopping malls during the weekend or commuter lots during the week would be tasked to charge PHEVs. In contrast to a standard hybrid vehicle (HEV), a plug-in can be charged from an external source and has an all-electric range of at least 10 miles. While no production PHEVs are currently available, several aftermarket conversion kits have been developed. A conversion involves the installation of extra battery capacity, usually with lithium ion chemistry, a modification of the battery-charging software and, of course, the addition of a plug. Typical plug-in conversions yield vehicles with an all-electric range of 20 to 60 miles. The advantage of PHEVs is due to the change in battery management. Standard HEVs operate in charge sustaining (CS) mode, in which the battery voltage, or state of charge, is maintained at a certain level. Most electrical output for this configuration is collected during trips from regenerative braking or generator operation. PHEVs include a charge depleting (CD) mode, which is intended to draw from the battery bank for motive power. The CD mode supplies the allelectric range and, as such, enables a vehicle to actually displace petroleum consumption per mile driven vs. reducing fuel consumption per mile. When a PHEV is within the allelectric range, no fuel is consumed and hence, no carbon is emitted. Since the typical commuter travels less than 30 miles a day, PHEVs can offer an eco-friendly trip to and from work. A common argument regarding the electrification of transportation is that consumption and emissions are shifted to utility power plants. However, the majority of energy for electric transportation is supplied by photovoltaics. A conservative electric consumption rate for a PHEV is 0.25 kWh per mile. With an average daily production of 9 kWh from a PV carport, a PHEV can travel 36-more than the average distance traveled by commuters. You may wonder why a PV carport should be connected to the grid at all. In addition to supplying some clean energy, PV carports allow a vehicle grid sharing of power. During the day, while cars are parked in lots, vehicle-based batteries can be a large energy storage device linked to the grid. If the PHEVs are outfitted with inverters to sell power back to the grid, a utility can extract energy from the PHEVs as opposed to engaging a peaking device, such as a diesel generator. Of course, each vehicle would be credited for power extracted and limits would be set to maintain a certain charge in each vehicle. However, the net gain to the community would manifest as reduced local emissions, since peaking power generation devices are commonly less efficient than equipment used for baseline production. In conjunction to providing real-world data to verify driving habits on Long Island and calibrate software simulation models, NYIT hopes to develop a scalable PV platform that can be easily extrapolated to parking lots of any size. In addition, we will analyze the economic merit of the vehicle to grid strategy and propose methods to improve the viability of this approach. The major goal is to translate per-vehicle benefits of emissions and consumption reductions to fleet-level benefits. Even if only 25% of registered vehicles on Long Island are PHEVs, 35% of local fuel consumption and emissions can be offset.

Likewise, engine oil classifications and performance requirements have evolved to meet the demands of the latest engine technology. This paper explores the degradation of engine oil quality in service by monitoring the condition of the used oil samples obtained from real-world, non-fleet consumer applications. In a previous study (SAE 2003-01-1957), used oil analysis results were reported for API/ILSAC GF-2 engine oil samples to determine oil degradation trends during service life. These samples were collected from a variety of vehicles, representing different driving conditions and oil brands. Each sample was analyzed to monitor additive depletion, accumulation of contaminants, and change in the physical and chemical properties of the oils. This study is a continuation of the previous work and includes API/ILSAC GF-4 engine oil samples. The data indicates an improvement in the used oil condition from API/ILSAC GF-2 to API/ILSAC GF-4 oils. As indicated in certain vehicles' manuals, several factors including individual driving habits and local operating conditions can impact how motor oil performs and degrades in service. These findings indicate that although engine and engine oil technology continue to improve, it is not possible to predict oil's expected life in service at statistically significant levels under a variety of operating conditions and external variables based upon engine oil age (miles). There appear to be circumstances in the current passenger vehicle population that would necessitate engine oil changes at relatively short drain intervals. © 2008 SAE International.",,"Chemical analysis; Drain current; Fuels; Lubricating oils; Powertrains; Service life; Additive depletion; Consumer applications; Driving conditions; Engine oil technology; Operating condition; Passenger vehicles; Performance requirements; Physical and chemical properties; Engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072468539

The extent of Research and Development (R & D) effort in construction industry has remained very low in the United States. There is evidence that improved productivity is related to the levels of research and development in an industry [2] and [3]. Productivity in construction is usually expressed in qualitative terms, and cannot be analyzed scientifically. The overall productivity in construction has been greatly affected by regulatory controls, environment, climatic effects, cost of energy, and other factors. Productivity improvement has never been the focus of construction industry, probably due to unavailability of a model that can fit together all the fragmented components of the overall construction process. This study attempts to explore the productivity issues, and models that may be suitable to improve productivity in the construction industry.","Construction; Construction productivity; Productivity","Climatic effects; Complex entities; Construction process; Construction productivity; Economic sectors; Productivity improvements; Regulatory controls; Research and development; Construction industry; Research and development management; Productivity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63849236753

Only two boron species are detected under our experimental conditions (91523 W cm-3 average microwave power density values), and the emission spectra used for studies reported here are B (S 12 2 - P 12,32 02) and BH[A Π1 -X +1 (0,0)]. Variations of their respective emission intensities as a function of the ratio BC, the boron to carbon ratio in the gas mixture, are reported. We confirmed that the plasma parameters (Tg, Te, and ne) are not affected by the introduction of diborane, and the number densities of B atoms and BH radical species were estimated from experimental measurements. The results are compared to those obtained from a zero-dimensional chemical kinetic model where two groups of reactions are considered: (1) B Hx +HB Hx-1 + H2 (x=1-3) by analogy with the well-known equilibrium C Hx +H set of reactions, which occurs, in particular, in diamond deposition reactors; and (2) from conventional organic chemistry, the set of reactions involving boron species: B Hx + C2 H2 (x=0-1). The results clearly show that the model based on hydrogen and boron hydrides reactions alone is not consistent with the experimental results, while it is so when taking into account both sets of reactions. Once an upper limit for the boron species number densities has been estimated, axial profiles are calculated on the basis of the plasma model results obtained previously in Laboratoire d'Inǵnierie des Mat́riaux et des Hautes Pressions, and significant differences in trends for different boron species are found.

Our modeling analysis considered the properties of benthic sediments, the saturation and distribution of the hydrates, the ocean depth, the initial seafloor temperature, and for the first time, estimated the effect of benthic biogeochemical activity. The results show that shallow deposits - such as those found in arctic regions or in the Gulf of Mexico-can undergo rapid dissociation and produce significant methane fluxes of 2 to 13 mol/yr/sq m over a period of decades, and release up to 1,100 mol of methane per sq m of seafloor in a century. These fluxes may exceed the ability of the seafloor environment (via anaerobic oxidation of methane) to consume the released methane or sequester the carbon.

""Climate-proofing"" the global economy will involve large-scale investments in new technologies, equipment, buildings, and infrastructure, which will provide a major stimulus for much-needed new employment and an opportunity for retaining and transforming existing jobs. The number of green jobs is on the rise. The renewable energy sector has seen rapid expansion in recent years, with current employment in renewables and supplier industries estimated at a conservative 2.3 million worldwide. The wind power industry employs some 300,000 people, the solar photovoltaics (PV) sector an estimated 170,000, and the solar thermal industry more than 600,000. More than I million jobs are found in the biofuels industry growing and processing a variety of feedstocks into ethanol and biodiesel. Construction jobs can be greened by ensuring that new buildings meet high performance standards. And retrofitting existing buildings to make them more energy-efficient has huge job potential for construction workers, architects, energy auditors, engineers, and others. The weatherization of some 200,000 apartments in Germany created 25,000 new jobs and helped retain 116,000 existing jobs in 2002-04. The transportation industry is a cornerstone of modern economics, but it also has the fastest-rising carbon emissions of any sector. Relatively green auto manufacturing jobs - those in manufacturing the most-efficient cars currently available - today number no more than about 250,000 out of roughly 8 million in the auto sector worldwide. Modern rail and urban transit systems offer a greener alternative, but they need fresh commitment and investments to reverse the job erosion of recent decades. In growing numbers of cities, good jobs are being generated by the emergence of bus rapid transit systems. There are also substantial green employment opportunities in retrofitting old diesel buses to reduce air pollutants and in replacing old equipment with cleaner compressed natural gas (CNG) or hybrid-electric buses. In New Delhi, the introduction of 6,100 CNG buses by 2009 is expected to create 18,000 new jobs. The steel, aluminum, cement, and paper industries are highly energy-intensive and polluting. But increasing scrap use, greater energy efficiency, and reliance on alternative energy sources may at least render them a pale shade of green. Worldwide, more than 40 percent of steel output and one-quarter of aluminum production is based on recycled scrap, possibly employing more than a quarter million people. Recycling and remanufacturing jobs worldwide number many millions, but incompatible definitions and a lack of data gathering make a global tally impossible. China alone is thought to have some 10 million jobs in this sector, and the United States has more than 1 million. In developing countries, recycling is often done by informal networks of scavengers. Brazil, which boasts a high rate of aluminum recycling, relies on some 500,000 scrap collectors. Cairo's 70,000 Zabaleen recycle as much as 85 percent of the materials they collect. Agriculture and forestry often still account for the bulk of employment and livelihoods in many developing countries. Small farms are more labor- and knowledge-intensive than agroindustrial farms are, and they use fewer energy and chemical inputs. But relatively sustainable forms of smallholder agriculture are being squeezed hard by energy- and pesticide-intensive farms and by global supply chains. Organic farming is still limited. But because it is more labor-intensive than industrialized agriculture, it can be a source of growing green employment. Afforestation and reforestation efforts, as well as better stewardship of critical ecosystems more generally, could support livelihoods among the more than 1 billion people who depend on forests, often through non-timber forest products. Planting trees creates large numbers of jobs, although these are often seasonal and low paid. Agroforestry, which combines tree planting with traditional farming, offers significant environmental benefits in degraded areas - including carbon sequestration. Some 1.2 billion people already depend on it to some extent. There is additional job potential in efforts to adapt to, and cope with, climate change. Building flood barriers, terracing land, and rehabilitating wetlands is labor-intensive work. Efforts to protect croplands from environmental degradation and to adapt farming to climate change by raising water efficiency, preventing erosion, planting trees, using conservation tillage, and rehabilitating degraded crop and pastureland can also support rural livelihoods. The potential for green jobs is immense. But much of it will not materialize without massive and sustained investments in the public and private sectors. Governments need to establish a firm framework for greening all aspects of the economy, with the help of targets and mandates, business incentives, and reformed tax and subsidy policies. It will also be critical to develop innovative forms of technology transfer to spread green methods around the world at the scale and speed required to avoid full-fledged climate change. Cooperative technology development and technology-sharing programs could help expedite the process of replicating best practices. To provide as many workers as possible with the qualifications they will increasingly need, an expansion of green education, training, and skill-building programs in a broad range of occupations is crucial. Resource extraction and energy-intensive industries are likely to feel the greatest impact in transitioning to a low-carbon future, and regions and communities highly dependent on them will need assistance in diversifying their economic base, creating alternative jobs and livelihoods, and acquiring new skills. This is known as a ""just transition."" Green jobs need to be decent jobs - offering good wages and income security, safe working conditions, dignity at work, and adequate workers' rights. Sadly, this is not always the case today. Recycling work is sometimes precarious, involving serious occupational health hazards and often generating less than living wages and incomes. Growing crops at biofuels plantations in countries like Brazil, Colombia, Malaysia, and Indonesia often involves excessive workloads, poor pay, exposure to pesticides, and oppression of workers. These cautionary aspects highlight the need for sustainable employment to be good not only for the environment but also for the people holding the jobs. Still, an economy that reconciles human aspirations with the planet's limits is eminently possible.",,"alternative energy; biofuel; carbon emission; developing world; employment; global economy; recycling; renewable resource; twenty first century; Asia; Brazil; Central Europe; China; Colombia; Delhi; Eurasia; Europe; Far East; Germany; India; Malaysia; New Delhi; North America; South America; South Asia; Southeast Asia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56449125974

The photoconductive and electro optic properties of the device are separately optimized. While the excellent photosensitivity arises from the photoconductivity of the BSO, the large electro-optic effect is due to the large birefringence of the liquid crystals. Photorefractive LCLVs have been demonstrated as attractive elements for nonlinear optical applications, such as two-wave mixing optical amplification and self-pumped phase conjugation [2]. Recently, we have introduced a new optical oscillator based on a photorefractive LCLV as a gain medium [3]. The large transverse size and high gain of the LCLV allows a large number of longitudinal and transverse modes to be simultaneously amplified in the cavity, thus giving rise to dynamical regimes remained inaccessible up to date. We report different dynamical regimes, in particular high amplitude spatiotemporal pulses that are confined along the three space directions. (Figure Presented) As sketched in Fig.1, a liquid crystal optical oscillator is formed by a ring cavity into which a LCLV is used as the gain medium. The cavity has a total length of 240 cm and is made of three high-reflectivity dielectric mirrors plus a lens of 70 cm focal length. This configuration ensures the stability and the presence of many longitudinal modes with a discrete spectrum for the transverse modes. The LCLV is driven by an applied voltage V0 and is pumped by a plane wave beam Ep (λ=532 nm). The light amplification comes from two-wave mixing (2WM) in the liquid crystals. The pump polarization is linear and parallel to the liquid crystal director orientation, which is vertical. The cavity field Ec is spontaneously generated and polarized along the vertical direction, since only the extraordinary waves are amplified by the 2WM. The cavity field Ec has a frequency detuning of a few Hz, which is automatically selected by the cavity in order to maximize the gain. The Fresnel number F, which is the ratio of the diffraction limiting aperture to the area of the fundamental Gaussian mode, is controlled by a diaphragm in the cavity and can be changed from F=1 to approximately F=500, which implies changing from a single transverse mode oscillation to a regime where a large number of modes are present. The number of oscillating modes can be changed also by varying the voltage V0 applied to the LCLV, which acts directly on the frequency detuning between the cavity field and the pump beam. For a fixed F=500, the low V0 regimes are characterized by the alternation of low order Gauss-Laguerre modes (Fig.2a-c), whereas the high V0 regimes are accompanied by the emission of high order and out of axis symmetrical modes (Fig.2d). For intermediate values of V0 and of the input intensity, a large number of transverse modes interact through the nonlinear medium, giving rise to spatiotemporal pulses. These appear as large intensity peaks over a lower amplitude and ""speckle-like"" background. (Figure Presented) Spatiotemporal pulses are identified by applying on the recorded images a threshold of 3 times the average intensity. Their extension in the z direction is investigated by simultaneously recording the transverse intensity distributions at the three different z planes along the cavity axis, as shown in Fig.3. (Figure Presented) Together with the experimental observations, we present a theoretical model that takes into account the longitudinal dependence of the cavity field, thus allowing for the formation of 3D optical structures [4]. The model is derived starting from the Maxwell equations for the light propagation in the cavity and from the theory of the LCLV. For a set of parameters consistent with the experiment, we perform numerical simulations confirming the appearance of 3D localized spatiotemporal pulse. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Light sources; Liquid crystals; Optical properties; Photoreactivity; Liquid crystal layers; Photo-refractive; Transverse effects in; Powders",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50249143527

DPOAE fine structures are determined in 16 normal-hearing humans using a high frequency-resolution and primary levels of L1/L2=65/45 dB. DPOAEs are measured both before and after the subjects are exposed to a moderate narrowband sound exposure, which causes a temporary change in the state of hearing. Immediately after the exposure the DPOAE levels are reduced. This level reduction recovers to the initial levels within 20 minutes. For some subjects, the DPOAE fine structure pattern is more pronounced after the exposure, whereas for other subjects the fine structure pattern is less pronounced or not altered. A shift of DPOAE fine structure in frequency could not be observed for any of the subjects after the exposure. The results do not indicate that there is a clear trend of DPOAE fine structure pattern as a result of the exposure.",,"Distortion product otoacoustic emissions; Exposed to; Fine structures; Hearing sensitivity; Narrow-band sound; Quasi-periodic variations; Acoustic emissions; Audition; Acoustic noise",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874831224

However, we show that a minimum energy barrier can be reached close to 40GPa, suggesting that synthesis of the Li-clathrate under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature may be possible. The electronic band structure with related density of states behavior under pressure, as well as the dependence of the active Raman modes with pressure are also examined. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Ab initio calculations; Carbon-based; Clathrates; Density of state; Doped carbons; Electronic band structure; Extreme conditions; First-principles study; Information concerning; Minimum energy; Negative pressures; Pressure and temperature; Raman modes; Theoretical study; Hydrates; Lithium; Metastable phases; Synthetic diamonds; High pressure effects in solids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67349181732

This study investigates gullies under semi arid climate in the small case-study area of Southern Khorasan Province, in Iran. The objectives are to determine the spatial distribution of gullies in the study area, to measure their morphological and topographical characteristics and to reconstruct the factors that led to their development. Large deep gullies are some of the most important sediment sources in the semi-arid environment of the Shaken Basin. So, this study regards gully development in SHAKHEN drainage basin, north of BIRJAND city, taking into account environmental and social characteristics, which affect gully occurrence and its evolution. Gully erosion clearly is a threshold phenomenon. This geomorphic process occurs only when a threshold in terms of flow hydraulics, rainfall, topography, pedology and land use has been exceeded. In this study with using simple methodology the gully erosion, initiation and development concerning with main factors are monitored. Furthermore, also the role of new tectonics activity in the study area on gully development was considered. Hence, different information resources are being undertaken such as: maps aerial photos, satellite image and field observations to determine variables in order to understand where and why gullies occurred and developed. © 2008 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","Erosion; Geomorphology; Gully; Iran; Landuse; Shakhen; Tectonic","Antennas; Catchments; Erosion; Geomorphology; Land use; Tectonics; Topography; Field observations; Geomorphic process; Gully; Information resource; Iran; Semi-arid environments; Shakhen; Threshold phenomena; Landforms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41949097600

In contrast to municipal water treatment where membrane technology is gaining increasing acceptance, paper industry process water is high in organics and can also contain elevated levels of totals dissolved salts. In an endeavour to better understand the relevant factors, we have continued tests at Norske Skog's Albury mill using a 3 stage ultrafiltration/nano-filtration/reverse osmosis (UF/NF/RO) pilot plant to treat water from the paper machine clear filtrate and the recycled fibre plant filtrate. The intention was to see if treating the streams closer to the source of salt generation (chemicals used in the recycling process) would result in improved efficiencies, particularly with respect to desalination. Pilot scale tests were conducted over a period of some weeks firstly on a variety of water qualities available from the paper machine (PM) disk filter, and secondly on filtrate from the recycled fibre (RCF) plant that had been treated by dissolved air flotation. Fouling of the UF membrane when treating PM filtrate, and of the NF stage when treating RCF filtrate, proved to be the limiting factors for the respective streams. Backwashing of the UF stage in the case where RCF filtrate was treated, proved to be the key to obtaining longer periods between membrane cleans. RO treatment of the NF permeate produced from RCF filtrate was reasonably successful, over the short period of the trials, although longer term trials would be needed to assess the likelihood of organic fouling resulting from carryover from the NF stage. However, silica arising from the use of sodium silicate in the RCF will prove the ultimate limiting factor in how concentrated the RO retentate could be.",,"Australia; Deinking plants; Disk filters; Dissolved Air flotations; Dissolved salts; Elevated levels; Limiting factors; Membrane technologies; Membrane treatments; Municipal waters; Norske skog; Organic fouling; Organics; Paper industries; Paper machines; Pilot plant investigations; Pilot scales; Process waters; Pulp and paper mills; Recycled fibres; Recycling processes; Retentate; RO treatments; Short periods; Sodium silicates; UF membranes; Water demands; Air filters; Air pollution; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Deinking; Desalination; Dissolution; Drought; Exhibitions; Filtration; Flotation; Fouling; Membranes; Paper and pulp mills; Paper coating; Paper products; Papermaking; Papermaking machinery; Permanent magnets; Pilot plants; Recycling; Reverse osmosis; Silica; Silicates; Silicon compounds; Wastewater treatment; Water filtration; Water quality; Water recycling; Water treatment; Effluents; Air Filters; Air Pollution; Coating; Deinking; Deionization; Dissolving; Drought; Effluents; Exhibitions; Filtration; Flotation; Fouling; Membranes; Paper Making; Paper Products; Silica",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55849090022

Actions include, for example, moving towards locally sourced food supplies, reducing waste, energy consumption and travel, and including sustainability in policies and strategies. A Strategic Health Authority (SHA) is part of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. They are responsible for developing strategies for the local health services and ensuring high-quality performance. They manage the NHS locally and are a key link between the U.K. Department of Health and the NHS. They also ensure that national priorities are integrated into local plans. Thus they are in a key position to influence policies and practices to mitigate and adapt to the impact of climate change and promote sustainability. Aim: The aim of this study was to review publicly available documents produced by Strategic Health Authorities (SHA) to assess the extent to which current activity and planning locally takes into consideration climate change and energy vulnerability. Methods: A retrospective thematic content analysis of publicly available materials was undertaken by two researchers over a six month period in 2008. These materials were obtained from the websites of the 10 SHAs in England. Materials included annual reports, plans, policies and strategy documents. Results: Of the 10 SHAs searched, 4 were found to have an absence of content related to climate change and sustainability. Of the remaining 6 SHAs that did include content related to climate change and energy vulnerability on their websites consistent themes were seen to emerge. These included commitment to a regional sustainability framework in collaboration with other agencies in the pursuit and promotion of sustainable development. Results indicate that many SHAs in England have yet to embrace sustainability, or to integrate preparations for climate change and energy vulnerability within their organisational strategies. Evidence also suggests that SHAs that have recognised the importance of sustainability within their documentation and policies have yet to fully demonstrate this in practice through the implementation of these policies. Conclusions: Further research is required to investigate means by which SHAs (U.K.) and agencies responsible for health service policy in other countries may be enabled to include a greater consideration of sustainability and climate change within their policies, and to find effective ways of implementing these policies within daily working practice. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","climate change; health; sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908498683

For this purpose, during the last decade, the classical engine has evolved towards a very complex system combining many hi-tech components with advanced control strategies. Optimising the whole engine system and controlling its behaviour has then become a real challenge for car manufacturers. In this context, powertrain simulation tools have been shown to provide an undisputable support during all stages of engine development from concept design to control strategies development and calibration. However these tools require sophisticated models to be efficient, especially in the combustion chamber where combustion and pollutant formation processes take place. This paper presents a OD physical combustion model devoted to the prediction of heat release and pollutants in SI engines. The originality of this model derives from the fact it is based on the reduction of the 3D CFD E-CFM (Extended Coherent Flame Model) model developed at IFP [1]. The CFM formalism distinguishes two zones: the fresh and the burnt gases, which are separated by a flame front and are both described by their temperature, mass and composition. The proposed model is an important evolution of the CFM-1D model previously published in [2]. It computes the rate of consumption of the fresh gases and is based on the calculation of the flame front surface using the real engine geometry and a OD derivation of the flame surface density approach. Pollutants (CO and NOx) are computed both through the flame front and within the burnt gases using a reduced kinetic scheme and a classical extended Zel'dovitch mechanism. The whole model is validated against experimental data at several steady state operating points for two engine configurations. A good agreement with experiments is observed for both configurations, showing the interest of reducing 3D CFD models to build predictive OD models for engine system simulations.

With the emergence of emissions trading systems and new GHG reporting and disclosure schemes, attention is now being focused on the inherent uncertainty of the data used for emission estimates. For the Oil & Gas Industry, the accuracy of calculating GHG emissions is determined by the uncertainties of the estimates of the key (largest) contributing sources. Those, in turn, depend on the quality and availability of sufficient data, or on the ability to measure emissions, or related activity parameters, and properly account for their variability. The Oil & Gas industry, through its global and regional associations, is pursuing these issues on many fronts, from global workshops, dialogue forums and other collaborative activities with peer associations and regulatory bodies. The goal of these activities is to gather information - and diverse perspectives - from all stakeholders. Issues that were discussed include cost-effective methods for quantifying uncertainty and data quality expectations (and level of significance sought) by regulators and by industry. This paper discusses a range of activities undertaken by the industry to investigate key sources of uncertainty and address issues of lowering data uncertainty, including some joint efforts with other trade associations and with the U.S. EPA.

FP pre-treatment of a mixture of primary and secondary sludge increased the soluble COD by 160% and DOC 120% over the control. FP pre-treatment of 63% of the input waste sludge increased biogas production by over 40% and reduced biosolids requiring disposal by 30% when compared to the plant baseline.

The science objective of the OCO instrument is to collect spaced-based measurements of atmospheric CO2 with the precision, resolution, and coverage needed to identify CO2 sources and sinks and quantify their seasonal variability. The instrument will permit the collection of spatially resolved, high resolution spectroscopic observations of CO2 and O2 absorption in reflected sunlight over both continents and oceans. These measurements will improve our ability to forecast CO2 induced climate change. The instrument consists of three bore-sighted, high resolution grating spectrometers sharing a common telescope with similar optics and electronics. One spectrometer is used for O2 observations with a 0.765 urn channel, while the weak and strong CO2 bands are observed with 1.61 urn and 2.06 um channels, respectively. The high-resolution spectroreters will reasure reflected sunlight to retrieve the column-averaged CO2 dry air mole fraction, X CO2. An extensive validation and correlation measurement program was developed for this mission to ensure that XCO2 can be retrieved with precisions of 0.3% (1 ppm) on regional scales (8o × 10 o). The nominal mission lifetime for the instrument is 2 years. The OCO spacecraft will be placed in a sun-synchronous near-circular polar orbit with an inclination of 98.2 degrees, mean altitude of 705 km, 98.9 minute orbit period and 1:26 pm ascending node. The thermal control system consists of passive and active elements to maintain the instrument within allowable flight temperature (AFT) limits. Passive thermal control includes multilayer insulation (MLI) blankets, thermal straps, and surface coatings to manage the transfer of waste energy from sources through structures and ultimately to radiators. Two detectors are cooled to 120 K and the third to 180 K by means of a mechanical pulse tube cryocooler. The optical bench is cooled to-5°C with an outboard radiator. The instrument was fully integrated in December 2007 and has undergone EMI/EMC, vibration and two thermal vacuum (TV) tests. A general overview of the thermal control system with an emphasis on the two-phase heat rejection system (HRS) as well as the cryogenic subsystem is presented.

In the first phase, a literature review created a database of diesel engine-out emissions. The database consisted chiefly of data from heavy-duty diesel engines; therefore, the need for an emission testing program for light-and medium-duty engines was identified. A second phase was conducted to provide additional light-duty vehicle emissions data from current technology vehicles. Engine-out diesel exhaust from four 2004 model light-duty vehicles with a variety of engine displacements was collected and analyzed. Each vehicle was evaluated using five steady-state engine operating conditions and two transient test cycles (the Federal Test Procedure and the US06). Regulated emissions were measured along with speciation of both volatile and semi-volatile components of the hydrocarbons. The results from the literature search and the engine-out emissions data were used to suggest a possible synthetic diesel exhaust formulation. © 2008 SAE International.",,"Search engines; Software testing; Testing; Vehicles; Engine displacement; Engine operating conditions; Engine-out emissions; Federal test procedures; Heavy-duty diesel engine; Light-duty vehicle emissions; Regulated emissions; Volatile components; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072457554

This paper considers how climate change came to be considered by local government against four institutional markers: the emergence of climate change advocates among local politicians and civil servants; climate change as a significant issue in municipal plans; staff and funds allocated to climate change issues; and a serious consideration of climate change issues within local government decision making. Considerable progress has been achieved on the second and third of these - but less so on the first and fourth. The paper highlights how climate change issues need to be rooted in local realities that centre on avoiding or limiting impacts from, for instance, heat waves, heavy rainfall and storm surges and sea-level rise, and also the ecological changes and water supply constraints brought about by climate change. To date, international agencies have paid little attention to adaptation, as the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation) has been prioritized. This paper also stresses the importance of building local knowledge and capacity about climate change risks and adaptive responses. Without this, decision makers will continue seeing environmental issues as constraints on development rather than as essential underpinnings of and contributors to development. © 2008 International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED).","Adaptation; Climate change; Durban; Local government; Municipal Climate Protection Programme","adaptive management; capacity building; climate change; decision making; local government; traditional knowledge; Africa; Durban; KwaZulu-Natal; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52949139060

The foundation of this approach is a three-dimensional finite element Maxwell solver that facilitates the computation of the cavity modes. The cavity modes complemented by a semi-analytic model for the radiative modes yield the emission spectra of the microcavity by means of an efficient mode expansion scheme.

The application of PEMS is now ranging from large engines to the smallest light-duty vehicles. The current commercially available PEMS exhibit measurement performances that are close to the ones of laboratory grade systems; when PEMS data are analysed with an adequate method, the test results allow a detailed insight into the on-road emissions performance of the vehicles with respect to their behaviour on the standard laboratory test cycles. The development of representative test cycles, which has become a typical approach in the last years, supposed to address special driving situations, now becomes less efficient because of the effort needed for their development and the poor representativeness of the results. In this light, PEMS testing offers an easy and efficient way to evaluate the vehicle emissions over a huge variety of conditions. This paper presents the on-road gaseous emission measurements of two light-duty diesel vehicles (Fiat Scudo 2 litre and VW T5, 2.5 litre) tested simultaneously with PEMS on the same routes including urban, extra-urban (rural) and highway during chase experiments. The vehicle absolute emissions and fuel economy is reported. The realworld emission results are analysed with an averaging window approach based on CO2 mass emission; this to provide a first qualitative insight on the variability of exhaust emissions from compression ignition combustion engines under real-world conditions. The investigation and methodology applied show much higher emissions values for real world data compared to the standard laboratory test cycles. The comparison of vehicle emissions and fuel economy performance allows an insight into the variability of emission behaviour under constant boundary conditions. © 2008 SAE International.",,"Engines; Fuel economy; Fuels; Ignition; Powertrains; Roads and streets; Vehicle performance; Combustion engines; Compression ignition; Driving situations; Economy performance; Emission measurement; Light duty vehicles; Portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS); Real-world emission; Air pollution control equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072456484

Our data indicate that these diatom shifts occurred in conjunction with changes in freshwater habitat structure and quality, which, in turn, we link to hemispheric warming trends. Significant increases in the relative abundances of planktonic Cyclotella taxa (P < 0.01) were concurrent with sharp declines in both heavily silicified Aulacoseira taxa (P < 0.01) and benthic Fragilaria taxa (P < 0.01). We demonstrate that this trend is not limited to Arctic and alpine environments, but that lakes at temperate latitudes are now showing similar ecological changes. As expected, the onset of biological responses to warming occurred significantly earlier (P < 0.05) in climatically sensitive Arctic regions (median age = ad 1870) compared with temperate regions (median age = ad 1970). In a detailed paleolimnological case study, we report strong relationships (P < 0.005) between sedimentary diatom data from Whitefish Bay, Lake of the Woods (Ontario, Canada), and long-term changes in air temperature and ice-out records. Other potential environmental factors, such as atmospheric nitrogen deposition, could not explain our observations. These data provide clear evidence that unparalleled warming over the last few decades resulted in substantial increases in the length of the ice-free period that, similar to 19th century changes in high-latitude lakes, likely triggered a reorganization of diatom community composition. We show that many nonacidified, nutrient-poor, freshwater ecosystems throughout the Northern Hemisphere have crossed important climatically induced ecological thresholds. These findings are worrisome, as the ecological changes that we report at both mid- and high-latitude sites have occurred with increases in mean annual air temperature that are less than half of what is projected for these regions over the next half century. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.","Climate; Cyclotella; Ice-out; Meta-analysis; Northern Hemisphere lakes; Paleolimnology; Planktonic diatoms","air temperature; climate effect; diatom; environmental factor; global warming; meta-analysis; Northern Hemisphere; paleolimnology; phytoplankton; relative abundance; Eurasia; Europe; Lake of the Woods; North America; Aulacoseira; Bacillariophyta; Cyclotella; Fragilaria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53249101041

These mandates call for biofuels to be blended in varying proportions with traditional gasoline or diesel and, in some cases, allow or require different biofuel standards. To maintain engine performance and emissions requirements, varying biofuel blends and standards will require changes to gasoline and diesel blendstocks that biofuels are mixed with. The manufacture of these different blendstocks will require modifications to the refining infrastructure. In addition, changes to blendstocks will further balkanize the mix of liquid fuels and put additional strain on an already stressed pipeline and storage infrastructure as smaller batches of incompatible fuels are shipped to an increasing number of locations. Further, because biofuels will typically be produced near the bio-feedstocks-which are currently not typically served by pipeline systems-trucking, rail, and barge infrastructure may expand until and unless new pipelines are built. Finally, the different blendstocks required for different regions will reduce the fungibility of petroleum liquid fuels, thereby reducing trade and increasing price volatility, similar to the effects in the United States of a proliferation of gasoline blends in response to Clean Air Act air quality standards. These and other unintended effects and additional capital expenditures raise serious questions about the efficacy of rapid expansion of biofuel use and also call for policy makers to consider negotiating biofuel production and blending standards to reduce the eventual number of incompatible liquid fuels.",,"Biofuel production; Capital expenditures; Engine performance; European Countries; Incompatible liquids; Petroleum liquids; Storage infrastructure; U.S. federal government; Automotive fuels; Blending; Fuel storage; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Liquid fuels; Management science; Petroleum refining; Pipelines; Ships; Standards; Trucks; Biodiesel",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896821228

The oil is heavy (12°API) with high viscosity and low solution gas. Primary recovery has been inefficient, less than 2% of OOIP. Over the period of primary recovery, from 1961 to 1986, the reservoir underwent extensive pressure depletion from 1,800 psig to as low as 400 psig in some regions, with a related production decline from a peak of approximately 9,000 Bbls/day to 1600 Bbls/day. In March 1986, a CO2 injection pilot scheme in a 1200 acre area containing 33 wells was initiated in the west portion of the field. The gas injection was initially cyclic; ""huff and puff"" method was applied. Later, in 1988, the gas injection scheme was converted to a CO2 flood process. Later, the process was widespread to cover the whole field. A peak daily production rate 13000 STB/d was achieved in 1993 in comparison to what would have been less than 1600 STB/d without CO2 application. However, since 1995, the field has undergone a progressive production decline to recent levels at approximately 5,500 Bbls/day. Polymer gel treatments were carried out to increase the CO2 sweep efficiency and arrest the decline. Multilateral and horizontal well technology was also applied on pilot scale to reach the bypassed oil. WAG is applied widespread now. Current production is 7000 Bbls/day.

In order to determine the main factors for reducing CO 2 emissions by Eco-Driving, tests on urban roads were conducted with a light duty diesel freight vehicle operated by five test drivers under two driving scenarios: one with typical operations and one with Eco-Driving operations. As a result, under conditions of a mean vehicle speed of about 15km/h, the amount of CO2 emissions emitted during Eco-Driving operations by the test drivers were less than those of typical operations by 15% or more. It was determined that while under Eco-Driving operations, CO 2 emissions in acceleration modes were greatly reduced. Other modes like cruising, deceleration, and idling produced less CO2 reductions. The results showed that CO2 emissions decreased because Eco-Driving operations reduced the required driving energy because of more moderate vehicle accelerations. Furthermore, analysis of the actual history of engine speed and load on the engine map under vehicle starting and acceleration conditions revealed that Eco-Driving operations, which included shifting-up at lower engine speeds and using higher load, increased the frequency of engine operation in the range with highest thermal efficiency, and this resulted in CO2 emissions reduction. © 2008 SAE International.",,"Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Engines; Speed; Vehicles; Acceleration condition; Driving scenarios; Engine operations; Freight vehicle; Real traffic conditions; Reducing co2 emissions; Thermal efficiency; Vehicle acceleration; Freight cars",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072473706

This leads to oil production decline, with some oil wells becoming so depleted that they have to be shut-in. This paper discusses a joint project to rehabilitate the Sorochinsko-Nikolskoe oil field in order to extend productive time of such wells by identifying candidate wells for horizontal sidetracking. The main goal of the project was the validation of horizontal sidetracking for long-term enhanced oil recovery. To achieve this objective, the joint group needed to select wells suitable for horizontal side tracking and predict both the initial daily oil production rate and cumulative oil production over five years. At the same time, the team had to minimize any risks associated with geological uncertainty. The main criteria for sidetrack selection included an initial oil production rate of more then 75 ton per day, followed by steady production for five years. An integrated approach was used to re-evaluate the development of the oil field. First step of this process was analysis of the oil field development and the identification of bypassed oil reserves to determine zones of interest. The next step was quality control of petrophysical and geological data sets and the analysis of match between initial models and actual production data. The result of this analysis confirmed the need to revise the existing models for a more accurate oil production forecast and to develop a water flooding strategy within the side track zones of interest. The next step was geological modeling based on petrophysical interpretation of porosity and fluid saturation. Special feature of petrophisical interpretation is new algorithm for calculation of reservoir property. Base of this algorithm is petrophisical equations sort of ""core-logging data"" relationship for calculation of reservoir property as a porosity, permeability and fluid saturation. Petrophisical equation for open porosity in target formation was drawn from comparative analysis of core data porosity and neutron porosity. Since this equation was used for processing of all well data in this oil field, time for data processing has been significantly reduced and on the same time, required accuracy of petrophisical value of rock property was achieved. Interpretation results from previous researches on a data set from this oil field do not have a criterion for estimation of fluid saturation type and water-saturation cut-off for pay zone recognition. New algorithm for petrophisical interpretation gives clearly defined criteria for recognition of watersaturated, oil saturated and oil-water saturated pay zones for target carbonate formation. Comparison of log interpretation results based on new algorithm and previous one is shown in Fig. 1. Significantly that, the new interpretation results of oil saturation coefficient depend from porosity and resistivity while quantitative criteria for that calculation were obtained from analyses of acceptable well test results. Structural framework of geological model was built based on top and bottom markers of target formations 04. As a trend surface for structural framework seismic horizon C1ok (top of Oksky formation) was used. Parameters of structural grid are 50/50 m for axes X-Y and 0.5 m for axis Z. Grid size is 151/182/20 (X/Y/Z) for Tolkayevsko-Sorochinsky dome and 87/112/20 (X/Y/Z) for Borodinovsky dome. For dynamic simulation, the number of vertical layers has been reduced up to 10 layers by upscaling to the average layer thickness 1m. Porosity model was made using stochastic algorithm (Sequential Gaussian Simulation). Variogram type is spherical. Lateral correlation ranges are 600/600 m and vertical range is 6 m. Porosity model is P50 model of porous volume realization. The variogram parameters were set up based on the experimental variogram generated using the Tolkayevsko-Sorochinsky data. The average model-based reservoir porosity value of the Tolkayevsko-Sorochinsky dome is 18.5%, of the Borodinovsky dome - 18.3%. The resulting geological model produced a detailed structure of vertical and lateral heterogeneity of the reservoirs and the transition zone. The geological model was updated on the basis of the results of reservoir simulation and history matching. Based on the results of dynamic simulation the average reservoir permeability values of the Tolkayevsko-Sorochinsky dome are - 303 mD, of the Borodinovsky dome - 266 mD. This interactive update allowed adjusting parameters for porosity distribution and structural position of some wells. Finally, the candidate selection was done using maps of residual reserves (Figs. 3.4), which were generated from simulation models. Forecast of oil production and cumulative production were provided for each side track candidate (Tabl.1). The recommendation on water flooding optimization was also provided for each side track candidate. The technical feasibility of drilling the side track in planned direction was verified. This analysis also enabled economic justification of the horizontal side-tracking project and the selection of each candidate. As a result of the project, 12 side track candidates were selected ranked using geological risks and calculated production parameters. Based on project results a program of side track drilling for 2008-2009 was developed. During the drilling stage of side track the project includes the requirements for real time geosteering of well for optimal recover of oil saturated rock.

Chemical energy is converted directly into electricity by reduction and oxidation reactions that occur at the anode and cathode of the electrochemical cell. Fuel cells and batteries have a wide range of applications in transportation, stationary systems, mobile phones and portable devices. The number of battery- and fuel-cell-powered electronic devices in new applications is expected to increase greatly in the next decade. Rechargeable batteries and fuel cells are extensively studied for their use as stationary power sources in electric vehicles (EVs) and in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). These will increase fuel efficiency and reduce the consumption of hydrocarbon-based fuels, resulting in lower CO2 emissions. Fuel cells, in particular, have a high potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and could one day replace, partly, fossil-fuel-based power plants and also combustion engines in the transportation sector. Biomass-based liquid and gaseous fuels are being studied for their use in fuel cells. Present-day fuel cells and batteries have their limitations. These include material deterioration problems, operating temperatures, energy and power output, and their short life. Batteries and fuel cells are specific in their uses and one type does not fit all purposes. The development of fuel-cell-powered vehicles is strongly related to environmental aspects and the need to decrease the dependency on foreign oil and consumption of fossil fuels. FCs produce electricity directly, and as a result have higher energy conversion efficiencies than do combustion engines.

This chapter analyzes the potential of growing energy crops for thermal energy applications, making a case-study comparison of bioheat, biogas and liquid biofuel production from energy crops in Ontario. Switchgrass pellets for bioheat and corn silage biogas were the most efficient strategies found for displacing imported fossil fuels, producing 142 and 123 GJ/ha respectively of net energy gain. Corn ethanol, soybean biodiesel and switchgrass cellulosic ethanol produced net energy gains of 16, 11 and 53 GJ/ha, respectively. Bioheat also proved the most efficient means to reduce GHG emissions. Switchgrass pellets were found to offset 86-91% of emissions compared with using coal, heating oil, natural gas or liquid natural gas (LNG). Each hectare of land used for production of switchgrass pellets could offset 7.6-13.1 tonnes of CO2 annually. In contrast, soybean biodiesel, corn ethanol and switchgrass cellulosic ethanol could offset 0.9, 1.5 and 5.2 tonnes of CO2/ha, respectively. The main historic constraint in the development of herbaceous biomass for thermal applications has been clinker formation and corrosion in the boiler during combustion.

Future tendencies on energy production envision that the growing demand of electricity will push forward the need to construct more electric power plants with different combustion material. In Spain, the growing electric energy demand has conducted to a growing market on natural gas combined cycle electric power plants. The air quality impact of such a plant is considerable smaller than the old ones but the modern EU Air Quality legislation is starting to obligate to control the air quality impact in real-time and forecasting mode. This tool presents the first implementation in Spain over a 4 group combined cycle electric power plant, located in the surrounding area of Madrid Community (Spain) by using the MM5-CMAQ-EMIMO modeling tool. The MM5 model is widely used al over the world developed by PSU/NCAR (USA) and the CMAQ model is the so-called Community Multiscale Air Quality Modelling System developed by EPA (USA) and finally EMIMO is an anthropogenic and biogenic emission model to produce hourly emissions per pollutant per squared kilometer. The system is accessed over the Internet for the environmental authorities and company managers under daily basis. The tool produces alerts every day according to the results of the model. Final decision related to possible shut-down for a limited period of time of the different power plant groups - in case of exceeds of EU Directive limits due to the emissions of the different power groups - is taken by environmental authorities in realtime. The system prototype was part of the EUREKA project TEAP (A tool to evaluate the air quality impact on industrial plants) (2001-2003). The same approach can be used for any other industrial plant and also for any emission source apportionment such as traffic over specific sections of the model domain or even specific pollutants over determined areas in the model domain.","Air quality modelling; Industrial impact; Real-time control","A plants; Air quality impacts; Air quality modeling; Air quality modelling; Anthropogenic and biogenic emissions; Combined cycle; Community multi-scale air qualities; Electric energies; Emission sources; Energy productions; Environmental Authority; EU directives; Final decision; Generation of electric power; Growing demand; Growing markets; Industrial impact; MM5 models; Model domains; Modeling tool; Natural gas combined cycles; Power group; Real time; Real-time forecasting; System prototype; Third generation; Air quality; Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Electric power plants; Energy management; Industrial emissions; Information technology; Laws and legislation; Pollution; Real time control; Industrial plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858320578

We have used an advanced and adapted version of the MIMO model (U. Karlsruhe, Germany) which is a sophisticated CFD model, to simulate the air concentrations at urban level with 10 m spatial resolution over the city of Las Palmas (Canary Islands, Spain). The CFD code receives the traffic emission data every second produced by a cellular automata model (CAMO). The integrated CFD model is called MICROSYS. This model is an Eulerian 3D tool which is running in diagnostic mode once every minute. The boundary conditions are obtained from the well-known MM5-CMAQ running over the city in prognostic mode. The MM5-CMAQ (OPANA V4) model is run with 1 km spatial resolution covering a domain of 16 × 16 km over the city. This system is operating in forecasting mode since 2004 and is operated over the Internet. The forecasting information for meteorology and air quality concentrations for the following 72 hours is used by MICROSYS to simulate the expected air concentrations at street level for the next three days. The system operates under daily basis and produces the detailed forecasting information at 6:00 GMT everyday. The Internet service includes a sophisticated VRML (Virtual Reality Modelling Language) tool to visualize in a 3D mode the air concentrations at street level by an Internet client. The VRML tool runs on the client server.

Chile has worked through various options to appropriately address the environmental challenge of arsenic pollution of water and air. Because of cost and other reasons, copying standards used elsewhere in the world was not an option for Chile. Approximately 1.8 million people, representing about 12% of the total population of the country, live in arsenic-contaminated areas. In these regions, air, water, and soil are contaminated with arsenic from both natural and anthropogenic sources. For long periods, water consumed by the population contained arsenic levels that exceeded values recommended by the World Health Organization. Exposure to airborne arsenic also occurred near several large cities, as a consequence of both natural contamination and the intensive mining activity carried out in those areas. In rural areas, indigenous populations, who lack access to treated water, were also exposed to arsenic by consuming foods grown locally in arseniccontaminated soils. Health effects in children and adults from arsenic exposure first appeared in the 1950s. Such effects included vascular, respiratory, and skin lesions from intake of high arsenic levels in drinking water. Methods to remove arsenic from water were evaluated, developed, and implemented that allowed significant reductions in exposure at a relatively low cost. Construction and operation of treatment plants to remove arsenic from water first began in the 1970s. Beginning in the 1990s, epidemiological studies showed that the rate of lung and bladder cancer in the arsenic-polluted area was considerably higher than mean cancer rates for the country. Cancer incidence was directly related to arsenic exposure. During the 1990s, international pressure and concern by Chile's Health Ministry prompted action to regulate arsenic emissions from copper smelters. A process began in which emission standards appropriate for Chile were set; this process included careful evaluation of risks versus mitigation costs for abatement options. Such options were developed and implemented. More recently, local communities have pressed for more significant reductions of arsenic in air and water. Considerable experience was gained with the arsenic experience on how to manage this type of hazardous pollutant, in a context of trade-offs among production, jobs, income, and health. In this review article, we cover arsenic levels in Chile's air, water, and soils and discuss health impacts and patterns of exposure. We also describe the process followed to set arsenic regulatory standards, as well as abatement options for air and water and the associated costs. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2008.",,"arsenic; animal; article; Chile; dangerous goods; environmental exposure; human; isolation and purification; pollutant; pollution; Animals; Arsenic; Chile; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Environmental Pollution; Hazardous Substances; Humans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049146864

This has translated to increased demand for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) in the Asia Pacific region, where LNG imports are the primary source of gas in some countries. Gas production in Australia has increased steadily over the past two decades to around 44 billion cubic metres in 2007-08. While the domestic market absorbs around 50 per cent of gas production, Australia is one of the largest LNG exporters in the Asia Pacific region. For these reasons the focus of this note is on LNG. In 2008, LNG trade is estimated to have increased by around 8 per cent to 186 million tonnes. This rate of growth is consistent with the longer term trend since 2000. Increased LNG trade has been driven by an increase in the uptake of natural gas for electricity generation and increased natural gas consumption in industrial and residential sectors of many economies, particularly in Europe and Asia. Increased consumption of natural gas also reflects a number of policy priorities including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, enhancing energy security, and ensuring a diversified fuel mix. In a number of countries where these policies are being pursued there is insufficient production of natural gas, requiring natural gas to be imported primarily in the form of LNG.",,"conference proceeding; demand analysis; electricity generation; energy policy; energy use; gas production; gas trade; global perspective; liquefied natural gas; natural gas; Australasia; Australia; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Rim",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-60149105169

In contrast, the more enclosed and entrophic Jurujuba embayment exhibited a Icaral contribution of autochthonous organic matter, as shown by the combination of cholesterol, dinosterol and, partially, also brassicasterol. The presence of stigmasterol and β-sitosterol also indicated a minor contribution of organic matter from terrestrial plants, as revealed by principal component analysis. The sedimentary record of the Jurujuba embayment exhibited highest concentrations of all sterol markers in the top layer, corroborating the recent increase in the accumulation of sewage, plankton derived organic carbon and also eutrophication. Trend in degradation of organic matter was evidenced by sterol/stanol ratios and the behavior of dinosterol indicated that the embayment has been dominated by the accumulation of phytoplankton derived organic matter since earlier times.","Brazil; Eutrophication; Guanabara Bay; Organic matter; Sediments; Sewage; Sterols; Tropical estuary",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48749083058

It is well recognized that the aircraft noise during the landing approach is mostly due to use of high lift devices. In this paper, in-flight deployable micro-tab devices are investigated for their suitability in aircraft landing nose control. This is accomplished with the use of the virtual-reality after scaled testing-simulation-validations approach. A scaled testing apparatus had to be designed to capture non-propulsive noise from aircraft during approach to validate the results of computational scaled simulation. This apparatus now serves as an anechoic wind tunnel at low Mach numbers and its design is detailed. We proposed use of lift generating micro-tab device that will allow reduced slat and/or flap settings during the approach thereby causing a reduction in airframe noise. Simulations based on a 1/3 rd scaled B737 wing resulted in promising noise reductions for the case with deployed micro-tab.

It has been widely hypothesized that litter quality and climatic and soil conditions regulate decomposition. The present study examined the decomposition of native forest tree litter on 2 aspects (the north and the south) and at 3 altitudes (top, middle, and bottom) on each aspect in Artvin province to determine the influence of litter quality, microclimate, and soil characteristics on the rate of decomposition. A litter-bag experiment was performed using beech, oak, fir, and pine litter. The litter bags were placed on the north- and south-facing sites and at 3 altitudes on each aspect and were sampled every 6 months for 2 years. The dominant rate-regulating factor on the litter mass loss rates was found to be the lignin concentration of the litter. The litter from oak and pine contained relatively low lignin levels, and these litter types exhibited significantly faster rates of decay than the highly lignified beech and fir litter. The litter placed on the north-facing site decomposed much faster compared to the south-facing site, and the litter placed at the top altitude on each aspect showed the lowest decay rates compared to either the bottom or middle position throughout the study period. The microclimate and soil characteristics also helped to explain the variation in the litter mass losses, but their effects were less and also showed variations according to the aspects. On the north-facing sites, behind the initial lignin concentration, the litter decomposition was limited by actual evapotranspiration (AET), whereas on the south-facing sites the limiting factor on litter decomposition was soil temperature. However, when the 2 aspects were considered together, lignin concentrations and soil respiration rates were found to be better predictors of the mass loss rates in these forest ecosystems. © TÜBİTAK.","Litter decomposition; Litter quality; Microclimate; Soil factors; Topography","Decay (organic); Ecosystems; Lignin; Soil surveys; Soils; Topography; Actual evapotranspiration; Litter bag experiments; Litter decomposition; Litter quality; Microclimate; Soil characteristics; Soil factors; Soil respiration rates; Forestry; coniferous tree; deciduous tree; decomposition; experimental study; litter; microclimate; Decay; Ecosystems; Engineering; Facings; Forest Litter; Forestry; Geology; Lignins; Quality; Soil; Surveys; Water Supply; Artvin; Eurasia; Turkey; Abies; Coniferales; Fagus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63449109692

Governments are seeking ways to help improve performance of their countries on this environmental issue through introduction of various policy instruments. One popular policy instrument that seems to have gained credibility with explicit mention of its application in the Kyoto Protocol is the use of permit trading and cap-and-trade mechanisms. Various political regions, countries, and even corporations have introduced, are introducing or seek to introduce this mechanism. Organizations functioning within this environment will need to manage their resources appropriately to remain competitive. Organizations will either have the opportunity to purchase emissions credits (offsets) from a market trading scheme or seek to reduce their emissions through different measures. Some measures may include investment in new technologies that will reduce their reliance on GHG emitting practices. In many countries, large organizations and institutions generate their own power to operate their facilities. Much of this power is generated (or bought) from GHG producing technology. Specific renewable energy sources such as wind and solar photovoltaic technology may become more feasible alternatives available to a large percentage of these organizations if they are able to take advantage and incorporate the market for GHG emissions trading in their analyses. To help organizations evaluate investment in these renewable energy technologies we introduce a real options based model that will take into consideration uncertainties associated with the technology and those associated with the GHG trading market. The real options analysis will consider both the stochastic (uncertainty) nature of the exercise price of the technology and the stochastic nature of the market trading price of the GHG emissions. Managerial and policy implications will be discussed. © 2008 Springer New York.","GHG emissions trading; photovoltaic tecnology; real options",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890002212

For night and early morning periods, this local practice can not be the appropriate one, because, in general, there are not available employees for manual actuation in these periods. In this research work, the aim was showing that night and eariy morning temperatures do not coincide with growing pigs' thermoneutral zone. For this reason, acclimatization must be carried out at these periods also. Two differently constructed buildings were used for obtaining the bioclimatic profile of the 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. period in spring. Dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity data were obtained in the interior of each building, as well as the external conditions. Temperature-humidity index (THI) was calculated for evaluation of thermal comfort. In this case, the analysis of climatic data allows us to conclude that these growing pig buildings should have had automatically actuated cooling systems during the analyzed period. It was necessary because of the magnitude of the thermal amplitude of this period and the maximum temperatures frequently cross over the maximum temperature of growing pigs' theermoneutral zone. The THI values were frequently higher than the desirable range.","Acclimatization system; Swine; Thermal comfort","Atmospheric humidity; Buildings; Cooling systems; Moisture; Thermal comfort; Acclimatization system; Bulb temperatures; Climatic datum; Cross overs; External conditions; Maximum temperatures; Pig buildings; Swine; Temperature-humidity indices; Thermal amplitudes; Thermal environmental conditions; Agriculture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63149088822

It has maintained a unique geographical position at the South Pole for long periods. As the only unpopulated continent, the absence of political barriers or short-term economic interests has allowed international collaborative science to flourish. Although 98% of its area is covered by ice, the coastal Antarctic region is one of the wellstudied regions in the world. The integrity and success of geological studies lies in the fact that exposed outcrops are well preserved in the low-latitude climate. The continuing programme of the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition focuses on the geology of East Antarctica, especially in the Dronning Maud Land and Enderby Land regions. Enderby Land preserves some of the oldest Archaean rocks on Earth, and the Mesoproterozoic to Palaeozoic history of Dronning Maud Land is extremely important in understanding the formation and dispersion of Rodinia and subsequent assembly of Gondwana. The geological features in this region have great significance in defining the temporal and spatial extension of orogenic belts formed by the collision of proto-continents. Present understanding of the evolution of East Antarctica in terms of global tectonics allows us to visualize how continents have evolved through time and space, and how far back in time the present-day plate-tectonic regime may have operated. Although several fundamental research problems still need to be resolved, the future direction of geoscience research in Antarctica will focus on how the formation and evolution of continents and supercontinents have affected the Earth's environment, a question that has been addressed only in recent years. © The Geological Society of London 2008.",,"Archean; Earth; future prospect; Gondwana; ice cover; orogenic belt; outcrop; paleoenvironment; paleogeography; Paleozoic; plate tectonics; research program; Rodinia; Antarctica; East Antarctica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71549141348

While climatic records for the Western Mediterranean show slight trends towards warmer and drier conditions over the last century, parts of the Eastern Mediterranean have experienced cooler and wetter conditions. Mediterranean forests are likely to be impacted by these changes, which could reduce their mitigation potential. If climate change occurs faster than new ecosystem structure and function can be developed, then the historical relationships between animal, plant and climatic conditions may not be reestablished and biological diversity will be reduced. During the last three decades, an expansion of the geographic range of major forest insect pests, caused by increased winter temperatures, have been observed worldwide. In Lebanon, changes in climatic conditions are linked with an altitudinal shift in bioclimatic zones. Cedar forest reserves, typical of the Montane-Mediterranean zone, recognized worldwide for their biological, cultural, historical and social value have been facing major threats. An alarming indicator appeared in these forests in the late 1990s where a web-spinning sawfly affected 70% of one of the largest populations of Cedar (Cedrus libani A.) forests in Lebanon. The newly-discovered insect, Cephalcia tannourinensis Chevin, now threatens the survival of several important Cedar forests, namely the Tannourine Cedar Forest Nature Reserve, the Hadeth El Jebbeh Forest, and the Bsharry Forest. Recognizing the value of these relic ecosystems, national stakeholders have been proactive in attracting international funds to conserve them, monitor their flora and fauna diversity and to remediate and prevent climate change effects at both national and regional levels. Although the pest management program was satisfactory, work on the sawfly's biology revealed that it would increase again rapidly unless climate change effects could be mitigated. The definition of adequate mitigation and adaptation measures requires the development of monitoring programmes integrating biotic and abiotic parameters. This article highlights the importance of these Cedar forests and the strategy adopted for managing the pest outbreak through the implementation of an integrated management program. It presents a monitoring plan for Cedar forest ecosystems under the effects of climate change. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adaptive management; Cedar; Cephalcia tannourinensis; Monitoring program; Pest management; Protected areas; Web-spinning sawfly","Animalia; Cedrus; Cedrus libani; Cephalcia; Hexapoda; Pamphiliidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73849090901

We studied the short-term effects on CO2 emissions of converting agricultural land-use (planted to barley) to a hybrid poplar (Populus deltoids × Populus × petrowskyana var. Walker) plantation in the Parkland region in northern Alberta, where large areas are being planted to hybrid poplars. CO2 emissions were measured using a static gas chamber method. No differences were found in soil temperature, volumetric moisture content, or soil respiration rates between the barley and Walker plots. The mean soil respiration rate in 2005 was 1.83 ± 0.19 (mean ± 1 SE) and 1.89 ± 0.13 μmol CO2 m -2 s-1 in the barley and Walker plots, respectively. However, biomass production was higher in the barley plots, indicating that the agricultural land-use system had a greater ability to fix atmospheric CO 2. The C balance in the land-use systems were estimated to be a small net gain (before considering straw and grain removal through harvesting) of 0.03 ± 0.187 Mg C ha-1 year-1 in the barley plots and a net loss of 3.35 ± 0.080 Mg C ha-1 year-1 from the Walker poplar plots.

This specific coupling method is required by the architecture of such CFD solvers that must handle with industrial reacting flows simulations often involving complex geometries and multiphysical phenomena. The proposed method can be devided into two main steps. First, the set of transported species is determined. Then a corrective term is added to the chemical reaction rates interpolated in the FPI database to balance the perturbations created accross the flame. This method is at first successfully validated on a simple but challenging academic test case: a monodimensional laminar methane/air premixed flame. After having tested the model in a laminar context, we discuss the issues introduced by turbulence/chemistry interactions. We propose here to use a presumed PDF model along with the FPI database. This model lies within the framework of flamelet models for pre-mixed combustion as the turbulent flame structure is assumed being locally similar to a monodimensional laminar premixed flame. The presumed PDF approach was chosen because it provides an excellent compromise between accuracy and CPU computation time and enables the construction of a new ""turbulent"" FPI database containing mean chemical variables. In this context, the modelisation of the progress variable variance, required for the interpolations in the turbulent table, remains a particularly challenging issue. The evaluation of the scalar dissipation rate is especially crucial and we chose to use a model based on the BML assumption to account for the reciprocal influence of chemistry on turbulence as well as flame brush resolution. Finally, results obtained for a turbulent lean premixed flame stabilized behind a conical bluff body are discussed. Comparisons are made between an algebraic model for the variance and a transport equation approach. The overall results are in good agreements with measurments which is very promising for more practical applications.",,"Algebraic models; Bluff body; CFD codes; CFD solver; Chemical variables; Combustion model; Complex geometries; Computation time; Coupling methods; Flame brush; Flamelet concept; Flamelet models; Laminar premixed flames; Model-based; Modelisation; Multiphysical phenomena; New approaches; Premixed Flame; Premixed Turbulent Combustion; Reacting flows; Scalar dissipation rate; Tabulated chemistry; Test case; Transport equation; Turbulence/chemistry interactions; Turbulent flame structure; Computational fluid dynamics; Database systems; Explosives; Probability distributions; Propulsion; Reaction rates; Combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957833994

Polarization measurements for oxygen reduction on the prepared catalysts were carried out with a gas-diffusion electrode floating on the surface of alkaline solution under a stream of oxygen. The catalytic activity toward decomposition of peroxide generated during oxygen reduction at the gas-diffusion electrode was examined in situ by monitoring the open-circuit potential recovery after interruption of steady-state cathodic current. The catalytic activity for oxygen reduction on the carbon-based electrode was well correlated with the activity toward peroxide decomposition. A linear relation between the electrode potential at constant current and the logarithm of the peroxide decomposition rate constant was observed. Among the catalysts consisting of several combinations of 3d transition elements, the catalysts containing cobalt or copper with iron exhibited high operation potential of the electrode, and the catalysts containing copper or zinc with iron exhibited high activity toward peroxide decomposition. When the normalized rate constants toward peroxide decomposition were compared with those reported for the conventional catalyst such as transition metal oxides, the catalytic activity of the present catalysts was comparable to or higher than the conventional catalysts.

Plasma gasification technology offers an environmentally responsible solution for older power plants allowing old power plants to meet increasingly stringent regulatory and environmental standards. Plasma Gasification technology converts coal / biomass into syngas, which is cleaned of impurities i.e. sulfur and mercury, and then combusted in the existing facility s steam electric generating equipment (typically boilers). By retrofitting plasma gasification technology into the older power plants, much of the existing facility infrastructure is retained and reused; thereby reducing repowering costs and the amount of air pollutants emitted is drastically reduced. As well, by replacing some of the coal with renewable biomass feedstock, construction and demolition waste or municipal solid waste, significant greenhouse gas reductions can also be attained. Retrofitting coal fueled facilities using plasma gasification system is expected to reduce harmful air emissions below US environmental guidelines, with significant reductions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), mercury (Hg) and sulfur oxides (SO x). Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from retrofitted facilities are possible by combining biomass into the feedstock to displace the need for coal and further reduction may be possible with the future add-on of carbon capture and sequestration technology. As well, it enhances power generation on Brownfield sites in areas of high power demand. Most importantly, it makes it unnecessary to abandon older power plants, the people who operate them, the vendors who sell goods and services to them, and the communities who benefit from them. As well, as it is a more time and cost efficient solution than building new facilities NRG Energy's power plant in Somerset, MA currently produces 110 megawatts (MW) with a pulverized coal combustion boiler and associated steam turbine. NRG has proposed and received required approvals from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection for the design, construction, and operation of a plasma gasification system at Somerset and the refueling of the existing boiler from pulverized coal to clean syngas firing using the plasma gasification technology developed by Westinghouse Plasma Corp (WPC). WPC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Alter Nrg. The approval also allows the use of up to 45% biomass, on a heat input basis to displace coal, thereby earning both Renewable Energy Credits and significantly reducing the emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG). There are close to 600 small to medium size coal-fired generation units in North America that are nearing the end of their economic life because they cant meet new emissions standards. NRG Energy together with Alter NRG has identified more than 320 coal-fired units that are suitable for retrofitting using WPC plasma technology. NRG Energy s Somerset plant will be the worlds first plasma gasification retrofit of a coal-fired power plant. Our paper will explain how plasma gasification works, the application to and benefits of plasma gasification for power plant retrofits, the experiences with plasma gasification of waste feed materials in commercial plants in Japan and India and the industry trends which are heightening interest in North America and around the world for plasma gasification application for power generation.",,"Air emissions; Air pollutants; Biomass feedstock; Brownfield sites; Carbon capture and sequestrations; Clean air act; Clean energy; Coal fired generation; Coal fired units; Coal power plants; Coal-fired power plant; Construction and demolition waste; Cost-efficient; Economic life; Environmental guidelines; Environmental standards; Environmentally responsible; Feed materials; Greenhouse gas reductions; Heat input; High-power; Industry trends; Massachusetts department of environmental protections; Medium size; Municipal Solid Waste; Plasma gasification; Plasma technology; Pulverized coal combustion boiler; Pulverized coals; Renewable energy credits; Repowering; Sulfur oxide; Syn-gas; Westinghouse; Wholly owned subsidiaries; Air pollution; Biomass; Boiler firing; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Coal gasification plants; Coal industry; Demolition; Energy conversion; Environmental protection; Feedstocks; Fire tube boilers; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Gas generators; Gas turbines; Gasification; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Laws and legislation; Leakage (fluid); Marine engines; Mercury (metal); Mining; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Plasmas; Retrofitting; Solid wastes; Standards; Steam power plants; Sulfur; Technology; Waste incineration; Coal combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349583861

The safety of personnel working on the range and the protection of expensive test equipment depend critically on the quality of forecasts of thunderstorms and associated hazards, including cloud-to-ground lightning, hail, strong winds, heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and tornadoes. The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Auto-Nowcast (ANC) system is one of the key forecast tools in the ATEC Four-Dimensional Weather System (4DWX) at WSMR, where its purpose is to aid WSMR meteorologists in their mission of very short term thunderstorm forecasting. Besides monitoring the weather activity throughout the region and warning personnel of potentially hazardous thunderstorms, forecasters play a key role in assisting with the day-to-day planning of test operations on the range by providing guidance with regard to weather conditions favorable to testing. Moreover, based on climatological information about the local weather conditions, forecasters advise their range customers about scheduling tests at WSMR months in advance. This paper reviews the NCAR ANC system, provides examples of the ANC system's use in thunderstorm forecasting, and describes climatological analyses of WSMR summertime thunderstorm activity relevant for long-range planning of tests. The climatological analysis illustrates that radar-detected convective cells with reflectivity of ≥35 dBZ at WSMR are 1) short lived, with 76% having lifetimes of less than 30 min; 2) small, with 67% occupying areas of less than 25 km2; 3) slow moving, with 79% exhibiting speeds of less than 4 m s-1; 4) moderately intense, with 80% showing reflectivities in excess of 40 dBZ; and 5) deep, with 80% of the storms reaching far enough above the freezing level to be capable of generating lightning. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climatology; Lightning; Military operations; Occupational risks; Personnel; Personnel testing; Precipitation (meteorology); Rain; Reflection; Storms; Testing; Thunderstorms; Weather forecasting; Anc systems; Climatological analysis; Climatological informations; Convective cells; Expensive tests; Forecast systems; Freezing levels; Ground lightnings; Heavy rainfalls; Life-times; Local weather conditions; National center for atmospheric researches; Nowcast; Range planning; Scale analysis; Short terms; Strong winds; Summer months; Test operations; Thunderstorm activities; U.s. armies; Weather conditions; White sands missile ranges; Forecasting; climatology; long range forecast; mesoscale meteorology; thunderstorm; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57649221133

However, local extirpation will be least likely where environmental change is slowest. Such locations will offer refugia for species with narrow environmental ranges, provide persistent sources of colonists, offer transitory homes for dispersers and serve as platform sites on which new community assemblages develop. Consequently, networks of protected areas that include such sites will conserve more biodiversity. Conventional protected area network selection algorithms give priority to areas with the lowest current cost. I added projected environmental change as a cost factor. I applied the modified algorithm in three arctic ecoregions where climate change is predicted to be extremely rapid and to 20 tropical ecoregions where the pace of climate change will be slower but many species are vulnerable to small changes. I identified protected area networks that protect places where change will be slowest in all ecoregions. These climate-adaptive protected area networks differ substantially from both current protected area networks and near-optimal networks that are based only on current costs. The modified method will help protected area planners to acquire potential climate refugia and to help implement adaptive conservation strategies for potential refugia that are already protected. It will also help reduce the risk that projected refugia are unknowingly allocated to land uses incompatible with their critical role in biodiversity conservation. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73849104615

However, knowledge of gas flux from irrigated agriculture is very limited. From April 2005 to October 2006, a study was conducted in the Aral Sea Basin, Uzbekistan, to quantify and compare emissions of N2O and CH4 in various annual and perennial land-use systems: irrigated cotton, winter wheat and rice crops, a poplar plantation and a natural Tugai (floodplain) forest. In the annual systems, average N2O emissions ranged from 10 to 150 μg N2O-Nm-2 h-1 with highest N2O emissions in the cotton fields, covering a similar range of previous studies from irrigated cropping systems. Emission factors (uncorrected for background emission), used to determine the fertilizer-induced N2O emission as a percentage of N fertilizer applied, ranged from 0.2% to 2.6%. Seasonal variations in N2O emissions were principally controlled by fertilization and irrigation management. Pulses of N2O emissions occurred after concomitant N-fertilizer application and irrigation. The unfertilized poplar plantation showed high N2O emissions over the entire study period (30 μg N2O-Nm-2h-1), whereas only negligible fluxes of N2O (&lt;2 μg N2O-Nm-2 h-1) occurred in the Tugai. Significant CH4 fluxes only were determined from the flooded rice field: Fluxes were low with mean flux rates of 32 mg CH4m-2 day-1 and a low seasonal total of 35.2 kg CH4 ha-1. The global warming potential (GWP) of the N2O and CH4 fluxes was highest under rice and cotton, with seasonal changes between 500 and 3000 kg CO2 eq.ha-1. The biennial cotton-wheat-rice crop rotation commonly practiced in the region would average a GWP of 2500 kg CO2 eq.ha-1 yr-1. The analyses point out opportunities for reducing the GWP of these irrigated agricultural systems by (i) optimization of fertilization and irrigation practices and (ii) conversion of annual cropping systems into perennial forest plantations, especially on less profitable, marginal lands. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.","Arid climate; Central Asia; Climate change; Cotton; Dryland agriculture; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Land use change; Rice; Tugai forest; Uzbekistan; Winter wheat","agricultural practice; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate effect; cotton; crop rotation; dryland farming; emission; global warming; greenhouse gas; irrigation; land use; methane; nitrous oxide; Aral Sea; Asia; Eurasia; West Asia; Gossypium hirsutum; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52449098464

Coal resources are abundant and coal is presently two to three times cheaper than gas. For many countries with large domestic coal reserves - the United States, China, Germany, and India, for example - the combination of cost and security concerns is an argument in favor of the continued widespread use of coal in the future. Advanced combustion technologies and environmental protection systems were introduced successfully on the market in the last 20 years. Nowadays, emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly CO 2, has become more and more important especially when burning coal. The European community introduced a CO 2-trading scheme motivated by the aim to keep to certain CO 2 reductions. However, considering the existing coal fleet, significant CO 2 reductions can be achieved by replacing old power stations with state-of-the-art power plants. Further reductions may be achieved by cofiring CO 2-neutral fuels such as biomass. Despite the increased share of renewable energy sources, carbon capture and storage technologies for coal need to be introduced over the long term to meet the challenging targets recently issued by the European community. The advantages of coal as fuel combined with the development of the technology for coal utilization offer a realistic perspective for reliable, economic, and environmentally friendly electricity generation.

Results of an economic evaluation of distributed solar photovoltaics and stationary fuel cells in the State of California are presented. To establish a range of value within California, solar photovoltaics were compared to natural gas-fired combined cycle and peaking plants: stationary fuel cells were compared to natural gas-fired generators and to typical pulverized coal-fired generators. Some of the avoided costs are quantified based on observable market prices, while some are quantified based on values derived from published data. It is estimated that 30% of California's stationary fuel cells operate using renewable digester gas from landfills and wastewater treatment plants, thereby avoiding the emissions associated with flaring that digester gas. Sixty percent of California's stationary fuel cells are estimated to operate in combined cooling, heating, and power mode, thus, avoiding boiler fuel (and related emissions) equivalent to the amount of useful waste heat captured. These aspects of California's stationary fuel cell market result in significantly reduced emissions when compared to conventional natural gas- or coal-fired generation, enhancing the potential contribution that such fuel cells can make to achieving California's reduced greenhouse gases emissions goals.

The problem can be viewed as an inverse to the one solved by the Viterbi algorithm on HMMs or by the CKY algorithm on SCFGs. We study this problem theoretically and obtain the first algorithmic results. We prove that the problem is NP-complete, even for a 3-letter emission alphabet, via a reduction from 3-SAT, a result that has implications for the hardness of RNA secondary structure design. We then develop a number of approaches for making the problem tractable. In particular, for HMMs we develop a branch-and-bound algorithm, which can be shown to have fixed-parameter tractable worst-case running time, exponential in the number of states of the HMM but linear in the length of the structure.

Some of the areas in which the largest funding is needed are waste management, waste water treatment, industrial pollution prevention and control, and climate change mitigation. According to the new Waste Management Plan, construction of county and regional waste management centers is envisaged where the waste will be processed in a sustainable manner (with material and energy recovery), in order to reduce the quantity of waste that is landfilled and decrease its reactivity. The existing landfills (mainly not in compliance with regulations) will be remedied and closed in five years period. Some of them will become transfer stations or recycling yards. The Republic of Croatia has recently ratified the Kyoto protocol after almost four years of negotiations, mainly about the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions level in the base year. By doing that Croatia has taken obligation to reduce its overall GHG emissions by at least 5% below the 1990 level during the commitment period 2008–2012. In order to reach that goal Croatia will have to implement different cost-effective measures such as use of renewable energy sources (mainly wind, biomass and solar energy), increase the energy efficiency in industry, service and building sector, introduce biofuels in transport etc. The activities on introducing the national emission trading scheme have already commenced in Croatia. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2008.","Climate change mitigation; Legislation; Waste management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078002663

For a further reduction of engine-out emissions, different measures are necessary such as: Especially an advanced emission and closed-loop combustion control has gained increased significance during the past years. The field of application for a closed-loop combustion control, for short-, mid-and long term applications, can be identified as: Precise correction of ambient conditions such as cold, hot, high altitude Adaptation to different fuel specifications (e.g. variation in cetane number, bio diesel fuel, potential for JP8 or kerosene operation) Mandatory for the support of pHCCI combustion strategies Adaptive compensation of production tolerances and drift during lifetime (e.g. injectors, boosting system, EGR system) Precise torque control General support of emission control Implementation of fast, real-time combustion modulation allowing optimized combustion conditions through the modulation of the available air and fuel handling parameters Adequate substitution or diagnostics of engine and/or aftertreatment sensors/actuators for example for OBD purposes A highly premixed combustion allows an overall reduction in exhaust emissions. This premixed combustion is achievable in low and medium engine speed and load areas where sufficient time permits the preparation of the mixture before combustion occurs. In combination with an optimized combustion system in form of hardware components that are harmonized to their corresponding mode of operation (e.g. bowl and injector nozzle design are matched to provide the best possible air utilization during combustion), there is a further emission reduction potential by applying an appropriate calibration and injection strategy. But it has to be taken into account that during transient and also steady-state operation under all ambient conditions an acceptable combustion noise level is maintained and engine misfiring must be avoided. This paper discusses a combustion control which considers the aspects of a conventional control of the center of combustion [7], [8] combined with a self-learning control algorithm of the main injection timing. The main issue is a closed-loop control of the global injection characteristic which describes the number of pre-injections used. The injection characteristic as the control mechanism is controlled by combustion stability and combustion noise as feedback signals. With this control mechanism, one or more pre-injections are activated for very short time periods to stabilize the combustion during transient operation and also for stationary operation with challenging combustion conditions such as low load operation. This paper explains the control strategy and presents results of vehicle emission tests.

Since the first IGCC power plants came into operation in the late 1970s, the more recent installations have matured and potential gains with sophisticated system integration concepts have been evaluated against its practicality during real term operation. The mayor system components have benefited from dedicated Research & Development over the last 2 decades and as a result several recent installations have reached industry standards, which are comparable to other electricity generation equipment. The highly pressurized IGCC gasification process provides the mechanism to effectively capture all key pollutants such as particulates, sulphur, mercury and carbon dioxide, prior to combustion. Pre-combustion capture is more economical than capturing these pollutants in a 'post-combustion' high volume and low concentration flue gas. It is expected that post-combustion clean-up technology will require o long-term development cycle before it is mature enough to be applied to existing coal plants. Even at that point, only a small portion of today's operating coal-fired plants will be able to adapt major retrofit conversions. In addition to the lower overall CO2 footprint, IGCC plants require less water than conventional coal plants do. As a consequence of the highly effective Syngas clean-up process, the remaining gas primarily consists of hydrogen with a concentration of over 80%. This fuel has been used in different concentrations in GE Gas Turbines for more than 25 years and is aided by either steam or nitrogen dilution to maintain low NOx emission levels.",,"Arsenic; Automobile parts and equipment; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climatology; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal industry; Coal storage; Combustion; Electric generators; Flue gases; Fuel storage; Gas fuel storage; Gas generators; Gas turbines; Gases; Gasification; Hydraulic machinery; Hydraulic motors; Hydrogen; Leakage (fluid); Mercury (metal); Metal casting; Nonmetals; Retrofitting; Smoke; Standardization; Steam power plants; Steam turbines; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Thermochemistry; Turbines; Turbomachinery; Waste incineration; Coal plants; Critical technologies; Current states; Development cycles; Electricity generations; Emission levels; Energy productions; Fuel bases; Gas turbine fuels; Gasification processes; Global climate changes; Hydrogen economies; Igcc plants; IGCC power plants; Industry standards; Integrated gasification combined cycles; Low concentrations; Nitrogen dilutions; Sophisticated systems; Syn gasses; System components; Coal gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57749088527

Five units (SM1-SM5) crystallized an alkaline to peralkaline, miaskitic mineral assemblage of amphibole, clinopyroxene, feldspar, nepheline, Fe-Ti oxides, zircon, apatite, fluorite and rarely olivine. The last magmatic batch (SM6) is characterized by an agpaitic mineral assemblage of aegirine, nepheline, alkali-feldspar, eudialyte and rare fluorite or sodalite. Coexisting mafic minerals constrain the crystallization conditions of the miaskitic rocks to about 850-600°C, whereas solidus temperatures below 500°C are indicated by coexisting alkali feldspars in the agpaitic rocks. Oxygen fugacities during the orthomagmatic stage are below the FMQ (fayalite-magnetite-quartz) buffer (ΔFMQ -0.5 to -2.0) whereas late hematite provides evidence of a higher relative oxygen fugacity during late-stage alteration. The Nd and oxygen isotope compositions of amphiboles and pyroxenes are homogeneous throughout the complex and suggest a common, mantle-derived magma source for all six units which is comparable with other Gardar intrusions. The hydrogen isotopic composition of amphiboles (δD-99 to -132‰) indicates low-temperature fluid-rock interaction with low fluid-rock ratios. Fluid inclusion studies indicate that H2O-NaCl fluids present during the magmatic stages in the miaskitic units had salinities of &lt;10 wt %NaCl eq. Calcite crystals in fluid inclusions within these rocks suggest that CO2 or HCO3- was an important component of the original fluid phase. In contrast, the agpaitic unit is characterized by a CH4-H2O-NaCl fluid. The C-O-H isotope compositions of the fluid inclusions in all units are consistent with mixing between a small volume of magmatic fluid and a large volume of meteoric water. The chemical evolution of the Motzfeldt complex is a type example of the connection of the transition from miaskitic to agpaitic mineral assemblages with redox-dependent fluid-solid equilibria. The transition from a relatively oxidized to a relatively reduced fluid is correlated with a change from a more reduced, Fe2+-bearing miaskitic (taramite-arfvedsonite, zircon, SM1-SM5) to a more oxidized, Fe3+-bearing agpaitic assemblage (aegirine, eudialyte, SM6). We suggest that coupled fluid-solid redox equilibria involving Fe2+, Fe3+, CO2 and CH4 in this case were simply driven by temperature decrease and an overall increase in Na (+ K) in the melt. This observation sheds light on the heavily debated miaskite-agpaite transition. The combined temperature and compositional effect stabilized Fe3+, CH4 and enhanced the solubility of Zr (possibly as Na-Zr-Si-O complexes) in the latest stage melt (SM6) resulting in the crystallization of an agpaitic mineral assemblage. In terms of redox conditions during crystallization, the Motzfeldt rocks represent an intermediate case in the Gardar Province between more oxidized, CO2-dominated intrusions such as the syenite-carbonatite complex of Grønnedal-Ika and CH4-dominated, more reduced complexes such as the peralkaline granitic Puklen and the agpaitic Ilímaussaq complex. © The Author 2008.

The direct acting injector provides a step reduction in engine-out emissions and fuel consumption. A revolutionary rather than evolutionary development path was followed in order to realise new levels of functionality to meet or exceed the customer requirements. After protecting the new concept with patents, throughout the early development cycle intensive use was made of numerical simulation tools to ensure a robust optimisation of dimensional values. This ensured that the number of design iterations required was minimised and shortened the time required to demonstrate proof-of-concept. The result is an injector with radically new configuration compared to existing products, which includes the novel arrangement of how the piezo actuator is placed inside the injector. This inventive step leads the way to improved electrical and hydraulic system efficiency which ultimately offers fuel economy and emissions benefits. Significant innovation was applied in the generation of new electrical drive software and hardware to realise the full potential of the injector.","Design; Diesel; Emissions; Injector; Pump","Common rail injector; Customer requirements; Design iteration; Development cycle; Diesel; Diesel injectors; Electrical drives; Engine-out emissions; Evolutionary development; Hydraulic system; Injector; Injector nozzle; Innovative approaches; Optimisations; Piezo actuator; Piezo stack; Proof of concept; Design; Fuel economy; Hydraulic equipment; Nozzle design; Particulate emissions; Patents and inventions; Pumps; Jet pumps",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866136604

Green power is being championed as the new fuel de jour kid on the block. Environmentalists and other global warming advocates are successfully lobbying their political agendas for emission caps, carbon sequestration, NOx and SOx and other greenhouse gas limits. In many cases, these efforts have resulted in the outright cancellation, delay or unit reductions of new coal-fired plants. Similarly, simple and combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) units, popularized during the Enron ""gas bubble"" era are at the mercy of unstable fuel prices which have, in large part, relegated this generation type from base load to load follow. Wind, biomass, hydro, photovoltaic and other renewables continue to produce an increased percentage of the power base but total contribution remains costly, inefficient and pitifully low. Enter the nuclear renaissance. A dramatic paradigm shift, even by the green power advocates, has allowed the nuclear phoenix to rise with the promise of emission-free power, generation efficiencies, increasing ROI revenues and demonstrating an enviable safety record since TMI and Chernobyl. Assuming this energy source conceives and bears the gestated fruit of a renaissance, the next decade will be telling in terms of the challenges brought forward by licensing, design, financing, construction and operation of a new generation of nuclear power reactors. Paramount among these is a new, time-tested generation of construction materials that will be evaluated to insure a 40 to 60 or even 80 year operational life of these new plants. Consider the problematic copper materials that were chosen during the early 70's for their high thermal conductivity, competitive cost and ease of fabrication. Contrast these past lessons-learned to current-day, state-of-the-art generation fleet construction standards where demonstrated long-term sustainability coupled with state-of-the-art designs &amp; materials must emerge as the prominent industry players of choice. The paper will examine these and other relevant aspects of the technical and commercial supply chain that is predicted to both challenge and reward designers and material suppliers well into the next decade.

A multidecadal drought event some 850 years ago may have eliminated maize cultivation by the first human settlers of the Colorado Plateau, the Fremont and Anasazi people, and contributed to the abandonment of their settlements. Even today, ranching and farming are vulnerable to drought and struggle to persist. The recent use of the Colorado Plateau primarily as rangeland has made this region less tolerant to drought due to unprecedented levels of surface disturbances that destroy biological crusts, reduce soil carbon and nitrogen stocks, and increase rates of soil erosion. The most recent drought of 2002 demonstrated the vulnerability of the Colorado Plateau in its currently depleted state and the associated costs to the local economies. New climate predictions for the southwestern United States include the possibility of a long-term shift to warmer, more arid conditions, punctuated by megadroughts not seen since medieval times. It remains to be seen whether the present-day extractive industries, aided by external subsidies, can persist in a climate regime that apparently exceeded the adaptive capacities of the Colorado Plateau's prehistoric agriculturalists.","Biological crust; Climate change; Megadrought; Ranching","arid region; climate change; drought; ranching; rangeland; vulnerability; Colorado Plateau; North America; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58749097658

So far the European Union started the largest scheme as from 2005, which is extended and will be further extended in the future towards 2020. In the USA a federal GHG ETS might emerge after the presidential elections in 2009. But now already several groups of US States are developing GHG trading schemes, the Western Climate Initiative (WCI) headed by California, The Regional Greenhouse Gas Intiative (RGGI) at the US East Coast and recently the Midwestern Climate Pact (MCP). The existing and emerging trading schemes are expected to be linked to each other, which will form the gradual growth of a global carbon market. Experience and analysis have learned that the method for the allocation of allowances is as important as the scarcity of allowances. The allocation drives the behaviour of companies when they are making decisions to invest in low carbon technologies. Four allocation methods are discussed: (1) auctioning, (2) cap & trade for individual companies based on historical grandfathering - allocation based on historic emissions - (3) performance-based allocation and (4) performance-based cap & trade. Auctioning is the ideal method if applied globally, but if not it causes ""leakage"" of emissions and ""import of unemployment"". Border Adjustments to protect industry against the loss of competitiveness are judged to be impossible in practice. Cap & trade for individual companies based on historical grandfathering causes all kinds of distortions and significant economic rents for electricity producers. In the European Union, historical grandfathering will be abandoned. Performance-based allocation solves all distortions, but now the total cap is not ensured. Therefore we propose performance-based cap & trade is proposed as the solution towards auctioning in the long term. It is argued that auctioning is only feasible when all developed and developing nations - including China, India, Brazil, etc. - have adopted GHG Emissions Tradings Schemes for industrial companies.

This paper reviews the distinct lines of inquiry that have been used to examine the influence of climate on tourist decision making, and attempts to define optimal climatic conditions for tourism. The study examined tourist perceptions of optimal climatic conditions (for temperature, sunshine, wind) and the relative importance of 4 climatic parameters (temperature, precipitation, sunshine, wind) in 3 major tourism environments (beach-coastal, urban, mountains). A survey instrument was administered to university students (n = 831) representing the young-adult travel segment, in 3 countries (Canada, New Zealand, Sweden). Three salient findings include: significant variation in the perceived optimum climatic conditions for the 3 major tourism environments, differences in the relative importance of the 4 climatic parameters in the 3 tourism environments, and similarities as well as differences in the climatic preferences of respondents from the 3 nations. These findings have several implications for the literature on climate and tourism, including the development of climate indices for tourism, destination choice and travel pattern modelling, and climate change impact assessments.

This approach is based on the use of a mixed fuel where an additive or a low boiling point fuel such as CO2, gas fuel, or gasoline is mixed with a higher boiling point fuel such as diesel gas oil. When producing such a fuel, the vapour-liquid equilibrium in the twophase region where the liquid and vapour phases of both components coexist is taken into account. In designing a mixed fuel, the authors intend to control both the physical process in the spray such as fuel evaporation and vapour air mixing and the chemical processes including spontaneous ignition and with reactions with regard to NOx, particulate matter (PM), and hydrocarbon (HC) formation. In this study flash boiling of mixed fuel is particularly focused on enhancing the mixing process in the spray because it has the potential to achieve fast evaporation and relatively lean and homogeneous mixtures. Experiments were carried out using two types of mixed fuel, both of which can generate flash boiling during injection events. In an experiment using a rapid compression machine (RCM) and an optical engine, mixed fuels consisting of liquefied CO2 as an additive and n-tridecane representing gas oil were employed with the aim of simultaneously reducting soot and NOx emissions. The high-speed images acquired for sprays reacting in the RCM and the engine clearly showed a significant reduction of soot formation in the spray. Reductions of soot and NOx emissions as well as the fuel consumption were also confirmed by emission measurements and a combustion analysis respectively. In other experiments, different types of mixed fuel consisting of gas or gasoline and gas oil were tested to see the effects on both the evaporation and ignition processes. The result of an engine experiment showed marked reductions of soot and HC emissions and fuel consumption. © IMechE 2008.","Combustion; Diesel engine; Flash boiling; Liquefied CO2; Spray; Two-component fuel","Boiling liquids; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Mixed gas fuels; Mixtures; Diesel gas oils; Flash boiling; Rapid compression machines; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40749162721

These hallmark images and statistics of climate change are often accompanied by scientists discussing the cause of these changes and how to address them. Although not unanimous, most scientists place the blame for climate change squarely on human action, and specifically on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For this majority, the logical manner for addressing climate change is by altering human behavior to reduce GHG emissions. With scientific evidence and popular support on their side, state and local lawmakers throughout the United States have taken it upon themselves to reduce GHG emissions. Over the past few years, the attention of state and local lawmakers to climate change has led to the proliferation of various laws regulating GHG emissions (both directly and indirectly). This state and local action has come despite what some consider the federal government's failure to address climate change on the national level. As one of the major sources of GHG emissions, buildings have received much of the state and local regulatory focus. This focus on buildings is driven by statistics showing that buildings consume 39% of all energy in the United States and 72% of the nation's electricity, while producing 39% of GHG emissions.4 According to the numbers, buildings are responsible for more GHG emissions than either industry or transportation. The statistics also show a continual increase in the level of GHG emissions from buildings. Although new laws regulating buildings vary widely, they typically apply green building standards to new construction and substantial renovations. Generally speaking, early enactments addressed public sector buildings through green building mandates and private sector buildings through green building incentives. Since the early enactments, new regulations have become increasingly broad, including mandates by several local governments applying green standards to private sector buildings. Based on current trends and the political atmosphere surrounding climate change issues, the application of mandatory green building standards to the private sector will not only continue, but may eventually encompass existing private sector buildings. Although the trend toward regulating private sector buildings is clear, the origin of future regulations is still an open question. While states and local governments took an early lead in addressing climate change, the future bodes well for regional pacts and perhaps national regulation from the federal government.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70549104495

The growing evidence that LAM climate statistics can be sensitive to initial conditions suggests that a deterministic verification of LAM solutions in terms of finescale atmospheric features might be misguided. In this study a 20-member ensemble of LAM integrations with perturbed initial conditions, driven by NCEP-NCAR reanalyses, is conducted for a summer season over a midlatitude domain. Ensemble simulations allow for the separation of the downscaled information in two parts: a unique, reproducible component associated with lateral-boundary and surface forcing, and an irreproducible component associated with internal variability. The partition in the reproducible and irreproducible components and their seasonal statistics is examined as a function of horizontal length scale, geographical position within the domain, height, and weather episodes during the season. The scale analysis of time-dependent model variables shows that, at scales smaller than a few hundred kilometers, the irreproducible component dominates, on average, the model solution, implying that the downscaled information at these scales is mainly in stochastic form. The constraint exerted by the surface forcing on the internal variability is weak. For seasonal averages, the reproducible component dominates at all scales, although for precipitation the reproducible and irreproducible components are of the same order of magnitude at scales smaller than 150 km. These results imply a need for a probabilistic approach to LAM climate simulations and their verification, especially for shorter integration times, from months to seasons. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climate simulations; Climate statistics; Ensemble simulations; Geographical positions; High resolutions; Initial conditions; Internal variabilities; Length-scale; Limited-area models; Midlatitude; Model solutions; Objective analysis; Order of magnitudes; Probabilistic approaches; Regional climate models; Scale analysis; Summer seasons; Surface forcing; Time-dependent models; Integration; Stochastic models; climate modeling; downscaling; ensemble forecasting; probability; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-64149097082

Hydrophilic oxide supported Pt catalysts show promise for this. Such catalysts are bi-functional where Pt activates CO and the oxide activates H2O. Among the catalysts studied, Pt/TiO2 was, intrinsically the most active. However, it deactivated with time due to sintering of Pt particles assisted by oxygenate specie, (HCHO) formed during reaction. Addition of Re to the catalyst help overcome sintering and thus deactivation. This catalyst also shows enhanced activity. Kinetic and in situ spectroscopic studies indicate that, for Pt/TiO2, WGS reaction occurs via two routes, viz, (i) an associative formate route involving red-ox regeneration and (ii) the classical red-ox sequence. In the case of Pt-Re/TiO2 catalyst rhenium is present at least partly as ReOx, and provides an additional red-ox route for WGS reaction in which ReOx is reduced by CO generating CO2 and re-oxidized by H2O forming H2. Observations from kinetic (transient and steady state) experiments and in situ IR spectroscopic studies are used to understand the working of the catalyst and justify the mechanistic reaction sequences discussed above.

Black carbon (BC) is an useful tracer of combustion processes and is likely to be relatively stable in snow for periods of time relevant for the reconstruction of climate and atmospheric aerosol histories. The BC content of snow may also influence albedo. However, levels of BC (0.1-4 micrograms per kilogram) in pristine snow are very low and measurements quite challenging. Artifacts (e.g., filter sorption and colloid passage) in methods that are currently being applied may result in significant biases. To overcome these limitations we have developed a direct optical method for BC measurement in melted snow. We're applying long-path (1 meter) optical cells and low-noise spectrophotometry to capture the absorption spectrum of suspended BC. After correction for absorption by non-BC components and dissolved species, one can isolate the BC signal. Calibrations with a variety of BC-containing standards are linear and reproducible and detection limits are adequate for quantifying trace levels of BC in snow.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955605610

Over the past few decades only certain vaporization technologies were considered and employed based on past ""tried and true"" operating experience by the regulators. With greater emphasis on energy conservation and environmental impacts, it has become apparent that other approaches to LNG vaporization are needed for future LNG terminals. Proposals have been put forward with innovative technologies which have been used successfully in other cryogenic industries. Some are completely original. With high emphasis on the environmental impacts associated with the LNG vaporization, the options were reduced, especially for the ""tried and true"" group of technologies. This opened the field for other alternative technologies. Those with lower emissions and lesser environmental impact began to get more consideration. As the fuel prices climbed, the option for fuel gas fired technologies has become less attractive. Two approaches that are receiving considerable attention involve use of ambient air as a source of heat. Historically, the least utilized for LNG re-gasification, ambient air vaporizers are steadily rising in the choice of technology options being considered. Significantly reduced emissions and limited environmental impact have brought the use of ambient air into favor with those pursuing new permits.

We have developed a new concept, by which the nets are designed to specifically filter sunlight, concomitant with providing the desired physical protection. A series of photoselective nets (Color Nets) was developed for outdoor use, each one absorbing different spectral bands, and at the same time increasing the relative proportion of scattered/diffused light. The spectral manipulation is aimed at specifically promoting physiological responses, while light scattering improves light penetration into the inner canopy. The relative enriching of the intercepted light with ""good"" parts of the spectrum, while reducing ""bad"" parts, may allow better utilization of the solar energy. Earlier studies of ornamental crops, traditionally grown under black shade nets, revealed differential responses to the photoselective shading. Ongoing studies of low-shading Color Nets in numerous fruit crops and climatic regions showed that nets of the same shading factor but different chromatic properties can differentially affect various attributes of tree performance, including production, fruit size and quality, and advancement or delay in the timing of harvest. The netting further ameliorates extreme climatic fluctuations, reduces heat/chill stresses, and improves the resulting canopy activity and water use. The results demonstrate the potency of photoselective netting for improving the agro-economical performance of horticultural crops, especially (but not only) in harsh climates and arid zones.","Colored nets; Extending harvest season; Fruit size; Fruit yield; Light quality; Protected agriculture",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149127147

Six landscape strategies were studied, using different combinations of trees, lawn, and an overhead shade-mesh. The effects of these treatments were tested in two adjacent courtyards at Sde-Boqer, in the Negev Highlands of southern Israel, during summer (July-August). On average, air temperature in the non-vegetated exposed courtyard reached a maximum of about 34°C in mid-afternoon. Compared to this base case, a configuration with shade trees and grass yielded a daytime temperature depression of up to 2.5°C, while shading the courtyard with a fabric shading mesh, counter-intuitively, caused a relative increase of nearly 1°C. Unshaded grass was found to provide only a small air temperature depression and had the highest water requirement. However when the grass was shaded, either by the trees or by the shade mesh, a synergic effect produced greater cooling as well as a reduction in total water use of over 50%. The ""cooling efficiency"" of these strategies was calculated as the ratio between the sensible heat removed from the space and the latent heat equivalent of the evaporated water. This measure is proposed as a criterion for evaluating landscape strategies in arid regions, where the water resource is scarce.","Cooling; Efficient water use; Hot arid regions; Landscaping","Arid regions; Atmospheric temperature; Cooling; Water resources; Water supply; Air temperature; Climatic analysis; Cooling effects; Cooling efficiency; Hot arid region; Landscaping; Outdoor cooling; Sensible heat; Shade trees; Synergic effects; Temperature depression; Urban landscape; Water requirements; Water use; Water use efficiency; Forestry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067728055

Statistically- based inventory efforts that started in Scandinavian countries in the 1920s raised interest in developing a similar program in the U.S. The U.S. Congress established the research branch of the U.S. Forest Service in 1928, shortly after Dr. Yrjö Ilvessalo, leader of the first Finnish national forest inventory, met with President Calvin Coolidge. Congress charged the Forest Service to find ""facts as may be necessary in the determination of ways and means to balance the timber budget of the United States"". As a result, Forest Survey maintained a timber focus for much its history. As society's interest in forests changed over time, so did information needs. Conflicts over resource allocation and use could not be resolved without up-to-date knowledge of forest status and trends. In response to society's needs, the Forest Inventory and Analysis program has evolved from Forest Survey to address diverse topics such as forest health, carbon storage, wildlife habitat, air pollution, and invasive plants, while continuing its mandate to monitor the Nation's timber supply. The Forest Inventory and Analysis program collects data on all land ownerships on an annual basis.

Experiments using SPT-2 wire were performed per UL1699 standards at each voltage level with equal nominal steady-state non-arcing load currents (e.g. 5A rms, 10A rms, 15A rms, 20A rms, and 30A rms). It was shown that the arc power, dissipated in the series arc, was greater at 240V rms than 120V rms due to increased arcing current. This was attributed to the arcing path resistance being a larger percentage of the total circuit resistance, reducing arcing current at 120V rms, and also to an increase in the number of arcing half-cycles at 240V rms because the higher system voltage was more likely to breakdown the gap than at 120V rms. Both these factors combined created a higher average arcing current at 240V rms. Furthermore, the increased arc power would result in a hotter carbonized contact gap - further reducing the breakdown strength of the gap. The average arc voltage however remained about equal for both voltage levels. These results may be useful for exploring additions to the UL1699 ""fire curve"" for 240V rms applications.","AFCI; Arc voltage; Arcing fault; Combination-circuit-breaker; Fire; Residential; series arc; UL1699","AFCI; Arc voltage; Arcing fault; Combination-circuit-breaker; Residential; series arc; UL1699; Electric arcs; Electric circuit breakers; Electric resistance; Fires; Inert gas welding; Wire; Cavity resonators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67249140685

Enhanced coalbed methane recovery (ECBM), involving injection of pure N2/CO2 or a mixture of the two, such as power plant flue gas, is a technology that has the potential to recover a larger fraction of methane in place without excessively reducing the reservoir pressure. CO2-ECBM has an added benefit that a potentially large volume of greenhouse gas can be stored in deep coal seams globally. The use of numerical models is essential in the development of the ECBM and CO 2 storage technology. The quasisteady state Fickian diffusion equation, together with the Langmuir equation, has been almost exclusively used in numerical simulation of primary coalbed methane production. Assuming that the individual gas component in a multicomponent system diffuses independently, the quasi-steady state Fickian diffusion equation can be readily extended to model mixed-gas diffusion. In the recent years, attempts have been made to use this approach, in conjunction with the extended Langmuir equation, to model ECBM/CO2 storage field pilots as well as laboratory flooding tests. However, this modelling approach for mixed-gas diffusion lacks theoretical rigour as the interaction between different gas components is not accounted for, though the practical significance of doing so in coalbeds is not well understood at present. A reservoir simulation sensitivity study on the Yubari CO2 storage pilot project, Japan, is presented. The sensitivity study with CO2 and CH4 sorption times indicates that the sorption time for CO2 has a much pronounced impact on the backproduced gas composition. The study has also highlighted the limitation of the extended Langmuir equation for ternary system predictions. Although inconclusive, the sensitivity results suggest that the N2 component sorption in the coalbed reservoir is over-estimated by at least 20% by the model.

Design/methodology/approach - The static simulated experiment in high-pressure autoclave and the surface analysis methods of EPMA and XRD were carried out to study the corrosion effect. Findings - Under the following conditions: T=360±3°C, pH = 9.40±0.10, cO2&lt;0.020 mg/l, the density of pitting corrosion on specimens without a protective film increased with the increase of C Cl- content, while CCl- was &gt; 0.2 mg/l. The film on specimens with integral films would not dissolve observably even until the CCl- concentration was as high as 0.8 mg/l. Films with corrosion pits would begin dissolving when the Cl- concentration reached 0.4 mg/l. The main constituents of the oxidative films in the gas and liquid phases both were Fe3O4. Practical implications - In order to prevent carbon steel from corroding in boiler water containing Cl- under conditions of low-phosphate and low-sodium hydroxide treatment, the concentration of Cl- should be strictly controlled. Originality/value - It was found that the presence of excessive Cl- in boiler water accelerated the corrosion of No. 20 carbon steel and the maximum permissible concentration of Cl- under the conditions (temperature and pressure) of sub-critical drum boilers was 0.2 mg/l. The research results can provide theoretical guidelines for preventing the facilities of power plants from corroding. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Films (states for matter); High temperatures; Steel Corrosion; Water","High temperature effects; Phosphates; Steel corrosion; Water; Chloride ions; High-temperature boiler; Carbon steel; Carbon steel; High temperature effects; Phosphates; Steel corrosion; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38149099333

The waste sector can contribute significantly to reach this aim. In Germany the total sum of municipal waste has remained constant over the years. With economic growth at 15 % (1992-2001), this suggests a severing of the link between waste quantity and economic growth. Within the overall quantity, there are further signs of a significant shift in waste quantities, away from disposal in favour of the separate collection and recovery of such waste. Emissions of climate relevant gases from the waste sector were significantly reduced. Since June 2005 no untreated waste is allowed to go to landfill anymore in Germany. The most important impact on climate change is the avoided methane emitted from landfills and also the recovery of energy from waste: e.g. Waste-to-energy plants avoid carbon dioxide emissions by displacing fossil fuels from power generation. Half of the produced energy is regarded as renewable because it derives from the biodegradable part of waste.

In this perspective an atmospheric modelling system based on the chemical transport model FARM has been applied for the year 2005 over a nested domain including the metropolitan area. To improve the description of local scale atmospheric circulation characteristics, observational meteorological data are analysed using the Isentropic Analysis package (ISAN). Since urban traffic emissions represent a relevant source of pollutants, hourly emissions coming from this sector have been estimated by means of a traffic assignment model, based on a source-destination approach, coupled with an emission model based on COPERT-3 methodology. The emissions from the other sectors have been derived from the national inventory and then disaggregated at the municipal level. The analysis of model results for the year 2005 against experimental data reveals a good agreement suggesting the use of the modelling system to study the impact on the air quality of different emission control strategies at both regional and urban scales. The 2010 has been considered as the future year base case scenario and the traffic limitation within the Rome urban core has been considered as an emission control action. The impact of this emission scenario has been then analysed by means of a semi-empiric approach: a significant decrease of PM10 and NO2 yearly average concentrations is expected to occur at urban traffic stations while the minimum reduction is expected at urban background and rural stations.","Air quality assessment and management; Emission control strategies; Modelling; Traffic emission; Urban air pollution","air quality; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; conference proceeding; emission control; traffic emission; urban pollution; Eurasia; Europe; Italy; Lazio; Roma [Lazio]; Rome; Southern Europe",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56349087066

In southern India, the ENSO condition to some degree determines the potential of the ensuing rainy season in terms of amount of summer monsoon rainfall that is likely to be received in the region. Although it is difficult to predict the distribution of rainfall at a site or region, the prediction of rainfall amount would help farmers to plan cropping strategies to minimize climatic risks to crop production. Using crop simulation models and long-term weather records (1961 to 2006), productivity and net income of three sequential cropping systems (maize-chickpea, soybean-chickpea and groundnut-chickpea) and three intercrop systems (maize/pigeonpea, soybean/pigeonpea and groundnut/pigeonpea) were evaluated for the three ENSO conditions for Nandyal situated in the Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh. The simulation analysis showed that groundnut-chickpea sequential, groundnut/pigeonpea and soybean/pigeonpea intercrop systems during the La-Niña years, while maize/pigeonpea and groundnut/pigeonpea intercrop systems during the El Niño years gave higher net income at low risk among the cropping systems studied. During Neutral years, groundnut/pigeonpea intercrop systems was the most promising in terms of net income The study has demonstrated that assessing the potential of seasons based on ENSO condition would help farmers maximize incomes and reduce climatic risks by providing more efficient cropping systems options in the region.","Climatic risk; Cropping systems; ENSO condition; Rainfall prediction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904111170

The inventory also includes indirect potential future GHG emissions from electricity usage and employee commuting and business travel. A mitigation assessment was performed to reflect the proposed Green Building design for the facility, including emission reductions resulting from use of geothermal heating, purchased renewable electricity, use of on-site photovoltaics, and an electric motor/generator dynamometer for generating electricity, and outdoor open space requirements. Total future annual GHG emissions were estimated to be 8679 ton/yr CO2 equivalent (CO2E) , equivalent to that from about 377 US households annually, with 97% of emissions resulting from stationary combustion sources and electricity usage. Total future annual GHG emissions avoided as a result of the Green Building design was estimated to be 1674 ton/yr CO2E, which represents a 16% reduction from potential emissions. The estimated total annual GHG emissions from the proposed vehicle testing research is equivalent that from 377 US households. Annual avoided emissions are 1674 ton/yr CO2E, which represents a 16% reduction from total potential annual emissions. The avoided emissions are a result of reduced stationary combustion from the use of a geothermal unit, from electricity generated by photovoltaic panels and the electric motor/generator dynamometer, and from renewable electricity purchased in accordance with state Executive Orders.

Major EU directives, commonly known as the Promotion of Renewable Electricity, Biofuels and Landfill Directives, along with the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and parts of the Common Agricultural Policy, are some of the most important drivers behind the growth of bioenergy in the EU27 today. The report compares how Germany, Finland and the Netherlands have implemented the directives, examining the policy frameworks in each country and the plans and mechanisms in place to reach national targets. A wider European perspective for each directive is then drawn out, and recommendations for RD&D actions to meet the EU directive targets or obligations in each area are outlined. The report also takes a broader look at the effects the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and the Common Agricultural Policy are having on the use of biomass in the EU with RD&D recommendations for each area. Bioenergy NoE advocates stronger communication and co-operation among various EU-wide projects and initiatives focusing on bioenergy development. Industry commitment to RD&D projects is, however, the only direct path for bringing state-of-the-art technology and products to market. Building sustainable production pathways and addressing competition with food products is crucial to developing environmentally-sound biofuels. Research in renewable electricity from biomass should prioritize development of higher efficiency power production and power-to-heat ratios in combined heat and power plants over new technology development. In the biofuels field, RD&D should prioritize the development of more sustainable, second generation biofuels. To meet landfill diversion targets, thermal conversion and energy recovery of municipal solid waste in some EU countries will have to increase. Meeting the European targets set for 2020 requires significant technology development in order to introduce a new generation of biofuels and feedstocks: this is the focus for Bioenergy NoE RD&D.

Seasonal dynamics of aquatic communities are - among others - regulated by the climate, especially by temperature. In this case study we attempted the simulation modelling of the seasonal dynamics of a copepod species, Cyclops vicinus, which ranks among the zooplankton community, based on a quantitative database containing ten years of data from the Danube's Göd area. We set up a simulation model predicting the abundance of Cyclops vicinus by considering only temperature as it affects the abundance of population. The model was adapted to eight years of daily temperature data observed between 1981 and 1994 and was tested successfully with the additional data of two further years. The model was run with the data series of climate change scenarios specified for the period around 2070-2100. On the other hand we looked for the geographically analogous areas with the Göd region which are mostly similar to the future climate of the Göd area. By means of the above-mentioned points we can get a view how the climate of the region will change by the end of the 21st century, and the way the seasonal dynamics of a chosen planktonic crustacean species may follow this change. According to our results the area of Göd will be similar to the northern region of Greece. The maximum abundance of the examined species occurs a month to one and a half months earlier, moreover larger variances are expected between years in respect of the abundance. The deviations are expected in the direction of smaller or significantly larger abundance not observed earlier. © 2008, Penkala Bt.","Cyclops vicinus; Geographical analogy; Hydrobiology; Simulation modelling","Copepoda; Crustacea; Cyclops vicinus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149103960

The issue of baseline setting for prospective CDM projects is a complex one in the Indian context. The baselines constructed on the basis of aggregate emission rates at the national level are unlikely to be precise as methane emission rates are influenced by the livestock and feed characteristics, which vary widely across regions in an agro-climatically diverse country like India. This calls for establishing a project specific baseline underpinned with regional methane emission rates. The various aspects of sustainable development that merit consideration in formulating a CDM project in the Indian dairy sector include; increasing the productivity of animals, increasing the net income of producers, decreasing the cost of milk production and the transfer of safe technologies. The projects in the sector would be able to meet the ‘additionality’ conditions of the CDM. However, there are a number of constraints in implementing the enteric methane mitigation strategies through a CDM project at the field level.

The DGVMs are also coupled to a fast 'climate analogue model', based on the Hadley Centre General Circulation Model (GCM), and run into the future for four Special Report Emission Scenarios (SRES): A1FI, A2, B1, B2. Results show that all DGVMs are consistent with the contemporary global land carbon budget. Under the more extreme projections of future environmental change, the responses of the DGVMs diverge markedly. In particular, large uncertainties are associated with the response of tropical vegetation to drought and boreal ecosystems to elevated temperatures and changing soil moisture status. The DGVMs show more divergence in their response to regional changes in climate than to increases in atmospheric CO2 content. All models simulate a release of land carbon in response to climate, when physiological effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on plant production are not considered, implying a positive terrestrial climate-carbon cycle feedback. All DGVMs simulate a reduction in global net primary production (NPP) and a decrease in soil residence time in the tropics and extra-tropics in response to future climate. When both counteracting effects of climate and atmospheric CO2 on ecosystem function are considered, all the DGVMs simulate cumulative net land carbon uptake over the 21st century for the four SRES emission scenarios. However, for the most extreme A1FI emissions scenario, three out of five DGVMs simulate an annual net source of CO2 from the land to the atmosphere in the final decades of the 21st century. For this scenario, cumulative land uptake differs by 494PgC among DGVMs over the 21st century. This uncertainty is equivalent to over 50 years of anthropogenic emissions at current levels. © Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.","Biogeography; Carbon cycle feedbacks; DGVM","biogeography; carbon budget; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate cycle; climatology; ecosystem function; environmental change; general circulation model; modeling; net primary production; soil moisture; terrestrial ecosystem; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48949103628

The essence of this phenomenon is slow oxidation of coal leavings caused by air flow, which, in conjunction with insufficient heat transfer produces temperature rise above its ignition value. Main problem concerning self combustion phenomenon is proper estimation of the process scale. The most efficient way dealing this problem would be constant monitoring of mine atmosphere composition in selected region located inside goafs zone, but this kind of activity is impossible to realize mainly because of technical constrains. One of the solution assumes constant monitoring of air composition in upper corner, in this case however content of carbon monoxide could indicate already existing fire in the goafs, not the self heating conditions. Taking into account above observations, it would be good solution to utilize temperature sensors in longwall's upper corner as an additional source of information concerning temperature changes in longwall, which depends, besides presence of electrical equipment also on goafs thermal activity. Of course one ought to calibrate sensors due to additional heat sources (cutter, conveyor etc.), but measured constant rise of temperature in this place could be the signal for early prevent action. Unfortunately this kind of solution meets the same constrains as previous one. Therefore the best solution for approaching this phenomenon is to deal with it numerically. Presented paper discuss results of three - dimensional CFD simulation of temperature and carbon monoxide propagation inside goafs - longwall complex. Because of high Reynolds number, Re > 105, which implies turbulent flow in longwall excavations, the calculation was realized using k-ω-SST model (proved to be suitable by Wala). The simulation results are represent in a form of three-dimensional distributions of temperature inside goafs and longwall zone (fig. 9), carbon monoxide concentration (fig. 14) and as a two dimensional charts of temperature and carbon monoxide in selected places of goaf-longwall complex (fig. 11 and 16).","Carbon monoxide emission; Carbon self-combustion; Goafs; Long wall ventilation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954912748

On SOFIA, FLITECAM will take advantage of lower backgrounds from 3-5 microns and will provide access to spectral regions completely or partially absorbed by water vapor at even the best ground-based sites. FLITECAM employs large cryogenic optics and an ALADDIN III 1024 × 1024 InSb detector to inscribe an 8 arcminute field of view with 0.48 arcsec/pixel spatial resolution. The optical components are cooled with liquid nitrogen and a liquid helium reservoir is used to establish an operational temperature of 30 K for the InSb array. FLITECAM has two primary observing modes, imaging and spectroscopy. A pupil-viewing mode, for examination of the primary mirror surface, and a high-speed snapshot mode for occultation observations are also provided. Ground-based commissioning of the instrument using the Shane 3-meter telescope at UCO/Lick Observatory has been completed successfully. In addition to broad-band filters, the imaging mode accommodates several narrow-band filters. A data reduction pipeline processes dithered image sets in real-time during the flight. The grism spectroscopy mode employs three direct-ruled KRS-5 grisms and fixed slits of either 1""60 or 2""60 to yield resolving powers (FWHM) of R~1700 and 900 respectively. Observations are scripted using AORs (Astronomical Observation Requests) in both modes. A pilot survey of 3.3 micron emission in planetary nebulae performed with FLITECAM at UCO/Lick Observatory demonstrates the potential of the grism mode.","Airborne astronomy; Grisms; Instrumentation; PAH features","3-5 micron; Airborne astronomy; Astronomical observation; Broad bands; Cryogenic optics; Field of views; Grisms; Ground based; High-speed; Image sets; Imaging modes; InSb detector; Instrumentation; Liquid helium; Narrow band filter; Operational temperature; Optical components; PAH features; Pilot surveys; Planetary nebulae; Primary mirrors; Spatial resolution; Spectral region; Stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomies; Astrophysics; Buildings; Data reduction; Emission spectroscopy; Helium; Instruments; Liquefied gases; Liquid nitrogen; NASA; Observatories; Reservoirs (water); Superfluid helium; Water vapor; Astronomical satellites",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66249098566

Small losses from this large pool could have significant impacts on future atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, so the response of soils to global warming is of critical importance when assessing climate carbon cycle feedbacks. Models that have coupled climate and carbon cycles show a large divergence in the size of the predicted biospheric feedback to the atmosphere. Central questions that still remain when attempting to reduce this uncertainty in the response of soils to global warming are (1) the temperature sensitivity of soil organic matter, especially the more recalcitrant pools; (2) the balance between increased carbon inputs to the soil from increased production and increased losses due to increased rates of decomposition; and (3) interactions between global warming and other aspects of global change, including other climatic effects (e.g., changes in water balance), changes in atmospheric composition (e.g., increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration) and land-use change. In this chapter, we review trends in warming, factors affecting the response of soil carbon to global warming, evidence on the balance between changes in production and soil organic matter decomposition, recent research on the temperature sensitivity of soil organic carbon pools, methods for measuring soil responses to global warming, approaches to modeling soil responses to global warming, regions/ecosystems likely to be most vulnerable to future warming, and available technologies to reduce vulnerability of soil carbon to the impacts of future global warming. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We investigate how different representations of the ocean physics in the models, which represent the range of models currently in use, affect the evolution of CO2 uptake in the North Atlantic. The buffer effect of the ocean carbon system would be expected to reduce ocean CO2 uptake as the ocean absorbs increasing amounts of CO2. We find that the strength of the buffer effect is very dependent on the model ocean state, as it affects both the magnitude and timing of the changes in uptake. The timescale over which uptake of CO2 in the North Atlantic drops to below preindustrial levels is particularly sensitive to the ocean state which sets the degree of buffering; it is less sensitive to the choice of atmospheric CO2 forcing scenario. Neglecting physical climate change effects, North Atlantic CO2 uptake drops below preindustrial levels between 50 and 300 years after stabilisation of atmospheric CO2 in different model configurations. Storage of anthropogenic carbon in the North Atlantic varies much less among the different model configurations, as differences in ocean transport of dissolved inorganic carbon and uptake of CO2 compensate each other. This supports the idea that measured inventories of anthropogenic carbon in the real ocean cannot be used to constrain the surface uptake. Including physical climate change effects reduces anthropogenic CO2 uptake and storage in the North Atlantic further, due to the combined effects of surface warming, increased freshwater input, and a slowdown of the meridional overturning circulation. The timescale over which North Atlantic CO2 uptake drops to below preindustrial levels is reduced by about one-third, leading to an estimate of this timescale for the real world of about 50 years after the stabilisation of atmospheric CO2. In the climate change experiment, a shallowing of the mixed layer depths in the North Atlantic results in a significant reduction in primary production, reducing the potential role for biology in drawing down anthropogenic CO2. © Springer-Verlag 2008.",,"atmospheric chemistry; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; meridional circulation; mixed layer; overturn; primary production; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50449109187

However, biodiesel utilization presents several challenges, including decreased fuel energy density and increased emissions of smog-generating nitrogen oxides (NOx). These negative aspects can likely be mitigated via closed-loop combustion control provided the properties of the fuel blend can be estimated accurately, on-vehicle, in real-time. To this end, this paper presents a method to practically estimate the biodiesel content of fuel being used in a diesel engine during steady-state operation. The simple, generalizable, physically motivated estimation strategy presented utilizes information from a wideband oxygen sensor in the engine's exhaust stream, coupled with knowledge of the air-fuel ratio, to estimate the biodiesel content of the fuel. Experimental validation was performed on a 2007 Cummins 6.7 liter ISB series engine. Four fuel blends (0%, 20%, 50% and 100% biodiesel) were tested at a wide variety of torque-speed conditions. The estimation strategy correctly estimated the biodiesel content of the four fuel blends to within 4.2% of the true biodiesel content. Blends of 0%, 20%, 50% and 100% were estimated to be 2.5%, 17.1%, 54.2%, and 96.8% respectively. The results indicate that the estimation strategy presented is capable of accurately estimating the biodiesel content in a diesel engine during steady-state engine operation. This method offers a practical alternative to in-the-fuel type sensors, because wideband oxygen sensors are already in widespread production and are in place on some modern diesel vehicles today. ©2008 AACC.","Alternative fuels; Biodiesel; Biofuels; Diesel engines; Diesel fuel; Estimation; Fuel flexibility; Oxygenation; Virtual sensing","Carbon dioxide; Nonmetals; Oxygen; Alternative fuels; Biodiesel blends; Biofuels; Diesel engines; Diesel fuel; Estimation; Fuel flexibility; Oxygenation; Virtual sensing; Wide bands; Biodiesel",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52449109292

In urban environment, traffic is an important source for ambient air Bz concentrations. In order to quantify emission-to-intake relationships, intake fraction (iF) was defined as the integrated incremental intake of Bz released from a source (or source category) and summed over all exposed individuals during a given exposure time, per unit of emitted pollutant (Bennet et al., 2000). iF takes into account the dispersion of pollutants, locations and activity of population, and human breathing rates. The calculated iF for Bz is directly applicable to any other inert substance emitted by the traffic, e.g. CO, NOX, so the calculations also provide a ready-to-use tool for health effects studies concerning other pollutants and emission scenarios. This study calculates the spatial distribution of average benzene iF for Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA) using the EXPAND model (Kousa et al., 2002). The spatial Bz concentration distributions were obtained by using dispersion models: CAR-FMI (Karppinen et al., 2000) and OSPM (Berkowicz, 2000). A constant breathing rate of 1 m3/day was considered.

Several theories have been proposed which provide a link between climate and ice thinning. We present surface elevation change (<i>dh/dt</i>) data from NASA's Program for Arctic Regional Climate Assessment (PARCA) laser altimetry surveys for fourteen and eleven of the largest outlet glaciers in Southern Greenland from 1993 to 1998 and 1998 to 2006 respectively to test the applicability of these theories to the GrIS. <br><br> Initially, outlet glacier <i>dh/dt</i> data are compared with data from concurrent surveys over inland ice (slow flowing ice that is not obviously draining into an outlet glacier) to confirm the effect of ice flow on surface thinning rates. Land-terminating and marine-terminating outlet glacier <i>dh/dt</i> data are then compared from 1993 to 1998 and from 1998 to 2006. Finally, ablation anomalies (the difference between the ""normal"" ablation rate from 1970 to 2000 and the ablation rate in the time period of interest) calculated with a positive degree day model are compared to both marine-terminating and land-terminating outlet glacier <i>dh/dt</i> data. <br><br> Our results support earlier conclusions that certain marine-terminating outlet glaciers have thinned much more than land-terminating outlet glaciers during both time periods. Furthermore we show that these differences are not limited to the largest, fastest-flowing outlet glaciers - almost all marine-terminating outlet glaciers are thinning more than land-terminating outlet glaciers. There was a four fold increase in mean marine-terminating outlet glacier thinning rates below 1000 m elevation between the periods 1993 to 1998 and 1998 to 2006, while thinning rates of land-terminating outlet glaciers remained statistically unchanged. This suggests that a change in a controlling mechanism specific to the thinning rates of marine-terminating outlet glaciers occurred in the late 1990s and that this change did not affect thinning rates of land-terminating outlet glaciers. <br><br> Thinning rates of land-terminating outlet glaciers are statistically the same as ablation anomalies, while thinning rates of marine-terminating outlet glaciers are not. Thinning of land-terminating outlet glaciers therefore seems to be a response to changes in local mass balance (principally increases in air temperature) while thinning of marine-terminating outlet glaciers is principally controlled by ice dynamics. The mechanism by which this dynamic thinning occurs is still not clear although its association with marine-terminating outlet glaciers suggests perturbations at marine termini (calving) as the likely cause. © Author(s) 2008.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65349136476

The over-all goal of the program was to elucidate source-receptor relationships and atmospheric processes leading to PM accumulation on urban and regional scales; thus providing the scientific underpinning for modeling and data analysis efforts to support State Implementation Plans and more effective risk management approaches for PM. The program had three main objectives: (1) conduct methods development and evaluation, (2) characterize ambient PM, and (3) support health effects and exposure research. This paper provides a synthesis of key scientific findings from the Supersites Program and related studies. EPA developed 16 science/policy-relevant questions in conjunction with state and other federal agencies, Regional Planning Organizations, and the private sector. These questions were addressed to the extent possible, even given the vast amount of new information available from the Supersites Program, in a series of papers published as a special issue of the Journal of Air & Waste Management Association (February 2008). This synthesis also includes discussions of: (1) initial Supersites Program support for air quality management efforts in specific locations throughout the United States; (2) selected policy-relevant insights, based on atmospheric sciences findings, useful to air quality managers and decision makers planning emissions management strategies to address current and future PM National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and network planning and implementation; (3) selected health-relevant insights interpreted from atmospheric sciences findings in light of future directions for health and exposure scientists planning studies of the effects of PM on human health; and (4) selected knowledge gaps to guide future research. Finally, given the scope and depth of research and findings from the Supersites Program, this paper provides a reference source so readers can glean a general understanding of the overall research conducted and its policy-relevant insights.

The determination of emissions and emission factors for the region is an essential part of the EU-supported project SMAQ, aimed at developing methods for optimizing pollution abatement plans and for early warning of extreme pollution incidents. Using various data sources and the CORINAIR methodology, emissions and local emission factors have been estimated for the main industrial and non-industrial activities in that region. Biogenic sources such as animal husbandry and agricultural activities have been examined as well. The particular source sectors examined include power plants, lignite mining, road transport, central heating systems and agriculture. Calculated emission factors are based on data from the local pollution sources, while default values from CORINAIR or other sources are used to fill existing data gaps. An emissions inventory concerning major pollutants (PM, SO2, NOx, CO, N2O, VOC, CH4, NH3) was compiled for the period 2001 - 2004. As expected, the most significant pollutants are SO2 and NOx, followed by PM and CO, emitted from power plants. However, CO emissions due to road transportation are also quite significant. The information obtained is considered fairly complete and it is currently being used in conjunction with other data, model results as well as satellite images to develop a novel integrated system for efficient monitoring, assessment and management of air pollution in the Region of Western Macedonia. © by PSP 2008.","Air pollution; Emission factors; Emissions; Greece; Western Macedonia","agriculture; animal husbandry; atmospheric pollution; emission; lignite; optimization; Eurasia; Europe; Greece; Macedonia [Greece]; Southern Europe; Animalia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57649112563

The author proposes five principles to help frame adaptation efforts. They involve managing current climate risks, and for the longer term, a 'climate-smart' approach, providing primacy to finding solutions to place-based development risks from climate. Such an approach, which utilizes learning from managing current climate risks for the management of longer term climate risks to development, would be better placed for traction with real-world development programmes, and would provide much needed succour to the lives of the poor and marginal communities who will bear the brunt of impacts from a changing climate.",,"adaptation; climate change; development project; environmental impact; environmental policy; future prospect; policy development; strategic approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50249139632

In contrast to the actively probed parameters such as maximal (FM′) or minimal (F0′) emission, the steady-state chlorophyll fluorescence, Chl-FS, (FM′ &gt; Chl-FS &gt; F0′) has not been adequately studied. Using fluorescence imaging of leaves, we explored the modulation of Chl-FS by actinic irradiance and by temperature in laboratory, as well as the changes that occurred in three coniferous and broadleaf plant species grown in field. The experiments revealed that Chl-FS is largely insensitive to the incident irradiance once this is above early morning or late evening levels. The characteristic, pre-noon measured Chl-FS correlated positively with the CO2 assimilation rate when measured in field during the year. It was low and stable in the cold winter months and steeply increased with the spring onset. The high values of the characteristic Chl-FS persisted throughout the vegetation season and rapidly decreased in the fall. The seasonal Chl-FS transitions coincided with the last spring frosts or the first fall frosts that persisted for several consecutive nights. The transitions were marked by an elevated variability of the Chl-FS signal. We propose that the signal variability occurring during the transition periods can be used to detect from satellites the beginning and the end of the photosynthetic activity in evergreen canopies of the temperate zone. © CSIRO 2008.","Imaging; Overwintering plants; Photosynthetic activity; Picea; Remote sensing; Rhododendron","Fluorescence; Photosynthesis; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Chlorophyll fluorescence emission; Evergreen plants; Overwintering plants; Photosynthetic activity; Chlorophyll; annual variation; canopy; chlorophyll; emission; evergreen tree; fluorescence; imaging method; photosynthesis; remote sensing; satellite; temperate environment; Picea; Rhododendron",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38549093266

The focus is on large-scale changes deduced from measurements, which are used for comparison with numerical simulations of the tropospheric ozone cycle. These are required to quantify the influence of anthropogenic ozone precursor emission changes on climate. Long-term tropospheric ozone measurements show that ozone over Europe has increased by more than a factor of two between World War II and the early 1990s which is consistent with the large increase in anthropogenic ozone precursor emissions in the industrialized world. However, the further increase in background ozone over Europe and North America since the early 1990s cannot be solely explained by regional ozone precursor changes because anthropogenic ozone precursor emissions decreased in the industrialized countries as consequence of air pollution legislation. Measurements also indicate large increases in ozone in the planetary boundary layer over the tropical Atlantic since the late 1970s, which have been attributed to large increases in fossil fuel related emissions. Measurements at southern midlatitudes, which are limited in number, show a moderate increase in tropospheric ozone since the middle of the 1990s. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2008.","Free troposphere; Ozone measurement; Planetary boundary layer; Surface ozone; Tropospheric ozone",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78751672573

Particular focus is, however, placed on the influence of the CO2 emission reduction targets and on their consequences on the carbon price in 2020. Design/methodology/approach - In order to explore the interactions among the three European objectives and their induced effects, a number of scenarios are tested within a combination of two modeling tools: the POLES world energy model and ASPEN, an auxiliary model dedicated to the analysis of quota trading systems. With reasonable assumptions for the burden sharing among the member states, the energy efficiency objectives and the renewable energy targets are achieved using national quota systems in each European country (white and green certificate systems and their implicit prices), while the CO2 emission reduction is carried out within the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) in line with the objective of 20 per cent emission reduction. Findings - The paper shows, in particular, that the two quota policies (white certificates and green certificates) decrease significantly the European marginal emission reduction cost and consequently, the compliance costs for ETS participants. The high-renewable target compliance cost could be reduced significantly if carbon price signal and energy saving policies are in place. The paper also shows that the sole carbon price signal has a limited influence for stimulating renewable energies and energy savings and thus concludes on the need for specific policies targeting these two areas. Originality/value - This paper is a first attempt to comprehensively deal with the economic fundamentals of the 3D regulatory system proposed by the Commission for Energy and Climate and is of value in proposing a comprehensive approach of the economics of the ""20/20/20"" European policy.","Energy consumption; European Union; Global warming; Renewable energy","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Cost reduction; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; International law; CO2 emission reduction; Design/methodology/approach; Energy and climate policies; Energy saving policies; European emissions trading schemes; European union; Renewable energies; Renewable energy targets; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47049131711

In our study setting nitrous oxide (N2O) did not show any clinical benefit in discomfort experienced when applying local anesthesia for nasal operations. Further studies with longer inhalation times are needed to elucidate the role of N2O in application of local anesthesia in nasal surgery. Objectives. N2O inhalation reduces the discomfort experienced in various medical procedures. The objective of this study was to assess the suitability of N2O inhalation before application of local anesthesia for nasal procedures in outpatient surgery. Patients and methods. This was a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled study at the Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland. Ninety patients were randomly divided into three groups. Group A inhaled 10 breaths of 50% N2O/50% O2 through a nasal mask with a Porter 2000 MXR scavenging system before application of local nasal anesthesia, group B inhaled room air through the same mask and group C received only local anesthesia. A visual analog scale was used to assess pain, nausea, and discomfort related to the application of nasal anesthesia. Results. The N2O inhalation was easy to perform and well tolerated.

This paper presents a case study that examines the feasibility of using gas turbine technology in one industrial park, located in the Dongguan city of the Guangdong province in China. A model of a gas turbine-based combined heat and power (CHP) plant with a heat recovery steam generator for absorption cooling was developed and simulated. A steam-injected gas turbine has been selected in the system to increase electricity production and to generate steam. The study includes performance analysis of the cogeneration plant in terms of thermal efficiency, cost estimation, and greenhouse gas emission. The gas turbine-based cogeneration system has been compared with a baseline reference case that is defined as if all the energy to the industrial park is supplied from the local electricity grid. The results show that the gas turbine-based cogeneration system can reach a total efficiency of 58% and reduce CO2 emissions with 12 700 tons per year. A sensitivity analysis on the costs of the system has also been made based on fuel costs and the interest rate, which shows that the investigated system is economically profitable at natural gas prices below 4.4RMBm-3 with fixed electricity prices and at electricity prices above 736RMBMWh-1 with fixed natural gas prices. The sensitivity analysis based on the interest rate showed that the proposed system is economically feasible with interest rates up to 16%.

With Russian ratification late in 2004, requirements for implementation were met, namely ratification by a minimum of 55 nations (127, in fact), including-importantly, since this was the binding constraint-Annex I (industrialized) countries representing at least 55 percent of 1990 industrialized world emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). The impacts of the Kyoto Protocol on emissions of greenhouse gases, targeted for the compliance period 2008-12, will be much less than originally anticipated. Nonparticipation by the United States is quantitatively important, and the rules written at the Conferences of the Parties (COPs) of the UNFCCC in Bonn and Marakesh in 2001 had the effect of significantly relaxing the aggregate target. But a scientific consensus has continued to form regarding the likelihood of future climate change due to anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases;1 and economic analysis increasingly points to the wisdom of some kind of policy action.2 Thus there is a dilemma. The Kyoto Protocol has come into force without U.S. participation; its effects on climate change will be trivial; but the economic and scientific consensus points to the need for a credible international approach. What can be done? A reasonable starting point is the UNFCCC, which was signed by 161 nations and ratified by 50-including the United States-and which entered into force in 1994. Among other things, the UNFCCC established the principle of ""common but differentiated responsibilities,"" meaning that all nations should engage in the solution (because of the global-commons nature of the problem) but that different countries could participate in different ways.3 If the UNFCCC provides a reasonable starting point, can the Kyoto Protocol provide the way forward? It is helpful to examine the protocol in terms of its major architectural elements. Its targets apply only to industrialized nations; it contains ambitious, short-term emissions reduction targets but no long-term targets; and it provides flexibility through market-based mechanisms such as tradable permits. This architecture has been widely criticized, chiefly because it would impose high costs, fail to provide for full participation by developing countries, and generate modest short-term climate benefits while failing to provide a long-term solution. On the other hand, the argument has been made that the Kyoto Protocol is essentially ""the only game in town"" and that, instead of suggesting alternatives, analysts ""should concentrate on convincing policymakers how to get the long-term climate policy instruments right that build on Kyoto's foundations.""4 Thus some analysts see the agreement as deeply flawed.5 Others see it as an acceptable first step.6 But virtually everyone agrees that the Kyoto Protocol is not sufficient to meet the overall challenge and that further steps will be required. As Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, wrote in 2003, ""whether or not the Protocol enters into force, the same fundamental challenge remains: engaging all countries that are major emitters of greenhouse gases in a common long-term effort. We need a durable strategy that can take us beyond Kyoto""7.

Knowing the temperature of the surface of the TBC and at the interface between the bondcoat and the thermally grown oxide (TGO) under realistic conditions is highly desirable. As the major life-controlling factors for TBC systems are thermally activated, therefore linked with temperature, this would provide useful data for a better understanding of these phenomena and to assess the remaining lifetime of the TBC. This knowledge could also enable the design of advanced cooling strategies in the most efficient way using a minimum amount of air. The integration of an on-line temperature detection system would enable the full potential of TBCs to be realised due to improved precision in temperature measurement and early warning of degradation. This in turn will increase fuel efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions. The concept of a thermal-sensing TBC was first introduced by Choy, Feist and Heyes in 1998 [1]. The TBC is locally modified so it acts as a thermographic phosphor. Phosphors are an innovative way of remotely measuring temperatures and also other physical properties at different depths in the coating using photo stimulated phosphorescence [2]. In this study the temperature dependence of several rare earth doped EB-PVD coatings will be compared. Details of the measurements, the influence of aging, the composition and the fabrication of the sensing TBC will be discussed in this paper. Temperature detection at ultra-high temperatures above 1300°C is presented using new types of EB-PVD TBC ceramic compositions. Multilayer sensing TBCs will be presented, which enable the detection of temperatures below and on the surface of the TBC simultaneously.

One of the most difficult challenges will be the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector. Powering more efficient cars with lower carbon fuel stocks will not necessarily be enough to meet A.B. 32's goals of reducing greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 20202-Californians must drive less. Managing the demand-side of transportation-typically measured in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) - implicates land use as a major indirect source of greenhouse gas emissions. While a general plan or a zoning ordinance is not commonly considered equivalent to a smokestack or a tailpipe, development patterns wield tremendous influence over the transportation choices people make, the vehicle miles they travel, and therefore, the emission of greenhouse gases. The transportation-land use connection suggests that the California State Air Resources Board (CARB or ""the state board""), the primary state regulator of greenhouse gas emissions, must confront the infirmities in local land use decision-making to curb the rising rates of VMTper capita.

Chemical modelling indicates that during the dissolution experiments, solutions have become supersaturated with respect to carbonates in the case of diopside, and carbonates, clay minerals and zeolites in the case of the basaltic glass. Decreasing dissolution is therefore interpreted as a result of secondary surface precipitates blocking the reactive surface area. Calcite formation was supported in both experiments by a significant increase in Ca (and Sr) concentrations as pH was abruptly lowered from 8.2 to 7 because this change increased carbonate solubility and caused all potential carbonate precipitates to re-dissolve. The reduction in pH also led to an increase in Si concentration for diopside and a decrease in Si concentration for basaltic glass. This observation is in accordance with previous experiments on the pH-dependent dissolution rates of pyroxenes and basaltic glass. © 2008 The Mineralogical Society.","Basaltic glass; Carbon dioxide sequestration; Carbonate coating; Diopside; Dissolution; Mixed-flow reactor","Basalt; Calcite; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Coatings; Dissolution; Glass; Silicate minerals; Zeolites; Basaltic glass; Carbon dioxide sequestration; Carbonate coating; Diopside; Mixed-flow reactors; Silicon; basalt; calcite; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; carbonate; chemical analysis; coating; conference proceeding; diopside; dissolution; pH; volcanic glass",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57249116295

Although there has been a great deal of focus on new power sources incorporating state of the art environmental protection systems, there has been little focus on addressing the issues of existing power plants. The purpose of this work is to address the options available to existing gas turbine based power plants to retrofit CO2 reduction measures cost effectively at the source of emissions, the combustor. Pre-combustion decarbonization is a highly efficient method of carbon removal, as only a small fraction of the gas turbine system flow needs to be addressed. This results in the requirement to burn a hydrogen based fuel, which presents challenges due to its highly reactive nature. The properties of hydrogen/syngas combustion are reviewed with emphasis on solutions for premixed combustion systems. Premixed combustion as opposed to diffusion combustion systems are key to retrofit solutions for existing gas turbines. Premixed systems provide the life cycle cost benefit, and heat rate benefit of not requiring the addition of diluent to the cycle to control emissions. Fuel flexibility is critical for retrofit systems, allowing operators to run on high hydrogen fuels as well as back-up standard natural gas to maximize power plant availability. Pre-combustion decarbonization may occur remote from the power plant at a centralized fuel processing facility, or it may be integrated into the combined cycle gas turbine power plant. Existing combined cycle power plants operating on natural gas could be modified to incorporate fuel decarbonization into the cycle, minimizing the parasitic loss of such a system while capturing carbon credits which are likely to become of increasing monetary value. An example cycle to address such integrated systems is presented. The focus of this work is to present a cycle to provide decarbonized fuel, cost effectively, from existing natural gas systems, as well as centralized coal/petcoke based fuel processing facilities. An additional focus is on the combustion system design requirements to burn such fuels, which are retrofitable to existing heavy duty gas turbine based power plants.",,"Carbon credits; Carbon removal; Combined cycle gas turbine; Combustion systems; Diffusion combustion; Efficient method; Environmental protection systems; Fuel decarbonization; Fuel flexibility; Fuel processing; Global carbon emission; Heat rate; Heavy-duty gas turbines; Integrated systems; Lifecycle costs; Monetary value; Natural gas systems; Parasitic loss; Power sources; Pre-combustions; Premixed combustion; Premixed systems; State of the art; Combined cycle power plants; Combustion; Engines; Fuel systems; Fuels; Gas industry; Gas plants; Gas turbines; Gases; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Retrofitting; Smoke; Turbomachinery; Gas turbine power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69949162506

Besides, an increment in droughts and other extreme events can be expected as well. Such climatic conditions require an effort to optimize irrigation technologies and to improve water management efficiency. There are currently available water-use and crop-growth simulation models, which can be combined to climate scenarios and weather generators in order to recommend, through many simulations, the most reliable irrigation management. The Preliminary Assessment of the Impacts in Spain due to the Effects of Climate Change and the National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change recommend the use of such simulation tools in Spanish climate-change impact assessments. Those tools, however, have not been used yet to support irrigation decision-making in our country. In that sense, the EU-funded proposal AGRIDEMA, leaded by Spain, has been addressed to introduce such tools, connecting the tools ""providers"" from Universities and high-level research centres, with their ""users"", located in agricultural technological or applied-research centres. AGRIDEMA comprised courses and Pilot Applications of the tools. Local researchers knew in the AGRIDEMA courses how to access to GCM data and seasonal forecasts, they receive also basic knowledge on weather generators, statistical and dynamical downscaling; as well as on available crop models as DSSAT, WOFOST, CROPSYST, SWAP and others. About 20 pilot assessments have been conducted in several European countries during AGRIDEMA, applying the modelling tools in particular cases. The AGRIDEMA results are commented, mentioning particularly the Pilot Assessments that were held in Spain and in the Mediterranean area. Furthermore, several ""users"" opinion regarding the available climate and crop-growth simulation tools are also pointed out. Those opinions can be used as important feedback by the tools ""developers"". An illustrative example on how modelling tools can help to manage Sugarbeet irrigation under present and future climate conditions in Spain is also shown. Several future research directions are pointed out, as followed from the shown example and the AGRIDEMA results. Those research directions agree with the actions recommended in the Spanish National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change, as well as in the European and international guidelines. Stakeholder will adopt climate-change mitigation options only if they realize the reliability of such options on their specific cases. To achieve this, the ""users"" of the modelling tools must develop local demonstration proposals, aimed to model calibration and validation, etc. Particularly, some demonstration proposals should be aimed to recommend productive and efficient irrigation water managements under the adverse climate conditions that Spanish farmers will eventually face in the next years. © 2008 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

We have studied an agent-based planning system to reduce energy consumptions, called Distributed Energy Management Systems (DEMSs). In the DEMSs, CO2 emissions regulation is imposed on each corporate entity, and electrical and thermal energy trading among the entities are allowed. We have proposed an energy trading decision method with the application of the Market Oriented Programming (MOP).

The continents of Africa and Asia are anticipated to be extremely vulnerable to droughts. In the impending extreme climate conditions, humanity's sustenance hinges on groundwater as it forms the world's largest freshwater resource. Adaptive and mitigation measures entail well planned strategies for sustained groundwater through extreme climate conditions including droughts. In this paper two such strategies are discussed to overcome the problem of droughts: (i) artificial groundwater recharge using percolation ponds; and (ii) identifying and characterizing deep aquifers resilient to droughts through detailed geophysical, hydrogeological and isotopic studies. Percolation ponds act as artificial recharge structures which are constructed across monsoon streams with the purpose of harvesting surface runoff caused by monsoon streams. Conventional and tracer methods were developed in India to determine how effective these artificial recharge structures could be. From studies carried out on percolation ponds located in diverse geological formations such as granites, basalts and sandstones, it was concluded that these structures are quite useful for overcoming droughts in semi-arid and and regions, and it was demonstrated that the role of geology outweighs the effect of climate on such structures. It has been shown that in a similar climatic environment, the percolation ponds in sandstones were far more efficient (efficiency 60%) than those in basalts (efficiency 20-30%). Recently it has been realized that certain deep aquifers can yield a good quantity and quality of water even during extreme climate events. The Neyveli aquifer in southern India has been demonstrated to be such a representative aquifer for mitigation of droughts. Very extensive and intensive hydrogeological and isotopic studies on the aquifer revealed that the aquifer has distinct characteristics, namely: (i) distinct recharge area; (ii) extensive groundwater regime with high degree of recharge rate; (iii) wide span of radiocarbon ages from Modern to >30 000 years BP indicating modern as well as palaeorecharge; and (iv) minimal changes in groundwater quality despite very heavy and continuous withdrawal during the last four decades. All these criteria provide the necessary ingredients for drought resilient aquifers which can be used to identify similar aquifers elsewhere in the world. © The Geological Society of London 2008.",,"aquifer; artificial recharge; climate change; drought; groundwater resource; hydrogeology; percolation; sustainability; water management; water quality; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41849137263

The fundamental parameters affecting the carbonation process have been studied. An adverse effect of the CO2 concentration was observed and the optimum water-to-solid ratio and temperature were 0.3 and 20-30 °C, respectively. The reaction consisted of two stages. Initially, the reaction rate was controlled by the movement of the carbonation interface and the activation energy at this stage was 14.84 kJ mol-1; as the reaction proceeds, the rate controlling regime switched to gas diffusion through product layer control, and the activation energy was calculated to be 30.17 kJ mol-1.

The global demand for energy is rapidly increasing with increasing human population, urbanization and modernization. The growth in global energy demand is projected to rise sharply over the coming years. The enormous amount of energy being consumed across the world is having adverse implications on the ecosystem of the planet. The world heavily relies on fossil fuels to meet its energy requirements. Fossil fuels are inflicting enormous impacts on the environment. Climatic changes driven by human activities, in particular the production of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), directly impact on the environment. Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is regarded as biomass; therefore almost all the carbon dioxide generation from the combustion system should be carbon neutral. Since there are around 1200 tons of MSW generated daily in Mauritius, this can be a good source of energy. The study was, therefore, initiated to assess the amount of GHG being avoided by using MSW as a source of energy. The results showed that that the amount of energy per unit weight that is generated from MSW was 1.85 kWh/kg. The amount of GHG emitted from combustion of MSW was 0.153 kg CO2/kg MSW. The amount of GHG per unit of electricity generated by the combustion of MSW was 250 g CO2/ kWhe. It was found that 640 g CO2/kWhe by replacing coal by MSW and 470 g CO2/kWhe can be avoided by replacing oil by MSW.","Energy; Greenhouse gas; Incineration; Municipal solid waste","Air pollution; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Climatology; Coal combustion; Combustion; Energy management; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Heat treatment; Incineration; Leakage (fluid); Materials science; Modernization; Renewable energy resources; Smoke; Solid wastes; Thermochemistry; Waste incineration; Waste management; Waste treatment; Carbon neutrals; Climatic changes; Combustion systems; Energy; Energy requirements; Global demands; Global energy demands; Greenhouse gas; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouse gasses; Human activities; Human developments; Human needs; Human populations; Mauritius; Municipal solid waste; Municipal solid wastes; Source of energies; Unit weights; Waste to energies; Energy conversion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55849140575

Local, regional, or State authorities may mandate continuous monitoring for carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds, and other specific pollutant parameters. U.S. regulations that require continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) also allow for the use of predictive approaches as an alternative providing the installed predictive emissions monitoring system (PEMS) meets rigorous performance specification criteria and the site performs ongoing quality assurance tasks such as periodic audits with portable analyzers and annual accuracy testing. A statistical hybrid predictive emission monitoring system (PEMS) has been deployed at numerous sites in the United States to meet EPA requirements for continuous monitoring of gas turbine pollutant emissions. This paper discusses specific implementations of a unique cost-effective statistical hybrid PEMS on various classes of gas turbines ranging in size from 60kW to 180 MW, both gas-fired and liquid-fired units, in simple cycle and combined cycle mode of operation. The turbines were equipped with a variety of NO control strategies including dry low NON, steam and water injection, solid post-combustion catalyst, S0L0NOTM, and selective catalytic reduction. In each instance the predictive engine operated on training data of at least three days and up to ninety days as required to develop a robust empirical model of the emissions. Each model was subsequently evaluated using standard U.S. EPA performance specification test methods. The results of PEMS performance testing on these gas turbines are presented along with additional information regarding the quality assurance and quality control procedures put in place and the costs to support the ongoing operation of the deployed compliance statistical hybrid PEMS.",,"Air pollution control equipment; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Compliance control; Cost effectiveness; Gas emissions; Gas turbines; Global warming; Laws and legislation; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Pollution detection; Quality assurance; Quality control; Selective catalytic reduction; Specifications; Sulfur dioxide; Testing; Volatile organic compounds; Carbon dioxide emissions; Clean air act amendments; Continuous emissions monitoring systems; Continuous monitoring; Emission monitoring system; Performance specifications; Post-combustion catalysts; Predictive emissions monitoring; Monitoring",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69949134992

The near field region of an H2 flame is characterized by a high density ratio between the air co-flow and the fuel jet and a high injection velocity, which make turbulence modelling and combustion modelling difficult in this zone. In order to implement H2 efficiently in terrestrial and aerospace power generation applications, the global characteristics of H2 flames need to be well identified. This study presents the effect of turbulence modelling on the predictions of a turbulent non-premixed diluted H2 flame (80 % H2 - 20 % He) characterized by high density and velocity gradients in the inlet region. Two turbulence models, the k-̇model and RSM (Reynolds Stress Model), are evaluated in the framework of the SLFM (Steady Laminar Flamelet Model) approach and the results are compared to the experimental data of Barlow and Carter (1994). Mixing is introduced into the predictions analysis using mixture fraction and its variance. These two parameters are included in the transport equations used in the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code. Computational predictions are compared to measurements at four axial locations. The results demonstrate that the two turbulence models fail to estimate the initial turbulent mixing, which consequently leads to an inaccurate description of the flame characteristics at the first location. Nevertheless, a slight improvement of mixing is achieved using the RSM model. Downstream of the first location, due to the accurate representation of mixing, overall predictions of species and temperature are in good agreement with experimental data. At the second and third location, the prediction accuracy is in favour of the k-̇model which describes mixing slightly better; whereas, at the last section, the RSM produces improved results.","Air entrainment; Flamelet approach; Mixing modelling; Non-premixed flame; Turbulence modelling","Air entrainment; Alternative fuels; Computational fluid dynamics; Dynamics; Experiments; Flammability; Fluid dynamics; Forecasting; Helium; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Leakage (fluid); Location; Mixing; Reynolds number; Turbulence; Two phase flow; Aerospace powers; Axial locations; Combustion modelling; Comparative studies; Computational Fluid Dynamics codes; Computational predictions; Diluted hydrogens; Emissions legislations; Experimental datums; Flame characteristics; Flamelet approach; Fuel jets; High densities; High injections; Inlet regions; Laminar Flamelet models; Mixture fractions; Near fields; Non-premixed flame; Prediction accuracies; Premixed; Premixed flames; Reynolds Stress models; Transport equations; Turbulence modelling; Turbulent mixing; Two parameters; Velocity gradients; Turbulence models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57049104693

The spatial distribution of nitrogen deposition for the historic period showed higher deposition rates in the Midwest States caused by the elevated NO emissions in this sub-region. Dry deposition was greater than wet deposition in West and Southeast, but lower in the Midwest and Northeast, resulting in a similar contribution of wet and dry deposition to the total annual deposition averaged over the US. The effect of climate change combined with activity growth and emissions controls decreased sulfur deposition in all US subregions. The biggest reduction was estimated over the Northeast, Midwest, and Southeast sub-regions due to the future applied SO2 emission strategies in these sub-regions.

In this study, we examine the impact of a large scale, yet climatically realistic, reduction in the aeolian Fe input during a 240 year transient simulation. In contrast to previous studies, we find that the ocean biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen are relatively insensitive (globally) to a 60% reduction in Fe input from dust. Net primary productivity (NPP) is reduced in the Fe limited regions, but the excess macronutrients that result are able to fuel additional NPP elsewhere. Overall, NPP and air-sea CO2 exchange are only reduced by around 3% between 1860 and 2100. While the nitrogen cycle is perturbed more significantly (by ∼15%), reduced N2 fixation is balanced by a concomitant decline in denitrification. Feedbacks between N2 fixation and denitrification are controlled by variability in surface utilization of inorganic nitrogen and subsurface oxygen consumption, as well as the direct influence of Fe on N2 fixation. Overall, there is relatively little impact of reduced aeolian Fe input (&amp;lt;4%) on cumulative CO2 fluxes over 240 years. The lower sensitivity of our model to changes in dust input is primarily due to the more detailed representation of the continental shelf Fe, which was absent in previous models.",,"air-sea interaction; biogeochemical cycle; biogeochemistry; carbon; carbon dioxide; continental shelf; denitrification; dust; net primary production; nitrogen cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849156609

For spectral analyses using data of WXM on-board HETE-2, background spectra are conventionally obtained with time regions before and/or after prompt emission. In some cases, the background spectra change during the prompt emission and/or the downlink trouble causes a loss of data around the prompt emission. If this is the case, the problem seems to lie in the fact that the conventional method cannot obtain correct background spectra. To make more appropriate background spectra, we develop a new analysis method using mask patterns of the WXM. The background spectra are estimated with shaded regions by the WXM mask pattern using the prompt emission data. Our new method might obtain a reliable result for a spectrum of GRB 030329.

If such waste can be recycled in the solid state, the amount of CO2 emission can be reduced. In the case of sheet metal waste with bend corner, sheet thickness decreases along the bend line. Although such bent sheets can be unbent to form flat sheets, the resulting sheets are thinner along the bend line. Here, we propose an incremental flattening process in which the thinned bent corner can be thickened by flattening. By applying our proposed method, the thickening behavior of the thinned residual corner was investigated experimentally. Moreover, from the point of view of practical use, the mechanical properties of recycled sheet metal were examined. It was found that the thinned bent corner can be flattened and thickened by the proposed incremental flattening process. The mechanical properties of the thickened region were improved from those of the original region. Furthermore, the elongation of the thickened region was maintained.

In the United States, engines are being equipped with DPF (Diesel Particulate Filters), while in Europe SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) is favored. In China, technologies of engine design are also intended to meet the stricter regulations of emissions control.

Most feedstock for Natural Gas as gas utility in Japan is LNG imported from Asia, Middle East, and Australia where the distance from Japan is over ten thousand kilometers, because there is no reserve of natural gas in Japan. The resource of natural gas in the exporting countries is limited and the amount of imported LNG will be severely restricted, forecasting the long-term future, such as twenty years later. There are a variety of ways to actively respond to the situation and ensure an adequate supply of natural gas. Consequently, The Japan Gas Association (JGA), an organization of city gas utilities, started to study alternative gas resources extensively for the future. The following potential cases were proposed to clarify what conditions will justify the case based on envisioned scenarios. Case 1: Coal imported from Asian countries or Australia is gasified, converted to methane in Japan, and distributed. Case 2: Coal is gasified and converted to methane in a coal mining country. The produced gas, SNG, is converted to LNG and exported to Japan. Case 3: Coal is gasified and used to produce methanol, DME or some chemicals because of decreasing the handling and shipping cost. These liquid materials are easily converted to gas and distributed in Japan. There are several potential-plant sites producing low-rank coal like lignite as well as Bituminous and Sub-bituminous coal in Asian countries, such as Indonesia, China, and Vietnam and Australia. It is important to discern the adequate business models based on updated technologies as a gas supplier in the new era. The several gasification technologies including commercialized and developing ones can be applied for producing methane with methanation reaction. These processes should be characterized by how the synthetic gas will be effectively produced in accordance with the intended use. As the methane content at the outlet of a gasifier increases, the duty of methanation reaction based on the commercialized technology will decrease. The feasibility study to compare several cases for introducing SNG into Japanese market, characterized by geographic location, based on the possible assumption was made to understand the future direction of SNG production technologies. SNG production in a coal mining country may be the most possible scheme, but the economics of the system is dependent on the policy, infrastructure, the relative energy and utility prices and so on. So, site-specific study is required for choosing the system. In the long-term vision, CCS will become of increasing importance. SNG production with CCS may contribute to reduction of carbon dioxide emission in comparison with coal combustion.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953688723

The chapter first focuses on techniques to be applied in the analysis of the various factors contributing to contamination of the environment, among which we list Principal Component Analysis, and alternative methods and tools such as: Unmix, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) and the Multilinear Engine (ME), and Multivariate Curve Resolution Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS). In cases where uncertainties were not experimentally available, the use of jackknife uncertainty estimations methods for receptor modelling is described and recommended. Time series extension of multivariate receptor modelling has been developed to account for temporal dependence in air pollution data into estimation of source compositions and uncertainty estimations. In the case of air pollution it is also of interest to estimate the average concentration of a given pollutant at the monitoring site after the air masses have travelled over a certain point (source) on the map. The use of non-parametric regression (kernel smoothing) methods proves to be useful. A method is given for source apportionment of local sources of air pollution by non-parametric regression of the concentration of a pollutant on wind speed and direction. Non-parametric methods have shown that nearby sources (such as freeways) are not always important contributors to high pollutant concentrations. Finally, a number of applications of receptor modelling techniques are presented, including source identification by the new CATT tool (Combined Aerosol Trajectory Tools). Ensemble backward trajectory techniques have been employed to identify regional origins of air pollutants subject to synoptic-scale atmospheric transport. In another application, one detailed study is reported with the analysis of the results obtained from the application of PMF and from PCA-MLRA (Principal Component Analysis with Multilinear Regression Receptor Modelling) to one dataset containing compositional PM10 data at an industrial site in Northern Spain. Even though similar results were obtained with both models, PMF achieved a higher level of detail in the apportionment of sources than PCA-MLRA. However, it was also noted that the application of PMF is more time consuming (at least 50% more time) than PCA-MLRA. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In the carbon-rich shells of IRC +10216 and CRL 2688, we have detected emission lines exactly at the PH3 frequency. Toward the oxygen-rich supergiant VY Canis Majoris, only an upper limit was obtained, while in the evolved carbon-rich proto-planetary nebula CRL 618, the transition is contaminated by vibrational excited HC3N (V7 = 4). The line shape in IRC +10216 appears to consist of two distinct components: a flat-topped profile with a width of ∼28 km s -1, as is typical for this source, and a narrower feature approximately 4 km s″1 wide. The narrow component likely arises from the inner envelope (r &lt; 8R*) where the gas has not reached the terminal expansion velocity, or it is nonthermal emission. Based on the broader component, the abundance of PH3 with respect to H2 is estimated to be 5 x 10-8 in a region with a radius of r&lt; 150R*. If the narrower component is thermal, it implies a phosphine abundance of ~5 x 10-7 close to the stellar photosphere (r&lt; 8R*). In CRL 2688, the PH3 abundance is less constrained, with plausible values ranging from 3 x 10 -8 to 4 x 10-7, assuming a spherical distribution. Phosphine appears to be present in large concentrations in the inner envelope of C-rich AGB stars, and thus may function as a parent molecule for other phosphorus species. © 2008, The American Astronomical Society, AU rights reserved.","Astrochemistry; Circumstellar matter; Ism: Molecules",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649631349

Plants are highly restricted to a small area of occupancy, seed dispersal is nearly non-existent and extreme fires appear to have destroyed almost all seeds and seedlings and decimated the pollinators.

For one, thermogenesis peaks in early evening, a contrast with daytime peaks of other Cycadothrips-pollinated Macrozamia, but matches that of the Tranes weevil-pollinated Macrozamia machinii. In addition, cone volatiles include both previously unreported compounds as well as those reported exclusively on either Cycadothrips- or Tranes-pollinated species. Based on its small, fragmented area of occupancy, projected population declines and the unique pollination syndrome, we recommend that M. platyrhachis retain its current status as 'Endangered'. Habitat management plans should stipulate that controlled burns be avoided during cycad coning season and that wildfires be controlled to minimise damage to seedlings and pollinators. © CSIRO 2008.",,"abundance; coniferous tree; conservation status; demographic survey; fire; pollination; pollinator; thrips; Cycadopsida; Cycadothrips; Cycadothrips chadwicki; Macrozamia; Macrozamia machinii; Tranes; Zamiaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45249112346

Its emission approach is described, which distinguishes between both eight different input pathways (municipal waste water treatment plants, industrial plants, combined sewer overflows, rainwater sewers, artificial drainage, erosion, wash-off, groundwater-borne runoff) and various types of critical source areas named phosphotopes. Then, the results of a model application to two large-scale river basins are presented and discussed. The river basins (ca. 12,500 km 2) each show contrasting natural conditions, land use patterns as well as population and industry densities. Total P-emissions from each river basin range around 1,600 tonnes per year but the importance of sources varies significantly. While in the Ems river basin 87 % of all P-inputs originate from diffuse sources, their portion achieves only 32 % in the Rhine river sub-basin. Due to the fact that diffuse entries are mainly made up by erosion (11 % of all P-inputs), measures for tackling P-inputs will aim at erosion prevention and sediment retention.","EU-WFD; Eutrophication; P-inputs; River basin management","Combined sewer overflows; Diffuse sources; Erosion prevention; EU-WFD; Land use pattern; Large rivers; Model application; Natural conditions; P-inputs; Point sources; Rhine river; River basin management; River basins; Sediment retention; Source area; Subbasins; Anoxic sediments; Combined sewers; Decision making; Erosion; Eutrophication; Groundwater; Industrial plants; Information technology; Water management; Watersheds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858318620

The catalyst activity in removing HC and nano-particles was examined with exhaust gas from a diesel engine operating on biodiesel-Rapeseed Methyl Ester (RME). The tests were carried out at steady-state conditions for short periods of time, thus catalyst tolerance to sulphur was not examined. The prototype catalyst reduced the amount of hydrocarbons (HC) and the total PM. The quantity of particulate with electrical mobility diameter in nucleation mode size &lt; 10nm, was significantly reduced over the catalyst. Moreover, it was observed that the use of EGR (20% vol.) for the biodiesel fuelled engine significantly increases the particle concentration in the accumulation mode with simultaneous reduction in the particle concentration in the nuclei mode. The effectiveness of the prototype catalyst in reducing PM from the combustion of biodiesel was dependent on the engine operating condition and EGR. However, up to 50% and 30% reduction in total particulate number and mass, respectively, was seen due to oxidation of the soot free PM (nuclei) and organic carbon from the rest of the PM. When EGR was used the catalyst effectiveness in controlling PM and especially total number was reduced to as low as 5%, due to increased PM concentration and modified PM composition. The results suggest that the use of this prototype catalyst can aid aftertreatment system performance and the control of environmental pollution. © 2008 SAE International.",,"Biodiesel; Diesel engines; Exhaust gases; Exhaust systems (engine); Gas emissions; Nanoparticles; Organic carbon; Pollution control; Powertrains; Aftertreatment systems; Electrical mobility; Engine operating conditions; Environmental pollutions; Particle concentrations; Rapeseed methyl ester; Simultaneous reduction; Steady-state condition; Catalyst activity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072453358

The Government of Canada's March 2008 ""Turning The Corner - Taking Action to Fight Climate Change"" report has set the foundation for CO2 regulations which ""start tough and get tougher"". The ""Toughest"" requirements are set for new oil sands plants and coal-fired power plants that come into operation in 2012, or later. The public and legal arena is also impacted by how oil sands carbon emissions are addressed. The Report on Business, March 6, 2008, reported; ""a federal court judge ⋯ found the approval of Imperial Oil Ltd's $8 billion oil sands mine insufficient on climate change and green house gas emissions."" The Conference Board of Canada Carbon Disclosure Project Report 2007 has also stated that ""Alberta's GHG reduction legislation will add approximately $0.18/bbl in additional operating costs for a typical integrated oil-sands mining project, and $0.22/bbl for a steam-assisted gravity drainage project."" These and other factors have changed the landscape for oil sands development. A review of the political, social, and regulatory pressures and obligations for the in situ oil sands industry to reduce its oil sands carbon foot print will be provided. This paper will discuss Laricina's insights and views on the carbon challenge, describe initiatives Laricina is taking to manage these imperatives and outline the challenges the overall industry is facing. The objective of this paper is to spur dialogue and collaboration by the oil sands industry in an effort to evolve and advance the knowledge and understanding of the impacts this important issue has on our business. This paper will also attempt to describe the dimensions of the carbon problem, point out the experience base our industry has to contribute to a solution, review the parameters to demonstrate CO2 or GHG's containment and storage, touch on the state of regulatory and policy issues, and try to scope out a progression to technical and economic success.

Some of the most pressing green issues demand policy and action at the strategic level associated with regional forms of governance: The challenges of climate change are an obvious example. Cities have powerful interactions with their hinterlands in the form, for example, of flows of water and energy into the city and wastes into the hinterland. Urban plans often feature green belts, green grids, green wedges, and other devices that extend into the surrounding areas. Major metropolitan areas have especially strong interdependence with the regions in which they are set; many have ecological footprints that extend far beyond the city limits. This can be seen in London's efforts to promote green issues and its attempts to integrate these efforts with the approach being taken in the Wider South East region, which surrounds London. This chapter describes the metropolitan region and the current strategies to greening, including policies to contain rapid urban growth, promote sustainable development, and develop an inter-regional comprehensive approach. It concludes that preoccupation with containing growth and weak mechanisms for inter-regional collaboration are inhibiting an otherwise vigorous effort to promote greening at the strategic level.

Air quality has long been a concern of Olympic mega-cities, although the air quality plans and strategies have often seemed short-lived and unsustainable in the long term. We have explored air quality data and air pollution control from seven Olympic cities: Mexico City, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Sydney and Athens and also Beijing and London which will host Olympic Games in near future. The study shows that despite a high altitude and air pollution problems, Mexico City had no clear environmental policy in place for the 1968 games. The characteristic smog of Los Angeles raised concerns about athletic performance at the Olympic Games of 1984, but there were limited efforts to tackle the ozone concentration during these games. The 1996 Atlanta Games represents a case where temporary public transport changes were used as a tactic to reduce air pollution. In Sydney a well planned sustainable strategy reduced air pollutants and CO2 emissions in 2000, but Athens' long efforts to improve air quality for the 2004 games were not wholly effective. Even where strategies proved successful the improvements in air quality seem short-lived. Current host cities Beijing and London are developing emission reduction plans. These have clear air quality objectives and are well intentioned. However, the improvements may be too narrow and may not be sustainable in the long term. Our analysis looks at the origins of success and failure and how more coherent improvements might be achieved and what would promote sustainable plans for air quality management at future games. The study illustrates the feedback between air pollution science and policy awareness. © 2008 Science Publications.","Air quality tactics; Sustainability; Transport strategy","air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; emission control; environmental policy; Olympic Games; ozone; pollution control; strategic approach; sustainable development; twenty first century; Asia; Athens [Attica]; Atlanta; Attica; Australasia; Australia; Beijing [China]; California; China; England; Eurasia; Europe; Far East; Federal District [Mexico]; Georgia; Greece; London [England]; Los Angeles; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]; New South Wales; North America; Southern Europe; Sydney [New South Wales]; United Kingdom; United States; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47249108158

The Program is managed on Sida's behalf by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and the corrosion project is coordinated by Swerea KIMAB AB. Corrosion attack after one (2002-2003 and 2005-2006), two (2002-2004) and four (2002-2006) years of exposure are presented for 12 test sites in Asia (India, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, and China including Hong Kong) and four test sites in Africa (South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe). Materials exposed are carbon steel, zinc, copper, limestone and paint coated steel. At each test site, the environment is characterized by SO 2, NO 2, HNO 3, O 3, particles, amount and pH of precipitation, temperature and relative humidity. Preliminary results are also given from the enlargement of the network (2006-) by inclusion of five new test sites in Asia (Taj Mahal/India, Iran, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Maldives) and two new test sites in Africa (Mozambique and Tanzania). SO 2 is the most important parameter but acid rain is also important for all materials while HNO 3 show correlation to corrosion of zinc and limestone, much similar to the situation in Europe. Attempts to predict corrosion values using dose-response functions developed in Europe have failed, especially for limestone. © 2009 by NACE International.","Air pollution; Carbon steel; Copper; Corrosion; Limestone; Painted steel; Tropical; Zinc","Coated steel; Corrosion attack; Cultural properties; Dose response; Hong-kong; International development; Malaysia; Maldives; Mozambique; Regional air pollution; South Africa; Sri Lanka; Stockholm; Tanzania; Temperature and relative humidity; Test site; Thailand; Tropical; Viet Nam; Zimbabwe; Acid rain; Air pollution; Atmospheric corrosion; Carbon steel; Coated materials; Copper; Corrosion; Corrosion prevention; Developing countries; Limestone; Sulfur dioxide; Zinc; Testing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864976821

In fact, it is often an economically attractive first step on the road to achieving carbon neutral status. Many industrial firms recognize this and take the initial steps of determining the technical and economic feasibility of energy conservation/cost-reduction projects; however, they often fall short when it comes to implementing their strategies. This shortfall is typically a result of the difficult task of balancing stakeholder expectations, financial constraints, and ever-changing regulatory mandates. Stalled implementation of potentially successful energy efficiency projects costs companies money not only in elevated operating expenses, but also in missed incentives. For example, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 offers significant new incentives for industrial energy efficiency projects that incorporate either recoverable waste energy or combined heat and power systems. Specifically, companies can receive $10 per Megawatthours-electric (MWhe) for excess electricity produced from waste energy or $10 per 3.412 million British thermal units (Btu) of excess thermal energy recovered and used for any purpose other than its original intent. Further, in states with mandatory carbon emission limits and for firms with the desire to register voluntary carbon emission reductions, there will be an avoided cost of carbon emissions resulting from these projects that should also be included in their financial analyses. Effectively balancing stakeholder expectations; federal, state, and regional mandates; and financial constraints starts with reexamining projects already in the pipeline. By recasting energy savings projects to incorporate economic incentives and rebates and the avoided cost of carbon emissions, companies will often see significantly improved financial results, achieve early success in meeting carbon reduction goals without large capital expenditures, reduce operating costs, and improve stakeholder satisfaction. This paper offers real world examples to provide insight into the benefits of this approach.",,"Avoided costs; British thermal units; Capital expenditures; Carbon emissions; Carbon management; Carbon neutrals; Carbon reduction; Combined heat and power system; Economic feasibilities; Economic incentive; Energy independence and security act of 2007; Financial analysis; Financial constraints; Financial results; Fundamental component; Industrial energy; Industrial energy efficiency; Operating expense; Waste energy; Carbon; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Power generation; Industry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865719516

A series of analyses was conducted to assess the impact of pavement structure, material characteristics, traffic loads, and changes in climate on incremental and terminal pavement deterioration and performance. Results suggest that rutting (asphalt, base, and subbase layers) and both longitudinal and alligator cracking will be exacerbated by climate change, with transverse cracking becoming less of a problem. In general, maintenance, rehabilitation, and reconstruction will be required earlier in the design life; however, the effects of climate change were found to be modest relative to effects of regional baseline climate differences and increased future traffic. For road authorities, key adaptations will relate to when and how to modify current design and maintenance practices. Pavement engineers should be encouraged to develop a protocol for considering potential climate change in the development and evaluation of future designs and maintenance programs.

It was ""born"" as a wastewater treatment system, in the 1970s showed promise as an alternative energy source (in particular from animal waste), in the 1980s and later it became a standard for treating organic-matter-rich industrial wastewater, and more recently returned to the market for its energy recovery potential, making use of different biomasses, including energy crops. With the growing concern around global warming, this paper looks at the potential of anaerobic digestion in terms of reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The potential contribution of anaerobic digestion to GHG reduction has been computed for the 27 EU countries on the basis of their 2005 Kyoto declarations and using life cycle data. The theoretical potential contribution of anaerobic digestion to Kyoto and EU post-Kyoto targets has been calculated. Two different possible biogas applications have been considered: electricity production from manure waste, and upgraded methane production for light goods vehicles (from landfill biogas and municipal and industrial wastewater treatment sludges). The useful heat that can be produced as by-product from biogas conversion into electricity has not been taken into consideration, as its real exploitation depends on local conditions. Moreover the amount of biogas already produced via dedicated anaerobic digestion processes has also not been included in the calculations. Therefore the overall gains achievable would be even higher than those reported here. This exercise shows that biogas may considerably contribute to GHG emission reductions in particular if used as a biofuel. Results also show that its use as a biofuel may allow for true negative GHG emissions, showing a net advantage with respect to other biofuels. Considering also energy crops that will become available in the next few years as a result of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, this study shows that biogas has the potential of covering almost 50% of the 2020 biofuel target of 10% of all automotive transport fuels, without implying a change in land use. Moreover, considering the achievable GHG reductions, a very large carbon emission trading ""value"" could support the investment needs. However, those results were obtained through a ""qualitative"" assessment. In order to produce robust data for decision makers, a quantitative sustainability assessment should be carried out, integrating different methodologies within a life cycle framework. The identification of the most appropriate policy for promoting the best set of options is then discussed. © IWA Publishing 2008.","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Biomethane; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle assessment","Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Biofuels; Biogas; Biomass; Chemical oxygen demand; Crops; Economics; Electricity; Emission control; Energy conversion; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Industrial waste treatment; Investments; Land use; Leakage (fluid); Life cycle; Manures; Methane; Reduction; Solid wastes; Technological forecasting; Waste treatment; Wastewater; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment; Water treatment plants; Alternative energy sources; Anaerobic digestion processes; Animal wastes; Automotive transport; Biomethane; Carbon emissions; Change in land use; Common Agricultural Policy; Cycle data; Decision makers; Electricity production; Energy crops; Energy recovery; EU countries; GHG emissions; Goods vehicles; Greenhouse gas emissions; Industrial waste waters; Industrial waste-water treatment; Life cycle assessment; Local conditions; Methane production; Potential contribution; Qualitative assessments; Sustainability assessment; Technological developments; True negative; Using life; Wastewater treatment systems; Anaerobic digestion; biofuel; carbon; methane; organic matter; anoxic conditions; biofuel; biogas; emission control; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; methane; anaerobic digestion; article; bioenergy; biomass; electricity; energy crop; energy recovery; environmental sustainability; Europe; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; land use; landfill; life cycle assessment; manure; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; sludge; waste water management; Energy-Generating Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Europe; Greenhouse Effect; Methane; Refuse Disposal; Eurasia; Europe; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47349112962

Design/methodology/approach - A multi-sector computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of Thailand has been developed to accomplish the objectives of this study. The potential DSM program considered refers to replacement of less efficient electrical appliances with their efficient counterparts in the household sector in Thailand. Findings - The study finds that the economy-wide impacts of the DSM program (e.g., economic welfare, GDP, international trade) depend on three key factors: the project economics of the DSM option or the ratio of unit cost of electricity savings to price of electricity (CPR); the implementation strategy of the DSM option; and scale or size of the DSM option. This paper shows that the welfare impacts of the DSM programs would improve along with the project economics of the DSM programs. If the DSM program is implemented under the CDM, the welfare impacts would increase along with the price for certified emission reductions units. On the other hand, the welfare impacts would increase up to the optimal size or scale of the program, but would start to deteriorate if the size is increased further. Research limitations/implications - The welfare function considered in this paper does not account for benefits of local air pollution reductions. The study provides crucial insights on designing DSM projects in Thailand to ensure that DSM programs are beneficial for the economy as a whole. Originality/value - Analyses of DSM options under the CDM using CGE models are not available in the literature.

This study analyzes the potential of using dry/wet year predictions to reduce risk in subsistence agricultural production associated with climate variability at the site level. Weather data sets from eight provincial study localities were classified into three precipitation scenarios - dry (lower threshold), normal and wet (upper threshold) years. According to the modelling results, there is a less than 12 per cent variance in mean maize yields across six out of the eight localities when planting occurs in March, May and August. The variance is equivalent to approximately 100-300 kg per ha, which represents a significant amount of food in the household security of the majority impoverished sectors of rural and urban society, and which could greatly impact the socioeconomic activities of the entire populace. The results lead to the conclusion that all extreme dry and wet years are not equal in terms of their regional manifestation.

Among actors with such capacities are municipalities, which multiply their influence through horizontal and vertical relationships. Transnational municipal networks present opportunities for both intermunicipal dialogue and the pooling of global influence, highlighting the presence and influence of the city in the world. This paper examines the collective response of some cities to climate change, exploring the place of cities in global environmental politics through analysis of two transnational municipal networks: the International Council of Local Environmental Initiatives' Cities for Climate Protection and the International Solar Cities Initiative. The article addresses the following questions: How might municipal efforts toward a climate-stable future be significant to the larger issue of ecological justice in global environmental politics? Might cities be able to redefine the rules of the game and take a stand on 'inefficient' norms? After briefly accounting for the relationship between cities and the world, the article characterizes technical leadership as a legitimizing force of and in global environmental governance and norm entrepreneurship as a potential source of contestation and subversion in global environmental politics. The paper describes what cities are globalizing, in terms of pollution, environmental degradation, and risk, and in terms of management and politics. Finally, the article explores the possibility that emerging horizontal and vertical relationships, intermunicipal relationships, and relationships between cities or networks of cities and other scales of governance potentiate legitimizing roles for cities in climate governance and subversive roles in climate politics. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78049304810

More specifically, CNG has a considerable potential when used as a dedicated fuel on a downsized turbo-charged SI engine for a small urban vehicle. This approach can be profitably extended by adding a small secondary (electrical) power source to the CNG engine, thus hybridizing the powertrain. This is why IFP has developed a mild-hybrid CNG prototype vehicle based on a MCC smart car equipped with a starter-alternator and ultra-capacitors (the StARS system). This solution offers some interesting functions such as ""Stop'n'Start"", regenerative braking, torque boosting and engine assistance, and yields significant benefits in terms of fuel economy, reduced exhaust emissions and better driveability. The unfolding of this project, named VEHGAN, has involved interesting and challenging issues from an engine control point of view, such as coping with distinctive features of natural gas engines, mastering the automatic manual transmission (AMT) control system and integrating a new power source, with its new functions, into the torque-oriented engine control structure. A paper presented at the 2007 SAE World Congress had already given an overview of the project and some preliminary results, mostly focusing on the AMT control part.

Improved engine technologies arc one possibility to reduce the fuel consumption. Other possibilities to lower the energy demand of a vehicle arc i.e. lightweight materials, improved aerodynamics, low resistance tires and more efficient gearboxes. With the market launch of vehicles with hybrid drive this drive concept has been set in the focus of public discussions as an additional promising technology to reduce fuel consumption. General advantages of hybrid vehicles arc e.g. an optimised operating strategy of the combustion engine during stopping phases and the possibility of energy recuperation while braking. So an urban traffic situation with a dynamic driving profile offers a high fuel saving potential. However, higher speed levels reduce the possible fuel saving. In general, hybrid vehicles have only a limited fuel saving potential towards conventionally driven vehicles in highway traffic. Thus hybrid vehicles need an adaptation of the driving style to the characteristics of the drive train (8). The complete saving potential of a hybrid vehicle is only open to a foresighted and anticipatory driver. The aims of the foresighted energy management for hybrid drive systems arc to reduce fuel consumption as well as exhaust emissions, to optimise aggregate stress and battery lifetime. A new operating strategy is necessary that considers additional information about the current and following traffic situation. One important question is how the foresighted driving effects fuel consumption, driving comfort and how drivers will accept this technology. A necessary condition for foresighted driving is the information about the future traffic situation. Vehicle mounted sensors like radar or lidar systems can give dynamic information about the surrounding traffic situation while the digital map of the navigation system offers static information about the street conditions (e.g. inclination, curvature, speed limit). This information will be included in the next generation of digital maps. The energy management uses all available information to drive the hybrid vehicle in the most economical way. This is the main topic of the presented project. Based on the latest drive train concepts a foresighted energy management will be developed for a full-hybrid vehicle and demonstrated in a subcompact vehicle. The build up of the vehicle has been finished by the end of the year 2007 and from the beginning of 2008 driving tests with different test persons started to show the fuel saving potential in real traffic. These tests show on the one hand the saving potential of the hybridisation of the vehicle and on the other hand the additional saving potential of the hybrid vehicle in combination with the foresighted driving strategy. The presentation explains the build-up of the hybrid drive train including the necessary components like the electric engine and the high voltage battery. In addition the traffic prediction system is described and how it influences the operating strategy of the hybrid drive train.","ACC; Digital map; Foresighted energy management; Full-hybrid; Simulation","ACC; Battery lifetime; Combustion engines; Digital map; Drive train; Driving comfort; Driving effect; Driving strategy; Driving styles; Driving test; Dynamic information; Electric engines; Energy demands; Energy management system; Energy recuperation; Engine technology; Exhaust emission; Fuel savings; Full-hybrid; High voltage; Highway traffic; Hybrid drive; Hybrid drive systems; Hybrid drive train; Hybridisation; Lidar systems; Lightweight materials; Low resistance; Market launch; Mounted sensors; Number of vehicles; Operating strategy; Real traffic; Saving potentials; Simulation; Speed levels; Speed limit; Static information; Traffic densities; Traffic situations; Traffic-prediction system; Urban traffic; Carbon dioxide; Energy management; Fuel economy; Hybrid vehicles; Navigation systems; Land vehicle propulsion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866067946

Gas concentration was determined using an infrared photoacoustic analyzer over a 24-hour period using a steady-state flux chamber setup containing urine:feces as-excreted from eight individual heifers. Odorous air samples were collected from chamber headspace and evaluated by six human assessors for pleasantness, intensity and detection threshold using a forced-choice dynamic olfactometer.

Odor emission tended to be reduced with lower quality forage diets, but with no significant difference. The volume of feces produced from the high concentrate diet was about half that from the low concentrate diet heifers.

Climatological analyses of this TMCF reveal changes in the region's climate reflected in increasing moisture content and surface air temperature. Historical changes in the low lands due to agriculture and urban sprawl are suspected to be a source of the climate variation. The focus of this paper is to quantify the climate impacts of changes in land use close to coastal TMCFs, using El Yunque during the dry season as the test case. To achieve this goal, the research makes use of high-resolution remote sensing information and surface weather stations, combined with the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS). The coupled and individual effects of land use and global climate change are investigated in detail by performing an ensemble of numerical simulations that represent past and present land use conditions, and past and present climate. Results indicate significant impacts in increasing air temperatures, reduction in cloud base heights, and increases in precipitation in the highlands and are attributed to increases of sea surface temperatures.

The relative importance of climate change for food security differs between regions. For example, in southern Africa, climate is among the most frequently cited drivers of food insecurity because it acts both as an underlying, ongoing issue and as a short-lived shock. The low ability to cope with shocks and to mitigate long-term stresses means that coping strategies that might be available in other regions are unavailable or inappropriate. In other regions, though, such as parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain of India, other drivers, such as labour issues and the availability and quality of ground water for irrigation, rank higher than the direct effects of climate change as factors influencing food security. Because of the multiple socio-economic and bio-physical factors affecting food systems and hence food security, the capacity to adapt food systems to reduce their vulnerability to climate change is not uniform. Improved systems of food production, food distribution and economic access may all contribute to food systems adapted to cope with climate change, but in adopting such changes it will be important to ensure that they contribute to sustainability. Agriculture is a major contributor of the greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), so that regionally derived policies promoting adapted food systems need to mitigate further climate change.","Climate change; Food security; Mitigation; Sustainability",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350094795

The estimated global N 2O flux from combustion sources, as well as from other sources, still has a large uncertainty. Herein, we characterize automobile sources using N2O isotopomer ratios (nitrogen and oxygen isotope ratios and intramolecular site preference of 15N, SP) to assess their contributions to total global sources and to deconvolute complex production/consumption processes during combustion and subsequent catalytic treatments of exhaust. Car exhaust gases were sampled under running and idling state, and N2O isotopomer ratios were measured by mass spectrometry. The N2O directly emitted from an engine of a vehicle running at constant velocity had almost constant isotopomer ratios (δ 15Nbulk = -28.7 ± 1.2‰, δ 18O = 28.6 ± 3.3‰, and SP = 4.2 ± 0.8‰) irrespective of the velocity. After passing through catalytic converters, the isotopomer ratios showed an increase which varied with the temperature and the aging of the catalysts. The increase suggests that both production and consumption of N2O occur on the catalyst and that their rates can be comparable. It was noticed that in the idling state, the N2O emitted from a brand new car has higher isotopomer ratios than that from used cars, which indicate that technical improvements in catalytic converters can reduce the N2O from mobile combustion sources. On average, the isotopomeric signatures of N2O finally emitted from automobiles are not sensitive to running/idling states or to aging of the catalysts. Characteristic average isotopomer ratios of N2O from automobile sources are estimated at -4.9 ± 8.2‰, 43.5 ± 13.9‰, and 12.2 ± 9.1‰ for δ15Nbulk, δ18O, and SP, respectively.

However, particulate matter emission and thermal efficiency tend to be worse at the high EGR ratios. EGR induces the heterogeneous distributions of oxygen and temperature in a combustion chamber and these heterogeneities affect the emissions and combustion characteristics of diesel engine. If the heterogeneities of oxygen and temperature distributions can be controlled, it is expected that the simultaneous reduction of NOx and PM from diesel engine will be achieved by active control of internal and external EGR devices. In this study, the NOx and PM emissions and combustion characteristics of diesel combustion achieved in various distributions of oxygen concentration and temperature are investigated in order to clarify the effect of these heterogeneities of surroundings on the diesel combustion. The experiment was conducted with the rapid compression expansion machine (RCEM) and the combustion chamber in which various distributions of intake gas can be formed. The enthalpy and the amount of oxygen entrained into the spray upstream the ignition region are selected as the parameters in order to clarify the effect of heterogeneities of surrounding conditions on the diesel spray combustion. The results indicated that the NOx and soot emissions from diesel combustion are governed mainly by the amount of enthalpy entrained into the spray upstream the ignition region, when the temperature distribution in a chamber is changed with keeping the oxygen fraction at constant.

Afterward the papers briefly introduce the papers devoted to the above mentioned topics, which were selected for this special volume. As we can see, authors studied different kinds of management (including abandonment) and different parameters of climate change (CO 2, temperature, rainfall, etc.). They consider predominately vegetation parameters, including the various plant traits, carbon cycling, soil respiration and different ecophysiological traits in simulated climate change. Dealing with different impacts of climate and/or land-use changes on multi-species systems, that grassland communities certainly are, is exceeding merely experimental syn-thesized-community or single-species approach on one side and classical vegetation studies on the other. The complex responses of natural communities, including those under FACE systems, are not easy to interpret and understand. The importance of non-linear dynamics during climate changes is emphasized by Bartha et al. (2008). In these selected papers, grasslands appear to be a very dynamic and plastic ecosystem. Grasslands are highlighted from a new, much more topical point of view.

A Geographical Information System was used for integrating information into a cohesive and easy to consult cartographic base and database.

The current Greenhouse Gas in Animal Agriculture Conference (2007) provides a valuable forum for the development and integration of the two. Compared with the level of investments worldwide into technologies to reduce emissions from energy generation and transport, investments into managing and reducing emissions from the agriculture and land sectors have lagged, sadly, far behind. Nonetheless, there still remains strong opportunity to reduce substantially the net emissions from the land-based sector while also improving productivity and financial return (both short and long term). Over the past few decades, it has probably been the science agenda that provided the main impetus for understanding the management of processes that give rise to greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and for improving management options to reduce these emissions. However, recently a range of new policy approaches (both in Australia and elsewhere) have come into play, and these approaches are now demanding a greater suite and possibly a different set of information from science - and over a short timeframe - to provide the technical means for change to be implemented. The challenge for science is to understand the new demands from the policy agendas, and to resolve how the science community can best deliver what is required. In this way science will be delivering additional benefits to agricultural industries and rural communities as activities in the land-based sector align with national interest and opportunities.",,"agricultural emission; comparative study; emission control; environmental management; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; Australasia; Australia; Animalia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37649022181

Then, the stoichiometric networks analysis can to determine whether there exist kinetically driven dynamical instabilities and what part of the mechanism is responsible for nonlinear phenomena, e.g., multiple steady states and oscillations. The stoichiometric networks approach provides a natural way of decomposing the entire network into subsystems. All potentially unstable subnetworks are systematically examined to reveal the topological differences between the instabilities and those that are likely to be the experimentally observed. The major subnetworks are combined to form the whole mechanism and the resulting spatiotemporal patterns in the corresponding reaction-transport system are compared to those for the subnetworks. This approach leads to a refined classification of complex spatiotemporal dynamics based on that for subsystems possessing only reaction subnetworks showing a specific type of chemical instability.

This situation is characteristic for the Republic of Estonia where 59 of the need in primary energy was covered by local oil shale in 2006. Due to the calcareous origin of the mineral part of oil shale, its combustion yields lime-containing ashes (5-6 million tons annually, containing 10-25 of lime as free CaO) as well as enhanced amounts of CO 2(up to 29.1 t C per TJ energy produced) as compared to coal combustion. To transport the ash into wet open-air deposits, a hydraulic system is used. As a result tens of millions of cubic meters of alkaline water (pH level 12-13) saturated by Ca2+- ions is recycling between the plant and sedimentation ponds. Before directing excessive water to nature it should be neutralized to a pH level accepted by environmental regulations ( 9). Related to this, the current work was targeted to develop possibilities for neutralizing wastewater with CO2-containing flue gases, leading to reduction of CO2 emissions. Intensification of respective heterogeneous gas-liquid reactions and characterization of calcium carbonate (PCC) forming were other objectives of the study. A cycle of laboratory-scale neutralization experiments using industrial wastewater samples and a model gas of flue gas composition has been carried out. Two different reactors - barboter-type columns and a dispergator-type phase mixer - have been comparatively examined. Sedimentation of PCC particles of rhombohedral crystallic structure has been shown and their main characteristics have been determined.

The human and environmental threats result from large, uncontrolled amounts of carbon dioxide reaching the atmosphere. CO2 transport risk (f. ex.: pipelines) and thronging (surface and deep-seated equipment of boreholes) is well recognized and may be minimized by the use of suitable technologies decreasing the possibility of failure. The process of carbon dioxide storage is complex and that is why the evaluation of probability of involved threats occurrence and their scale estimation is difficult and dependent on many factors, such as the trapping mechanisms, boreholes quality and cohesion of overburden rocks. Drills, faults and fractures are the main paths where CO2 escape from storage site may occur. Risk minimizing is implemented through monitoring carried out while storage and after its completion. The risk connected with geological storage of CO2 is the key issue influencing the social approval of this technology and legal regulations as well as technological standards applied in industrial storage of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide in large concentrations can influence people, animals and ecosystem. Negative environmental effects caused by effluent of stored CO2 may be considered in the global and local scale. Gas migrating from the structure in which it is stored towards the surface can cause change of quality of superficial and underground waters, soils and changes surface and subsurface ecosystems. If carbon dioxide will get to level of drinking waters, then even its small quantities can change of chemism and deterioration of quality of these waters. Dissolved CO2 creates carbon acid, changing pH of water and causing sequence of indirect effects such as: mobility of toxic metals, chlorides and sulfides. Increased concentration of CO2 in soil will cause decrease of its pH, will influence negatively chemism of nutritious substances and will cause mobility of trace metals (IPCC, 2005). Stored CO2 can influence plants and animals. Its influence on microorganisms living deep in the ground and on plants and animals living in shallow layers of the ground is anticipated. Influence of increased CO2 concentration on microorganisms is subject of many investigations at present. Results show that there is a group of microorganisms which develop well at increased concentration of carbon dioxide [12].",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052783822

Less is known about the mechanisms of these relationships. This paper seeks to examine the proposition that part of the explanation may be the mediating influence of school climate. Design/methodology/approach - Teachers from 80 Virginia middle schools were surveyed employing measures including the School Climate Index, a seven-item quality of school facilities scale, as well as three resource support items. Data on student SES and achievement were also gathered. Bivariate correlational analysis was used to explore the relationships between the quality of facilities, resource support, school climate, student SES, and student achievement. In addition, multiple regression was used to test school climate as a mediating variable between the quality of facilities and student achievement. Findings - Results confirmed a link between the quality of school facilities and student achievement in English and mathematics. As well, quality facilities were significantly positively related to three school climate variables. Finally, results confirmed the hypothesis that school climate plays a mediating role in the relationship between facility quality and student achievement. Originality/value - As we face fundamental issues of equity across schools and districts, leaders struggle to convince taxpayers of the need to invest in replacing and/or renovating inadequate facilities. Deeper understandings of the complicated interplay between the physical and social environments of school, and how these dynamics influence student outcomes, may help educators build a compelling case. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Facilities; Quality; School buildings; Schools; Students; United States of America",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38549126695

Climatological information, usually expressed as long-term averages and variability, is then presented over a geographical area or at a single location and time series of these quantities or of the observations themselves are examined for evidence of warming, more-frequent severe storms, and so on. A powerful new approach to climate analysis has emerged in recent years. It applies the tools and techniques of modern everyday weather forecasting in a process called reanalysis. The products, reanalyses, have applicability far beyond that of traditional climate information. Reanalyses have become established as an important and widely utilized resource for the study of atmospheric and oceanic processes and predictability also over the data sparse polar regions. They are used in a range of applications that require a comprehensive record of the state of either the atmosphere or its underlying land and ocean surfaces. The reanalysis products, unlike their operational counterparts, do not suffer from inhomogeneities introduced by changes in the data assimilation system. Thus they are in principle better suited for use in studies of low frequency variability and climate trends that complement studies of climate change based on individual instrumental records and climate-model simulations. Climate quality requirements can be met by reanalyses for the decades with good upper-air data coverage by satellites or at least radiosonde data. The possibility of extending reanalyses to cover earlier periods when only surface observations are available in reasonable numbers (e.g., from the 1850s to the 1930s) is nevertheless of interest, and has been explored in pilot studies comparing analyses with good coverage of satellite and other upper-air data with analyses using only surface-pressure observations. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2008.","Data assimilation; Data assimilation system; Reanalysis product; Satellite radiance; Southern hemisphere",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78149391203

It is critical for the road construction industry to become part of the solution by proactively implementing technology and construction practices that assist in achieving these challenging emission reduction goals. In addition to improved asphalt technology, better construction and rehabilitation methods, and optimized pavement selection based on life-cycle cost analysis, more attention needs to be focused on pavement sustainability. This concept can be defined as a safe, efficient and environmentally friendly pavement that meets the needs of present-day users without compromising those of future generations. This paper will consider some aspects of perpetual pavement sustainability based on a practical application of the concept on the Red Hill Valley Parkway project in the City of Hamilton, Ontario. Essentially by designing and building low maintenance highways that have extended serviceable lives, there are environmental benefits in terms of reduced impact on the environment and reduced cumulative greenhouse gas emissions. The assessment of the overall impacts of construction on the environment during road building and maintenance operations used in this paper are based on European experience, particularly in France. In addition, the Pavement Life-cycle Assessment Tool for Environmental and Economic Effects (PaLATE) computer program developed at the University of California, Berkeley was used to calculate the energy consumption and gas emission during initial construction and the pavement maintenance and rehabilitation. The analysis shows that besides the lower life-cycle cost of the perpetual pavement alternative, the environmental impact of this type of pavement is significantly lower than that of the conventional deep strength pavement.",,"Construction industry; Cost benefit analysis; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Maintenance; Road construction; Sustainable development; Impact on the environment; Life-cycle assessment tools; Life-cycle cost analysis; Maintenance operations; Pavement maintenance and rehabilitations; Pavement sustainability; Rehabilitation methods; University of California , Berkeley; Pavements",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896665209

During experimental tests it was found that the gas to be processed suffers a pressure reduction, by loss of energy transmitted to the rotor, in a near isothermal manner contrary to the usual equipments utilized in the actual state of the art.

The following characteristics were determined in three repetitions: total porosity (TP), dry bulk density (Ds), particle density (Dp); water retention capacity (WRC) at 10 hPa, air-filled porosity (AP), pH-value (pH) and salinity (EC). The peat from Delta de Entre Rios is fibrous with pieces of grass and ferns still present, has a high value of TP (between 84 and 93% v/v) and 42%v of WRC.

In an experimental study, green parts were fabricated using LaserFormtm A6 tool steel powder. They were then heated in vacuum to drive off the binder and infiltrated with ASTM A532 white cast iron. During infiltration, an equilibrium state is established between the solid SLS steel part and liquid cast iron associated primarily with carbon diffusion from the cast iron into the tool steel. The equilibrium state is governed by the carbon content of the steel and cast iron, the relative density of the steel part prior to infiltration and the infiltration temperature. In some cases guided by Ashby densification maps, pre-sintering of the tool steel green part was performed to increase the initial relative density of the solid metal.",,"Carbon; Cast iron; Laser heating; Sintering; Tool steel; Commercial process; Densification maps; Equilibrium state; High temperature stability; High thermal conductivity; Infiltration temperatures; Predictive modeling; Selective laser sintering; Thermal conductivity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953180419

Different concepts are identified and compared for their performance on energy and materials recovery. Performance indicators for WtE are compared; like energy efficiency, Energy efficiency, the R1-D1O formula from the EU Waste Framework directive, and CO2-emission and avoidance. It is shown that, due to the biomass content and the avoidance effect due to the recovery of energy and materials, conventional WtE has a near zero CO2-emission per ton of waste. Optimised WtE can have a significant negative overall emission of 200-300 kgCO2/ton of waste. This means an absolute net avoidance of CO2 by WtE. The reduction relative to land filling is as much as 500-1200 kgCO2/ton of waste. The potential for optimisation of the energy recovety as well as the material recovety of the WtE infrastructure is demonstrated. If WtE is evaluated as a power plant, an optimised plant can have an emission of only 0,336 kgCO2/kWh, lower than a gas fired electrical power plant, and this absolute figure does not include the avoided landfill emissions.

The photon flux was determined using an extreme ultraviolet spectrometer equipped with a charge-coupled device camera and the spatial coherence was determined from Young double-slit interference fringes. The high-order harmonic emission is confined to just a few orders because of the small phase mismatch in the cut-off region that allows macroscopic phase matching to be satisfied for just a few harmonics in this region.

A crucial factor for this new viewpoint was the recognition that water could contribute to solve urban problems by upgrading deprived neighbourhoods.

Emissions from these systems are expected to rise over the coming decades due to the increasing global population and shifting diets, unless appropriate mitigation strategies are implemented. In this paper, we argue that the main constraints for such implementation are: (i) the complex and often poorly understood controls of GHG sources in animal production systems; (ii) the lack of knowledge on the economic and social costs involved in implementing mitigation strategies; and (iii) the strong political emphasis on mitigating nitrate leaching and ammonia volatilisation, rather than GHG emissions. We further argue that overcoming these three constraints can only be achieved by initiating integrated mitigation strategies, based on modelling and experimental work at three scales. At the 'laboratory and field scale', basic causal relationships with respect to processes of GHG formation and other detrimental fluxes need to be experimentally established and modelled. As management options are considered at the 'farm scale', this is the ideal scale to evaluate the cost-effectiveness, feasibility and possible pollution swapping effects of mitigation measures. Finally, at the 'national and supra-national scales', environmental legislation is implemented, effectiveness of environmental policies and emissions abatement measures are being monitored, and the social costs of various scenarios are being weighed. We illustrate the need for integral measures and working across different scales using our own work on the relationship between nitrogen surplus and fluxes to the environment. At the field scale, a clear positive relation between nitrogen surplus and N 2O emission, NO3- leaching and NH3 volatilisation was experimentally established. At the farm scale, the model DAIRYWISE was used to evaluate effects of minimising nitrogen surplus on the nutrient flow and economic viability of an average Dutch dairy farm. Even after including trade-off effects of CH4 emissions from cattle and manure storage, there was still a clear positive relationship between farm gate nitrogen surplus and GHG emission. At this scale, the prime issue was balancing environmental gains with economic viability. Finally, at the 'national and supra-national scale' we developed the MITERRA-EUROPE model, and used it to quantify the effects on GHG emissions of environmental policies aimed at reducing NO3- leaching and NH3 volatilisation in the 27 Member States of the European Union (EU-27). This showed the intricate relationship between different environmental goals, with both positive feedback (balanced fertilisation reduced both NO3- leaching and N2O emission) and negative feedback ('low-emission' manure application reduced NH3 volatilisation but increased N2O emission) possible. At this scale, there is a clear need for an integral approach towards reducing environmental assessment to the environment. Our studies so far suggest that 'balanced fertilisation' is among the most promising mitigation measures for simultaneously lowering N2O emission, NO3- leaching and NH3 volatilisation, without pollution swapping to CH4 emission. © CSIRO 2008.","Ammonia volatilisation; Methane; Nitrate leaching; Nitrous oxide","abatement cost; ammonia; environmental legislation; environmental policy; experimental study; greenhouse gas; implementation process; methane; mitigation; nitrous oxide; strategic approach; volatilization; Animalia; Bos",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37649018733

The rapid increase in greenhouse area is a result of an attractive export market, USA. Mexican summer midday temperatures are well above crop optimum and cooling is needed if heat stress induced crop growth reduction is to be prevented. The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of greenhouse cooling systems for tomato culture under desert, humid tropic and temperate Mexican weather conditions. These climate regions are represented by Mexicali, Merida and Huejutla respectively. The cooling systems included a variety of passive and active systems, which through an engineering design methodology were combined to suit the climate conditions of the 3 regions. The evaluation was conducted via simulation, taking into account the most important temperature effects on crop growth and yield. The results showed that the cooling systems were effective in decreasing heat stress to plants. Investment costs of greenhouse with cooling equipment were under USD 50 m -2 and operational costs were under USD 10 m-2 for all equipment combinations and treatments except for the humid tropic climate of Merida. Solutions for Merida were both economically and physically not feasible due to too high humidity levels. This model study clearly indicates that cooling is feasible in desert and moderate climate regions of Mexico but in humid tropic climate regions feasibility is a problem. Application of design methodology and design evaluation with help of simulation greatly contributed to pointing out effective and non-effective solutions to reduce heat stress in hot climates.","Greenhouse climate; Greenhouse technology; Model; Resource use; Tomato","Lycopersicon esculentum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71449089495

Urban change not only impacts on land cover but also on urban climate.

In this research Geoinformatics technology were utilized to evaluate urban growth patterns and its thermal characteristics through mapping impervious surfaces and evaluating thermal infrared images. The study case is northern part of Ho Chi Minh City, where urban area is expanded manyfold. Landsat and Aster images were used to calculate variation in urban impervious surfaces from 1989 to 2006. Thermal bands were processed to obtain radiant surface temperatures for investigating the urban heat island effect associated with increasing impervious surfaces both spatially and temporally. Impacts of urban growth on the climate conditions of urban and suburban areas in study area have been investigated by analyzing the change of surface temperature, impervious surface area using data collected from satellite images and historical climate in-situ measurements in the region.

Emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ammonia (NH2) were measured between June and October 2007 from six tanks (6.6 m2) containing liquid dairy manure in Nova Scotia, Canada. Straw was added to four of the tanks at two thicknesses (15 and 30 cm), while two tanks remained uncovered. Concentrations were measured using tunable diode lasers, an infra-red gas analyzer, and acid traps, while fluxes were measured using steady-state chambers. At the end of the study one tank from each treatment was agitated. During 122 d of undisturbed storage the 15 and 30 cm straw cover treatments both reduced total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 20% and NH3 emissions by 78 and 90%, respectively. During 5d of agitation, substantial releases of CO2, CH4 and NH3 were observed from all treatments and this decreased the overall reduction of NH3 emissions provided by the 15 and 30 cm straw cover treatments to 68 and 76%, respectively. The results suggest floating straw covers can reduce both GHG and NH3 emissions from liquid dairy manure and that agitation contributes to overall storage losses, especially for NH3.","Air quality; Dairy; Emissions; Manure; Storage","Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Leakage (fluid); Liquids; Manures; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Tanks (containers); Dairy manures; Emissions; Gas analyzers; Green house gas emissions; Infra reds; Nitrous oxides; Nova scotias; Storage; Storage loss; Tunable diode lasers; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63049133129

Our objectives were to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions from implementation of aerobic technology in USA swine farms. Emission reductions were calculated using the approved United Nations framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) methodology in conjunction with monitoring information collected during full-scale demonstration of the new treatment system in a 4360-head swine operation in North Carolina (USA). Emission sources for the project and baseline manure management system were methane (CH4) emissions from the decomposition of manure under anaerobic conditions and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions during storage and handling of manure in the manure management system. Emission reductions resulted from the difference between total project and baseline emissions. The project activity included an on-farm wastewater treatment system consisting of liquid-solid separation, treatment of the separated liquid using aerobic biological N removal, chemical disinfection and soluble P removal using lime. The project activity was completed with a centralized facility that used aerobic composting to process the separated solids. Replacement of the lagoon technology with the cleaner aerobic technology reduced GHG emissions 96.9%, from 4972 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-eq) to 153 tonnes CO2-eq/year. Total net emission reductions by the project activity in the 4360-head finishing operation were 4776.6 tonnes CO2-eq per year or 1.10 tonnes CO2-eq/head per year. The dollar value from implementation of this project in this swine farm was US$19,106/year using current Chicago Climate Exchange trading values of US$4/t CO2. This translates into a direct economic benefit to the producer of US$1.75 per finished pig. Thus, GHG emission reductions and credits can help compensate for the higher installation cost of cleaner aerobic technologies and facilitate producer adoption of environmentally superior technologies to replace current anaerobic lagoons in the USA.",,"Computation theory; Decomposition; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Particulate emissions; Chemical disinfection; Environmental quality; Wastewater treatment; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; phosphorus; Computation theory; Decomposition; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Particulate emissions; Wastewater treatment; environmental quality; environmental technology; greenhouse gas; implementation process; lagoon; manure; oxic conditions; project assessment; reduction; ungulate; waste management; waste treatment; aerobic waste treatment; air pollution control; article; composting; cost; environmental impact assessment; environmental parameters; greenhouse gas; manure; pig farming; priority journal; separation technique; solid waste; technology; United States; waste management; waste water; Aerobiosis; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; North Carolina; Swine; Waste Disposal, Fluid; North America; North Carolina; United States; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38749145598

Based on their cumulative production, number of reservoirs, average porosity and permeability, obtained recovery and depositional characteristics of reservoir rocks, the Croatian hydrocarbon fields may be divided into three groups (oil), or four groups (gas) (Table 1, 2). In the period 1941-1990 the production started in 38 fields, 13 of which before 1959. The peak was reached in 1980-1989 period, when exploitation started in 12 new fields. However, estimations of economic exploitation are optimistic. The longest period is assumed for the 1st group of fields - approx. 55 years, while for 2nd and 3rd group 46 and 36 years of exploitation are expected, respectively. Moreover, in the 1st group the average number of reservoirs is 16 and lithological composition is very favourable, since reservoirs are represented by sandstones of Pannonian and Pontian age. The exception is the Beničanci field with a reservoir in Lower and Middle Miocene breccias. The prognosed exploitation period of gas fields (without fields in the Adriatic off-shore) is between 5 and 23 years. Relatively homogeneous sandstone lithology, including good regional seals like marls, enables increasing of recovery using fluid injection. Also, injection of CO2 is planed in favourable reservoirs (immiscible phases, pressure supported) and two pilot projects are either finished (Šandrovac field in 2001) or planned in near future (Ivanić field in 2008). The water-flooding will probably be dominant secondary method for increasing recovery in the future, especially due to the fact that for the CO2 injection gas transport and careful analysis of fluids interactions in sub-surfaces are necessary. Both approaches can be very easily and successfully applied today due to very good regional tectonic, stratigraphic, depositional and geochemical investigations of the Sava and Drava depressions. It is assumed that over 2-4 times more oil was generated than oil discovered up to now. It means that, at least based on presented statistics, probably some larger fields can be discovered especially in the Drava and Sava depressions.","Croatia; Exploitation period; Hydrocarbons; Pannonian basin","Croatia; Cumulative production; Depositional characteristics; Exploitation period; Geochemical investigations; Lithological composition; Pannonian basin; Sandstone lithology; Carbon dioxide; Deposition; Environmental management; Environmental protection; Fertilizers; Gas industry; Hydrocarbons; Lithology; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Recovery; Rocks; Sandstone; Secondary recovery; Stratigraphy; Tectonics; Water injection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956967274

Unfortunately, hundreds of species and thousands of elementary reactions are involved in hydrocarbon chemical schemes and cannot be handled in practical simulations, because of the related computational costs and the need to model the complexity of their interaction with turbulent motions. Detailed chemistry may be handled using look-up tables, where chemical parameters such as reaction rates and/or species mass fractions are determined from a reduced set of coordinates, progress variables or mixture fractions, as proposed in ILDM, FPI or FGM methods. Nevertheless, these tables may require large computer memory spaces and non-negligible access times. This issue becomes of crucial importance when running on massively parallel computers: to implement these databases in shared memories would induce a large number of data exchanges, reducing the overall code performance; on the other hand duplicating databases in every local processor memory may become impossible either for large databases or small local memories. This work proposes to take advantage of the self-similar behaviour of turbulent premixed flames to reduce the size of these chemical databases, specifically when running on massively parallel machines, under the FPI (Flame Prolongation of ILDM) framework. Several approaches to reduce the database are investigated and discussed both in terms of memory requirements and access times. A very good compromise is obtained for methane-air turbulent premixed flames, where the size of the database is decreased by a factor of 1000, while the access time is reduced by about 60%.","Chemistry tabulation; High-performance computing; Modelling; Premixed flames; Turbulent combustion","Chemical properties; Combustion; Computational complexity; Data storage equipment; Fabry-Perot interferometers; Flammability; Hydrocarbons; Ignition; Methane; Organic compounds; Rate constants; Reaction rates; Smoke; Table lookup; Thermochemistry; Turbulence; Access times; Chemical databases; Chemical mechanisms; Chemical parameters; Code performances; Computational costs; Detailed chemistries; Elementary reactions; Flame propagations; High-performance computing; Large computers; Large databases; Local memories; Look-up tables; Mass fractions; Massively parallel computers; Massively parallel machines; Memory requirements; Mixture fractions; Modelling; Number of datums; Numerical simulations; Pollutant formations; Premixed flames; Processor memories; Self-similar; Shared memories; Turbulent combustion; Turbulent combustions; Turbulent motions; Turbulent premixed flames; Database systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56549115152

In a recent study by the authors, it was found that the soot formation and growth regions in lifted flames were not adequately represented by using acetylene alone as the soot inception species. Comparisons with a conceptual model and available experimental data suggested that the location of soot formation regions could be better represented if polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) species were considered as alternatives to acetylene for soot formation processes. Since the local temperatures are much lower under low temperature combustion (LTC) conditions, it is believed that significant soot mass contribution can be attributed to PAH rather than to acetylene. To quantify and validate the above observations, a reduced n-heptane chemistry mechanism has been extended to include PAH species up to four fused aromatic rings (pyrene). The resulting chemistry mechanism was integrated into the multidimensional CFD code KIVA-CHEMKIN for modeling soot formation in lifted flames in a constant volume chamber. The investigation revealed that a simpler model that only considers up to phenanthrene (three fused rings) as the soot inception species has good possibilities for better soot location predictions. The present work highlights and illustrates the various research challenges toward accurate qualitative and quantitative predictions of soot for new low emission combustion strategies for I.C. engines.

The core of the ESM is a coupled coarse-resolution Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model (AOGCM). Ocean biogeochemistry, land vegetation and ice sheets are included as components of the ESM. The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) decays in all simulations, while the Antarctic ice sheet contributes negatively to sea level rise, due to enhanced storage of water caused by larger snowfall rates. Freshwater flux increases from Greenland are one order of magnitude smaller than total freshwater flux increases into the North Atlantic basin (the sum of the contribution from changes in precipitation, evaporation, run-off and Greenland meltwater) and do not play an important role in changes in the strength of the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (NAMOC). The regional climate change associated with weakening/collapse of the NAMOC drastically reduces the decay rate of the GrIS. The dynamical changes due to GrIS topography modification driven by mass balance changes act first as a negative feedback for the decay of the ice sheet, but accelerate the decay at a later stage. The increase of surface temperature due to reduced topographic heights causes a strong acceleration of the decay of the ice sheet in the long term.

It is therefore appropriate to ask what is new about the recent raft of white certificate schemes and whether there is anything that makes them more effective than the older approaches. This paper attempts to answer these questions by reviewing the experience with earlier utility schemes and comparing them with the more recent schemes implemented on both sides of the Atlantic as well as Australia. Up-to-date results are reported on utility programme impact in all the regions, including a new indicator analysis of the collective, long-term impact of such schemes in the USA. From this it is clear that both the new and old schemes are highly effective in delivering substantial, sustained and cost effective energy savings and associated reductions in CO2 emissions. A key component of programme impact, including cost-effectiveness, is the effective alignment of utility commercial incentives with the delivery of energy savings. There are essentially two new elements of the recent utility energy efficiency schemes: i) mandated energy savings obligations and ii) the flexibility to trade the obligations. The mandated savings obligation, when linked to a suitable non-compliance penalty structure, seems to be an especially effective means of ensuring that public policy objectives for energy efficiency are met. The importance of allowing obligations to be traded for programme success is not yet clear and will require more time before proper longitudinal evaluations can be attempted. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","Cost effectiveness; Emissions trading; Energy savings; Incentives; Utility energy efficiency obligations; Utility energy efficiency programmes; White certificates","Air quality; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Energy policy; Public policy; Emissions trading; Energy savings; Incentives; Utility energy efficiency obligations; Utility energy efficiency programmes; White certificates; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54349085025

This underlies the 'kill-curve' approach which graphs crater diameter directly against likely percentage losses of taxa. However, crater diameter is a complex product of syn- and post-impact processes that can be site-dependent. Furthermore, location (global positioning) and timing (moment in geological history) also strongly influence biotic effects. We examine four of our largest and best-documented Phanerozoic impacts to explore this more holistic size - time - place relationship. Only the c. 180 km end-Cretaceous Chicxulub crater (Mexico) links to any substantial immediate extinction and some of the worst effects stem from where it struck the planet (a continental margin carbonate platform site) and when (a time of high regional and global biodiversity). Both the c. 100 km late Triassic Manicouagan crater in NE Canada (arid continental interior, low regional and world biodiversity) and the c. 35 Ma 100 km Popigai crater, Siberia (continental arctic desert) provide much less damaging scenarios. However the c. 90 km Chesapeake Bay crater, Eastern USA (also c. 35 Ma) marks a far more sensitive (Chicxulub-like) site but it also proved relatively benign. Here the rheologically varied shallow marine target site produced an anomalously broad crater, and the scale of the impact has evidently been overestimated. We offer a new approach to the graphical prediction of biotic risk in which both crater diameter and a generalised time/place factor we term 'vulnerability' are variables. © 2008 Copyright 2008 Cambridge University Press.","Bolide; Chesapeake; Chicxulub; Cratering; Ejecta; Impacts; Kill-curve; Manicouagan; Mass extinction; Popigai","biotic factor; bolide; carbonate platform; continental margin; extinction; impact structure; Phanerozoic; Chesapeake Bay; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57649129163

One of the main challenges to implementing digital audio broadcasting is that existing broadcast equipment was not designed for it. Unlike analog AM, which is low bandwidth amplitude modulated signal, OFDM is a noise-like signal with significant amplitude and phase modulation. Most AM transmitters use an envelope elimination and restoration (EER) amplifier architecture, where the amplitude and phase components of the signal are amplified separately then recombined at the high power stage. The magnitude and phase component bandwidths are several times that of the input signal, and any filtering in the amplifier will result in spectral regrowth due to poor cancellation of this high frequency content. This paper develops the concept of using time-domain preprocessing on the signal to reduce the bandwidth expansion EER amplifiers. The processing exploits the localization of bandwidth expansion and its correlation with spectral regrowth at the output. The proposed algorithm identifies distortioncausing signal sections and replaces each one with an alternative signal trajectory. Using the processing, out of band emissions reduced at the expense of increased computational complexity and error vector magnitude.

Replacing gasoline with ethanol without any additional measures results in unacceptable disadvantages mainly in terms of vehicle range. This paper summarizes combustion studies performed with gasoline as well as blends of gasoline and ethanol. These tests were performed on a modern, 4-cylinder spark ignition engine with direct fuel injection and exhaust gas recirculation. To evaluate the influence of blending on the combustion behavior the engine was operated on the base gasoline calibration. Cylinder pressure data taken during the testing allowed for detailed analysis of rates of heat release and combustion stability. The different fuels are compared in terms of combustion behavior, engine efficiency, as well as regulated emissions. Further studies will include advanced sensing tools to identify the consistency of the blend as well as optimized engine calibrations for the different blends based on sensor feedback.

An investigation on ammonia emission from dairy cattle buildings with different floor types and manure handling systems in Denmark was carried out. Ammonia emission rate was determined by measured ammonia concentrations and calculated values of air exchange rates. The overall measured ammonia emission rates were in the range of 8.9 to 46.8 g/(HPU-d) with a standard deviation from 3.9 to 25.6 g/(HPU-d) at the air temperatures from 2.3 to 22.4°C.

A well developed and disseminated knowledge base is currently lacking on the critical issues that affect planning, design, and implementation of desalination technology. These include a number of water quality, environmental, energy, economic, and social implications. Water quality is significant in desalination as it impacts treatment. Source water quality influences recovery and pretreatment operation, while product water quality is important in maintaining stable and constant water quality to end users. Environmental concerns with intake systems are significant as it may affect the biota of the marine life surrounding the intake system. High energy requirements in desalination compared to conventional sources may need to be balanced with renewable energy sources to reduce carbon footprint. To help increasing challenges in concentrate management, several considerations may help develop technical, economical, and environmentally suitable concentrate disposal options. Economic issues in implementing desalination may be high in capital and operating costs, consideration of the value of the desalinated water must also be considered. Public opinion and interest group perception can significantly impact desalination support. Complexities of regulations, limited permitting experience, and multiple agency involvement in ocean desalination may also hamper desalination progress. Coordinated effort in addressing the public and regulatory framework is crucial. These interconnected factors in implementing desalination must be addressed together rather than individually. Two major recommendations arose to improve the implementation of desalination technology. The first approach is to bring a meaningful, open, and transparent dialogue to the general public, special interest groups, politicians, and regulatory agencies. The second approach is to develop a multicriteria assessment approach to evaluate the full range of technical/functional, environmental, economic, and social/political issues related to desalination, in support of decision making. © 2008 American Water Works Association.",,"Capital and operating costs; Concentrate disposal; Critical assessment; Critical issues; Desalinated water; Desalination technologies; Economic issues; End users; Environmental concerns; General publics; High energy requirements; IT impact; Knowledge base; Marine life; Multi-criteria assessment; Ocean desalination; Pre-Treatment; Public opinions; Regulatory agencies; Regulatory frameworks; Renewable energy source; Seawater desalination; Social implication; Special interest groups; Arid regions; Carbon footprint; Exhibitions; Intake systems; Knowledge based systems; Laws and legislation; Renewable energy resources; Seawater; Social aspects; Water filtration; Water quality; Water supply; Desalination",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871817387

Enhanced crystallinity can be obtained after excimer laser annealing (ELA). However, grain growth induced by ELA is nonuniform, and the effect is limited to the upper region of the films. As the number of laser pulses increases to 120, the film shows stronger diffraction intensities and increased oxygen content, resulting in a distinct capacitance versus electric field hysteresis loop and a larger dielectric constant than the nonirradiated one. The leakage current is found to be associated with the interface quality. The conduction mechanism of nonirradiated and irradiated PSrT films is mainly governed by Schottky emission at low electric fields, whereas the Poole-Frenkel emission occurs for films irradiated with more than 120 laser pulses or laser fluences larger than 90.5 mJ cm2 at high electric fields. © 2008 American Vacuum Society.",,"Annealing; Electric field effects; Excimer lasers; Hysteresis loops; Laser pulses; Permittivity; Titanium dioxide; Laser fluences; Oxygen content; PSrT films; Schottky emission; Thin films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849097246

Two experiments were performed to confirm the validity of the approach in the current climate: the first focused on hindcasting the surge generated by a storm in early 2002 while the second provided surge statistics by running the model for the period 1990-2002; in both cases ROMS was driven with ERA-40 forcing fields. The results show that the model is capable of simulating both specific surge events and surge climate statistics with reasonable accuracy (order of 10 cm). Model outputs were also compared spatially against satellite altimetry data, corrected for long wavelength errors, from 1993 to 2001. The ROMS model consistently reproduces the sea level changes in the Irish Sea, and over the waters to the south and west of Ireland. For the investigation of the impact of the climate change on storm surges, the same configuration of ROMS was driven by atmospheric forcing fields downscaled from ECHAM5/OM1 data for the past (1961-1990) and future (2031-2060; SRES A1B greenhouse gas scenario); the downscaled data were produced using the Rossby Centre Regional Atmosphere model (RCA3). The results show an increase in storm surge events around Irish coastal areas in the future projection, except along the south Irish coast; there is also a significant increase in the height of the extreme surges along the west and east coasts, with most of the extreme surges occurring in wintertime. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This growth has fed rapid increases in energy demand and carbon emissions since 2000. China is now the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide. There is mounting pressure from some in the international community for China to take specific actions to mitigate its emissions as part of a post-2012 climate regime. However, emissions embodied in internationally traded goods have not been given enough attention in this debate. This article discusses the results of research to quantify the emissions stemming from goods that are exported from China to other countries. It finds that these emissions accounted for 23% of China's national total in 2004. The article sets out how this result has been obtained and compares it to the results of several other pieces of research to demonstrate the importance of this issue. Some pointers for international climate policy are then discussed, including the advantages and difficulties of moving to consumption-based emissions accounting, and implications for international trade rules. © 2008 Earthscan.","China; Climate policy; Competitiveness; Consumption-based emissions; Embodied carbon; Emissions accounting; International trade; Post-2012","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; competitiveness; economic growth; emission control; energy use; environmental policy; international trade; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63449112704

Using manual gas sampling chambers, we measured N2O emissions from different N fertiliser and trash management practices on two sugarcane soils throughout the entire cropping seasons. One of the trials was near Murwillumbah NSW where the cane was burnt before harvest each year; the other site was located near Mackay where green cane trash blanketing was practiced. The annual cumulative N2O emissions from the farmers’ fertilisation practices of 160 and 150 kg N/ha for the Murwillumbah and Mackay sites respectively were 44 kg N2O/ha and 5.7 kg N2O/ha, with the emission factors (% of fertiliser N emitted as N2O-N) being 10.0% and 1.32%. Polymer coated urea reduced annual N2O emission by 30% on the Murwillumbah site but increased it by 50% on the Mackay site. Although addition of nitrification inhibitor (3,4-dimethylpyrozole phosphate, DMPP) to urea reduced N2O emissions from the fertilised band, the plot-scale emissions were not significantly different between the tretaments with or without DMPP at the Murwillumbah site (P=0.05). No significant effect was observed for the nitrification inhibitor at the Mackay site. Removal of trash from the soil surface decreased N2O emissions by 30% and 24% respectively from the Murwillumbah and Mackay soils, showing the importance of organic carbon in regulating N2O fluxes. © 2008 Australian Society of Sugar Cane Technologists.

Non-attainment status with Federal particulate matter (PM) air quality standards has forced air pollution regulators in some states to focus emission reduction efforts on previously exempt agricultural operations. Specifically, farmers in California and Arizona are required to obtain air quality permits for all crop production operations including harvesting, tillage, and planting. Producers are also required to submit conservation management plans detailing the actions the producer will take to reduce fugitive PM emissions from their operation. Permit fees and fines for violations add substantially to production costs. A problem faced by producers and regulators is the lack of accurate emission factors for many agricultural field operations including cotton harvesting. The objective of this work is to document the protocol and PM emission factors developed for a six row cotton picker using a novel source measurement technique. The area based TSP, PM10, and PM2.5 emission factors developed in this work are 1.64, 0.55, and 1.58E-03 kg ha-1, respectively (1.46, 0.49, and 1.41E-03 lb ac-1, respectively). In terms of PM emitted per harvested cotton mass, the TSP, PM10, and PM2.5 emission factors are 0.22, 0.07, and 2.15E-4 kg bale-1, respectively (0.48, 0.15, and 4.74E-4 lb bale-1, respectively). The average systematic uncertainty of the emission rate measurements is 2.78% indicating that the resulting emission factors likely accurately represent the emissions from the harvester. The use of accurate emission factors in the regulatory process will help regulators focus their emission reduction efforts on the most appropriate sources.","Cotton; Emission factor; Harvesting; Isokinetic sampling; Particulate matter; PSD","Agricultural machinery; Air quality; Cotton; Cultivation; Environmental regulations; Harvesting; Laws and legislation; Permanent magnets; Power spectral density; Pulse shaping circuits; Traveling salesman problem; Uncertainty analysis; Agricultural fields; Agricultural operations; Air quality regulations; Air quality standards; Area-based; Arizona; California; Conservation managements; Cotton harvesting; Crop productions; Emission factor; Emission rates; Emission reductions; Isokinetic sampling; Measurement techniques; Non attainments; Particulate matter; Pm emissions; Production costs; PSD; Public concerns; Regulatory process; Source samplings; Systematic uncertainties; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63049115476

This includes monitoring its progress, and communicating this progress to decision-makers and to the general public in an attempt to change their behavior and move towards a low carbon economy. Leicester has a long history of implementing policies to reduce energy consumption. The city has set an ambitious target of reducing its energy use by 50% of the 1990 levels by the year 2025. An energy strategy was developed which gave details of energy demand and supply measures that should be implemented. A further target of meeting 20% of the city's energy requirements from renewable energy by 2020 is also agreed, and in 2003 a climate change strategy was produced that addressed adaptation, mitigation, evaluation, and communication. To address these ambitious targets, Leicester has undertaken many activities aimed at managing energy consumption and carbon emissions in different energy end-use sectors. The ability to measure success with implementing local energy/carbon management projects is essential. Leicester has carried out work to monitor and evaluate its progress towards its energy and greenhouse gas emissions targets. The technology required to reduce carbon emissions already exists. Support is needed to implement this technology and to maintain progress with achieving carbon savings. The energy efficiency technology is often regarded as ""unexciting"" and ""boring"". There is a need to show that ""being energy efficient"" is enjoyable and that it is something that people and organizations should aspire to. © 2008 Copyright © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

These requirements mainly focused on passenger cars, as they were recognized as one of the main contributors to air pollution. The actions implemented in this regard resulted in valuably improved powertrain systems and elaborated solutions for exhaust after-treatment systems that allow operation with considerably lowered environmental impact. Emission monitoring on vehicles out of the traffic generally confirms this evolution, but also shows some discrepancies between certification and real-world emission behaviour. In fact, a disagreement between test bench emission measurements employing the statutory cycles for vehicle certification and real-world cycles based on driving behaviour studies is recorded. Real-world vehicle emissions of subsequent certification categories improve clearly less pronounced and mostly exceed statutory emission levels. The improvements detected in the statutory test arc therefore not equally reflected in real-world vehicle use. Besides, the emission limit utilization increases for most pollutants. The current powertrain technologies also show some specific drawbacks: cold-start emissions of gasoline cars still represent the main hurdle to reach cleanest operation. CO 2-reducing concepts like lean-bum combustion lead to increased formation of nitrogen oxides that cannot be handled with a three-way catalyst anymore. Implementing pollutant-specific after-treatment thus becomes necessary with the challenge to gain maximum operational efficiency, especially when based on a regenerative trap concept. In addition, particle discharge resulting from gasoline direct fuel injection also gains relevance. Both these two process-related concerns count for state-of-the-art diescl propulsion technologies as well. There, however, regenerating particle traps are already an inevitable after-treatment technology to meet its present and future emission requirements. But some of the regeneration procedures and their frequencies of appearance valuably influence overall discharge of other pollutants. These cars also exhibit a rising share of NO 2 within NO x in the exhaust as confirmed by roadside NO 2 immision trends that, apart from its toxicity to humans, supports ozone formation, both alarming aspects regarding urban air quality. The present paper addresses to the evolution and present status of the environmental impact of individual mobility as described above basing on respective test bench data derived from real-world vehicle samples of different certification classes up to Euro 4. It is evident that further technical efforts to improve conventional propulsion and after-treatment systems are needed to achieve near pollutant-free individual mobility and technological progress to gain CO 2-neutral powertrain solutions.","Emission development; Emission trends; Legislative tests; Light vehicles; Real-world emissions","After-treatment; After-treatment technology; Cold-start; Conventional propulsion; Driving behaviour; Emission level; Emission limits; Emission measurement; Emission monitoring; Emission trends; Exhaust aftertreatment; Formation of nitrogen oxides; Future challenges; Gasoline cars; Impact on the environment; Individual mobility; Legislative tests; Light vehicles; Operational efficiencies; Ozone formation; Particle discharge; Particle traps; Passenger transportation; Pollutant emission; Power-train systems; Present status; Propulsion technology; Real-world emission; Technical efforts; Technological progress; Test benches; Three way catalysts; Urban air quality; Vehicle emission; Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Powertrains; Propulsion; Vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866061510

London implemented a congestion charge in 2004, reducing auto usage and increasing its commitment to public transportation. Paris has reallocated a highway along the Seine as Paris Plage, converting the road to a pedestrian space and manmade beach for several weeks each year. Paris has also installed thousands of bicycles throughout the city that can be rented for short journeys around town. These bikes may be picked up at any bike stand location and returned at any other location. In the United States, major cities such as Salt Lake City, Chicago, San Francisco, and Denver are contributing through their transit and bicycle initiatives to a budding revolution in sustainable/ green transport. New York City is making an especially noteworthy effort to put in place a green transportation plan. PlaNYC 2030, issued by Mayor Michael Bloomberg in April 2007, will contribute to the city meeting its pledge to reduce carbon emissions 30 percent by 2030 and setting New York on course for further reductions in the future. This chapter discusses this initiative and the question of transportation in New York City generally by first discussing the negative externalities of transportation and showing how these led to the guiding principles the city adopted. New York City has a transit advantage relative to other U.S. cities: residents rely heavily on this transit infrastructure and the city will leverage this strength in the plan. Next it outlines New York's current mobility needs, providing a window on future patterns. How the city has defined its transportation problem is a critical step in proposing a solution. The chapter ends with a description of the PlaNYC initiatives proposed to reach the city's sustainability goals. New York is unique in its low levels of auto ownership and high transit usage, two positives it must preserve and build on to achieve greater levels of sustainability. Despite its uniqueness, the city can, and should, serve as a model for other cities. Even while it has improvements to make, it is a living example of the possibility of sustainability in the transportation arena.

As a result, biomes, species distributions, hydrology and the cryosphere will undergo profound changes. It will threaten some cultural resources and change visitor activities, satisfaction and safety. Protected area management cannot contribute significantly to climate change mitigation, but it can help nature adapt to it, and help society to understand its causes and consequences. The tools for managers are: research and monitoring; awareness and engagement; leading by example; and action on the ground. The management of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems should focus on the restoration and maintenance of ecosystems, natural processes, biodiversity and abiotic processes, forms and environments that are free of significant impacts from local or regional threats to ecological integrity, cultural resources and human health. Ideally, protected areas should be nested within ecological regions that are permeable for the movement of native species and that contain sufficient habitat for the self-perpetuation of native wildlife populations. Fast and slow migrant native species should be managed to permit orderly ecological shifts that favour the maintenance of high biodiversity. Alien species should be managed to minimize their presence. The management of marine ecosystems should focus on the conservation of biotic resources and sustainable resource use, also free from significant local and regional threats to wild populations and human health. Conversely, parks should neither be manipulated to sequester carbon or to buffer against natural disasters, nor be moved in pursuit of migrating or future ecoregions. Where natural regions guide park establishment, they should not be recast wholesale in anticipation of landscape evolution. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73849111628

Rapid advances are being made in the automobile industry to research and develop more efficient vehicles. The very successful introduction of gasoline-electric hybrid automobiles has spawned intense research and development of advanced batteries, ultra-capacitors, electric motors and controls. Opportunities for adapting automobile technologies to small general aviation airplanes should be exploited. Over the past few years, several groups have successfully flown experimental airplanes powered by ground-rechargeable batteries. Performance studies of small single-engine battery-powered airplanes show that performance is severely restricted because of low specific energy values (kWh/kg) of chemical batteries compared to traditional fossil fuels. However, advantages of zero in-flight emissions, high reliability, and fuel cost of only $1/gallon of avgas equivalent make the battery-powered airplane increasingly attractive. An airplane with minimum power lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) of 17 and battery with specific energy of 0.250 kWh/kg will provide single-person flight duration of two hours, or two-person flight duration of one hour, adequate for many Light Sport Aircraft (LSA) and training operations.

However, new vehicle fuel economy standards have not been significantly tightened since they were first enacted three decades ago. A historical impediment to imposing tougher fuel economy standards has been the long-standing perception that reducing the mass of a car or truck would make it more dangerous to its occupants in a crash. One often hears that this perception is dictated by ""simple physics:"" that, all else being equal, you are at greater risk in a lighter vehicle than in a heavier one. Our research on driver fatality risk has found that, when it comes to vehicle safety, all else is never equal. Vehicle mass is not the most important variable in determining occupant safety, not even in frontal crashes between two vehicles. You are at no greater risk driving an average car than you are driving a much heavier (and less fuel efficient) truck-based SUV. And larger and heavier truck-based SUVs and pickups impose enormous risks on car occupants. We summarize the most recent research on the interplay between vehicle weight, size and safety, and what the implications are for new state and federal standards to reduce vehicle CO 2 emissions. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54049156115

During the intervening forty-plus years, knowledge and technologies have continued to explode in unanticipated ways. Today, we understand in great detail the molecular mechanisms of the many levels of metabolic and genetic regulation that control carbon flow through the amino acid biosynthetic pathways. Traditional experimental approaches are not sufficient for the integration and reconstruction of complex biological systems using data mostly generated by high-throughput experiments. Only with computational methods and adequate modeling tools will we be able to reconstruct and query these large and complicated systems. Due to complicated enzyme reaction mechanisms and the frequent lack of rate constant measurements needed for solving differential equations, most investigators have turned their attention to the development of abstract, top-down modeling tools. For example, Palsson and colleagues have used metabolic flux balance analysis (FBA) methods to simulate steady-state metabolite flux through E. coli pathways representing hundreds of enzyme steps.

Our objective was to investigate the influence of litter management strategies on NH 3 emissions from commercial broiler barns employing new bedding, acid-treated built-up litter (sodium bisulphate), or untreated built-up litter (normal practzce). Nearly 400 barn-days of NH 3 emissions data were collectedfroin 12 broiler barns onfourfarms monitored in 48-hour episodes over one year. On each study farm, the barns were paired for repetition of conditions. Emission was calculated as the product of gas concentration of the exhaust air and barn ventilation rate. Use of new beddzng for every flock led to consistently lower NH 3 emission (averaging 0.35 g NH 3/(bird d)) at day 21 of the 42-day flock grow-outs, followed by flocks raised on the annual cleanout with new bedding (0.52 g NH 3/(bird d)). Built-up litter without any treatment had the highest emission (0.73 g NH 3/ (bird d)), followed by the built-up litter with acid treatment (0.63 g NH 3/(bird d)). One study site was managed with two barns using litter treatment and two identical barns with untreated, built-up litter for a side-by-side comparison of results under field conditions. Ammonia emissions from treated built-up litter barns were similar to those from untreated built- up litter barns, however, the temporal pattern of emissions provided evidence that ammonia held in the acid-treated litter at the beginning of the flock was released durzng the latter period of the flock cycle.","Ammonia control; Emission rate; NH 3; Poultry","Acid treatments; Aerial emissions; Ammonia emissions; Broiler chickens; Clean outs; Emission rate; Exhaust airs; Field conditions; Gas concentrations; Management strategies; NH 3; Poultry; Sodium bisulphate; Study sites; Temporal patterns; Ventilation rates; Acids; Agriculture; Air quality; Ammonia; Farm buildings; Food products plants; Sodium; Ventilation exhausts; Leakage (fluid)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63149152725

But it is far from clear how state and local governments in the United States can best address climate change through planning. Purpose: As of 2008, 29 states had prepared some sort of climate change plan, and more than 170 local governments had joined the Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) campaign that requires that a plan be developed. This article analyzes this first generation of climate change plans and seeks to assess the goals being set, the measures included or left out, issues surrounding implementation, and the basic strengths and weaknesses of state and local climate change planning to date.Methods: I conducted this research by analyzing planning documents as well as interviewing state and local officials by telephone. I analyzed the plans of three types of governments: all states with planning documents on climate change; cities with populations of over 500,000 that are members of the CCP campaign; and selected smaller cities that are CCP members. Results and conclusions: Most plans set emissions-reduction goals, establish emission inventories, green public sector operations, and recommend a range of other measures. Many recent plans have been developed through extensive stakeholder processes and present very detailed lists of recommendations with quantified emissions benefits. But emissions-reduction goals vary widely, many proposed actions are voluntary, few resources have been allocated, and implementation of most measures has not yet taken place. Most plans do not address adaptation to a changing climate. Officials see rapidly growing public awareness of the issue and general support for climate change planning, but reluctance to change personal behavior. Takeaway for practice: Future climate change planning should (a) set goals that can adequately address the problem; (b) establish long-term planning frameworks in which progress toward these goals can be monitored on a regular basis and actions revised as needed; (c) include the full range of measures needed to reduce and adapt to climate change; (d) ensure implementation of recommended actions through commitment of resources, revised regulation, incentives for reducing emissions, and other means; and (e) develop strategies to deepen public awareness of the need for fundamental changes in behavior, for example regarding motor vehicle use.","Climate change; Global warming; Municipal planning; State planning; Sustainable development","climate change; emission control; global warming; local government; stakeholder; state role; sustainable development; urban planning; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65449125874

The chemical index of alteration (CIA) was used to investigate the weathering of silicate minerals. Paleosols generated before the IETM have CIA values ranging from 62 to 72, and CIA values during the IETM range from 67 to 82. The CIA values for pre-initial Eocene thermal maximum paleosols indicate moderate weathering conditions, and CIA values during the event indicate moderate to extreme weathering conditions. The clay mineralogy of the paleosols is dominated by smectite, and it is only within paleosols that formed during the IETM that there is a change. There is a notable increase in the amount of kaolinite in one paleosol horizon that is associated with the carbon excursion. In addition, there is an increase in the translocation of clays and iron, and an increase in the leaching of calcite and plagioclase in initial Eocene thermal maximum paleosols. The differences between soils that formed before and during the initial Eocene thermal maximum indicate that chemical weathering did increase during this ancient global warming event. The mechanism responsible for increased weathering is interpreted to be an increase in hydrolysis reactions caused by an increase in humidity and an increase of carbonic acid in the soil due to elevated CO2 levels during the initial Eocene thermal maximum. Documentation of an increase in chemical weathering during the initial Eocene thermal maximum is significant because it may have served as a negative feedback to reduce atmospheric CO2. © 2008 Geological Society of America.","Chemical weathering; Initial Eocene thermal maximum; Kaolinite; Paleosols","Atmospheric CO; Big Bend National Park; Carbonic acids; Chemical index of alterations; Chemical weathering; Clay mineralogy; Elevated CO; Hydrolysis reaction; Initial Eocene thermal maximum; Negative feedback; Paleogene; Paleosols; Paper tests; Smectites; Texas , USA; Thermal maxima; Weathering conditions; Atmospheric humidity; Calcite; Carbon dioxide; Carbonate minerals; Crystallography; Erosion; Feedback; Feldspar; Geochemistry; Global warming; Kaolinite; Leaching; Mineralogy; Minerals; Organic acids; Parks; Silicate minerals; Soils; Weathering; chemical weathering; clay mineral; Eocene; paleoclimate; Paleogene; paleosol; pedogenesis; silicate mineral; Big Bend National Park; North America; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69949170158

Of these processes, loss of physical protection of OM through the breaking up of soil aggregation can result in up to 65% of soil carbon (C) reductions. Objectives of this research were to monitor soil aggregate size distribution and associated C throughout short-term stockpiling and subsequent utilization of topsoil for reclamation. Soil samples were collected from the top 5 cm of a stockpile over a 3 year period (&lt;1, 1.5, 3 yrs) and an adjacent undisturbed, native site. Surface stockpile soils were then tracked to a temporary location following stockpile removal and sampled again. Samples were analyzed for aggregate size distribution, fractions, associated C, and OM turnover with 13C natural abundance. Macroaggregation increased and microaggregation decreased after 3 yrs of storage, indicating recovery of aggregation in 3 yrs. Following the second removal, macroaggregate proportions decreased and silt and clay fractions were greater than that observed in the native site soils. The second disturbance resulted in greater destruction of aggregate structure than the initial disturbance during topsoil salvage. Carbon increased significantly between &lt;1 and 1.5 yrs in both aggregate size classes. Macro- and microaggregate light fraction (LF) C decreased with storage time as this material was available for utilization by microbes. Aggregate δ 13C values indicated up to 65% new C associated with aggregate structure.

Carnegie Avenue, Santa Ana, CA 92705, United States","Coal-fired power plants firing low cost coals or equipped with combustion modifications for NOx controls are challenged with maintaining good combustion conditions while maximizing generation and minimizing emissions. In many cases significant derates, availability losses and increase in unburned carbon levels can be attributed to poor combustion conditions as a result of poorly controlled local fuel-air distribution within the boiler furnace. A new generation of combustion optimization technologies is available utilizing burner air and fuel controls and spatially distributed combustion monitors to detect and correct local furnace air-fuel distribution imbalances. GE Energy's method of combustion optimization uses on-line exhaust gas monitors and upfront information about the furnace flow field to determine optimum burner and overfire-air system airflow distributions. The system monitors the exhaust gases' excess oxygen (O2) and combustible gases, primarily carbon monoxide (CO), by using a spatially distributed monitoring grid located in the boiler's high temperature upper convective backpass region. At these locations, the furnace flow is still significantly stratified and air in-leakage is minimal which enables tracing of poor combustion zones to specific burners and overfire-air ports. Using a model-based tuning system, operators can rapidly respond to poor combustion conditions by redistributing airflows to select burners and overfire-air ports. By improving combustion at every point within the furnace, the boiler can operate at reduced excess O2 and reduced furnace exit gas temperature (FEGT) levels while also reducing localized hot spots, corrosive gas conditions, slag or clinker formation and carbon-in-ash (CIA). Benefits include improving efficiency, reducing NOx emissions, increasing output and maximizing availability.

The improvement plan included new buses, upgraded stations, intelligent transportation system applications, transit priority measures, as well as park and ride facilities. While several of the initiatives were system-wide, others were focused on major arterial streets with high levels of transit service. These streets have been designated as ""Quality Corridors"". Dillon Consulting Limited was retained to study and implement the transit priority measures. This included a study of eleven Quality Corridors, modeling the traffic and transit patterns, analyzing possible transit priority measures, and implementing the recommended measures through construction. This report presents a case study of the impacts of the transit priority measures in the first three Quality Corridors of the program: Pembina Highway; St. Mary's Road; and St. Anne's Road. This was Phase I of three phases. Transit priority measures are one of the few strategies that can be used concurrently to attract passengers with moderate capital costs. Improvements in speed and reliability make transit travel more competitive with automobile travel and attract ridership. A decrease in bus running times due to priority measures can lead to higher operating speed and reduced delay, which can translate to more reliable service, decreased delays, fuel consumption, and emissions from idling vehicles. Increased ridership can further result in reduced emissions and congestion from the reduction in passenger cars on the roadway. There are many ways to provide priority to on street transit over regular traffic. A variety of items in the ""toolbox"" are necessary to be able to address different situations. Retrofitting an existing arterial or collector street to include transit priorities usually means issues with traffic volumes, restricted right-of-way, traffic signal spacing, and adjacent parking and access. There is no ""one size fits all"" solution to promote transit. Measures can include dedicated bus lanes, bus-only links or ""shortcuts"", queue jumps, transit priority signals, and even optimization of existing signal phases for transit. In general, transit priority measures were implemented within the Corridors without unduly impacting general traffic movements. In this way, the gap in speed between transit and other traffic was narrowed and transit can become more attractive to commuters. This reduced delay, idling, and emissions for all modes, is a benefit to the community and contributes to a more sustainable city.",,"Fuel consumption; Intelligent systems; Traffic signals; Traffic surveys; Automobile travels; Improvement plans; Intelligent transportation systems; Operating speed; Sustainable cities; Traffic movements; Traffic volumes; Transit services; Roads and streets",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896630044

The most critical tests of climate model predictions will occur using observations of decadal changes in climate forcing, response, and feedback variables. Many of these key climate variables are observed by remotely sensing the global distribution of reflected solar spectral and broadband radiance. These ""reflected solar"" variables include aerosols, clouds, radiative fluxes, snow, ice, vegetation, ocean color, and land cover. Achieving sufficient satellite instrument accuracy, stability, and overlap to rigorously observe decadal change signals has proven very difficult in most cases and has not yet been achieved in others [2]. One of the earliest efforts to make climate quality observations was for Earth Radiation Budget: Nimbus 6/7 in the late 1970s, ERBE in the 1980s/90s, and CERES in 2000s are examples of the most complete global records. The recent CERES data products have carried out the most extensive intercomparisons because if the need to merge data from up to 11 instruments (CERES, MODIS, geostationary imagers) on 7 spacecraft (Terra, Aqua, and 5 geostationary) for any given month. In order to achieve climate calibration for cloud feedbacks, the radiative effect of clear-sky, all-sky, and cloud radiative effect must all be made with very high stability and accuracy. For shortwave solar reflected flux, even the 1% CERES broadband absolute accuracy (1-σ confidence bound) is not sufficient to allow gaps in the radiation record for decadal climate change. Typical absolute accuracy for the best narrowband sensors like SeaWiFS, MISR, and MODIS range from 2 to 4% (1-σ). IPCC greenhouse gas radiative forcing is ̃ 0.6 Wm -2 per decade or 0.6% of the global mean shortwave reflected flux, so that a 50% cloud feedback would change the global reflected flux by ̃ 0.3 Wm -2 or 0.3% per decade in broadband SW calibration change. Recent results comparing CERES reflected flux changes with MODIS, MISR, and SeaWiFS narrowband changes concluded that only SeaWiFS and CERES were approaching sufficient stability in calibration for decadal climate change [3]. Results using deep convective clouds in the optically thick limit as a stability target may prove very effective for improving past data sets like ISCCP. Results for intercalibration of geostationary imagers to CERES using an entire month of regional nearly coincident data demonstrates new approaches to constraining the calibration of current geostationary imagers. The new Decadal Survey Mission CLARREO is examining future approaches to a ""NIST-in- Orbit"" approach of very high absolute accuracy reference radiometers that cover the full solar and infrared spectrum at high spectral resolution but at low spatial resolution. Sampling studies have shown that a precessing CLARREO mission could calibrate other geo and leo reflected solar radiation and thermal infrared sensors. © 2008 IEEE.","Calibration; Meteorology; Remote Sensing","A-stability; Absolute accuracy; All-sky; Broadband radiances; Climate forcing; Climate model; Climate prediction; Climate quality; Climate variables; Confidence bounds; Critical challenges; Data products; Data sets; Decadal change; Deep convective clouds; Earth radiation Budget; Geostationary imagers; Global climate changes; Global distribution; High spectral resolution; High stability; In-orbit; Infrared spectrum; Intercalibration; Intercomparisons; Land cover; Narrow bands; New approaches; Ocean color; Potential impacts; Radiance calibration; Radiative effects; Radiative fluxes; Radiative forcing; Satellite instruments; SeaWiFs; Spatial resolution; Thermal infrared sensors; Time-scale; Aerosols; Atmospheric radiation; Band structure; Climatology; Clouds; Feedback; Geostationary satellites; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Image sensors; Infrared spectroscopy; Ocean currents; Ocean engineering; Remote sensing; Spacecraft instruments; Spectrometers; Stability; Sun; Calibration",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649763928

This paper summarises recent evidence of urban impacts on climate and vice versa. The technique of statistical downscaling is then introduced through exemplar studies of London's future urban heat island and peak ozone concentrations. Projections of both indices are derived from atmospheric variables supplied by four general circulation models, driven by a medium-high (A2) emissions scenario for the 2050s. The results show further intensification of the nocturnal heat island and higher ozone concentrations that are most pronounced in summer. These changes reflect sensitivity to variations in regional climate alone, so omit other factors such as changes in land use, emissions, climate feedbacks, or synergies between air quality and heat islands. Nonetheless, the downscaled scenarios are consistent with an emerging picture of increasing risks to human health in urban areas unless appropriate adaptation measures are taken. © 2008 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.",,"air quality; atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; downscaling; heat island; ozone; urban climate; England; Eurasia; Europe; London [England]; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58849107436

The remaining GHG emissions predominantly comprise carbon dioxide (CO2) deriving from energy and industry sources. Proposed strategies to mitigate emissions of CH4 and N2O from pastoral agriculture in New Zealand are: (1) utilising extensive and riparian afforestation of pasture to achieve CO2 uptake (carbon sequestration); (2) management of nitrogen through budgeting and/or the use of nitrification inhibitors, and minimizing soil anoxia to reduce N 2O emissions; and (3) utilisation of alternative waste treatment technologies to minimise emissions of CH4. These mitigation measures have associated co-benefits and co-costs (disadvantages) for rivers, streams and lakes because they affect land use, runoff loads, and receiving water and habitat quality. Extensive afforestation results in lower specific yields (exports) of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), suspended sediment (SS) and faecal matter and also has benefits for stream habitat quality by improving stream temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH regimes through greater shading, and the supply of woody debris and terrestrial food resources. Riparian afforestation does not achieve the same reductions in exports as extensive afforestation but can achieve reductions in concentrations of N, P, SS and faecal organisms. Extensive afforestation of pasture leads to reduced water yields and stream flows. Both afforestation measures produce intermittent disturbances to waterways during forestry operations (logging and thinning), resulting in sediment release from channel re-stabilisation and localised flooding, including formation of debris dams at culverts. Soil and fertiliser management benefits aquatic ecosystems by reducing N exports but the use of nitrification inhibitors, viz. dicyandiamide (DCD), to achieve this may under some circumstances impair wetland function to intercept and remove nitrate from drainage water, or even add to the overall N loading to waterways. DCD is water soluble and degrades rapidly in warm soil conditions. The recommended application rate of 10 kg DCD/ha corresponds to 6 kg N/ha and may be exceeded in warm climates. Of the N2O produced by agricultural systems, approximately 30% is emitted from indirect sources, which are waterways draining agriculture. It is important therefore to focus strategies for managing N inputs to agricultural systems generally to reduce inputs to wetlands and streams where these might be reduced to N2O. Waste management options include utilizing the CH4 resource produced in farm waste treatment ponds as a source of energy, with conversion to CO2 via combustion achieving a 21-fold reduction in GHG emissions. Both of these have co-benefits for waterways as a result of reduced loadings. A conceptual model derived showing the linkages between key land management practices for greenhouse gas mitigation and key waterway values and ecosystem attributes is derived to aid resource managers making decisions affecting waterways and atmospheric GHG emissions. © IWA Publishing 2008.","Agriculture; CH4; CO2; Greenhouse gas; N2O; Water quality","Agricultural system; Application rates; Aquatic ecosystem; Benefits and costs; Carbon sequestration; CH4; Climate change mitigation; CO2; Conceptual model; Dicyandiamide; Drainage water; Faecal organisms; Fertilisers; Food resources; Forestry operations; GHG emission; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Habitat quality; Land management practices; Making decision; Mitigation measures; N2O; New zealand; Nitrification inhibitor; Nitrous oxide; Receiving waters; Resource managers; Sediment release; Soil conditions; Source of energy; Specific yield; Stabilisation; Stream habitats; Stream temperatures; Suspended sediment; Warm climates; Water yield; Watersoluble; Wetland functions; Woody debris; Agriculture; Air pollution; Biochemical oxygen demand; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Debris; Defect structures; Denitrification; Dissolution; Dissolved oxygen; Ecosystems; Energy conversion; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Hydraulic structures; Industrial waste treatment; International trade; Land use; Leakage (fluid); Loading; Logging (forestry); Methane; Nitrification; Nitrogen oxides; Ocean habitats; Oxidation; Oxygen supply; Phosphorus; Public key cryptography; Reforestation; Sedimentology; Sediments; Soils; Stream flow; Waste incineration; Waste management; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Water quality; Water recycling; Water resources; Wetlands; Rivers; afforestation; carbon dioxide; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; habitat quality; land management; land use; nitrous oxide; pastoralism; soil management; waste treatment; water pollution; water quality; Agriculture; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Fertilizers; Greenhouse Effect; Waste Management; Water Supply; Agriculture; Air Pollution; Bod; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Monoxide; Dissolved Oxygen; Effluent Treatment; Greenhouse Gases; Hydraulic Structures; Industrial Wastes; Land Use; Nitrification; Rivers; Water Quality; Australasia; New Zealand",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58949089482

The fundamental back pressure and filtration efficiency characteristics of gel-cast ceramic foam diesel particulate filters (DPFs) have been investigated. Methodology is developed for the first time that allows the calculation of the effect of local PM loading on the pressure drop characteristics from experimental data without problems caused by the non-uniform PM loading in the filter that can be applied to all depth bed filtration media. The back pressure and filtration efficiency relationships were used to develop graphical design spaces to aid development of application-specific DPFs. Effects of PM distribution on the pressure drop of the filter are presented. Filters with a non-even distribution of PM were found to have lower pressure drops than filters with an evenly distributed PM for the same average specific PM loadings. The predictions showed that gel-cast ceramic foams can achieve comparable back pressure, filtration volume, and PM holding capacity with WFFs with a lower filtration efficiency of about 80 per cent. The model demonstrated that greater than 90 per cent filtration efficiency can be achieved with filter volumes of about 0.6 times the volume of a WFF with a lower PM holding capacity. © IMechE 2008.","Back pressure; Depth bed filter; Diesel particulate filter; Filtration efficiency; Gel-cast ceramic foam; Model; Optimization","Air filters; Ceramic materials; Colloids; Diesel engines; Drops; Filters (for fluids); Fuel filters; Gelation; Gels; Internal combustion engines; Loading; Optimization; Particulate emissions; Permanent magnets; Porous materials; Pressure drop; Wall flow; Wave filters; Application specifics; Back pressure; Back pressures; Bed filtrations; Configurable; Depth bed filter; Diesel particulate filter; Diesel particulate filters; Experimental datums; Filtration efficiencies; Filtration efficiency; Filtration volumes; Graphical designs; Holding capacities; Internal combustions; Lower pressures; Non uniforms; Particulate matter emissions; Pressure drop characteristics; Wall flow filters; Ceramic foams",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57049138278

Because orexin neurons receive inputs that signal metabolic, sleep/wake and emotional states, it is tempting to speculate that they may regulate breathing according to these parameters. Knockout of the orexin gene in mice reduces CO2-induced increases in breathing by ∼50% and increases the frequency of spontaneous sleep apneas. The relationship between orexins and breathing may be bidirectional: the rate of breathing controls acid and CO2 levels, and these signals alter the electrical activity of orexin neurons in vitro. Overall, these findings suggest that orexins are important for the regulation of breathing and may potentially play a role in the pathophysiology and medical treatment of respiratory disorders. © Cambridge University Press 2008.",,"orexin; orexin 1 receptor; orexin 2 receptor; arousal; breathing; cell membrane potential; chronic obstructive lung disease; cognitive arousal; consciousness; feeding behavior; homeostasis; hormone action; human; hypercapnia; hyperventilation; lateral hypothalamus; narcolepsy; nerve cell stimulation; obesity hypoventilation syndrome; priority journal; protein expression; receptor binding; respiration center; review; signal transduction; sleep; sleep apnea syndrome; wakefulness; Mus",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53849145356

Local GHG reduction strategies are often capital investments such as new green buildings, ignoring the promise of operational strategies. Purpose: The research is intended to support local planning efforts for GHG reduction in areas where land uses are separated and transit use is low. It is also intended to contribute to the dialogue on the potential for local actions versus broader state, federal, or international initiatives. Methods: Using the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (CPP) campus in eastern Los Angeles County as a case study, this ex ante evaluation estimates the cost effectiveness of eight capital and operating GHG-reduction strategies. It uses locally developed estimation methods in combination with the Clean Air-Cool Planet GHG inventory model. Results and conclusions: Carbon neutrality in suburban areas is a fantasy unless there are supportive energy, transportation, and carbon sequestration initiatives at the state, national, and international level. We find that local operational strategies, such as online classes and alternative scheduling, green energy purchase, and parking pricing and carpool programs have merit. Greater results are achieved when operational strategies are combined with cost-effective capital investments such as land use mixing (in this case, on-campus housing). Even so, some of the most favored capital approaches, such as a new green building or building commuter rail transit station facilities, rank near the bottom in cost effectiveness. Takeaway for practice: Given the urgency of reducing GHG emissions, local planners and activity center managers should evaluate both capital and operating strategies and implement the most cost-effective strategies in new and existing development.","Campus planning; Cost-effectiveness evaluation; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Suburban activity centers","carbon emission; emission control; greenhouse gas; suburban area; urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65449171247

In the soil, it records the isotopic signal of water pools subjected to precipitation and evaporation events. The δ18O of the surface soil net CO2 flux is dominated by the physical processes of diffusion of CO2 into and out of the soil and the chemical reactions during CO2-H2O equilibration. Catalytic reactions by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, reducing CO2 hydration times, have been proposed recently to explain field observations of the δ18O signatures of net soil CO2 fluxes. How important these catalytic reactions are for accurately predicting large-scale biosphere fluxes and partitioning net ecosystem fluxes is currently uncertain because of the lack of field data. In this study, we determined the δ18O signatures of net soil CO2 fluxes from soil chamber measurements in a Mediterranean forest. Over the 3 days of measurements, the observed δ18O signatures of net soil CO2 fluxes became progressively enriched with a well-characterized diurnal cycle. Model simulations indicated that the δ18O signatures recorded the interplay of two effects: (1) progressive enrichment of water in the upper soil by evaporation, and (2) catalytic acceleration of the isotopic exchange between CO2 and soil water, amplifying the contributions of 'atmospheric invasion' to net signatures. We conclude that there is a need for better understanding of the role of enzymatic reactions, and hence soil biology, in determining the contributions of soil fluxes to oxygen isotope signals in atmospheric CO2. © Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.","Atmospheric invasion; Carbonic anhydrase; Drought; Mediterranean forests; Oxygen isotopes; Quercus suber; Soil CO2 efflux; Soil evaporation; Soil water δ18O composition","carbon dioxide; carbon flux; catalysis; climate effect; diffusion; drought; evaporation; gas exchange; net ecosystem production; oxygen isotope; pool; soil carbon; terrestrial ecosystem; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; Quercus suber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48849112032

PM and NO x have been major constituents of the Diesel emissions and the regulations are getting stringent. But these Diesel emissions arc difficult to reduce due to the broad range of fucl-air mixtures present during the combustion process. In a conventional Diesel engine, air is gradually drawn into the fuel spray from the surrounding area. The ignition delay period is short, so combustion starts before the fuel has thoroughly mixed with the air. Consequently, the centre of the spray is overly rich, resulting in smoke, while a stoichiometric mixture is formed in the surrounding area, resulting in a high NO x concentration. In order to develop a low emission engine, research is necessary to come up with a new combustion strategy for Diesel engine. The new combustion strategics such as LTC (low temperature combustion) for Diesel engine have been widely studied as a combustion technology to avoid NO x and smoke formation regions simultaneously. In PCCI (premixed charged compression ignition) approach the combustion temperature is lowered by forming a lean prc-mixturc which simultaneously and substantially reduces NO x and smoke. A very long mixing period is required to form a lean and uniform mixture, and it is necessary to inject fuel at a fairly early time. At this point, as the temperature and in-cylinder pressure arc low, a large amount of the sprayed fuel adheres to the wall, causing problems of oil dilution and a decline in combustion efficiency. This can be avoided by suppressing the penetrating force of the spray using a narrow cone angle nozzle. This paper focuses on reducing the HC and CO emissions with the special nozzles under low loads using conventional piston bowl. Future goals include optimization of injection strategy by varying piston bowl geometry with the selected nozzle. A mixture of n-decane and a-mcthylnaphthalcnc known as IDEA fuel was used as the surrogate fuel for Diesel for numerical studies with different spray cone angles. Effect of the choice of surrogate fuel is also studied for conventional spray cone angle.","Early injection; LTC; Narrow spray-cone angle; PCCI; Surrogate fuel","CO emissions; Combustion efficiencies; Combustion pro-cess; Combustion technology; Combustion temperatures; Compression ignition; Cone angle; Diesel combustion system; Diesel emission; Experimental studies; Fuel sprays; HC emissions; Ignition delays; Low emission engines; Low load; Low temperature combustion; Low temperatures; LTC; N-decane; Narrow spray-cone angle; Numerical studies; PCCI; Premixed; Pressure arc; Spray cone angle; Stoichiometric mixtures; Surrogate fuels; Uniform mixtures; Carbon dioxide; Exhaust systems (engine); Fuels; Ignition; Mixtures; Paraffins; Smoke; Spray nozzles; Temperature; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866131504

Well planning with accurate information of target reservoir would not only optimize drilling operation and completion but also maximizes production of oil and gas. To produce hydrocarbons effectively, the wellbore must communicate with formations beyond the altered zone and this can be accomplished by using proper perforation penetration or creating fractures. Thus the prediction of invaded zone is critical and a numerical model can be used for preplanning purposes. In this study, the dynamic filtration process and the related penetration into the gas and oil bearing reservoirs are studied in a vertical openhole system using a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software package. The radius of filtrate invasion is determined by the unsteady-state three-dimensional multiphase fluid flow model. This study investigates the communication between fluids and formations during drilling with special emphasis on the effects of formation porosity and permeability, time, and overbalanced pressure.

Also the sizeable footprint restricts use of altimetry to greater than 10 km from any coast, with some restrictions at a greater distance. The sampling limitations do not negate the usefulness of altimetry, either in isolation or in combination with other instruments or modelling. Climatologies of sea level and wave parameters built from altimetry provide a unique perspective on both a regional and global scale. Measurements of individual storm events provide a test for both wave and storm-surge modelling and could be useful in Near Real Time applications.

Although these geological settings may constitute the most readily accessible sites for immediate utilization, it is unlikely that they represent sufficient cumulative storage capacity to keep pace with global CO2 production and future disposal requirements. In addition, the requirement for longterm maintenance of CO2 sequestered in fluid form, raises concerns over gas leaks. The Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) investigated potential opportunities to sequester CO2 in solid, hydrate form in Canadian reservoirs having the appropriate pressure and temperature conditions. Initial screening of candidate reservoirs has identified substantial storage potentials in extensive porous sandstone and limestone formations beneath portions of the Canadian Great Lakes, and in areas of the Mackenzie-Beaufort hydrocarbon development region in northern Canada.

Significant achievements have been made by continuous investigation of glacier inventories, frozen ground observations, paleo-climate analyses of ice cores, process studies and the modeling of cryopsheric/ atmospheric interactions. The general facts and understanding of these changes include: (1) Solid precipitation, including the number of days with frost and hail storms, shows a decreasing tendency over the past half century. (2) In most areas glaciers are retreating or have completely vanished (>80%), some glaciers are still advancing (5%-20% depending upon time period). The annual glacial melt water has been increasing since the 1980s. This increased supply of melt water to river runoff in Northwest China is about a 10%-13%. (3) The long-term variability of snow cover in western China is characterized by a large inter-annual variation superimposed on a small increasing trend. Snow cover variability in the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau (QXP) is influenced by the Indian monsoon, and conversely impacts monsoon onset and strength and eventually the drought and flood events in middle-low reaches of Yangtze River. (4) Frozen ground, including permafrost, is decaying both in QXP and in Northeast China. The most significant changes occurred in the regions with thickest seasonal frozen ground (SFG), i.e., inland QXP, then northeastern and northwestern QXP. The cold season air temperature is the main factor controlling SFG change. The increase of ground surface temperatures is more significant than air temperature. (5) The sea ice coverage over the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea has deceased since the 1980s. (6) River ice duration and ice thickness is also decreasing in northern China. In 2001, the Chinese National Committee of World Climate Research Program/Climate and Cyosphere (WCRP/CliC) (CNC-CliC) was organized to strengthen research on climate and cryosphere in China. Future monitoring of the cryosphere in China will be enhanced both in spatial coverage and through the use of new techniques. Interactions between atmosphere/cryosphere/hydrosphere/ land-surface will be assessed to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of cryospheric change. © Science Press 2008.","Climate change; CNC-WCRP/CliC; Cryosphere; Global warming; Observations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55349087275

The average heating value of the bio-oil product was estimated at 34 MJ/kg. The oil product could be used as a boiler fuel or as fuel in combustion engines.

Error in the emission data is a primary source of error in air quality forecasts, much like the effect of error in the initial conditions on the accuracy of weather forecasting. Data assimilation has been widely used to improve weather forecasting by correcting the initial conditions with weather observations. In a similar way, observed concentrations of air pollutants can be used to correct the errors in the emission data. In this study, a new method is developed for estimating air pollution emissions based on a Newtonian relaxation and nudging technique. Case studies for the period of 1-25 August 2006 in 47 cities in China indicate that the nudging technique resulted in improved estimations of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions in the majority of these cities.

The semi-arid region of the Central Andes is one of the most extreme areas of human occupation at 4200 meters altitude and affected by high climatic variability. This paper studies the relations between climate variability, resilience, biodiversity of pastures and pastoral production in Sajama National Park. We present a botanical study of palatable pasture herbs between two years, one humid (2006) and the other dry (2007). Thirty vascular plants were recorded. The number of species and the cover of iro (Festuca ortophylla) peak in areas of intermediate disturbance; areas that are at a medium distance from camelid corrals. On the other hand, the cover of ephemeral plants between tussocks increases in high disturbance areas. This is interpreted as a result of the tradeoff between the damage of grazing and the benefit of the fertilization produced by the herding animals. The local people clearly perceive strong impacts of climate change, combined with changes in management and human pressures. The social dynamics and production management, combined with climate warming, water reduction, and the increasing variability of surface water regimes create potential risks for the local sustainability of pastoralism.","Bolivia; Diversity-productivity; Pastures; Puna; Seasonal variation; Subtropical Andes; Variability; Vegetation structure","anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; climate change; climate variation; global warming; grazing; nature-society relations; pastoralism; pasture; seasonal variation; subtropical region; sustainability; vegetation structure; Andes; Bolivia; Oruro [Bolivia]; Sajama National Park; South America; Animalia; Artiodactyla; Camelidae; Festuca; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67149138037

It is expected that emission of soot particles can penetrate into the lung, causing human carcinogenic effects. To reduce these emissions especially from heavy-duty vehicles such as cargo trucks and buses, a diesel particulate filter (DPF) has been developed for the after-treatment of exhaust gas. In simple explanation of DPF, it traps PM when exhaust gas passes its porous wall. However, since the filter would be plugged with particles to cause an increase of filter back-pressure, filter regeneration process is needed. In this study, we simulate the flow in DPF by the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). So far, the LBM has been widely used in fluid simulation, and has been an alternative and promising numerical scheme. It has been confirmed that, through the Chapman-Enskog procedure, the Navier-Stokes equations are derived from LB equations. In the LBM, the treatment of boundary conditions is simple and easy, and it is appropriate to simulate porous media flows such as DPF. In this paper, our approach for LB simulation of combustion is briefly explained. Here, the real filter is used in the simulation. The inner structure of the filter sample is scanned by a 3D X-ray CT technique. By conducting tomography-assisted simulation, we obtain local velocity and pressure distributions in the filter, which is hardly obtained by measurements. First, the flow and pressure profiles are visualized, compared with the empirical equation of the Ergun equation. Then, the soot combustion is simulated. Based on the temperature change and reaction inside the filter, the heat and mass transfer in the filter regeneration process is discussed.

The gate oxide quality and reliability of the devices are compared to those of simultaneously processed Si control devices and conventional thick virtual substrate devices that have the same Ge content (20%), strained Si channel thickness, and channel strain. The thin virtual substrates offer the same mobility enhancement as the thick virtual substrates (∼100% compared to universal mobility data) and are effective at reducing device self-heating. Up to 90% improvement in gate leakage current is demonstrated for the strained Si n -channel MOSFETs compared to that for the bulk Si controls. The lower leakage arises from the increased electron affinity in tensile strained Si and is significant due to the sizeable strain generated by using wafer-level stressors. The strain-induced leakage reductions also lead to major improvements in stress-induced leakage current (SILC) and oxide reliability. The lower leakage current of the thin and thick virtual substrate devices compares well to theoretical estimates based on the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. Breakdown characteristics also differ considerably between the devices, with the strained Si devices exhibiting a one order of magnitude increase in time to hard breakdown (THBD) compared to the Si control devices following high-field stressing at 17 MV cm-1. The strained Si devices are exempted from soft breakdown. Experimental based analytical leakage modeling has been carried out across the field range for the first time in thin oxides and demonstrates that Poole-Frenkel (PF) emissions followed by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling dominate gate leakage current at low fields in all of the devices. This contrasts to the frequently reported assumption that direct tunneling dominates gate leakage in ultrathin oxides. We also show that PF emissions are reduced in strained Si devices compared to bulk Si devices. The gate leakage, interface trap density, bulk oxide traps, breakdown characteristics, and SILC are further improved in the thin virtual substrate devices compared to the thick virtual substrate devices. The difference is attributed to surface roughness.

The diesel engine examined employed a variable turbine geometry (VTG) turbocharger with air-to-air charge cooler, cooled low pressure exhaust gas re-circulation (LP-EGR), and cooled high pressure exhaust gas re-circulation (HP-EGR). The LIVC system investigated varied the closing time of the intake valve by increasing or decreasing the dwell at the maximum valve lift point. This paper describes how the fuel economy and NOx emission of the diesel engine were affected by varying the intake valve closing time. The intake valve closing time was delayed by as much as 60 degrees. The intermediate speed, low load 3000 rpm, 5 bar BMEP, 10% HP-EGR, and 2000 rpm, 4 bar BMEP, 10% LP-EGR operation points were chosen as the engine running conditions, since turbocharger potential at these conditions can be greatly explored to investigate the variable valve timing effect. By combining variable valve timing technology with VTG turbocharger, engine out NOx emission can be greatly reduced by 24% without sacrificing fuel economy. For some LIVC, BSFC can even be decreased by 1%. The reason for the better fuel economy was investigated. It was found that LIVC coupled with the VTG turbocharger moved the operating point to a more efficient region, reducing the fuel consumption. At the same time, the NOx reduction caused by the lower in-cylinder temperature from late intake valve closing was also analyzed in detail. In another investigation, O2 level was found to be important in understanding the NOx reduction benefit. © 2008 SAE International.",,"Diesel engines; Emission control; Exhaust gases; Fuel economy; Fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Powertrains; Superchargers; Turbomachinery; Cylinder temperatures; Diesel engine emissions; Emission reduction; Intake valve closings; Late intake valve closings (LIVC); Operating points; Running conditions; Variable valve timing; Intake valves",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072465576

This is inconsistent with the changes in the equatorial atmosphere, which shows a slowdown of the zonal Walker circulation and tends to stabilize the tropical coupling system. The ocean role is highlighted in this paper. The enhanced ENSO variability is attributed to the strengthened equatorial thermocline that acts as a destabilizing factor of the tropical coupling system. To quantify the dynamic effect of the ocean on the ENSO variability under the global warming, ensemble experiments are performed using a coupled climate model [Fast Ocean Atmosphere Model (FOAM)], following the ""1pctto2x"" scenario defined in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports. Term balance analyses on the temperature variability equation show that the anomalous upwelling of the mean vertical temperature gradient (referred as the ""local term"") in the eastern equatorial Pacific is the most important destabilizing factor to the temperature variabilities. The magnitude of local term and its change are controlled by its two components: the mean vertical temperature gradient T̄z and the ""virtual vertical heat flux"" - w'T'. The former can be viewed as the background of the latter and these two components are positively correlated. A stronger T̄z is usually associated with a bigger upward heat flux - w'T', which implies a bigger impact of thermocline depth variations on SST. The T̄z is first enhanced during the transient stage of the global warming with a 1% yr-1 increase of CO2, and then reduced during the equilibrium stage with a fixed doubled CO2. This turnaround in T̄z determines the turnaround of ENSO variability in the entire global warming period. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric pressure; Climatology; Global warming; Heat flux; Nickel compounds; Oceanography; Stream flow; Temperature sensors; Thermal gradients; Tropics; Balance analysis; Coupled climate models; Coupling systems; Dynamic effects; Eastern equatorial Pacific; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Local terms; Long-term trends; Ocean-atmosphere models; Southern oscillations; Temperature variabilities; Thermocline depths; Transient stages; Two components; Vertical temperature gradients; Walker circulations; Ocean engineering; atmosphere-ocean coupling; climate variation; decadal variation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; equatorial dynamics; global warming; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; temperature gradient; trend analysis; upwelling; Walker circulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-60749104198

Climate change and ecological damage unparalleled in recent history echoed these milestones. Storms have become more erratic and extreme. The first plot of habitable land recently gave way to rising sea levels in coastal India. Deforestation, desertification, and sprawling development are drastically reducing the world's biological diversity and available arable land. Global warming is no longer under dispute. The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change links human behavior with higher land and ocean temperatures and rising sea levels over the past century and into the future (IPCC 2007). The greatest impetus for growing greener is thus the impending crises stemming from climate change. Human activities are responsible for many of these ecological problems. For example, in America's Appalachian region and other mining districts around the world, miners eliminated mountains, filled river valleys, and left gaping holes carved into the earth's crust to reach the underlying natural resources. The use of fossil fuels for transport and manufacturing concentrates pollution in the air, oceans, animals, and, most worrisome, in those who use them and their children. Just as humans have created these problems, they can also relieve them by promoting greener patterns of growth. Most important, they can reduce the demand for energy through promoting green regional design to achieve a greater balance between the built and natural environments, curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Intervention at the regional scale is not only feasible but also necessary to counteract the dangers of climate change. In this essay we define the key aspects of green regional design. We then use the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut metropolitan area as a case study of the application of regional design, detailing its use in the creation of open space, transportation (and related land uses) and energy networks that frame an area's growth and development. We show how it makes the area more livable and competitive while addressing global warming. Copyright © 2008 University of Pennsylvania Press.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878661923

The systematic review's research questions relate to the caries-reducing benefits and associated potential health risks of providing fluoride systemically (via addition to water, milk and salt) and the use of topical fluoride agents, such as toothpaste, gel, varnish and mouthrinse. Although the review summarises the recent evidence, it does not constitute health policy or clinical practice recommendations. Data sources: A literature search was undertaken using the Medline and Embase databases (via www.embase.com). In addition, the Cochrane Systematic Review and Clinical Trial databases were searched to help identify additional systematic reviews and original studies. Because of the availability of recent systematic reviews, searches were limited to publications from 1996 onwards. The search was conducted in December 2006 and limited to English-language publications. Study selection: Based on types of intervention (individual or population) and the outcomes assessed (efficacy or safety), the hierarchy of study types considered most relevant for answering each of the clinical questions defined in this review was chosen (Table 1). The levels of evidence used by NHMRC for intervention and aetiological studies are summarised in Table 2. Data extraction and synthesis: Screening of eligible studies was conducted by three reviewers. Data were extracted for all of the included systematic reviews and individual studies using standardised data-extraction forms. This included information about the study design, NHMRC level of evidence, population, intervention, comparator, outcome definitions and results. Information relating to potential biases and study quality were also extracted. Where appropriate, study results were pooled using standard meta-analysis techniques. Results: In total, 5418 nonduplicate citations were identified. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 408 citations were considered potentially eligible for inclusion in the review. After the review of the full papers of potentially eligible articles, 77 citations were included in the review. The summary of findings was presented in the context of the research questions (Table 3). Recommendations: Fluoridation of drinking water remains the most effective and socially equitable means of achieving community-wide exposure to the caries prevention effects of fluoride. It is recommended (see also www.nhmrc.gov.au/news/media/rel07/_files/fluoride_flyer.pdf) that water be fluoridated in the target range of 0.6-1.1 mg/l, depending on the climate, to balance reduction of dental caries and occurrence of dental fluorosis.n particular with reference to care in hospital for those following stroke.",,"article; Australia; fluoridation; human; Australia; Fluoridation; Humans",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46649085716

To assess the air quality, Industrial Source Complex-Short Term (ISCST3) dispersion model was applied by combining measured emissions and meteorological data with 1 hour temporal and 1km×1km spatial resolution. Validity of model was verified by comparing the monitored data from Beijing's Environmental Protection Bureau with the model values predicted. Demonstrated by Geographical Information System (GIS), results indicate that the levels of PM10, SO2, and NOx were serious and endangered the regional human health. While area source accounted for 83.8% of PM 10 concentration distribution and 79.2% of SO2 concentration distribution respectively, line source contributed 73.5% of NOx concentration distribution. It reveals insight on emission control priorities and future implementations of effective control technology. © 2008 ASCE.","Air quality; Assessments; China; Monitoring","Air pollutants; Air quality monitoring; Area sources; Assessments; China; Concentration distributions; Control technologies; Dispersion models; Emission factors; Emission inventories; Fine particulate matter; Geographical information systems; Human health; Industrial source complex models; Industrial source complexes; Line sources; Management plans; Meteorological data; Metropolitan area; Short term; Spatial resolution; Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Emission control; Geographic information systems; Meteorology; Microchannels; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Rating; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Water resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79251522147

Previously, insertional mutants were generated to enable isolation of inorganic carbon transporters and other proteins that might be essential for a functional CCM. These mutants have an antibiotic resistance gene that encodes a protein that binds to Zeocin inhibiting Zeocin's DNA strand cleavage activity. The DNA flanking the BleR insert of one of the high CO2 requiring strains, named cia7, was cloned with inverse-PCR and sequenced. Sequence analysis showed homology to conserved bacterial proteins of unknown function, but there were no ESTs in this region of the genome. However, the presence of a gene was established by PCR and RLM-RACE. CIA7 was found to have four exons and the BleR insert was in the fourth exon. CIA7 encodes a protein of 104 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 11.3:kDa. Based on the ChloroP prediction program, the protein is predicted to have a chloroplast targeting signal. Complementation analyses results showed possible partially rescued mutants, and RNAi showed several transformants with a sick on low CO2 phenotype with reduced expression of CIA7. These results suggest that CIA7 is a gene that facilitates growth in C. reinhardtii under low CO2 conditions. One possible role of CIA7 would be in the delivery or storage of a metal ion. It may play a potential role as either a domain of a metal transporter or as a metallochaperone. © CSIRO 2008.","Expression analysis; Growth on low CO2; Metal binding domain","Characterisation; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Inorganic carbon acquisition; carbon dioxide; gene expression; genetic analysis; growth response; identification method; inorganic carbon; mutation; polymerase chain reaction; protein; algae; Bacteria (microorganisms); Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Eukaryota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47349126665

In order to enhance the water use efficiency, especially that of the agricultural sector, the crop water consumption by ET should be decreased. Thus, the calculating and forecasting of ET is getting more and more important. Based on the analysis of meteorological indices and the water use actuality affecting ET in Tongzhou District of Beijing, this paper investigated the prediction of ET using the artificial neutral network (ANN). Using the meteorological indices and agricultural water use as the inputs and ET as output, three ANN models were established in this study, e.g., six-factor input vector model, five-factor input vector model and four-factor input vector model. By using the monthly meteorological data, agricultural water use and remote sensing ET of Tongzhou during 2002-2004, the models were trained and used to forecast the ET in 2005. The results showed that the BP neural computing technique could be employed successfully in modeling ET. The precision of six-factor input vector model including the agricultural water use was the highest among the three. This conclusion showed that the agricultural water use is an important factor affecting ET in the study area. The four-factor input vector model using the air temperature, sunshine hours, precipitation and the agricultural water use had a considerable result, which can be used as an convenient and effective forecasting method for ET where data availability is limited. © 2009 by Aussino Academic Publishing House.","Agricultural water use; BP neutral network; Evapotranspiration","Agriculture; Catchments; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Meteorology; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Vectors; Water supply; Weather forecasting; Agricultural water use; Artificial neutral network; BP neutral network; Crop water consumption; Forecasting methods; Meteorological data; Meteorological index; Water use efficiency; Water resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928945581

We used the NCEP/ NCAR reanalyses data to drive a regional climate model (CLM) in order to reproduce finer resolved atmospheric fields over the North Atlantic over a two year period. In these fields we detected polar lows by means of a detection algorithm based on a spatial digital bandpass filter. CLM was run in two different ways, the conventional way and with additionally prescribing the analysed large scale situation. The resulting temporal and spatial distributions of polar lows between the different simulations are compared. A reasonable seasonal cycle and spatial distribution was found for all simulations. A lower number of polar lows in the spectral nudged simulation indicates a closer vicinity to reality. Higher temporal and spatial variability between the conventional simulations suggest a more random generation of polar lows. Frequency distributions of track-lengths reveal shorter tracks when nudging is applied. Maximum wind speeds reveal only minor, insignificant differences between all runs and are higher in conventional mode. © by Gebrüder Borntraeger 2008.",,"Algorithms; Bandpass filters; Climatology; Computer simulation; Data structures; Remote sensing; Storms; Wind; algorithm; climate modeling; climate prediction; cyclone; detection method; regional climate; spatial distribution; tracking; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049113268

Diesel engines have the highest fuel economy and thus, highest CO2 reduction potential among all other thermal propulsion engines due to their superior thermal efficiency. However, particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NO x) emissions from diesel engines are comparatively higher than those emitted from modern gasoline engines. Therefore, reduction of diesel emitted pollutants and especially, PM and NOx without increase of specific fuel consumption or let alone improvement of diesel fuel economy is a difficult problem, which requires immediate and drastic actions to be taken. A direct means for reducing diesel engine emitted pollutants, while preserving fuel economy, is the reformulation of conventional diesel fuel. A very promising way to improve diesel fuel behavior is the addition of synthetic or biologically renewable oxygenates. However, as the characteristics of the ""parental"" conventional diesel oil affect directly the behavior of resulting mixtures it is of utmost importance to first optimize its chemical composition and properties. A vast number of experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted in the past to examine the effect of diesel fuel chemical structure and properties on diesel engine exhaust emissions. The most significant fuel characteristics examined in these studies were aromatic structure and content, sulphur content, hydrocarbon molecular structure, cetane number, fuel heating value, density, viscosity and distillation temperatures. The effects of these fuel characteristics on diesel pollutant emissions have been assessed in various types of diesel engines (direct and indirect) and vehicles under diverse operating conditions (steady-state and transient). The effects of fuel properties on emissions depend on engine types and operating conditions. Moreover, it turns out that it is quite difficult to separate the effects of various fuel properties on emissions because many of them are statistically interrelated. In addition, the influence of fuel properties such as compressibility factor and surface tension on diesel performance characteristics and pollutant emissions has not been examined thoroughly. For this reason, the purpose of this study is to examine the effect of diesel fuel chemical structure and properties on diesel engine performance characteristics and pollutant emissions. To achieve these, findings of three major research programs funded by the European Commission, in which our team participated during recent years, are utilized in conjunction with pertinent results obtained from the literature. During these programs, the effect of variable aromatic content and structure and the influence of fuel physical properties on diesel engine combustion characteristics and pollutant emissions were investigated both theoretically and experimentally, in various types of diesel engines and under diverse operating conditions. Unlike other studies, emphasis will be given herein on the effects of fuel properties not only on regulated pollutant emissions but also on diesel fuel injection system, combustion evolution and in-cylinder pollutant formation. In addition, the background and the succession of various statistical approaches used in the literature to identify possible correlations between specific diesel fuel properties and exhaust emissions will be discussed. The conclusions of these evaluations will be contrasted with the statistical methods used from our research group to correlate diesel emitted pollutants and fuel characteristics. The ultimate objective of this review is to consolidate existing knowledge and discern the influence of individual conventional diesel fuel characteristics on engine performance and pollutant emissions.

In particular, forward back bias is effective if applied during the OFF-state. Additional analysis of the RTS noise due to individual traps in small-area devices, clarify that the application of forward substrate bias to switched MOSFETs causes a large reduction of the mean emission time and increases the mean capture time, leading to a suppression of the low-frequency noise associated to the trapping de-trapping processes. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Back bias; Bias points; Capture time; De-trapping; Emission time; Flicker noise; Gate bias; Low-frequency noise; MOSFETs; Random telegraph signals; Substrate bias; Integrated circuits; MOSFET devices; Spurious signal noise; Telegraph; Substrates",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-60749132283

In recent years the effects of climate change on local sources, in combination with the ever-present requirement for on-going disinfection effectiveness and disinfection by-product regulation has driven the need for the development of innovative, sustainable processes for the removal of DOC. Extensive pilot plant studies over a number of years have demonstrated the effectiveness of biological filtration for cost-effectively managing a variety of high DOC source waters, consequently biofiltration is seen as a process of choice for organics removal in drinking water in Western Australia. Although there are a number of indicators for measuring the efficacy of organic carbon reduction across biological treatment processes (e.g., DOC concentration, SUVA, etc), none currently are able to reliably inform on the change in the ""non-refractory"" organic carbon component of DOC (i.e. biodegradable dissolved organic carbon [BDOC]) which arises from microbiological metabolic activity in the biological treatment process. Knowledge of this parameter is of critical importance to the understanding of biological stability of the finished water entering a distribution system.

Paris Diderot, 92190 Meudon, France","The relatively high contrast between planetary and solar low frequency radio emissions suggests that the low-frequency radio range may be well adapted to the direct detection of exoplanets. We review the most significant properties of planetary radio emissions (auroral as well as satellite-induced) and show that their primary engine is the interaction of a plasma flow with an obstacle in the presence of a strong magnetic field (of the flow or of the obstacle). Scaling laws have been derived from solar system planetary radio emissions that relate the emitted radio power to the power dissipated in the various corresponding flow-obstacle interactions. We generalize these scaling laws into a ""radio-magnetic"" scaling law that seems to relate output radio power to the magnetic energy flux convected on the obstacle, this obstacle being magnetized or unmagnetized. Extrapolating this scaling law to the case of exoplanets, we find that hot Jupiters may produce very intense radio emissions due to either magnetospheric interaction with a strong stellar wind or to unipolar interaction between the planet and a magnetic star (or strongly magnetized regions of the stellar surface). In the former case, similar to the magnetosphere-solar wind interactions in our solar system or to the Ganymede-Jupiter interaction, a hecto-decameter emission is expected in the vicinity of the planet with an intensity possibly to times that of Jupiter's low frequency radio emissions. In the latter case, which is a giant analogy of the Io-Jupiter system, emission in the decameter-to-meter wavelength range near the footprints of the star's magnetic field lines interacting with the planet may reach times that of Jupiter (unless some ""saturation"" mechanism occurs). The system of HD 179949, where a hot spot has been tentatively detected in visible light near the sub-planetary point, is discussed in some details. Finally, we discuss the interests of direct radio detection, among which access to exoplanetary magnetic field measurements and comparative magnetospheric physics. © 2008 EAS EDP Sciences.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54749145035

Evidence presented by the IPCC and others points to the potential for increasingly dangerous weather, new disease outbreaks, regional water shortages, the loss of habitat and species, and other disturbing developments that could have profound social and economic impacts. Opinions on what should be done, however, remain sharply divided within and among countries. Though monumental in its efforts, the Kyoto Protocol has left much to be agreed upon and achieved, with the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide ?the United States ?rejecting it. In G lobal Warming: Looking Beyond Kyoto , some of the best-known and respected authorities in climate policy provide a comprehensive agenda for global collective action. Representing both industrialized and developing nations, the contributors present a thought-provoking examination of the economic, social, and political context of climate policy within their countries. With Kyoto's emissions targets set to expire in 2012, these authors call for a multilateral approach that goes beyond the mitigation-focused Kyoto policies, balancing them with strategies for adaptation. They also stress the importance of generating policies that work within a time frame commensurate with that of climate change itself.

Unlike conventional Spark Ignition (SI) engines, lean burn engines are no longer operating in a narrow band around stoichiometric resulting in a very challenging air-fuel ratio tracking problem. An approach to combine an input shaping method together with Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) feedback control is proposed in this paper to solve the transient air-fuel ratio tracking problem. LPV air-fuel ratio control has been shown to regulate the air-fuel ratio at steady state engine operating conditions, reduce the variability of the closed-loop system, reject disturbance and guarantee robustness and stability in the presence of variable time delays. In this paper, an input shaping method is used to reduce the cost of feedback, and thereby enhance the air-fuel ratio tracking performance during engine transient operations. The prefilter is designed based on the closed-loop dynamics resulting from the LPV design. A systematic input shaping prefilter design process is developed. The designed prefilter successfully extends the closed-loop air-fuel ratio tracking bandwidth. Simulation results using Federal Test Procedure (FTP) drive cycle data are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the input shaping prefilter. Moreover, the designed prefilter is structurally simple and computationally efficient.

The risk of metal leaching from carbonated waste was investigated in the present study; in particular, the effect of the carbonation process and leachate pH on the leaching toxicity of the alkaline air pollution control (APC) residues from municipal solid waste incinerator was evaluated. The pH varying test was conducted to characterize the leaching characteristics of the raw and carbonated residue over a broad range of pH. Partial least square modeling and thermodynamic modeling using Visual MINTEQ were applied to highlight the significant process parameters that controlled metal leaching from the carbonated residue. By lowering the pH to 8-11, the carbonation process reduced markedly the leaching toxicity of the alkaline APC residue; however, the treated APC residue showed similar potential risk of heavy metal release as the raw ash when subjected to an acid shock. The carbonated waste could, thereby, not be disposed of safely. Nonetheless, carbonation could be applied as a temporary stabilization process for heavy metals in APC residues in order to reduce the leaching risk during its transportation and storage before final disposal. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A detailed comparison of the model predictions for the 8-12 March SDS process with surface network observations and lidar measurements revealed a robust forecasting ability of the system. The time series of the operationally forecasted dust concentrations for a number of representative stations for the whole spring 2006 (1 March-31 May) were evaluated against surface PM10 monitoring data, showing a good agreement in terms of the SDS timing and magnitudes at and near the source regions where dust aerosols dominate. For the operational forecasts of spring 2006 in East Asia, a TS (threat score) system evaluated the performance of CUACE/Dust against all available observations and rendered a spring averaged TS value of 0.31 for FT1 (24 h forecasts), 0.23 for FT2 (48 h forecasts) and 0.21 for FT3 (72 h forecasts).",,"aerosol; dust; emission; forecasting method; meteorology; Asia; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39449136554

A common problem in diagnosing winds from the measured temperature is the error amplification associated with apparent singularities in the wave polarization relations. The authors have developed a spectral module that accurately derives tidal winds from the measured tidal temperature field and effectively eliminates the error amplification near the apparent singularities. The algorithm is used to perform a diagnostic analysis of tidal winds and the Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux divergence in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) based on the zonal mean and tidal temperature fields derived from 6 yr of temperature measurements made by the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument onboard the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite. The derived zonal mean wind and diurnal tidal amplitude reveal new insights into the mesospheric biennial oscillation (MBO) that exists in the MLT at both equatorial and midlatitude regions. The equatorial MBO in the zonal mean wind is present in the entire mesosphere from 50 to 90 km. The equatorial MBO in the temperature amplitude of the diurnal tide occurs near the mesopause region between 80 and 90 km and is largely coincident with the downward phase propagation of the equatorial MBO in the zonal mean wind, indicating a possible mechanism of wave-mean flow interaction between the two. On the other hand, the newly discovered midlatitude MBOs in zonal mean wind and the meridional wind in diurnal tide occur at different altitudes, suggesting possibly a remote forcing-response relationship. The acceleration or deceleration of the zonal mean wind due to EP flux divergence that is contributed by the migrating tides peaks at mid-latitudes with a typical value of 10-20 m s-1 day-1 around 95 km. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"Common problems; Diagnostic analysis; Diurnal tides; Eliassen-palm fluxes; Error amplifications; Flux divergences; Linear wave equations; Meridional winds; Mesopause regions; Mesosphere and lower thermospheres; Mid-latitudes; Midlatitude; Phase propagation; Planetary waves; Remote forcing; Sounding of the atmosphere using broadband emission radiometries; Temperature amplitudes; Temperature fields; Thermosphere ionospheres; Tidal winds; Typical values; Wave polarizations; Wind components; Zonal means; Amplification; Atmospheric electricity; Ionosphere; Polarization; Temperature measurement; Tides; Wave equations; Wind; Atmospheric temperature; atmospheric tide; meridional circulation; mesosphere; thermosphere; zonal wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65549131556

One of the main goals of SIPEX was to conduct large-scale sea ice and snow thickness surveys for the validation of satellite-based measurements. SIPEX scientists used a variety of techniques including helicopter-based radar and laser altimetry, as well as a remotely operated underwater vehicle, to gather baseline data on Antarctic sea ice thickness and the under-ice environment.

We explored this debate by examining patterns of tree establishment on an oak savanna in east-central Minnesota within the context of variable moisture availability and fire suppression. We used superposed epoch analyses (SEA) to evaluate the mean moisture conditions for a 21-year window surrounding tree establishment dates. Before effective fire suppression (1809-1939), 24 of 42 trees with pith dates (62%) grew to 30-cm height during dry years (Palmer Drought Severity Index &lt; -1), versus only 5 of 42 (12%) that established in wet years (PDSI &gt; 1). Significantly more trees established during dry periods (negative PDSI values) than would be expected with the proportion of wet-to-dry years (χ2 = 10.738, df = 1, p-value = 0.001). Twenty of the complete sample of 74 trees with pith dates (27%) established during drought in the 1930s. We hypothesize that dry conditions limited plant productivity, which in turn decreased competition between grasses and tree seedlings and reduced rates of accumulation of fine fuels, enabling seedlings to grow tall enough to resist subsequent fires. We recommend SEA as a methodological approach to compare historical climate conditions with the timing of regeneration success in other regions of forest expansion.

Events related to bridge collapses in Pennsylvania (partial) and Minnesota (catastrophic) combined with the levee failures in Louisiana have justifiably drawn the attention of the policy makers and the public at large. Therefore it appears likely that both monitoring efforts of existing systems and the development of more resilient systems will be increased. In the case of civil structures (bridges, dams, levees, and buildings) the most common type of sensors used are strain gages and accelerometers. While these sensors can be useful if used correctly they are limited in the types of data that can be gathered and are not well-suited for many applications. In contrast acoustic emission sensors are very rarely used for civil applications but can in fact provide useful information either as a stand-alone data type or to supplement the data gathered from other sensors. This paper describes several case studies where acoustic emission has been successfully used in civil infrastructure applications and summarizes both the advantages and challenges that are inherent in the method for such applications.","Acoustic emission; Fiber reinforced polymers; Load testing; Nondestructive evaluation","Acoustic emission sensors; Civil structures; Accelerometers; Civil engineering; Fiber reinforced plastics; Load testing; Strain gages; Structural health monitoring; Acoustic emission testing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43449090663

The price ranges from US$ 120-140 per barrel, and the expenditure on crude purchase is in the range of Rs.3200 billion per year. The impact on the country's foreign exchange reserves is in a big way. The petroleum industry now looks very much committed to the use of ethanol as fuel, as it is expected to benefit sugarcane farmers as well as the oil industry in the long run. Ethanol (FUEL ETHANOL) can also be produced from wheat, corn, beet, sweet sorghum etc. The best tool to fight vehicular pollution is ethanol as it contains 35% oxygen that helps complete combustion of fuel and thus reduces harmful tailpipe emissions. It also reduces particulate emissions that pose a health hazard severely affecting children and the aged. It also reduces Co2 emissions; the highest contributor to global warming. The use of E-diesel is a relatively new concept in the Indian transport sector. The fuel has been tried, tested and put to use by one of the premier state transport undertaking; ""Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation"" with technical know how from ""Energenics Pte Ltd"", Singapore; a supplier of alternative energy solutions and technologies.

CCS takes CO2 from large stationary sources and stores it in deep geological layers to prevent its release into the atmosphere. Responding to a G8 Gleneagles request, this study documents progress toward the development of CCS, covering capture, transportation and storage technologies and their costs; storage capacity estimates, regional assessment of CCS potential; legal and regulatory frameworks; public awareness and outreach strategies; and financial mechanisms and international mechanisms. It also discusses the role of CCS in ambitious new energy scenarios that aim for substantial emissions reduction.
