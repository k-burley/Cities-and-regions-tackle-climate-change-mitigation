This final action is taken in response to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit’s (D.C. Circuit) remand of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) Update in Wisconsin v. EPA on 9/13/2013. The CSAPR Update finalized Federal Implementation Plans (FIP) for 22 states to address their good neighbor obligations for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. In this final action, EPA is issuing new or amended FIP for these 12 states to replace their existing CSAPR NOx Ozone Season Group 2 emissions budgets for electricity generating units (EGU) with revised budgets via a new CSAPR NOx Ozone Season Group 3 Trading Program. EPA is requiring implementation of the revised emission budgets beginning with the 2021 ozone season. Based on EPA’s assessment of remaining air quality issues and additional emission control strategies for EGU and other emissions sources in other industry sectors (non-EGU), EPA is further determining that these NOx emission reductions fully eliminate these states’ significant contributions to downwind air quality problems for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. In this action, EPA is also finalizing an error correction of its June 2018 approval of Kentucky’s good neighbor SIP. This final rule is effective on 6/29/2021.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106975027

Therefore, the way we manage our food systems needs to be urgently changed if the goal is to achieve food security and sustainable development more quickly. This review paper analyzes the nexus “climate-smart agriculture-food systems-sustainable development” in order to draw sound ways that could allow rapid transformation of food systems in the context of climate change pressure. We followed an integrative review approach based on selected concrete example-experiences from ground-implemented projects across Africa (Ghana, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, in West Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, and Tanzania in East Africa). Mostly composed of examples from the Climate Change, Agriculture, and Food Security (CCAFS) Research Program of the CGIAR (former Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) and its partners, these also included ground initiatives from non-CGIAR that could provide demonstrable conditions for a transformative agriculture and food systems. The lessons learnt from the ground implementation of climate-smart agriculture (CSA), in the African context, were instrumental to informing the actions areas of the food-system transformation framework suggested in this paper (reroute, de-risk, reduce, and realign). Selected CSA example-cases to inform these action areas included 24 initiatives across Africa, but with a focus on the following studies for an in-depth analysis: (1) the climate-smart village approach to generate knowledge on climate-smart agriculture (CSA) technologies and practices for their scaling, (2) the use of climate information services (CIS) to better manage climate variability and extremes, and (3) the science–policy interfacing to mainstream CSA into agricultural development policies and plans. The analysis of these examples showed that CSA can contribute driving a rapid change of food systems in Africa through: (1) the implementation of relevant climate-smart technologies and practices to reroute farming and rural livelihoods to new climate-resilient and low-emission trajectories; (2) the development and application of weather and climate information services (WCIS) that support de-risking of livelihoods, farms, and value chains in the face of increasing vagaries of weather and extreme events; (3) the use of climate-smart options that minimize waste of all the natural resources used for growing, processing, packaging, transporting, and marketing food, and therefore mitigating the carbon footprint attached to this food loss and waste; and (4) the realignment of policies and finance that facilitate action in the four proposed action areas through the identification of news ways to mobilize sustainable finance and create innovative financial mechanisms and delivery channels. © 2021 by the authors.

The reasons for the formation and volume of construction debris are considered. Recycling technologies currently used in the demolition of buildings are associated with crushing. The resulting concrete mix is used only for filling low-level earthworks due to the rapid carbonation of concrete surfaces. The scrap metal formed during crushing is used for remelting, polluting the atmosphere and requiring a large amount of energy. It is proved that due to the low economic and environmental efficiency, this method of recycling is a dead end. Studies have found that the constant increase in the strength of concrete and the absence of a decrease in the strength characteristics of reinforcing steels, stone materials, bricks, which are operated for a long time in favorable temperature and humidity conditions, allows them to be reused. General approaches have been developed that require changes in the existing technologies for the renovation of urban areas, the demolition of individual buildings and structures that currently exist. To reduce CO2 emissions and construction debris, it is enough to increase the volume of gentrification, reconstruction, major repairs, and re-profiling of the existing residential and industrial stock. When demolishing buildings, it is necessary to abandon the method of collapse of building structures with their further fragmentation. The method of piecemeal dismantling with repeated use of materials, products and structures (after determining their strength indicators by specialists), allows you to dramatically reduce the problems of construction debris and carbon dioxide emissions. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Concrete mixtures; Crushing; Debris; Demolition; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Recycling; Scrap metal; Scrap metal reprocessing; Carbon dioxide emissions; Construction debris; Construction technologies; Environmental efficiency; Recycling technology; Strength characteristics; Strength of concrete; Temperature and humidities; Strength of materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104060413

Here we show that single atoms of Pt-group metals embedded into the surface of Fe3O4 have a greatly enhanced interaction strength with CO2 compared with the Fe3O4 surface. The strong CO2 adsorption on single Rh atoms and corresponding low activation energies lead to 2 orders of magnitude higher conversion rates of CO2 compared to Rh nanoparticles. This high activity of single atoms stems from the partially oxidic state imposed by their coordination to the support. Fe3O4-supported Rh nanoparticles follow the behavior of single atoms for CO2 interaction and reduction, which is attributed to the dominating role of partially oxidic sites at the Fe3O4-Rh interface. Thus, we show a likely common catalytic chemistry for two kinds of materials thought to be different, and we show that single atoms of Pt-group metals on Fe3O4 are especially successful materials for catalyzed reactions that depend primarily upon sites with the metal-O-Fe environment. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Activation energy; Atoms; Carbon dioxide; Iron oxides; Magnetite; Metals; Platinum compounds; Catalytic chemistry; Catalytic properties; Catalyzed reactions; Comparison of sites; Interaction strength; Low-activation energy; Orders of magnitude; Supported nanoparticles; Metal nanoparticles; carbon dioxide; iron; magnetite; metal; metal nanoparticle; nanoparticle; oxygen; platinum; rhodium; rhodium nanoparticle; silicon dioxide; unclassified drug; adsorption; Article; atom; catalysis; chemical bond; chemical parameters; chemical structure; concentration (parameter); controlled study; energy; experimental study; mass spectrometry; reduction (chemistry); scanning electron microscopy; surface property; X ray absorption spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104275731

The carbon-supported single-atom catalysts (SACs) have great potential for electrochemical CO2RR due to their high efficiency and low cost. The metal centers’ performance is related to the local coordination environment and the long-range electronic intercalation from the carbon substrates. This review summarizes the recent progress on the synthesis of carbon-supported SACs and their application toward electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO and other C1 and C2 products. Several SACs are involved, including MNx catalysts, heterogeneous molecular catalysts, and the covalent organic framework (COF) based SACs. The controllable synthesis methods for anchoring single-atom sites on different carbon supports are introduced, focusing on the influence that precursors and synthetic conditions have on the final structure of SACs. For the CO2RR performance, the intrinsic activity difference of various metal centers and the corresponding activity enhancement strategies via the modulation of the metal centers’ electronic structure are systematically summarized, which may help promote the rational design of active and selective SACs for CO2 reduction to CO and beyond. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","carbon-supported single atom; CO 2 reduction; electrocatalyst; metal–substrate intercalation","Beryllium compounds; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Electronic structure; Energy storage; Metals; Reduction; Substrates; Activity enhancement; Controllable synthesis; Covalent organic frameworks; Global carbon cycle; Intrinsic activities; Local coordination; Molecular catalysts; Synthetic conditions; Catalyst supports",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099370767

However, due to their high production cost and limited cruising range, the development of the NEV industry relies heavily on governments’ cash subsidy (CS) programs. At the same time, policymakers in several countries, including the United States (California) and China, have introduced carbon regulation (CR) to re-energize the NEV market. CS and CR have different impacts on the consumer and production sides. To this end, we propose a hybrid model combining the advantages of both. Through this model, the impacts of different interventions on product demands, profits, carbon emissions and technology R&D are derived: (1) CS always increases the demand for NEVs, while CR promotes NEVs only when NEVs are emission saving; providing CS increases the profits of the supply chain members, but supply chain profits under CR show uncertain trends; (2) CS reduces total emissions only if the unit carbon emission of NEVs is small enough, and the effect of NEVs’ carbon quota on total emissions under CR shows a similar trend, whereas the impact of carbon price on total emissions under CR depends on specific thresholds.

The set of shales with stable distribution and thickness of about 200 m is also extensively developed in South China, which provides an important material for studying the marine redox environment, major geological events and biotic evolution. Here we conduct studies on the nitrogen cycle and mercury's abnormal enrichment based on mercury (Hg) concentrations and nitrogen (N) isotope compositions of the shales from the lower Cambrian Niutitang Formation in Tongren area of Guizhou Province, South China. The results show that both Hg and TOC exhibited abnormal enrichments at the bottom of the Niutitang Formation. Mo and U enrichment factors indicated a gradually oxidized redox evolution during the deposition of the Niutitang Formation, with two fluctuated redox cycles from reducing to oxic, and then from dysoxic to oxic conditions in the water column. And the abnormal enrichment of Hg during the early Cambrian may be related to the volcanic and hydrothermal activities. Nitrogen isotope (δ15N) has obvious negative shift at the bottom of the Niutitang Formation, which indicated that nitrogen fixation was enhanced under the anoxic condition in the water column, the organic carbon pool gradually reduced, and phosphorus (P) and other nutrient elements were available, leading to the enhancement of nitrogen fixation and an increase of bioavailable nitrogen in the water column. Nitrogen isotopes recorded the effects of early Cambrian biological evolution and marine redox environment on nutrient element circulation, with contemporaneous volcanic or hydrothermal fluid activities during this period. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Co-evolution; Hypoxia; Nitrification; Nitrogen isotope; Nutrients","Geology; Isotopes; Nutrients; Organic carbon; Plants (botany); Volcanoes; Biological evolution; Enrichment factors; Geological history; Hydrothermal activity; Hydrothermal fluids; Isotope compositions; Organic carbon pools; Stable distributions; Nitrogen fixation; black shale; Cambrian; geochemistry; hydrothermal activity; hydrothermal fluid; mercury (element); nitrogen cycle; nitrogen isotope; redox conditions; shale; China; Guizhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101867264

Encouraged by the urgent need for cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels, vehicle electrification has been advancing at an unprecedented pace. As a major component of the multimodal transportation system, public transit is at the forefront of adopting battery technology into its operation. Battery Electric Bus (BEB), with superior features such as zero-emission and reduced noise, is made ready for commercial deployment in the past several years. However, it is still a grand challenge to successfully deploy BEB system given the nature of the public transit system and the unique spatio-temporal characteristics of BEB. This research presents a bi-objective optimization model for BEB deployment to consider constraints unique to the BEB system and to address the trade-off between environmental equity for the disadvantaged population and capital investment. The model is further demonstrated using the transit system operated by the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) to offer insights on the benefits gained as a result of BEB deployment. Optimal deployment plans under different budgets are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the model. The trade-offs in each of the plans are further discussed and compared. This research set the foundation for transit agencies to develop optimal deployment strategies for BEB systems when multiple goals need to be considered, allowing planners and decision-makers to create a transportation ecosystem that better serves livable and sustainable communities. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","battery electric bus; bi-objective optimization; charging station placement; environmental equity; Public transit","Budget control; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Electric automobiles; Fossil fuels; Investments; Multimodal transportation; Planning; Secondary batteries; Sustainable development; Urban transportation; Battery electric bus (BEB); Bi-objective optimization; Commercial deployment; Multi-modal transportation systems; Public transit systems; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Sustainable communities; Vehicle electrifications; Battery electric vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099081114

In this paper, based on the practical thermodynamic parameters of the automotive exhaust gas, including mass flow rate and temperature, two traveling-wave thermoacoustic engines are designed and optimized for the typical heavy-duty and light-duty vehicles, respectively, to extract and reutilize their exhaust waste heat. Firstly, nonlinear thermoacoustic models for each component of a thermoacoustic engine are established in the frequency domain, by which any potential steady operating point of the engine is available. Then, a matching between the required heat for the engine and the available heat from the exhaust gas is performed to determine the practical operating point and the performance of the thermoacoustic engine driven by this exhaust gas with a specified thermodynamic state. Furthermore, an outline-size optimization of the thermoacoustic engines is carried out for the heavy-duty and light-duty applications, respectively, to improve the waste heat utilization efficiency and maximize the acoustic power. To consider the impact of the system weight on vehicles, a power-to-weight ratio is adopted in this work as the optimization objective. It's shown that the optimum system outside diameters for the heavy- and light-duty applications are different due to the different thermodynamic characteristics of the exhaust gas. The available acoustic powers with the maximum power-to-weight ratio for heavy- and light-duty applications are approximately 515 Watts and 935 Watts with 8.2% and 18% of thermal efficiency, respectively, corresponding to 29.3% and 42.9% of their respective Carnot efficiencies.

Growing season temperature significantly impacts wood anatomy only in its extremes. Abstract: Quantitative wood anatomy can provide detailed insight into adaptation of trees to changing environment, especially on the borders of species distribution ranges. This study investigated wood anatomy of Pinus sylvestris L., Pinus sibirica Du Tour, and Picea obovata Ledeb. near the forest line in the Western Sayan Mountains, where local climate changes rapidly. Anatomical traits reflecting three developmental stages of conifer tracheids (division = cell number, cell enlargement = radial diameter, and secondary wall deposition = cell wall thickness) were calculated for earlywood, latewood and total tree ring over 50 years. Similar earlywood anatomical structure and low between-trait correlations (r = 0.21…67) were observed in all species, which supports prevalence of external impact on its formation, i.e. that shared habitat, climate, and similar habitus provide common trade-off between hydraulic efficiency and safety. Also, stronger nonlinearity of relationship between cell number and radial diameter in earlywood decreased correlations between them. In latewood, anatomical traits are strongly interconnected (r = 0.63…93) for all species. However, Siberian pine has significantly less pronounced latewood; later switch from earlywood and different strategy of carbon allocation are proposed as possible reasons. Length of vegetative season and sum of temperatures above thresholds 5 °C and 8 °C have no significant correlations with anatomical traits, but extremes of these temperature variables led to forming more pronounced latewood (higher proportion of latewood cells with thicker walls) during warm/long vegetative seasons than during short/cool ones. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cold environment; Earlywood; Evergreen conifers; Latewood; Quantitative wood anatomy","Cells; Climate change; Cytology; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Wood; Anatomical structures; Cell-wall thickness; Changing environment; Developmental stage; Hydraulic efficiency; Quantitative wood anatomy; Species distributions; Temperature variables; Forestry; Cells; Cytology; Diameter; Ecosystems; Forestry; Wood Structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094842069

Phosphate rock and its decomposition products were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS), and chemical analysis. The measurements of electron temperature (T e) and electron density (N e) of plasma plume under atmospheric pressure were carried out using optical emission spectroscopy(OES). The electron temperature (T e) was determined based on the calculation of the relative intensity of the O II (301.91 nm) and O II (347.49 nm) spectral lines. Correspondingly, electron densities were obtained using the Saha ionization equation which was based on the C I (247.86 nm) line and the C II (296.62 nm) line under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The relationship between the relative intensity of the active components and the gas output was studied by the spectrometer. Finally the reaction mechanism of the decomposition of the phosphate rock under the action of the atmospheric pressure microwave plasma was proposed. The results showed that with the increase of CO flow and microwave power, the electron temperature and electron density in the plasma show a decreasing and increasing trend. The CO is dissociated into gaseous carbon ions under the action of microwave plasma, and the presence of gaseous carbon ions promotes the decomposition of the phosphate rock. © 2021 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.","microwave plasma; optical emission spectroscopy; phosphorus decomposition; reaction mechanism","Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Chemical analysis; Electron density measurement; Electrons; Ionization of gases; Microwaves; Optical emission spectroscopy; Phosphate deposits; Rock products; Spectrometers; Active components; Decomposition products; Decomposition reaction; Local thermodynamic equilibrium; Microwave plasma; Optical emission spectroscopies (OES); Reaction mechanism; Relative intensity; Electron temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105756166

This study sought to examine the association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and obesity in a large population of children and adolescents in China. A cross-sectional analysis was performed from a school-based health lifestyles intervention project between September 1, 2019 and November 31, 2019, including 36,456 participants aged 9–17 years in Jiangsu province of China. Exposure to air pollutants (nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters ≤10 μm (PM10), and ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5)) were measured based on the nearest air monitoring station for each selected school. Data on each participant's weight and height was also recorded. Demographic and obesity-related behavioral information was collected using a self-reported questionnaire. We used the multivariate regression model to estimate the effects of three-year (2016–2018) average concentrations and the exceedance concentration days (ECD) of air pollutants on obesity after adjusting potential confounders. The ECD was defined as daily concentration exceeding the Chinese National Ambient Air Quality Standard and World Health Organization Ambient Air Quality Guidelines. We observed that higher concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, and O3 were associated with elevated likelihood of obesity. For each 10 μg/m3 increment in concentration, odds ratio of obesity was 1.185 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.054, 1.333) for PM2.5, 1.127 (95%CI: 1.042, 1.219) for NO2, and 1.041 (95%CI: 1.001, 1.082) for O3, respectively. A significant association between the ECD and obesity was also found for PM2.5 and O3. Effects of air pollutants on obesity were stronger in males, low economic level regions, and age subgroups of 9–11 and 15–17 years. Our findings suggest that long-term exposures to PM2.5, NO2, and O3 were associated with higher prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents.

Effective regional cooperation is urgently required to mitigate PAHs emissions to maintain satisfactory air quality. This study quantified and tracked China's PAHs emissions flows embodied in interprovincial trade. A production-based emissions inventory of 16 U.S. EPA priority PAHs based on commercial energy consumption in China in 2012 was compiled using the emissions factor approach. Then, a multiregional input-output model was constructed to reveal consumption-based emissions and to track the PAHs emissions embodied in the trade of 27 major sectors across 30 regions in China. Key structural paths were also identified using structural path analysis (SPA). In 2012, the total industrial energy-derived PAHs emissions were estimated to be 47.7 tons of BaP-toxic equivalents (8032.7 tons of mass). Shandong, Hebei, and Hubei accounted for more than 24.0% of the production-side PAHs emissions in the whole country. Approximately 30.8% of China's PAHs emissions were embodied in goods consumed outside of the province in which they were produced. PAHs flow tended to start in the western regions and ended in the eastern regions along the coast. The results of the SPA showed that critical paths, such as from the Metallurgy sector to the Construction sector, embodied a large amount of emissions and had the potential to affect the performance of the entire system. By paying attention to the consumption-based accounting as well as the production-based accounting of emissions and by focusing on vital transfer paths, policymakers can devise effective and targeted environmental protection and sustainable development policies in China. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Consumption-based emissions; Emissions inventory; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Structural path analysis","polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; air quality; domestic waste; emission inventory; energy use; environmental protection; industrial emission; input-output analysis; PAH; path analysis; sustainable development; trade-environment relations; Article; China; construction work; energy consumption; environmental policy; geographic distribution; information processing; metallurgy; path analysis; reliability; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental monitoring; human; industry; China; Hebei; Hubei; Shandong; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Industry; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100054987

The extensive biochar application in soil has also aroused interests in its influence on soil methane emissions. However, although numerous studies have paid attention to the methane flux from the biochar amended soil, the research efforts of biochar effects on methanotrophs mediating the methane consumption in soil still lag behind and need to be re-examined. Especially, studies of the nonconventional methanotrophs for atmospheric and anaerobic methane oxidation, which have rapidly developed in recent years, deserve much attention. Results and discussion: Here, we literately reviewed the proceedings about the biochar effects on conventional, atmospheric, and anaerobic methanotrophs in soil, respectively. Biochar plays a great role in methanotroph communities through soil characteristics controlling and redox reactions. Key physical soil characteristics such as porosity, aggregation, and moisture and chemical parameters such as soil pH, nitrogen, and metal oxides are confirmed to be altered by the biochar amendment for the regulation of methanotrophs. Conclusion: Soil methane oxidation is thereby regulated by biochar amendment. This review improved our understanding of the biochar function in greenhouse gas regulation and provided a scientific basis for better soil management with biochar application. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Anaerobic methane oxidation; Atmospheric methane oxidation; Biochar amendment; Methanotrophs","biochar; greenhouse gas; literature review; methane; methanotroph; microbial community; oxidation; soil amendment; soil chemistry; soil management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100063517

Carbon emissions due to urban residential energy consumption have increased significantly; however, there is a lack of research on urban residential carbon intensity. This paper examines the spatiotemporal variation of carbon intensity in the residential sector during 2001–2015, and then identifies the causes of the variation by utilizing the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) with the help of Microsoft Excel 2016 for 620 county-level cities in 30 Chinese provinces. The results show that high carbon intensity is mainly found in large cities, such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. However, these cities showed a downward trend in carbon intensity. In terms of influencing factors, the energy consumption per capita, urban sprawl, and land demand are the three most influential factors in determining the changes in carbon intensity. The effect of energy consumption per capita mainly increases the carbon intensity, and its impact is higher in the municipal districts of provincial capital cities than in other types of cities. Similarly, the urban sprawl effect also promotes increases in carbon intensity, and a higher degree of influence appears in large cities. However, as urban expansion plateaus, the effect of urban sprawl decreases. The land-demand effect reduces the carbon intensity, and the degree of influence of the land-demand effect on carbon intensity is also clearly stronger in big cities. Our findings show that lowering the energy consumption per capita and optimizing the land-use structure are a reasonable direction of efforts, and the effects of differences in influencing factors should be paid more attention to reduce carbon intensity. © 2021 by the authors.

To alleviate air pollution and reduce the petroleum demand from vehicles in China, the policy of “oil to gas” was vigorously carried out. Qingdao began to promote the use of natural gas vehicles (NGVs) in 2003. By the end of 2016, there were 9460 natural gas (NG) taxis in Qingdao, which accounted for 80% of the total taxis. An understanding of policy implementation for emission reductions is required. Experiments to obtain the taxi driving conditions and local parameters were investigated and an international vehicle emissions (IVE) localization model was established. Combined with vehicle mass analysis system (VMAS) experiments, the IVE localization model was amended and included the taxi pollutant emission factors. The result indicates that annual total carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from actual taxis are 6411.87 t, carbureted hydrogen (HC) emissions are 124.85 t, nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions are 1397.44 t and particulate matter (PM) emissions are 8.9 t. When the taxis are running on pure natural gas, the annual emissions of CO, HC, NOx and PM are 4942.3 t, 48.15 t, 1496.01 t and 5.13 t, respectively. Unregulated emissions of annual total formaldehydes, benzene, acetaldehyde, 1,3-butadience emissions from an actual taxi are 65.99 t, 4.68 t, 1.04 t and 8.83 t. When the taxi is running on pure natural gas, the above unregulated emissions are 12.11 t, 1.27 t, 1.5 t and 0.02 t, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

However, as a major species of secondary air pollutant, tropospheric ozone did not reduce synchronously, but instead rose in some region. Furthermore, higher concentrations of ozone may potentially promote the rates of COVID-19 infections, causing extra risk to human health. Thus, the variation of ozone should be evaluated widely. This paper presents ozone profiles and tropospheric ozone columns from ultraviolet radiances detected by TROPOospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard Sentinel 5 Precursor (S–5P) satellite based on the principle of optimal estimation method. We compare our TROPOMI retrievals with global ozonesonde observations, Fourier Transform Spectrometry (FTS) observation at Hefei (117.17°E, 31.7°N) and Global Positioning System (GPS) ozonesonde sensor (GPSO3) ozonesonde profiles at Beijing (116.46°E, 39.80°N). The integrated Tropospheric Ozone Column (TOC) and Stratospheric Ozone Column (SOC) show excellent agreement with validation data. We use the retrieved TOC combining with tropospheric vertical column density (TVCD) of NO2 and HCHO from TROPOMI to assess the changes of tropospheric ozone during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Although NO2 TVCD decreased by 63%, the retrieved TOC over east China increase by 10% from the 20-day averaged before the lockdown on January 23, 2020 to 20-day averaged after it. Because the production of ozone in winter is controlled by volatile organic compounds (VOCs) indicated by monitored HCHO, which did not present evident change during the lockdown, the production of ozone did not decrease significantly. Besides, the decrease of NOx emission weakened the titration of ozone, causing an increase of ozone. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Lockdown; Ozone profile retrievals; Soft calibration; TROPOMI","Global positioning system; Health risks; Meteorological instruments; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Ozone layer; Spacecraft instruments; Troposphere; Viruses; Volatile organic compounds; Fourier transform spectrometry; Monitoring instruments; Optimal estimation methods; Primary pollutants; Risk to human health; Stratospheric ozone; Tropospheric ozone; Vertical column densities; Air pollution; ozone; volatile organic compound; ozone; atmospheric pollution; calibration; COVID-19; epidemic; ozone; Sentinel; temporal variation; viral disease; Article; calibration; China; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental impact assessment; epidemic; Fourier transform spectroscopy; global positioning system; lockdown; pollution monitoring; priority journal; temperature sensitivity; troposphere; air pollutant; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; epidemiology; human; China; Coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Beijing; China; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Disease Outbreaks; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Ozone; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093085489

The whole is installed behind the seeder body and works in cooperation with the seeder. The device is composed of a film gripping module, a deep turning module, a crushing module and a graded vibrating screen module, and realizes the process of bringing out the film in the soil, crushing it, fining it and finally collecting it. At the same time, according to the state of the recovered film, a graded vibrating screen module is designed. The first-stage vibrating screen can transport the soil and film to the second-stage vibrating screen device, and the second-stage vibrating screen device separates the film by using the thermoplasticity of the mulching film by heating, so that the film can be better separated and recovered. The novel high-efficiency mulching film removing device can avoid the problem of low efficiency of traditional manual recovery.

Species distribution models (SDMs) are a widely used tool to assess climate change impacts on species’ geographical distributions. As the name of these models suggests, the species level is the most commonly used taxonomic unit in SDMs. However, recently it has been demonstrated that SDMs considering taxonomic resolution below (or above) the species level can make more reliable predictions of biodiversity change when different populations exhibit local adaptation. Here, we tested this idea using the Japanese crayfish (Cambaroides japonicus), a threatened species encompassing two geographically structured and phylogenetically distinct genetic lineages. Location: Northern Japan. Methods: We first estimated niche differentiation between the two lineages of C. japonicus using n-dimensional hypervolumes and then made climate change predictions of habitat suitability using SDMs constructed at two phylogenetic levels: species and intraspecific lineage. Results: Our results showed only intermediate niche overlap, demonstrating measurable niche differences between the two lineages. The species-level SDM made future predictions that predicted much broader and severe impacts of climate change. However, the lineage-level SDMs led to reduced climate change impacts overall and also suggested that the eastern lineage may be more resilient to climate change than the western one. Main conclusions: The two lineages of C. japonicus occupy different niche spaces. Compared with lineage-level models, species-level models can overestimate climate change impacts. These results not only have important implications for designing future conservation strategies for this threatened species, but also highlight the need for incorporating genetic information into SDMs to obtain realistic predictions of biodiversity change. © 2021 The Authors.

The results indicate that incorporation of CEMS data in the emission inventory reduced the biases between simulation and observation and could better reflect the actual sources of regional air pollution. Based on the CEMS data, the air quality changes and corresponding health impacts were quantified for different implementation levels of China's recent ""ultra-low"" emission policy. If the coal-fired power sector met the requirement alone (case 3), the differences in the simulated monthly SOspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""2/span, NOspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""2/span, Ospan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""3/span, and PMspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""2.5/span concentrations compared to those of case 2, our base case for policy comparisons, would be less than 7 % for all pollutants. The result implies a minor benefit of ultra-low emission control if implemented in the power sector alone, which is attributed to its limited contribution to the total emissions in the YRD after years of pollution control (11 %, 7 %, and 2 % of SOspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""2/span, NOspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""iX/i/span, and primary particle matter (PM) in case 2, respectively).

However, pursuing highly efficient electrocatalyst is still a challenge. In this study, cuprous oxide (Cu2O) modified by cucurbit[6]urils (Q[6]), a kind of rigid macromolecule, is found to act as an efficient supramolecular inorganic nanocomposite catalyst for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to C1 fuels. This catalyst affords a high total faradaic efficiency (FECO+formate) of 93.96 % at a potential of −0.7 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode and over 85 % from −0.6 to −0.9 V in 0.5 M KHCO3, which is higher than that of pure Cu2O (39.89 %). The enhancements in selectivity and activity for CO2RR could significantly benefit from the strong CO2 adsorption capacity and hydrophobic nature of the cavity of Q[6], which simultaneously trap gaseous reactants near the catalyst to tune the local environment and limit the diffusion of water molecules.

Air quality is affected by many factors, and showed significant non-linear features. Output–input feedback Elman (OIF Elman) neural network can effectively solve non-linear problems. However, the disadvantages of OIF Elman neural network are easy to fall into local minimum, slow convergence and inflexibility. Chicken swarm optimization (CSO) algorithm has high operating efficiency and fast convergence speed. Therefore, this paper proposes an air pollution prediction model for OIF Elman neural network based on the CSO algorithm (CSO-OIF Elman neural network model). Evaluation indicators are absolute average error and accuracy rate. The efficacy of the proposed model is compared with other models such as traditional Elman neural network model, OIF Elman neural network model and Elman neural network model based on CSO algorithm (CSO-Elman neural network model). The experimental results show that CSO-OIF Elman neural network model has the best accuracy and the smallest absolute average error value, and has higher nonlinear fitting capabilities and generalization capabilities.

To identify the drivers for PM2.5 concentration decreases in the BTH2+26 cites from the 2016/17 heating season (HS1617) to the 2017/18 heating season (HS1718), we investigated the contributions of meteorological conditions and emission-reduction measures by Community Multi-Scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model simulations. The source apportionments of five sector sources (i.e., agriculture, industry, power plants, traffic and residential), and regional sources (i.e., local, within-BTH: other cities within the BTH2+26 cities, outside-BTH, and boundary conditions (BCON)) to the PM2.5 decreases in the BTH2+26 cities were estimated with the Integrated Source Apportionment Method (ISAM). Mean PM2.5 concentrations in the BTH2+26 cities substantially decreased from 77.4 to 152.5 μg m−3 in HS1617 to 52.9–101.9 μg m−3 in HS1718, with the numbers of heavy haze (daily PM2.5 ≥150 μg m−3) days decreasing from 17-77 to 5–30 days. The model simulation results indicated that the PM2.5 concentration decreases in most of the BTH2+26 cities were attributed to emission reductions (0.4–55.0 μg m−3, 2.3–81.6% of total), but the favorable meteorological conditions also played important roles (1.9–25.4 μg m−3, 18.4–97.7%). Residential sources dominated the PM2.5 reductions, leading to decreases in average PM2.5 concentrations by more than 30 μg m−3 in severely polluted cities (i.e., Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Xingtai, and Beijing). Regional source analyses showed that both local and within-BTH sources were significant contributors to PM2.5 concentrations for most cities. Emission controls in local and within-BTH sources in HS1718 decreased the average PM2.5 concentrations by 0.1–47.2 μg m−3 and 0.3–22.1 μg m−3, respectively, relative to those in HS1617. Here we demonstrate that a combination of favorable meteorological conditions and anthropogenic emission reductions contributed to the improvement of air quality from HS1617 to HS1718 in the BTH2+26 cities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality improvement; BTH2+26 cities; Emission reduction; Meteorological contribution; Source apportionment","Agricultural robots; Air quality; Emission control; Housing; Air quality improvement; Anthropogenic emissions; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Community multi-scale air qualities; Integrated sources; Meteorological condition; PM2.5 concentration; Source apportionment; Quality control; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; haze; meteorology; particulate matter; source apportionment; agriculture; air pollution control; air quality; article; China; city; electric power plant; haze; heating; human; meteorology; particulate matter 2.5; season; simulation; air pollutant; air pollution; China; city; environmental monitoring; heating; particulate matter; season; total quality management; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Heating; Particulate Matter; Quality Improvement; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099800527

To fill these gaps, this paper empirically and comprehensively investigates the multiple effects of RTD on NPSP, by addressing three different dimensions of the RTD process-namely, regional urbanization, agricultural modernization, and land use transition. Longitudinal trends analysis of NPSP loads over the long-term (1990–2017) using the approach of inventory analysis was conducted to overcome the difficulty in gathering pollution monitoring data. Our results suggest that RTD generally presents an inverted “U” shaped relationship with NPSP, and differentiated evolution trajectories exist between different dimensions of RTD and different components and sources of NPSP. The turning points of total phosphor (TP) and planting industry-induced NPSP emission appear later than others. Land use transition and agricultural modernization process have significantly positive relations with the emissions from the planting industry. Furthermore, the evolution of NPSP is highly coupled with the shifts in national strategies, agricultural policies, and environmental regulations. These findings provide insights into the human-environment relation, suggesting that reasonable countermeasures should be formulated corresponding to the development stage of RTD. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Comprehensive assessment; Environmental problems; Land use transition; Rural development","land use change; modernization; nonpoint source pollution; pollutant source; pollution monitoring; rural area; rural development; trend analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096427576

Although previous studies have investigated the carbon emissions and costs of single-family and rural houses, relatively few studies have compared the characteristics of different structural forms and verified the reliability of their results. In light of sustainable development of rural building structures in China, this study assessed process-based and subproject-based emissions, as well as the costs associated with the construction of a rural residential house, with consideration of three common structural forms. Among the schemes designed using a reinforced concrete framed (CF), block masonry (BM), and prefabricated masonry (PM) structure, the BM scheme afforded the lowest emissions and costs, whereas the CF scheme led to the highest emissions and costs. To identify the key processes for measuring embodied emissions and costs, contribution indicators were proposed and an uncertainty analysis was conducted according to variations in emission factors. The results indicate that the comparison and findings are reliable with respect to current technical levels. A further sensitivity analysis revealed that the CF and PM schemes had the potential to be low-carbon alternatives if emissions from steel and cement production can be significantly reduced in a future scenario. This paper proposes relevant suggestions from the perspectives of material selection, structural member design, and structural form decisions and its findings can help improve the sustainability of rural houses. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Comparative analysis; Rural house; Structural design; Sustainability","Cement industry; Houses; Low carbon steel; Planning; Reinforced concrete; Sensitivity analysis; Structural analysis; Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon emissions; Cement production; Embodied carbons; Embodied emissions; Emission factors; Material selection; Rural residential; Technical levels; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100422679

The NOx control would trigger increasing O3 concentrations in response to a series of released China emission reduction policies. This study used sensitivity analysis methodology to explore the effectiveness of integrated sectoral emission control policies that have been expanded throughout China. Air quality and synergistic health effects of O3 and NO2 were investigated to obtain an in-depth understanding of the O3 control, especially under a VOC-limited regime. The findings demonstrated that although the NOx-titration effect triggered an increase in O3, the combined health effects of two pollutants tended to improve in most regions of China under a VOC-limited regime. The region-based annual average NO2 concentrations exhibited a larger reduction in Hong Kong (HK) than in the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone (PRD EZ). The short-term measures led to substantial health benefits for Shenzhen and HK. The sectoral emission controls demonstrated a considerable health improvement for the major PRD EZ cities. Joint national control efforts confined the domain-wide health risks below the safety line in China. National cooperative efforts in China could avoid more than 1.5–2% of the emergency hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases attributed to NO2 and O3 exposure. The observed O3 increases due to the NOx-titration effect for calculating the integral health effects of emission control on concentration reduction called for simultaneously strengthened controls on both NOx and VOC in areas subject to a VOC-limited regime. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality control policy; Chemical transport model; China; Health co-benefits; Sensitivity analysis","Air quality; Emission control; Health; Health risks; Nitrogen oxides; River pollution; Sensitivity analysis; Titration; Concentration reduction; Emission reduction policies; Health benefits; Health improvements; Hospital admissions; In-depth understanding; National controls; Pearl River delta; Quality control; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; nitrogen oxide; ozone; air quality; concentration (composition); emission control; nitrogen oxides; ozone; quality control; sensitivity analysis; volatile organic compound; air pollution control; air quality; air quality control; Article; cardiovascular disease; China; Community Multiscale Air Quality model; emergency health service; exposure; health hazard; Hong Kong; hospital admission; human; photochemistry; policy; respiratory tract disease; risk reduction; safety; sensitivity analysis; air pollutant; air pollution; China; city; environmental monitoring; policy; prevention and control; quality control; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Hong Kong; Humans; Nitrogen Oxides; Ozone; Policy; Quality Control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098120585

The recently released Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report “Global Warming of 1.5ºC” (hereafter SR15) concludes robustly avoided impacts from climate extremes from the 0.5°C less warming globally, based on multiple lines of evidence. However, the methodological uncertainties, including those arising from modeling strategy (i.e., different pathways to achieve the temperature targets), remain a knowledge gap. Here, by comparing simulations with the common Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5) using different modeling strategies (i.e., fully coupled transient, fully coupled quasi-equilibrium, and atmosphere-only quasi-equilibrium simulations), we explored the uncertainty from modeling strategy in the reduced impacts of climate extremes from the half-degree less warming. While the globally aggregated reduced impacts are reasonably consistent among modeling strategies, substantial quantitative uncertainties of reduced impact exist at regional scales. For temperature extremes, the largest methodological uncertainty exists in northern high-latitudes, especially in Europe and North America, with spread exceeding 0.8°C. For precipitation extremes, large uncertainties (even opposite signs) are expected scatteredly over the globe, particularly in the populous South Asia for wet extremes, and in South-East Asia, West North America, and the Amazon for dry extremes, with spread of ∼5%. The different regional responses among modeling strategies result from multiple physical processes, dominated by the transient versus quasi-equilibrium responses, prescribed sea surface temperatures and aerosol forcing. The comparisons improve the understanding of methodological uncertainties in the projected impacts in light of model setups. © 2021. The Authors.

Achieving high selectivity for the desired products of the CO2RR remains challenging. Herein, a self-redox strategy is developed to construct strong interfacial bonds between Ag nanoparticles and an ultrathin CoAl-layered double hydroxide (U-LDH) nanosheet support, where the surface hydroxyl groups associated with oxygen vacancies of U-LDH play a critical role in the formation of the interface structure. The supported Ag@U-LDH acts as a highly efficient catalyst for CO2 reduction, resulting in a high CO evolution rate of 757 μmol gcat-1 h-1 and a CO selectivity of 94.5% under light irradiation. Such a high catalytic selectivity may represent a new record among current photocatalytic CO2RR to CO systems. The Ag-O-Co interface bonding is confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and FTIR CO2 adsorption studies. The in situ FTIR measurements indicate that the formation of the *COOH intermediate is accelerated and the mass transfer is improved during the CO2RR. Density functional theory calculations show that the Ag-O-Co interface reduces the formation energy of the *COOH intermediate and accumulates localized charge. Experimental and theoretical analysis collectively demonstrates that the strong interface bonding between Ag and U-LDH activates the interface structure as catalytically CO2RR active sites, effectively optimizing the binding energies with reacted intermediates and facilitating the CO2RR performance. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","Ag-O-Co bonding; CO2photoreduction; interface; layered double hydroxide; self-redox","Binding energy; Binding sites; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst selectivity; Cobalt metallography; Density functional theory; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Mass transfer; Nanosheets; Reduction; Silver metallography; Silver nanoparticles; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Co-Al layered double hydroxides; Efficient catalysts; Formation energies; Interface bonding; Interface structures; Light irradiations; Surface hydroxyl groups; Value-added chemicals; Silver compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104369206

By assimilating hourly surface PM2.5 observations, the optimal initial conditions (ICs) of the state variable were solved iteratively with the NLS-4DVar method, which uses a Gauss–Newton iterative scheme to handle nonlinearity without a tangent linear or adjoint model, thereby rendering the aerosol assimilation process fast and simple.

Currently, the scale of the existing distribution centers cannot fully meet this demand, so building new ones would seem necessary. Research rarely considers consumer choice from the perspective of competition between new and existing cold chain distribution centers, and the low-carbon concept is rarely considered when a competitive site is selected. This paper therefore puts forward a model to assist the decision-making process regarding the choice of location where cold chain logistics facilities might be sited. Based on a bi-level programming method, this model is constructed where the upper level of government aims to determine an optimal location and scale for a cold chain distribution center as well as a rational trading policy regarding carbon emissions to minimize the total social cost of the whole logistics system. The lower level adopts the demand user equilibrium model, which considers the demands of logistics users when choosing between new and existing cold chain distribution centers, so as to minimize the cost incurred by each logistics user. We use the cloud particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the model and decide a suitable location for a new center in Wuhan, the principal city in the Hubei Province, in China. The study reveals that: (1) The high demand is equivalent to the high number of new distribution centers; (2) The high attractiveness of these centers is equal to their high total scale; (3) Changes in carbon emissions trading prices have an impact on the scale, total carbon emissions, and total social cost of new cold chain distribution centers; (4) The carbon emissions quota policy has an impact on the scale of the location chosen for a new cold chain distribution center, total carbon emissions, and total social costs. This article provides a scientific basis regarding decisions concerning the location of new cold chain distribution centers by the government, and provides some ideas for energy conservation improvement and carbon emissions reduction by the whole society. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Attractiveness; Carbon emissions trading price; Cloud particle swarm optimization algorithm; Competitive distribution center location","Carbon; Commerce; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Location; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Warehouses; Bi-level programming methods; Carbon emissions quotas; Carbon emissions reductions; Competitive distribution; Decision making process; Distribution centers; Economic and social development; Location optimization; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100023219

Although doping high concentration Mn2+ could increase the Mn2+ emission, excess Mn2+ ions would be expelled from the host perovskite lattice. Doping secondary metal Ni into the NCs as an efficient method is always used to improve the Mn2+ emission. We adopted a one-pot halogen injection into Cs-precursor under ambient environment method to prepare (Mn, Ni): CsPbCl3 and (Mn, Ni): CsPb(Cl/Br)3 NCs, which introduces NiCl2 in the Mn: CsPb(Cl/Br)3 NCs to supply enough halide ions and to passivate defect states or traps in the perovskite NCs so as to enhance Mn2+ emission.

It is currently not commercially viable in many regions due to the high concentration of non-flammable gases such as nitrogen. The CBM separation is crucial for both economic benefit and methane emission reduction. The biggest challenge lies in the separation of low-concentration CBM. Gas separation via gas hydrate is gaining great attraction due to its safe, clean, and economically efficient features. We examined the effects of two environmentally benign amino acids L-tryptophan and L-leucine on hydrate formation from 30% CH4/70% N2 mixture in the presence of tetrahydrofuran (THF, 5.56 mol%). Experiments were carried out at 283.2 K and 3.0 MPa with different solution volumes to study the impact of gas/liquid volume ratio (calculated at standard pressure and temperature conditions). The lower gas/liquid volume ratio improved the CH4 recovery ratio and separation factor but lowered the kinetics. The effect of amino acid is concentration-dependent. In synergy with 5.56 mol% THF solution (gas/liquid volume ratio of 67/1), L-tryptophan (5000 ppm) enhanced the CH4 recovery ratio from 58.3% to 71.4% and boosted the initial hydrate growth rate by 130%. On the other hand, L-leucine (5000 ppm) showed no obvious impact on the kinetics but achieved the highest CH4 enrichment in the hydrate phase (from 30.0 mol% in the feed gas to 56.8 mol% in the hydrates). The high CH4 recovery ratio, enhanced kinetics, and simplicity of this process demonstrate the potential of developing an efficient and economical recovery method for low-concentration CBM. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Amino acids; Clathrate hydrates; Coal bed methane; Coal mine gas; Gas hydrates; Tetrahydrofuran","Amino acids; Coal; Coal bed methane; Coal deposits; Coal industry; Coal mines; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Gases; Growth rate; Hydration; Kinetics; Methane; Natural gas; Organic solvents; Recovery; Separation; Concentration-dependent; Environmentally benign; Hydrate formation; Low concentrations; Methane emissions; Pressure and temperature; Separation factors; Unconventional natural gas resources; Gas hydrates; amino acid; clathrate; coal mine; coal seam; concentration (composition); emission control; furan; methane; natural gas; separation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100494200

The article empirically examines these theoretical hypotheses using a panel data set of sulfur dioxide emission reduction targets and GDP growth goals across Chinese provinces. The statistical findings support these arguments and help elucidate the “black box” of decision-making in the public sector. Evidence for Practice: High pollutant emission reduction pressure can lower provincial leaders' expectations of economic growth in China. The improvement in pollutant emission efficiency weakens the constraint of pollutant emission reduction pressure on expectations of economic growth.

Many governments and environmental localities around the world are proposing internal combustion engine (ICE) bans and enacting large subsidy programs for zero-tailpipe emissions vehicles powered by batteries or fuel-cells. Such policies can be effective in driving the consumer towards specific powertrains. The reason for such aggressive change is to reduce the sector's carbon footprint. However, it is not clear if these proposals will reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Emissions from raw material extraction, manufacturing, and power generation are shadowed by the focus on reducing the reliance on fossil fuel use. Emissions from non-tailpipe sources should also be considered before pushing for a rapid change to powertrains. Life-cycle analysis (LCA) can assess the GHG emissions produced before, during and after the life of a vehicle in a cradle-to-grave analysis. Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) has performed an LCA study on two different light-duty vehicles and five different powertrain configurations. The first vehicle platform chosen is the compact sedan, also known as a C-segment or small family car. The second vehicle platform chosen is a standard full-size pickup truck. For each platform an internal combustion engine, mild hybrid, full hybrid, plug-in hybrid and battery electric powertrain were selected; specifications for each were based around current production vehicles, or near production vehicles. The analysis compares the impact of electrical grid carbon intensity to predict the global warming potential of various powertrain options in different markets. The results are presented by comparing embedded emissions and in-use emissions. The study concludes that while battery electric vehicles do generally show a lower life-cycle CO2, a variety of pathways should be explored for future powertrain needs due to the variation of available low-carbon electricity and production in different markets. © 2021 SAE International.

However, compositions and aging of haze aerosols during the TRT have not been studied. We showed the TRT PM2.5 dominated by organic matter (OM) (30%) and secondary inorganic ions (36%) in the NCP and 29% and 60% in the YRD. Following the TRT, abundant spherical primary OM particles (i.e., tarballs) (71% by number) mainly from residential coal burning in rural areas of the NCP unexpectedly occurred in the YRD. The inert tarballs display similar sizes (∼300 nm) and O/C ratios (∼0.15), but the mixture of nitrate, sulfate, and secondary OM as the coatings completely convert the hydrophobic tarballs into hydrophilic ones in the TRT. The aging and transport of tarballs from the NCP to YRD further indicate that the TRT not only brought various trace gases (e.g., CO, SO2, NOx, and VOCs) but also carried large numbers of nanosized primary particles (e.g., tarball, metal, fly ash, and soot) with secondary coatings over 1,000 km. The findings suggest that these many nanosized tarballs containing brown carbon and highly toxic species in the NCP influence regional climate and human health in northern and eastern China, which needs more attention. Although the NCP and YRD have different energy consumption structures in winter and are two isolated administrative regions, we emphasize the need for a coordinated cross-regional emission reduction strategy for TRT haze control. © 2021.

Of these investible areas, 1.1–1.3 Mha can be financially sustainable over a 30-year time frame based on carbon prices of US$5–9.4 t−1CO2e. This contributes up to 29.8 MtCO2e year−1 and yields a return on investment of ∼US$3.7 billion per year. Our results point toward a disproportionately large potential of blue carbon finance that can be leveraged to meet national-level climate mitigation goals, particularly if combined with other conservation interventions that further safeguard carbon stocks and biodiversity in these irreplaceable forests.

However, as the main model for carbon reduction in China, the non-cooperative carbon reduction model (NCCRM) is a simple regulation mode, which is not beneficial for optimization of electricity generation capacity structure and cannot effectively motivate carbon reduction at the provincial level. Therefore, we propose an interprovincial cooperative carbon reduction model (CCRM) from the perspective of electricity generation, which provides a mechanism integrating two fundamental principles of efficiency and fairness. The CCRM consists of two parts: (1) an optimal model of carbon reduction with the object of minimizing the carbon emission of the cooperation union to determine the optimal annual electricity generation for each participating province and (2) a model that distributes the economic benefits of the cooperation among the provinces in the cooperation based on the Shapley value method. We applied the CCRM to the case of an interprovincial union of Shanghai, Sichuan, Shanxi, and Gansu in China. The results, based on the data from 2014 to 2017, show that cooperation can significantly reduce the carbon emission of the union by 425.78 × 108 kg, 11.06%; meanwhile, Shanghai, Sichuan, Shanxi, and Gansu can, respectively, get 2.79 × 108, 11.11 × 108, 4.07 × 108, and 3.19 × 108 CNY of extra benefits from carbon reduction. To test the impact of different parameter values on the results of the CCRM, a sensitivity analysis was conducted. Some policy recommendations are proposed to promote the implementation of the CCRM. © Copyright © 2021 Zeng, Du, Zhao and Sun.","carbon reduction; game; interprovincial cooperation; optimal model; Shapley value","Climate change; Electric power generation; Sensitivity analysis; Cooperation based; Economic benefits; Efficiency and fairness; Electricity generation; Electricity generation capacity; Fundamental principles; National policies; Policy recommendations; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105942632

Solar radiation modification (SRM) is one potential approach to partially counteract anthropogenic warming by reflecting a small proportion of the incoming solar radiation to increase Earth's albedo. While climate science research has focused on the predicted climate effects of SRM, almost no studies have investigated the impacts that SRM would have on ecological systems. The impacts and risks posed by SRM would vary by implementation scenario, anthropogenic climate effects, geographic region, and by ecosystem, community, population, and organism. Complex interactions among Earth's climate system and living systems would further affect SRM impacts and risks. We focus here on stratospheric aerosol intervention (SAI), a well-studied and relatively feasible SRM scheme that is likely to have a large impact on Earth's surface temperature. We outline current gaps in knowledge about both helpful and harmful predicted effects of SAI on ecological systems. Desired ecological outcomes might also inform development of future SAI implementation scenarios. In addition to filling these knowledge gaps, increased collaboration between ecologists and climate scientists would identify a common set of SAI research goals and improve the communication about potential SAI impacts and risks with the public. Without this collaboration, forecasts of SAI impacts will overlook potential effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services for humanity. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

These crystals were synthesized using the hydrothermal method and were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Rietveld refinement, and TEM techniques. XRD and Rietveld results confirmed that β-Ag2MoO4 has a spinel-type cubic structure. The optical properties were investigated by UV-Vis spectroscopy. DFT+U formalism, via on-site Coulomb corrections for the d orbital electrons of Ag and Mo atoms (Ud) and the 2p orbital electrons of O atoms (Up) provided an improved band gap for β-Ag2MoO4. Examination of the density of states revealed the energy states in the valence and conduction bands of the β-Ag2MoO4 and Ag2O. The theoretical band structure indicated an indirect band gap of approximately 3.41 eV. Furthermore, CO2 electroreduction, and hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of β-Ag2MoO4 and Ag2O were studied and a comparative investigation on molybdate-derived silver and oxide-derived silver was performed. The electrochemical results demonstrate that β-Ag2MoO4 and Ag2O can be good electrocatalysts for water splitting and CO2 reduction. The CO2 electroreduction results also indicate that CO2 reduction intermediates adsorbed strongly on the surface of Ag2O, which increased the overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction on the surface of Ag2O by as much as 0.68 V against the value of 0.6 V for Ag2MoO4, at a current density of-1.0 mA cm-2.

A literature search for peer-reviewed, English language, literature published since the pandemic emerged was conducted using Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, and the Cochrane Library. The final sample yielded a total of 22 commentaries, editorials, discussion papers, and a research study that explicitly addressed the intersection of COVID-19 and climate change. Sixty articles emerged in the initial review of the intersection of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change with the final yield of 22 articles deemed valid for inclusion after full text review. With the emergence of COVID-19 and scholarly discourse that addresses the intersection of the pandemic with climate change, key issues emerged that intersect with policy /advocacy, social justice, and nursing's public health role in clinical practice, education, policy/advocacy, and research/scholarship. Five themes that emerged included the role of public health in COVID-19 and climate change efforts; global approach addressing human-environment issues; intersection of COVID-19 and climate change from a community and global perspective; impacts of COVID-19, climate change and the environment and professional associations and specialty organizations’ views and responsibilities with a lens on COVID-19 and climate change. Despite the importance of addressing racial inequities as well as systemic and structural racism that impacts those most affected by climate change and pandemics such as COVID-19, no literature addressed this topic.

C. inophyllum seed can be deformed into oil as biofuel. Biofuel is very important to mitigate climate change impact as it reduces greenhouse gas emission from transportation sector. Mostly C. inophyllum grows along the coastline, especially in Ngombol and Grabag, Purworejo. There are a lot of C. inophyllum plant populations at these sites, but its varieties are not studied yet, therefore it is necessary to study the characterization of its morphology. This study aimed to obtain morphological character data and analyze C. inophyllum plants' diversity in Purworejo. Samples were selected intentionally (purposive sampling). Thus morphological data elaborated descriptively and the cluster was analyzed by NTSYS (Numerical Taxonomy and Multivariate Analysis System) program. The study showed the diversity and also the similarity of morphological characters. C. inophyllum fruit and seed's morphological character had its fruit length 2.1-3.1 cm, fruit diameter 1.93-1.95 cm, fruit weight 3.04-12.82 g, fruit shape is spherical/round, and fruit hardness 92.5-99.57 N. Moreover, it had seed length 1.16-2.22 cm, seed width 1.16-1.79 cm, seed weight 0.74-3.06 g, seed shape were spheroid, ellipsoid, reniform and the color was yellow. The morphological characters' variance was 26%, which was categorized as low and Grabag district had more potential for growing and production than Ngombol regency. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Biodiesel; Fruits; Greenhouse gases; Multivariant analysis; Climate change impact; Morphological characterization; Morphological characters; Morphological data; Multi variate analysis; Numerical taxonomy; Plant population; Transportation sector; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104886856

To reduce CO2 emissions, the Chinese government has ordered the construction of a large number of photovoltaic (PV) panels to generate power in the past two decades; many are located in desert areas because of the sufficient light conditions. Large-scale PV construction in desert areas can alter the local microclimate and soil conditions, thereby affecting the growth of vegetation. However, few studies have focused on the effects of PV panels on the environment of desert areas. In this study, we investigated the effects of PV panels on soil moisture and temperature via a whole-year field experiment at a PV power plant in a desert area in western China. The in situ soil moisture and temperature at a depth of 0–0.4 m were measured under three types of PV shading conditions: shaded by fixed-tilt (FIX) PV panels, shaded by oblique single-axis (OSA) PV panels, and no shading. The results showed that the soil temperature and moisture at sites under PV shading were significantly affected compared with those at sites without shading. PV panels increased the average soil temperature during winter but decreased it during the other three seasons. Moreover, the warming effect of FIX PV panels on the soil is more apparent than that of OSA PV panels. PV panels have positive effects on soil moisture. Compared with that at the sites without shaded areas, the average soil moisture under the FIX PV panels and under the OSA PV panels increased by 14.7% and by 11.1%, respectively. These data provide support for future studies on vegetation restoration around PV power plants in desert areas. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Desert areas; Field observations; PV panels; Soil moisture; Soil temperature","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; desert; experimental study; fossil fuel; microclimate; photovoltaic system; power generation; soil depth; soil moisture; soil temperature; China; water; China; desert climate; ecosystem; microclimate; season; soil; temperature; China; Desert Climate; Ecosystem; Microclimate; Seasons; Soil; Temperature; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099001000

However, the relationship between dechlorination and CH4-associated bioprocesses is unclear. Based on the hypothesis that CH4 supplementation could facilitate OCP dechlorination, we investigated the role of CH4-associated bioprocesses in the self-purification of flooded lindane-spiked paddy soils. Four treatments were conducted for up to 28 days: sterilized soil (S), sterilized soil + CH4 (SC), non-sterilized soil (NS), and non-sterilized soil + CH4 (NSC). Results indicated that both sterilization and addition of CH4 promoted lindane degradation and CH4 emissions in the flooded paddy soils. In the NS treatment, lindane had the lowest degradation rate when CH4 emissions were barely detected; while in the SC treatment, lindane had the highest degradation rate when CH4 achieved its highest emissions from anaerobic soil. Also, sterilization led to microbial diversity loss and functional recession, but increased ferrous ion [Fe(II)] concentrations compared to non-sterilized soils. Methanogenic communities and mcrA gene recovered faster than the majority of microorganisms (e.g., Fe bacteria, Bdellovibrionaceae, Rhizobiaceae, Dehalogenimonas) or functional genes (e.g., Dhc, Geo, narG, nirS). Collectively, we assume the enhanced removal of lindane may partly be due to both abiotic dechlorination promoted by chemical Fe redox processes and methanogenesis-derived biotic dechlorination. Revealing the coupling between dechlorination and CH4-associated bioprocesses is helpful to resolve both pollution remediation and mitigation of CH4 emissions in anaerobic contaminated sites. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Iron redox; Methane; Methanogenesis; Organic chlorinated pollutants; Reductive dechlorination","Cyclohexane; Dechlorination; Degradation; Floods; Genes; Insecticides; Iron compounds; Methane; Purification; Soils; Sterilization (cleaning); Anaerobic environment; Contaminated sites; Ecological process; Methanogenic community; Microbial diversity; Oxidation of methane; Reductive dechlorination; Self-purification; Soil pollution; bacterial DNA; bacterial RNA; ferrous ion; genomic DNA; lindane; methane; nitrate reductase; nitrite; nitrous oxide; RNA 16S; sulfate; hexachlorocyclohexane; methane; agricultural soil; bacterium; concentration (composition); dechlorination; HCH; methane; methanogenesis; microbial community; redox conditions; self purification; soil pollution; Acidiphilium; Acidovorax; Article; bacterial gene; Bdellovibrionaceae; bioprocess; bioremediation; Burkholderiaceae; Caulobacteraceae; Chlorobium; Chromobacteriaceae; controlled study; dechlorination; degradation; Dehalobacter; Dhc gene; electron; environmental factor; Ferroglobus placidus; gas chromatography; gene dosage; Geo gene; Geobacter metallireducens; greenhouse; high throughput sequencing; ion chromatography; Leptothrix; mcrA gene; Methanobacteriaceae; Methanobacterium; Methanoculleus; methanogenesis; Methanomassiliicoccus; Methanosarcina; Methanothermobacter; Methylobacillus; Methylococcus; Methylophilaceae; Methylosinus; microbial community; microbial diversity; narG gene; nirS gene; nonhuman; oxidation; oxidation reduction reaction; purification; Rhizobiaceae; Rhodomicrobium; Rhodomicrobium vannielii; Rhodopseudomonas; Rhodopseudomonas palustris; Rhodovulum; Shewanella; soil pollution; Sphaerotilus; Streptomycetaceae; Thiobacillus; ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry; microbiology; soil; soil pollutant; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bdellovibrionaceae; Rhizobiaceae; Hexachlorocyclohexane; Methane; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098674700

Loss of ground cover increases the direct exposure of the surface soil to erosion by strong winds—a process that ultimately converts grassland into sandy desert. Three ways to restore such degraded lands through afforestation were evaluated in terms of total carbon stored in the restored ecosystems compared to that in the control. Total carbon comprised that stored in the biomass of trees, herbs, standing litter, and soil (to a depth of 100 cm). The three restoration treatments were (1) enclosing the grassland within a shelter belt of Populus × beijingensis (FG), (2) afforesting small but well-distributed patches within the grassland using Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica (MG), and (3) afforesting small but well-distributed patches within the grassland using Ulmus pumila (UG). A plot of desertified sandy grassland in which the dominant species were Agriophyllum squarrosum (Linn.) Moq. and Cenchrus echinatus Linn. was used as the control (CK). The results show that total ecosystem carbon storage in FG, UG, and MG increased significantly over time in comparison with that in CK. After more than 20 years, all three grassland restoration approaches are expected to contribute greatly to global ecosystem carbon sequestration. The rank order of total ecosystem carbon storage content is: FG (104.29 t/ha) > MG (102.96 t/ha) > UG (92.24 t/ha) > CK (24.48 t/ha). Soil carbon storage in the 0–30 cm and 0–50 cm depth ranges accounted for 41.81–60.13% and 59.42–80.80% of the total soil pool, respectively, across all treatments. FG had the highest biomass carbon storage, which was linked to differences in tree species. The structure of the plant community created in these treatments was different from that found in natural stands of forest and in grasslands without trees or shrubs. All the three treatments are suitable for the restoration of moderately desertified sandy grasslands in south-eastern Horqin, northern China, depending on the availability of water and soil nutrients. The results of the present study highlight the importance of degraded grassland restoration programs in enhancing ecosystem carbon storage. © 2020 The Author(s)","Desertification; Ecosystem carbon storage; Grassland restoration; Sparse afforestation; Tree belt enclosure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100219269

Specifically, difference-in-differences (DID) and spatial DID (SDID) estimators are used as the main empirical strategy. We find that the LCCP policy improved CEE by 1.7% which are both economically and statistically significant. Further, its impact on neighbor untreated cities is about 64% of that on the treated cities.

Regional atmospheric environmental problems characterized by PM2.5 pollutants are becoming increasingly prominent, especially in the Jing-Jin-Ji (3J) region. This study employs the generalized Divisia index approach to decompose the factors that influence the changes of PM2.5 emission in the 3J region. It is divided into 8 factors: scale effect of regional economy, scale effect of regional energy consumption, scale effect of investment in treatment of environment pollution (ITEP), technology effect of energy efficient utilization, technology effect of clean energy utilization technology, the intensity effect of regional green economic development, the intensity effect of investment in treatment of regional PM2.5 emission, and the intensity effect of regional environmental regulation. To identify the vital driving force of the change of PM2.5 emission, the contribution of each driving factor of PM2.5 emission variation is analyzed. The results show that the factors affecting the change of PM2.5 emission are almost the same, but the contribution of each factor is apparently different in the 3J region. The level of regional economic development and the scale of energy consumption promoted the increase of PM2.5 emission in the region. The growth of PM2.5 emission can be effectively controlled by green economic development intensity, energy clean utilization technology, environmental regulation intensity, and the intensity of investment in treatment of PM2.5 emission. Energy efficiency has a slight effect on the changes of PM2.5 emission. ITEP has a negative effect on the changes of PM2.5 emission. In the future, the 3J region needs to optimize the structure of ITEP further and implement the refinement and precision of pollution treatment. Moreover, it also needs to promote the development of energy clean and efficient use of technological innovation to drive PM2.5 emission reduction. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Environmental regulation; Generalized Divisia index method; Investment in treatment of environment pollution; Jing-Jin-Ji (3J) region; PM2.5 emission","atmospheric pollution; economic development; emission control; innovation; particulate matter; pollution control; precision; scale effect; socioeconomic status; China; Jingjinji; air pollutant; air pollution; China; economic development; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; socioeconomics; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Economic Development; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096800370

This paper takes China's carbon emission trading policy as the research subject, and evaluates the employment effect of carbon emission trading policy from the perspective of micro enterprises under the premise of considering the spatial spillover effect. This paper aims to verify and evaluate the spatial spillover effect of China's carbon emission trading pilot policy on labor demand of enterprises, and study the effect of environmental policies on the employment market in China. Firstly, from the theoretical point of view, comparisons among the differences of the average employment effect, spillover effect and total effect coefficient of carbon trading right policy are conducted under the condition of spillover effect or not. Secondly, from the empirical perspective and relaxing the STUVA conditions, a Triple Difference Model is constructed to evaluate the impact of carbon emission trading policy on the labor demand of enterprises by using the panel data of China A-share listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2008 to 2017. Thirdly, this paper further uses the synthetic control method to analyze the employment effect differences of carbon emission trading policies in different pilot areas of China. The results show that the carbon emission trading policy in China has an about 10 percent positive spillover effect on the neighboring provinces in pilot areas. Moreover, the results indicate that China's carbon emission trading policy has generated some employment dividend, and the total effect is about 11.5 percent when the ratio of individual sample is considered. In addition, the impact of carbon emission trading policy on employment is gradually increasing, and the employment effect of carbon trading policies in different pilot areas of China is quite dissimilar. The findings of this paper confirm the positive employment effect of China's carbon emission trading policy, and have important policy implications for the further promotion of the national carbon emission trading market. At the same time, it helps to clarify the relationship between environmental protection and full employment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission trading policy; Employment effect; Spillover effect; Triple difference model","Carbon; Emission control; Employment; Public policy; Carbon emission trading; Difference models; Employment effects; Environmental policy; Environmental supervision; Policy implications; Positive spillovers; Theoretical points; Environmental protection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099918697

In the case of Colombia, the role of biomass has been tackled through qualitative roadmaps and regional climate policy assessments. However, neither of these approaches has addressed the complexity of the bio-based economy systematically in the wider context of emission mitigation and energy and chemicals supply. In response to this limitation, we extended a bottom-up energy system optimization model by adding a comprehensive database of novel bio-based value chains. We included advanced road and aviation biofuels, (bio)chemicals, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and integrated biorefinery configurations. A scenario analysis was conducted for the period 2015–2050, which reflected uncertainties in the capacity for technological learning, climate policy ambitions, and land availability for energy crops. Our results indicate that biomass can play an important, even if variable, role in supplying 315–760 PJ/y of modern bio-based products. In pursuit of a deep decarbonization trajectory, the large-scale mobilization of biomass resources can reduce the cost of the energy system by up to 11 billion $/year, the marginal abatement cost by 62%, and the potential reliance on imports of oil and chemicals in the future. The mitigation potential of BECCS can reach 24–29% of the cumulative avoided emissions between 2015 and 2050.

Fukuoka, located on the west side of Japan and affected by TAP from the Asian continent, is a unique example for understanding the contribution of LAP and TAP. Gaseous species and particulate matter (PM) were measured for approximately three weeks in Fukuoka in the winter of 2018. We classified two distinctive periods, LAP and TAP, based on wind speed. The classification was supported by variations in the concentration of gaseous species and by backward trajectories. Most air pollutants, including NOx and PM, were high in the LAP period and low in the TAP period. However, ozone was the exception. Therefore, our findings suggest that reducing local emissions is necessary. Ozone was higher in the TAP period, and the variation in ozone concentration was relatively small, indicating that ozone was produced outside of the city and transported to Fukuoka. Thus, air pollutants must also be reduced at a regional scale, including in China. © 2021 by the authors.

O3 concentrations increased for 2017 to 2019. Correlation and statistics analysis indicated high temperature (T &gt; 25 ◦C, low relative humidity (RH &lt; 60%), and low wind speed (WS &lt; 3 m/s) were favorable for O3 formation and accumulation, and the O3 pollution days (MDA8 O3 &gt; 160 µg/m3) were predominantly observed when the wind was traveling from the easterly and southerly. O3 concentration in urban area of Yulin was higher than that in background. The pollution air masses from Fenwei Plain increase the level and duration of O3 pollution. In order to clarify the formation mechanism and source of O3, online measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were conducted from 7 July to 10 August in 2019. The average of VOCs concentration was 26 ± 12 ppbv, and large amounts of alkenes followed by aromatics, characteristic pollutants of the coal chemical industry, were detected in the ambient air. To further measure the sensitivity, the observation-based model (OBM) simulation was conducted. Empirical Kinetic Modeling Approach (EKMA) plot and relative incremental reactivity (RIR) value indicated Yulin located on VOCs-limited regime. That implied a slight decrease of NOx may increase O3 concentration. When the emission reduction ratio of anthropogenic VOCs/NOx higher than 1:1, the O3 will decrease. O3 control strategies analysis shows that the O3 targets of 5% and 10% O3 concentration reductions are achievable through precursor control, but more effort is needed to reach the 30% and 40% reduction control targets.

These changes are known as ocean acidification and affect the seaweeds in various ways. Therefore, this study is aimed to determine the ecological succession of Ulva flexuosa Wulfen 1803 in future predicted CO2-induced low pH conditions alone and in combination with naturally relevant ultraviolet radiation (UVR). For this purpose, acidification experiments with and without UVR were conducted on U. flexuosa from the Mediterranean coast, and important physiological features of algae was investigated. In this study, the Fv/Fm ratios of U. flexuosa ranged from 0.718±0.01 to 0.754±0.009. While rETRmax values of samples exposed to elevated-CO2 were measured between 112.13 - 151.93 µmol e-m-2s-1, it was determined between 111.7 - 158.4 µmol e-m-2s-1 in samples exposed to ambient sea water. According to our results, increased CO2 concentration in seawater did not improve the photosynthetic efficiency of U. flexuosa. However, when the specimens were exposed to elevated-CO2, nitrate reductase activity of U. flexuosa was declined drastically. According to the results, it is suggested that the elevated CO2 may regulate the nitrogen preference of U. flexuosa. Besides, the data also show that U. flexuosa was not sensitive to UVR. © 2021 National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

However, assessments of future range shifts rarely account for the capacity of the landscape matrix to facilitate species dispersals. Here, we assessed future range shifts for a suite of critically endangered plants in Madagascar. We quantified habitat connectivity using a least cost path model that captured the potential of species to disperse within fragmented landscapes. Next, we constructed three scenarios representing landscapes impacted by climate-only, climate and land-cover change, as well as habitat connectivity. We modelled species distributions using a hierarchical Bayesian framework and measured future range shifts using three spatial indices: net-change, range distance and elevation change. Our results show that the median range shift due to contractions increased by 25% under the climate-only scenario compared with the connectivity scenario. Habitat connectivity is predicted to limit range shifts due to contractions, while increasing shifts due to expansions for many of the endangered and critically endangered plants on Madagascar. However, at least one-third of critically endangered and 50% of endangered plants are expected to experience range contractions and upslope displacement under all scenarios, suggesting that even with habitat connectivity the range of some species may still contract. Despite that finding, our study suggests that including connectivity in range shift models is crucial for developing a relevant connectivity conservation plan, since future climate or climate and land-cover change models do not adequately represent species' potential to reach safe sites. © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate change; Critically endangered plants; Habitat connectivity; Land-cover change; Madagascar; Range shifts","connectivity; endangered species; habitat fragmentation; habitat structure; landscape structure; prediction; range expansion; range size; scenario analysis; Madagascar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101823826

In the PM2.5 source analysis, coal combustion is one of the important factors in the formation of PM2.5 local source. In this paper, we build network model with PM2.5 data of 366 cities in China from January 2015 to June 2017. Specifically, we construct a symmetric correlation network by partial correlation coefficient and an asymmetric information transportation network by transfer entropy. Then the spatial and temporal characteristics of PM2.5 are studied through time-variant complex networks. Structural control theory of complex networks helps to find the control node sets, which provide suggestions to prevent PM2.5 pollution. Further, we analyze the national power data and the correlation analysis shows the clean energy ratio and PM2.5 concentration are strongly correlated. Finally, control strategy of clean energy for PM2.5 is provided. © 2021 IEEE.","Clean energy; Partial correlation coefficient; PM2.5; Structural control; Transfer entropy","Air quality; Coal combustion; Complex networks; Energy utilization; Entropy; Structural dynamics; Clean energy; Control strategies; Correlation coefficient; Partial correlation; Partial correlation coefficient; Pm2.5; Prevention and controls; Prevention strategies; Structural control; Transfer entropy; Correlation methods",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117221754

The structural transformation of electric power supply plays a key role in the realization of low-carbon development in China. However, the low-carbon transformation of the electric power structure has to consider the differences in resource endowment and technical conditions among regions. To investigate the potential evolution of the regional electric power supply structure, we collect data of provincial resource endowment and technical differences and introduce them into the Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (TIMES) model of China's regional electric power sector. In this model, different scenarios for carbon emission reduction in the electric power industry are set, and the optimal regional electric power supply structures under each constraint of carbon emissions are calculated. The results show that the electric power supply structure will change in various regions when the carbon emission reduction target increases from 5% (LC1 scenario) to 15% (LC3 scenario). In 2030, the proportion of thermal power in all regions will decline, especially in western China, where the proportion will decline by 8.47%. However, thermal power will still play a leading role in central China and eastern China, with the proportion more than 50%. Meanwhile, the proportion of the power generation of renewable energy in all regions will increase rapidly in the LC3 scenario, especially in western China, where the proportion will account for 60.72% in 2030, while the proportion will account for 27.26% in eastern China in 2030. Wind power will play an important role in the power supply system in the LC3 scenario, and the proportion of wind power in all regions will exceed that of solar power in 2030, especially in northeast China, where the highest proportion of wind power will come to 30.37%. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emissions; Electric power supply; Low-carbon transformation; Resource endowment; Scenario analysis; TIMES model","Carbon; Electric industry; Emission control; Wind power; Carbon emission reductions; Electric power industries; Electric power sector; Electric power supply; Low carbon transformations; Low-carbon development; Structural transformation; Technical conditions; Electric power system interconnection; carbon; bottom-up approach; carbon emission; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy use; model; scenario analysis; carbon footprint; China; controlled study; electric power plant; energy resource; hydropower; nuclear energy; photovoltaic power; power supply; renewable energy; solar energy; thermal power; wind power; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097051543

Dalian City has a single source of natural gas by sea, which is highly dependent on offshore imports. In addition, it is predicted that the LNG throughput of Dalian Port will reach 8-12 billion m3 by 2050, so it urgently needs to build new LNG terminals to ensure the safety of natural gas supply. This paper statistically analyzed not only the operation status and construction progress of LNG terminals in northern China, but also the characteristics of natural gas consumption in the three North-Eastern Provinces of China and Dalian City.

We use an interdisciplinary approach to develop a range of stylized global coal demand scenarios until 2040 depicting the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting recovery stimuli. Additional insights are gained by adjusting trade restrictions of key countries within the coal sector model COALMOD-World to resemble plausible post-COVID-19 policy and market dynamics. Results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic might cause an “L” or “\” shape instead of the hoped for “V” or “U” shaped recovery of the coal industry. Regional effects vary, as the Atlantic market dries out first, causing shifts in trade patterns in the Pacific market. Moreover, announced trade restrictions could change dramatically the composition of the international steam coal trade. However, even significantly reduced coal consumption levels in low-coal post-COVID-19 scenarios would still be too high to comply with the global climate targets. This emphasizes the importance of concentrated policy efforts in the pandemic aftermath to manage a coal decline consistent with global climate targets while bringing just transitions efforts substantially forward, in particular in vulnerable coal-dependent countries and regions. © 2021 The Authors","Coal phase-out; COVID-19; Green recovery; Just transition; Steam coal market","Coal; Commerce; Metal recovery; Coal consumption; Global climates; Long-term perspective; Market dynamics; Potential impacts; Regional effects; Trade patterns; Trade restrictions; Coal industry; coal production; consumption behavior; COVID-19; demand analysis; energy planning; epidemic; gas trade; interdisciplinary approach; market conditions; vulnerability; Atlantic Sector; Pacific Ocean; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101806122

In the present study, the adsorption mechanisms of CH4, CO2, and H2O molecules on the undoped and Al or Al&amp;Mg doped illite (001) surfaces have been investigated using density functional theory. The nine different adsorption sites (H1-H3, T1-T3, and B1-B3) on the surfaces were considered. The calculations show that for all the three molecules, the Al&amp;Mg-doped illite (001) surface has the strongest adsorption ability while the undoped one is the weakest. Besides, the adsorption ability on each of the three surfaces increases in the order of CH4, CO2 and H2O. The H2O molecule having the strongest adsorption on the three surfaces is ascribed to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the adsorbate and adsorbent. The adsorption of the CH4 and CO2 molecules on each of the three surfaces is characterized as a physical adsorption, but that of the H2O molecule is not. In-depth PDOS (partial density of states) and Hirshfeld charge analyses suggest that there exists a small amount of electron transfer from the adsorbent to adsorbate after their adsorptions on the three surfaces. The Al&amp;Mg-doped illite surface having the strongest adsorption ability for each of the three molecules should be attributed to its surface O atoms having more negative charges. © 2021","Adsorption; DFT; Illite; PDOS analysis; Shale gas",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101500670

The Chinese government issued the “Mid- and Long-term Railway Network Plan” and the “National Highway Network Plan (2013–2030)” in 2004 and 2013, respectively, aiming at building a national railway network and a national highway network with reasonable layout, wide coverage and economic efficiency. In the future, both railway and road investment will be further increased, which has the potential for a larger impact on air pollution emissions. However, comparison between the impact of railway investment and that road investment in China is lacking. In this study, we use a multiregion and multisectoral computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to investigate the difference in the impact of railway investment and that of road investment on the economy and air pollution emissions in China. We find that with a fixed amount of investment, road investment may lead to more economic growth than railway investment, mainly through influencing the motor equipment, other transport equipment, construction and road transport sectors. In addition, compared to railway investment, road investment promotes a greater emission reduction in CO2, CO, SO2, NOX, and PM2.5, especially in Hubei, Guizhou, and Guangdong provinces, where both energy consumption and the output of heavy industry will decrease significantly. Therefore, future investment in roads has a stronger promotional effect on both economic growth and air pollution emission reduction than railway investment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution emissions; Computable general equilibrium model; Economic impact; Railway investment; Road investment","Air pollution; Construction equipment; Economics; Emission control; Energy utilization; Highway planning; Railroads; Roads and streets; Sulfur dioxide; Chinese Government; Computable general equilibrium model; Economic efficiency; Guangdong Province; Pollution emissions; Promotional effect; Road transport sectors; Transport equipment; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100691553

On top of that, refrigeration, air-conditioning, and heat pump equipment account for 25–30% of the global electricity consumption and will increase dramatically in the next decades. However, some waste cold energy sources have not been fully used. These challenges triggered an interest in developing the concept of cold thermal energy storage, which can be used to recover the waste cold energy, enhance the performance of refrigeration systems, and improve renewable energy integration. This paper comprehensively reviews the research activities about cold thermal energy storage technologies at sub-zero temperatures (from around −270 °C to below 0 °C). A wide range of existing and potential storage materials are tabulated with their properties. Numerical and experimental work conducted for different storage types is systematically summarized. Current and potential applications of cold thermal energy storage are analyzed with their suitable materials and compatible storage types. Selection criteria of materials and storage types are also presented. This review aims to provide a quick reference for researchers and industry experts in designing cold thermal energy systems. Moreover, by identifying the research gaps where further efforts are needed, the review also outlines the progress and potential development directions of cold thermal energy storage technologies. © 2021 The Authors","Cold thermal energy storage; Encapsulation method; Numerical; Phase change materials (PCMs); Storage system; Sub-zero","Air conditioning; Climate change; Electric energy storage; Heat storage; Refrigeration; Thermal energy; Cold thermal energy storage; Development directions; Electricity-consumption; Potential storage materials; Refrigeration system; Renewable energy integrations; Sub-zero temperatures; Thermal energy systems; Storage (materials); alternative energy; electricity; energy storage; equipment component; low temperature; pump; recovery method; technological development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101335629

Because the GPP is not a statistical index yet, we use a non-radial directional distance function (NDDF) in a non-parametric data envelop analysis (DEA) framework to evaluate the GPP for 10 provinces (4 with pilot ETSs while 6 without an ETS) in eastern China over 2006–2016. We find: (1) GPP in all the provinces increased over time. However, most of the provinces have great potentials to further improve their GPP. (2) The average GPP in the treatment group (with pilot ETSs) was larger than that in the control group (without an ETS). The GPP differences between the two groups increased after the pilot ETSs were implemented. (3) The pilot ETSs significantly improved the GPP by approximately 10%. (4) The GPP in the treatment group has been improved since the pilot ETS policy was released in late 2011 rather than the pilot ETSs were put in force starting from 2013. (5) Due to the low carbon prices in the pilot markets, the impact of the pilot ETSs on the GPP decreased after 2013. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon-emission trading scheme (ETS); Difference-in-difference model; Green production performance; Non-radial directional distance function; Pilot ETSs in China","Emission control; Carbon emission trading; Data envelop analysis; Difference-in-differences; Directional distance function; Green production; Non-parametric; Statistical indices; Treatment group; Carbon; carbon emission; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental policy; green economy; performance assessment; policy approach; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101630001

In order to assess those disturbances correctly and to design effective and efficient mitigation measures, it is necessary to develop an accurate prediction model for subsurface strata movements and deformations. Decades of research have demonstrated that variations of stratification and lithology in the overburden have significant influence on the subsurface strata movements and deformations during ground subsidence process. The key strata theory states that the thick and hard key strata serve as the backbone of the overburden and control the movements of the thin and soft weak strata located above them. From an engineering standpoint, the overburden strata are subdivided into several individual groups by the key strata with each group consisting of a key layer at the bottom and weak layers overlying it. A new subsurface subsidence prediction model considering the key strata effects on subsurface strata movements and deformations has been proposed. In this method, elastic modulus, specific weight, tensile strength, and uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of each layer are used to identify the key layers and to determine the needed subsurface subsidence parameters. The influence function method, proven to be accurate and versatile for surface subsidence prediction, was employed to predict the subsidence on each of the overburden layers from mining horizon progressively upward to ground surface with the assumption that the predicted subsidence on a given layer serves as the subsidence source for the layer immediately above. The enhanced subsurface subsidence prediction model has been demonstrated with an actual case to show its applicability and improvement. © 2021, Society for Mining, Metallurgy & Exploration Inc.","Key strata theory; Longwall mining; Prediction model; Subsurface subsidence","Coal deposits; Coal industry; Coal mines; Compressive strength; Deformation; Forecasting; Groundwater; Lithology; Longwall mining; Methane; Predictive analytics; Reservoirs (water); Tensile strength; Accurate prediction; Coalbed methane reservoir; Engineering standpoint; Influence function methods; Mitigation measures; Subsidence predictions; Underground coal mine; Uniaxial compressive strength; Subsidence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099910108

Studies in environmental justice concur that the adverse effects of urban climate change are disproportionately greater for the demographically vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, the children, and the socially marginalized. Yet, little is known about how these social groups contribute to urban climate change policies. Accounting for local climate risks and the presence of national adaptation schemes, this study examines whether the implementation of adaptation policies in the 902 European cities is influenced by the proportion of these vulnerable groups. Our results show a positive and significant association between the proportion of elderly citizens and adaptation policies among these European cities. The result of this study offers local level empirical evidence to the climate justice discussion and suggests that the adaptation policies adopted by these European cities are working to ameliorate environmental injustice faced by the older and weaker social groups. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation policies; Climate justice; Elderly citizens; Environmental justice; Local climate risk; Urban climate policy","Economics; Adaptation policies; Adaptation scheme; Climate change impact; Climate justices; Elderly citizens; Environmental justice; Socio-economic status; Vulnerable groups; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100611990

A random effect eigenvector spatial filtering (RE-ESF) approach with and without non-spatially varying coefficients (SNVC) is performed by using the provincial panel dataset over the period 2002–2016. The main findings are as follows: First, compared with the non-spatial pooled regression model, the RE-ESF and RE-ESF-SNVC models have increased the goodness-of-fit from 0.8854 to 0.9778 and 0.9834, respectively, indicating that the RE-ESF approach produces a better fit to the data. Second, the global results of the RE-ESF model show that a 1% increase in financial deepening will bring about 0.152% decrease in PM2.5 concentrations. Third, the local results of the RE-ESF-SNVC model indicate that the spatially varying coefficient of financial deepening ranges from −0.3215 to 0.101 with the median value of −0.1315, reflecting significant spatial heterogeneity of PM2.5 concentrations driven by financial deepening. These findings contribute to PM2.5 concentration reduction by identifying financial deepening as a significant economic driving factor, investigating its global and local impacts on PM2.5 concentrations, and providing policymakers with implications for developing appropriate financial policies, such as a more flexible province-specific reserve requirement policy supplemented by higher deposit rates and a cross-provincial allocation of bank credits. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Eigenvector spatial filtering; Financial deepening; Non-spatially varying coefficients; PM2.5 concentrations; Spatial heterogeneity","Beamforming; Digital storage; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Random processes; Regression analysis; Driving factors; Goodness of fit; PM2.5 concentration; Regression model; Reserve requirements; Spatial filterings; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatially varying coefficients; Finance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099503779

However, current understandings of global changes in fine-mode aerosols are limited. In this study, we employed newly developed satellite retrieval data and an attentive interpretable deep learning model to explore the status, changes, and association factors of the global fine-mode aerosol optical depth (fAOD) and aerosol fine-mode fraction (FMF) from 2008 to 2017. At the global scale, the results show a significant increasing trend in land FMF (2.34 × 10−3/year); however, the FMF over the ocean and the fAOD over land and ocean did not reveal significant trends. Between 2008 and 2017, high levels of both fAOD (&gt;0.30) and FMF (&gt;0.75) were identified over China, southeastern Asia, India, and Africa. Seasonally, global land FMF showed high values in summer (&gt;0.70) and low values in spring (&lt;0.65), while land fAOD was high in summer (&gt;0.15) but low in winter (&lt;0.13). Importantly, Australia and Mexico experienced significant increasing trends in FMF during all four seasons. At the regional scale, a significant decline in fAOD was identified in China, which indicates that government emission controls and reductions have been effective in recent decades. The deep learning model was used to interpret the result and showed that O3 was significantly associated with changes in both the FMF and fAOD. This finding suggests the importance of synergizing the regulations for both O3 and fine particles. Our work comprehensively examined global spatial and seasonal fAOD and FMF changes and provides a holistic understanding of global anthropogenic impacts. © 2021 The Author(s)","Aerosol; fAOD; FMF; Satellite","Aerosols; Learning systems; Aerosol optical depths; Anthropogenic impacts; Fine particles; Global change; Learning approach; Learning models; Regional scale; Satellite retrieval; Deep learning; aerosol; anthropogenic source; emission control; global change; machine learning; optical depth; particle size; satellite data; seasonal variation; aerosol; Africa; air pollution control; article; Australia; China; deep learning; global change; government; human; human impact (environment); India; information retrieval; Mexico; optical depth; sea; Southeast Asia; spring; summer; winter; aerosol; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; season; Africa; Australia; China; India; Mexico [North America]; Southeast Asia; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Australia; China; Deep Learning; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; India; Mexico; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100008708

Here, based on the analysis of the spatio-temporal variation characteristics of PM2.5 concentration in Henan Province during 2015-2018, this paper combined the data of ten socio-economic indicators and adopted the principal component regression (PCR) analysis method to explore the influence of socio-economic activities on PM2.5 concentration. The results showed that the annual average concentration of PM2.5 during 2015-2018 ranged from 59.0 μg/m3 to 83.8 μg/m3, with a decreasing rate of -5.955 μg/(m3•a). Spatial distribution of PM2.5 showed ""high in the north and low in the south"", and the PM2.5 concentration in Anyang, Zhengzhou, Jiaozuo and Xinxiang were more than 75μg/m3, indicating a slightly polluted state. Among all the socio-economic indicators, gross domestic product (GDP), population density (PD), industrial value-added (IVA) and actual utilization of foreign capital (AUFC) played main positive roles in PM2.5 from 2015 to 2018 but with a diminishing trend, and afforestation area (AA) played a negative role in PM2.5. In addition, the effect of the sown area of major crops (SAMC) on PM2.5 was negative with enhanced before 2018 and reversed in 2018.

The inundation depth was calculated using a two-dimensional unsteady flow model. The flood damage cost was estimated from the unit evaluation value set for each land use and prefectures and the calculated inundation depth distribution. To estimate the flood damage in the near future and the late twenty-first century, five global climate models were used. These models provided daily precipitation, and the change of the extreme precipitation was calculated. In addition to the assessment of the impacts of climate change, certain adaptation measures (land-use control, piloti building, and improvement of flood control level) were discussed, and their effects on flood damage cost reduction were evaluated. In the case of the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario, the damage cost in the late twenty-first century will increase to 57% of that in the late twentieth century. However, if mitigation measures were to be undertaken according to RCP2.6 standards, the increase of the flood damage cost will stop, and the increase of the flood damage cost will be 28% of that in the late twentieth century. By implementing adaptation measures in combination rather than individually, it is possible to keep the damage cost in the future period even below that in the late twentieth century. By implementing both mitigation and adaptation measures, it is possible to reduce the flood damage cost in the late twenty-first century to 69% of that in the late twentieth century. © 2021, The Author(s).","Climate change impacts; Flood simulation; GCM; Global warming; Land-use control; Piloti building","Climate models; Cost reduction; Damage detection; Flood control; Flood damage; Land use; Precipitation (meteorology); Daily precipitations; Depth distribution; Emissions mitigation; Extreme precipitation; Global climate model; Mitigation measures; Multiple adaptation; Two dimensional unsteady flow; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; climate modeling; emission control; flood; flood control; flood damage; global climate; precipitation (climatology); Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104770474

The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of RT and routine endoscopic surveillance, hypothesizing that most patients are curable with RT alone. We queried a single institution database at a tertiary referral cancer center for patients with H pylori-independent GML treated with RT between 1991 and 2017. Response was assessed by follow-up endoscopies (EGDs) starting 10 to 12 weeks post-RT. Computed tomography scans were also part of the follow-up program, and positron emission tomography was added when clinically appropriate. We identified 178 patients (median age, 63 years; range, 25-89 years); 86% had stage I disease, 7% had stage II disease, and 7% had stage IV disease. Median RT dose was 3000 cGy over 20 fractions. Ninety-five percent of patients exhibited complete pathologic response on posttreatment EGD. Two patients experienced grade 3 toxicity, and 2 patients experienced in-field secondary malignancies. Over a median follow-up of 6.2 years, 9.6% experienced local failures, and 11.8% developed distant sites of disease. Five-year and 10-year overall survival were 94% and 79%, respectively, from last date of RT.

However, information on soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration potential is limited for AFSs. Furthermore, the impacts of AFSs established for the restoration of C in degraded soils (prone to soil erosion, C and nutrients loss, etc.) of Himalayas are rarely investigated. Thus, a study was conducted on an agroforestry block established in 1989 at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Research Complex for North Eastern Hill (NEH) Region, Lembucherra, Tripura, India. The AFSs comprised of four multipurpose tree species viz., teak (Tectona grandis Linn), sissoo (Dalbergia sissoo Roxb. Ex DC.), eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus L.), and neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) in combination with pineapple (Ananas comosus L. merr.). Planted in three times replicated randomized block design. After 28 years of establishment, the impacts of these AFSs were assessed on SOC stocks and its fraction pools. Results revealed that sissoo + pineapple system stored the highest SOC stocks in 0–15 cm (22.1 ± 1.4 Mg/ha) and 30–60 cm (18.0 ± 4.3 Mg/ha) depths, whereas the SOC stocks in 15–30 cm (12.2 ± 1.2 Mg/ha) and 0–30 cm (34.0 ± 1.6 Mg/ha) were the highest under teak + pineapple. When considering the entire 0–100 cm soil profile, the SOC stocks ranged between 65.3 and 71.6 Mg/ha across the diverse AFSs which was significantly higher than that under cultivated land (52.8 ± 2.6 Mg/ha). The sissoo + pineapple system had the highest SOC stock in 0–100 cm (71.6 ± 5.8 Mg/ha). The share of passive carbon (PC, less labile + non-labile) pools to SOC stocks under AFSs followed the order of sissoo + pineapple > teak + pineapple > neem + pineapple > eucalyptus + pineapple. The PC or recalcitrant pools of SOC stocks at 0–100 cm were 54.2–60.6% under various AFSs. Results revealed that the establishment of AFSs with pineapple on degraded lands increased a significant amount of C and had a considerable effect on soil quality in comparison to C present in soils under cropland. Thus, a large scale adoption of AFSs may restore C lost through the cultivation of the crop in degraded lands and provide a feasible option for livelihood through concurrent cultivation of multipurpose tree species and agri-horticulture crops. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agroforestry; Land restoration; Multipurpose trees; Pineapple; Soil carbon pool","agroforestry; Article; Azadirachta indica; bulk density; carbon dynamics; climate change; cropland; cultivated land; Dalbergia sissoo; Eucalyptus globulus; India; pineapple; soil quality; Tectona grandis; agriculture; carbon sequestration; soil; Ananas comosus; Azadirachta indica; Dalbergia sissoo; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus globulus; Matthiola; Tectona grandis; carbon; Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; India; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099609503

Establishing GHG emission inventories for IPs is essential to generate low-carbon strategies. Taking 11 IPs in Central China as objects, this study established GHG inventories including direct and indirect emissions, exploring the characteristics from the point of view of energy types and industrial sectors. We then adopted cluster analysis to classify these IPs into “3Hs”, “3Ls” and “Mixed” parks, and subsequently chose representative IPs for case study. The results show that total CO2 emissions of the parks in 2017 were 14.47 Mt. Coal combustion from energy types and energy-intensive industries from industrial sectors were the dominant emission sources, both accounting for 80% of the total emission in 11 IPs. Reducing power export and using renewable energy are crucial to mitigate GHG emission in the IPs including large-scale thermal power plants. Cluster analysis reveals that “3Hs” and “Mixed” parks should be put in a high priority in GHG mitigation, focusing on energy-intensive industries transformation and energy structure adjustment. This study is helpful to understand GHG emission characteristics of IPs in Central China and promotes the proposal and implementation of GHG emission reduction strategies in IPs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Central China; Cluster analysis; Emission inventory; GHG mitigation; Industrial park","Cluster analysis; Coal combustion; Coal industry; Emission control; Thermoelectric power plants; Emission inventories; Energy intensive industries; Energy structure adjustments; GHG emission reduction strategies; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Low-carbon strategies; Renewable energies; Thermal power plants; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cluster analysis; emission control; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; industrial district; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101412760

However, reduction of their relatively high emission intensity can be a key to mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the agrifood sector. Using the European Union (EU) and its 28 member states as example, we mapped the mass flow and analyzed the efficiency of the entire tomato supply chain from farm to fork for the year 2016. We then explored potentials of a full spectrum of GHG emission mitigation strategies ranging from production-efficiency improvement to process optimization, food-waste reduction, trade-pattern change, and diet-structure change, both individually and in an integrated framework. The results showed that 63% of tomato loss and waste occurred at the processing and consumption stages (over half in Italy and Spain), and 54% of GHG emissions were from production (notably greenhouse based). Although the reduction of tomato products consumption (considered as the substitution by other vegetables) presented the highest potential of emissions reduction, reducing retailing and consumption waste were found to have great effect on GHG emissions reduction as well for all EU member states, especially for United Kingdom and Germany. The combined effects of different mitigation strategies with high levels of change could reduce GHG emissions by 39% compared to the current level. © 2020 by Yale University","energy efficiency; food waste; greenhouse gas emission mitigation; material flow analysis; resource efficiency; tomato supply chain","Efficiency; Emission control; Food waste; Fruits; Gas emissions; Optimization; Supply chains; Vegetables; Agrifood sectors; Emissions reduction; Ghg emission mitigations; High emission intensity; Integrated frameworks; Mitigation strategy; Production efficiency; Structure change; Greenhouse gases; agroindustry; crop plant; emission control; European Union; greenhouse gas; strategic approach; Germany; Italy; Spain; United Kingdom; Lycopersicon esculentum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092759526

The discrete material and thickness optimization (DMTO) method is adopted to parameterize the design variables of thickness and orientation of CFRP composites, which is driven by the Method of Moving Asymptote (MMA) algorithm. A large number of local constraints associated with the failure criteria are aggregated in terms of a p-norm function. Analytical sensitivities are derived with respect to the design variables. In this study, a battery hanging structure in electrical vehicle (EV) is exemplified; and a DMTO based design is prototyped and validated through the in-house experimental tests first. To prevent different failure modes, the Hashin, Hoffman and Tsai-Wu failure criteria are then imposed as the design constraints together with manufacturing requirements in the optimization. A comparative study is performed for the design with and without such failure criteria. The results demonstrate that the maximum failure index of the optimized structure with the Tsai-Wu failure criterion decreases the most by 40%; and follows by the Hashin and Hoffman criteria by 24% and 33%, respectively. Finally, the CFRP structure is also optimized to design a so-called double-double laminates for demonstrating the generality of the proposed method.

As a result, the government and researchers have gradually begun to attach great importance to the industrialization of low-carbon and energy-saving buildings. The rise of prefabricated buildings has promoted a major transformation of the construction methods in the construction industry, which is conducive to reducing the consumption of resources and energy, and of great significance in promoting the lowcarbon emission reduction of industrial buildings. This article mainly studies the calculation model for carbon emissions of the three-stage life cycle of component production, logistics transportation, and on-site installation in the whole construction process of composite beams for prefabricated buildings. The construction of CG-2 composite beams in Fujian province, China, was taken as the example. Based on the life cycle assessment method, carbon emissions from the actual construction process of composite beams were evaluated, and that generated by the composite beam components during the transportation stage by using diesel, gasoline, and electric energy consumption methods were compared in detail. The results show that (1) the carbon emissions generated by composite beams during the production stage were relatively high, accounting for 80.8% of the total carbon emissions, while during the transport stage and installation stage, they only accounted for 7.6% and 11.6%, respectively; and (2) during the transportation stage with three different energy-consuming trucks, the carbon emissions from diesel fuel trucks were higher, reaching 186.05 kg, followed by gasoline trucks, which generated about 115.68 kg; electric trucks produced the lowest, only 12.24 kg. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we conducted an in situ 15N tracing experiment to assess the source of N2O emissions and fate of fertilizer-N in soil intensively farmed with summer maize (Zea mays L.). Four treatments, i.e., no N fertilization and no straw incorporation (N0S0), straw incorporation only (N0S1), N fertilization only (N1S0), and N fertilization plus straw incorporation (N1S1), were established in the study. Compared with straw removal, straw incorporation increased the seasonal N2O emissions by 22.3% but reduced the N2O emissions per unit of applied N by 6.22% (P &gt; 0.05). The emission of fertilizer-derived N2O occurred mainly in the 13–17 days after fertilization; thereafter, the ratio of fertilizer-derived N2O fluxes would be less than 5%. N fertilization significantly stimulated non-fertilizer-derived N2O emissions and soil CO2 fluxes, especially when straw was incorporated (P &lt; 0.05), indicating that N fertilization might have triggered the mineralization of straw-N and/or native soil organic N. The soil NO3−-N concentration in straw-incorporated plots tended to be lower than that in straw-removed plots, especially after N fertilization events. Straw incorporation sequestered 52.5% (27.4 kg N ha−1) more fertilizer-N in 1 m of soil than straw removal (P &lt; 0.05) while significantly increasing the fertilizer-N harvest index and maintaining grain yield. Overall, compared with straw removal, straw incorporation significantly reduced total fertilizer-N losses (by 12.8%, i.e., 14.58 kg N ha−1; P &lt; 0.05).

Moreover, the use of coal significantly increases SO2 emissions while the use of natural gas significantly reduces them.

The country has realized that its economic development has to be free from dependence on fossil fuels. On 30 June 2015, China submitted its 'Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)' in preparation for the Conference of Parties 21 (COP21). One of the important actions in China's NDC is to lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per unit of GDP by 60% to 65% from 2005 levels by 2030. This study examines the efforts from China's building sector (i.e. urban residential, rural residential and service) in achieving the CO2 reduction target stated in China's NDC. Furthermore, this study also explores the post-NDC era and looks into the opportunities towards deep decarbonization in the building sector by mid-century for contributing to the Paris agreement. The study covers 31 provincial regions of mainland China anddisparities of climate and socioeconomic indicators across regions are fully considered. We use a bottom-up cost optimization model called AIM/Enduse to evaluate the CO2 reduction potential brought by efficient technologies in China's building sector. Five scenarios are designed to illustrate the emission pathways through 2050. The results show that, when energy constraint and emission target is introduced in mitigation scenarios, new generation biomass contribute a lot to emission reduction. Reduction potential in the nearly zero emission scenario is mainly from the urban residential sector, and to achieve deep decarbonization by 2050, it is important to bring a significant reduction of per-capita energy consumption in addition to ci improvement both in urban and rural households. Co-benefit analysis suggests that air pollutants can also be significantly reduced by deep decarbonization policies. © 2021 The Author(s).

With the fast development of China's economy, most cities are faced with the pressure of ecological environment to varying degrees. The construction of ecological city is not only the need of ecological protection and improvement of natural environment, but also the requirement of urban development. Compared with coal-fired power generation, natural gas power generation has advantages in terms of environmental pollution, energy utilization efficiency and resource occupancy, and is one of the ideal energy sources for eco-city construction. However, at present, there are constraints such as lack of subsidy policy, high fuel price, dependence on import of equipment and high cost of construction and maintenance. In the long run, the development of gas-fired power generation industry should be actively and prudently promoted from the aspects of strengthening the construction of supporting facilities and the guarantee of gas source, perfecting the mechanism of electricity price, and increasing the localization rate of key equipment, so as to achieve the goal of optimizing industrial structure, saving energy and reducing emissions, and facilitating the construction of China's ecological city. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.",,"Coal deposits; Coal industry; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Industrial emissions; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Urban growth; Coal-fired power generation; Eco-city construction; Ecological environments; Energy utilization efficiency; Environmental pollutions; Industrial structures; Natural gas power generations; Power generation industries; Construction equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104458150

However, the quantitative effects on energy consumption and emissions reduction remains poorly understood due to the unavailability of local life cycle inventory. Therefore, its LCI needs to be built by accounting for the properties of BOF aggregate in terms of high porosity and dust content in BOF, the rainy interference condition that reducing efficiency in production, and transportation distance. Here we investigated the life cycle energy consumption and global warming potential (CO2-eq emission) of asphalt pavement incorporating BOF aggregate by performing a case study with uncertainty analysis. Five scenarios were elaborated and performed in the case study. The results show that the energy required for BOF production is 0.024 MJ/kg, approximately half the energy required for crushed stone of 0.044 MJ/kg. The pavements with BOF can reduce up to 12% of emission compared to ordinary pavement. Considerably more negative impacts of rainy weather on energy consumption of BOF than natural crushed stone can be concluded. Monte Carlo simulation indicates that the order of magnitudes of the energy values were varied, from materials extraction as the maximum contributor to transportation. The benefits for BOF utilization are gradually offset by increased transport distances and the displacement ratios of fine crushed stones, due to the increase in fuel and resource consumption for mixing, construction, and transportation. © 2021 by the authors.

Change in the annual occurrence frequency of landfalling and non-landfalling weak, strong, and super TCs during 1980-2018 was analyzed. Results indicate that the super TCs have been more likely to make landfall in the northwest Pacific since 1980. Using an empirical orthogonal function-based method proposed to decompose the space-time field of TC occurrence into different patterns, the anthropogenic influence on the change in super TC occurrence was detected when the impacts of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific meridional mode (PMM), and the interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO) were separated. Results further show that TCs forming in the sea surface near land (6°21°N, 130°-137°E) have been more likely to intensify to super TCs in recent years. These intensified TCs tend to favor subsequent landfall, which may be the reason for the increase in landfalling super TCs. The intensification of TC is mainly due to the increase in the intensification rate, which increases with increased sea surface temperature (SST), especially during the stronger wind periods. Along with the change in the occurrence of landfalling super TCs, the landfalling locations of super TCs also changed. For example, western South China, Southeast China, and Japan are facing an increase in landfalling super TCs. The destructiveness of super TCs to these economically developed and highly populated regions is great; more attention therefore should be paid to mitigate TC disasters. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.","Annual variations; Climate change; Cyclogenesis/cyclolysis; Hurricanes; North Pacific Ocean; Tropical cyclones","Atmospheric pressure; Disasters; Hurricanes; Oceanography; Orthogonal functions; Surface waters; Tropics; Anthropogenic influence; Climate change adaptation; Disaster mitigation; Empirical Orthogonal Function; Inter-decadal pacific oscillations; Landfalling tropical cyclones; Sea surface temperature (SST); Southern oscillation; Climate change; annual variation; climate change; cyclogenesis; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; frequency analysis; hurricane event; sea surface temperature; tropical cyclone event; China; Japan; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Northwest)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104375265

Compared with adjustable mode, auto mode's advantage of reducing indoor PM2.5 has been previously demonstrated. This study examines the energy consumption of such PACs in six residences recruited in Seattle, United States, and compares the power consumption between auto and adjustable modes. Each residence went through a one-week-long PAC filtration session under auto and adjustable modes, respectively. PAC power consumption, indoor PM2.5, temperature, and relative humidity (RH) were measured at 10-second intervals in each residence. A linear mixed-effects regression (LMER) model was used to compare the PAC power consumption between the two modes after adjusting for indoor PM2.5, temperature, and RH. Results show that the mean (standard deviation) PAC power consumption under adjustable and auto modes were 7.0 (3.5) and 6.8 (2.6) W, respectively. The average monthly energy consumption of continuous PAC operation was estimated to be ∼5 kWh for both modes. Based on the LEMR model, PAC power consumption under auto mode was approximately 3% larger than that under adjustable mode, after adjusting for living-room PM2.5, temperature, and RH levels.

The empirical study concludes: 1○ Fiscal decentralization, both within the region and in its neighborhood, will contribute to carbon emissions in the region; 2○ Environmental decentralization will help reduce carbon emissions, while environmental decentralization in neighboring regions will increase carbon emissions in the region; 3○ The promotion pressure of officials plays a positive role in moderating the impact of fiscal decentralization on carbon emissions, and at the same time weakens the suppression of carbon emissions by environmental decentralization; 4○ From a regional point of view, there is a positive relationship between fiscal decentralization and carbon emissions in various regions; but environmental decentralization has obvious spatial heterogeneity.

Despite its rich possession of pristine biodiversity, manufacture industry contributes 3% of the total provincial income. This study aims to predict the GRDP if West Papua incorporates Eco-Industrial Development (EID) to mitigate emissions from the industrial sector and its shares to the local community's economy and the global economy. System dynamic modelling was employed to simulate and project the scenarios. The results show that the GRDP projection under the BAU scenario will rise from about 1,200 billion IDR in 2010 to 2,500 billion IDR in 2030, in parallel with the gradual increase of GHGs emission to 72,000 tonCO2e. The intervention scenario shows that the emissions will reach 57,000 tonCO2e and the economic contraction to 2,000 billion IDR by 2030. Considering the intermediate input, the added benefit for local communities in 2030 could fall from 840 billion IDR to 670 billion IDR in the intervention scenario. The contribution to the outer region's economy could decrease from 230 to 180 billion IDR. Besides the benefit of EID to reduce emissions, the government should also consider the impact of economic contraction. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Biodiversity; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Planning; Sustainable development; Eco-industrial development; GHGs emissions; Global economies; Industrial sector; Intermediate inputs; Local community; Manufacture industry; System dynamic modelling; Industrial economics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104172612

Meanwhile, communities in Batutegi are also suggesting that effects of climate change are becoming more prominent in their region. Indicators include rising air temperature and the increasing regularity of extreme weather changes. Studies show that land cover has decreased by up to 95% in the region. As these trends intensify, predictions note that the Batutegi reservoir and the productivity of the surrounding protected forests will be affected. This research examines FMU efforts to adapt to vulnerabilities from environmental and climate change. The broader objective of this research is to determine the appropriate climate change adaptation efforts, specifically regarding the management of sustainable forest protection. The method is conducted through regression analysis to identify significant variables and applies the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to identify priorities for planned interventions for climate change adaptation by the FMU. Based on regression results there were four significant variables, i.e. appropriate agroforestry initiatives, non-timber forest products, community institutional support, and local policy engagement. This research also considers various kinds of technologies of adaptation applied by local communities. Examining community efforts also presents possibilities for improving FMU institutional planning that is locally responsive. This is done primarily through agroforestry techniques and other community conservation practices. Based on the result of the AHP analysis, the findings highlight various programs related to agroforestry technologies as the top priority. Thereafter, priorities point to institutional development policies. Together, these priorities can form the basic considerations for developing climate change adaptation policies in Batutegi. These policies can be applied with, and by communities in managing forests through agroforestry, beginning with support for high quality seed procurement that also supports all phases of cultivation and supply chain through final product marketing. As a result, forest productivity and support for local income can form a robust approach for fulfilling community needs despite the effects of environmental and climate change in Batutegi. © 2021 by Forest and Society.","Agroforestry; Climate Change; Community Institutions; Forest Policy","adaptive management; agroforestry; climate change; environmental change; forest management; forestry policy; vulnerability; Indonesia; Lampung",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102309094

Regulating the regional climate is one of the most important ecosystem services of natural wetlands. However, the impact of wetlands on local temperature on the global scale and the attribution is still unclear. This study utilizes the satellite-based products (land surface temperature (LST), albedo, and evapotranspiration (ET)) to evaluate the difference in LST between wetlands and their adjacent landcover types and the possible drivers. Here we show that on average for the whole year, wetlands have a cooling effect in tropical regions, but have a warming effect in boreal regions. The impacts of wetlands on LST show great seasonality in the boreal regions; i.e., the wetlands have a warming effect in winter but a cooling effect in summer. The difference in albedo and ET between wetlands and the other landcover types only interprets 30% of temporal variation of the difference in LST. Due to the large water storage in wetlands, the ground heat flux (G) may interpret the rest of the impact, absorbing energy in summer and releasing energy in winter in wetlands, which has often been neglected in previous studies. Our results indicate that it is critical to comprehensively consider the effects of wetland restoration in different regions to realize potential climatic benefits in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

However, their potential is undermined by the scarcity of fully coupled idealized models with components comparable to contemporary, comprehensive Earth System Models. To fill this gap, we compare and contrast the climates of two idealized planets which build on the Simpler Models initiative of the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Using the fully coupled CESM, the Aqua configuration is ocean-covered except for two polar land caps, and the Ridge configuration has an additional pole-to-pole grid-cell-wide continent. Contrary to most sea surface temperature profiles assumed for atmosphere-only aquaplanet experiments with the thermal maximum on the equator, the coupled Aqua configuration is characterized by a global cold belt of wind-driven equatorial upwelling, analogous to the eastern Pacific cold tongue. The presence of the meridional boundary on Ridge introduces zonal asymmetry in thermal and circulation features, similar to the contrast between western and eastern Pacific. This zonal asymmetry leads to a distinct climate state from Aqua, cooled by ∼2°C via the radiative feedback of clouds and water vapor. The meridional boundary of Ridge is also crucial for producing a more Earth-like climate state compared to Aqua, including features of atmospheric and ocean circulation, the seasonal cycle of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and the meridional heat transport. The mean climates of these two basic configurations provide a baseline for exploring other idealized ocean geometries, and their application for investigating various features and scale interactions in the coupled climate system. © 2021.

Biomass can vary greatly at the ecological transition zone between grass dominated savannahs and the forest. It is not well understood if the transition zone could expand under climate change, and thereby reduce ecosystem stability and carbon storage in biomass. Here, we quantify such changes by using a high-resolution regional Earth system model under RCP 8.5 climate scenario. We disentangle the effects of climate, CO2, and land use by considering vegetation-climate feedbacks. Our results suggest that future climate change combined with elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration tends to induce a larger spatial gradient of ecosystem states, increasing the transition area by ∼110% at the end of the century. Vegetation feedbacks generally amplify the climate effect by intensifying the climate-induced warming and drought, further enhancing spatial heterogeneity. © 2021.

However, conventional processes were generally stuck with limited hydrolysis and poor pathogen destruction. Hyperthermophilic digestion at 70 °C has drawn attention in overcoming those issues at a relatively low energy requirement and operating difficulties. In order to illuminate its operation characteristics, a single-stage hyperthermophilic digester was controlled at 70 °C and operated continuously to degrade WAS. 88.7 mL/g VSadded of methane yield could be achieved in the hyperthermophilic system, fourfold higher than that in the mesophilic system. Kinetic analysis revealed that hyperthermophilic digestion was advantageous in converting the non-degradable fraction. Consequently, hydrolysis under the hyperthermophilic condition was able to be significantly improved. Above 10 d was necessary for the hyperthermophilic system to gain such a high methane production. In the case of stability, the organic loading of higher than 10.2 g VS/L/d resulted in increasing limitation from methanogenesis and accumulation of propionic, butyric and valeric acids. In addition to the dominant acetoclastic genus Methanothrix for methane production in the hyperthermophilic system, two hydrogenotrophic methanogens Methanospirillum and Methanothermobacter reached 18.84% and 8.31%, respectively. The genus Coprothermobacter, affiliated with the phylum Firmicutes, made more contribution to protein hydrolysis in the hyperthermophilic digester. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Hyperthermophilic; Kinetic; Methanogenesis; Microbial community","Anaerobic digestion; Butyric acid; Hydrolysis; Kinetics; Methane; Propionic acid; Saturated fatty acids; Sludge digestion; Anaerobics; Energy requirements; Hyperthermophilic; Lower energies; Methane production; Methanogenesis; Microbial communities; Microbial community analysis; Performance stability; Waste activated sludges; Microorganisms; ammonia; butyric acid; propionic acid; valeric acid; methane; activated sludge; anaerobic digestion; methanogenesis; microbial community; performance assessment; reaction kinetics; stability analysis; temperature effect; thermophilic bacterium; activated sludge; alkalinity; anaerobic digestion; Article; bioaccumulation; biomass; chemical reaction kinetics; controlled study; Coprothermobacter; Firmicutes; hyperthermophilic methanogenesis; methanogenesis; Methanospirillum; Methanothermobacter; Methanothrix; microbial community; microorganism; molecular stability; nonhuman; performance; pH measurement; protein hydrolysis; temperature measurement; thermodynamics; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; kinetics; microflora; sewage; Coprothermobacter; Firmicutes; Methanosaeta; Methanospirillum; Methanothermobacter; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Kinetics; Methane; Microbiota; Sewage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102037754

There is uncertainty about whether increasing fire frequency will lead to decreased carbon pools due to shorter inter-fire recovery periods, or increased carbon pools due to lowered fire intensity due to lighter fuel loads. Additionally, data are needed to determine whether plant and soil carbon pools respond similarly and whether ecosystem responses are consistent across environmental gradients that can affect fire intensity, such as soil moisture. We measured soil and vegetation carbon pools and fluxes at sites that had experienced different experimental burn treatments over the previous 8 years and across a range of soil moisture in a longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem in North Carolina, USA. We found that increasing fire frequency, assessed by either the number of days since a previous fire or the number of fires a plot had experienced over the previous 8 years, significantly reduced carbon stocks in the litter pool and soil carbon pool and reduced the productivity of understory plants. Total carbon stocks also significantly declined, and there was a marginally significant shift away from soil carbon and toward tree carbon as being the dominant carbon pool in the system with increasing fire.

Because the incidence of wildfires is unpredictable, quantifying wildfire effects is challenging due to the lack of prefire data or controls from experiments over a large landscape. We explored a quasi-experimental method, propensity score matching, to estimate wildfire effects on aboveground forest woody carbon mass in Washington and Oregon, United States. Observational data, including national forest inventory plot measurements and satellite imagery metrics, were utilized to obtain a control set of unburned plots that are comparable to burned plots in terms of environmental conditions as well as spatial locations. Three matching methods were implemented: propensity score matching (PSM), spatial matching (SM), and distance-adjusted propensity score matching (DAPSM). We investigated if propensity score matching with and without spatial adjustment led to different outcomes in terms of (1) balance in covariate distributions between burned and control plots, (2) mean carbon mass obtained from the selected control plots compared to burned and all unburned plots, and (3) estimates of wildfire effects by burn severity. We found that PSM and SM, which use only the environmental covariate set or the spatial distance for estimating propensity scores, respectively, did not appear to produce a comparable set of control plots in terms of the estimated propensity scores and the outcomes of mean carbon mass. DAPSM was the preferred method both in balancing the observed covariates and in dealing with unobservable confounding variables through spatial adjustment. The average wildfire effects estimated by DAPSM showed clear evidence of redistribution of carbon among aboveground woody pools, from live to dead trees, but the consumption of total woody carbon by wildfire was not substantial. Only moderate burn severity led to significant reduction of total woody carbon mass across Washington and Oregon forests (64% of control plots remained on average). This study provides an applied example of a quasi-experimental approach to quantify the effects of a natural disturbance for which experimental settings are unavailable. The study results suggest that incorporating spatial information in addition to environmental covariates would yield a comparable set of control plots for wildfire effects quantification. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America","burn severity; cause-and-effect estimation; distance adjustment; forest inventory data; forest woody carbon; observational study; propensity score; quasi-experiment; unobservable confounding variable","aboveground biomass; carbon cycle; environmental conditions; estimation method; experimental study; forest inventory; satellite imagery; spatial analysis; wildfire; Oregon; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Northwest); United States; Washington [United States]; carbon; fire; forest; Oregon; tree; United States; Washington; wildfire; Carbon; Fires; Forests; Oregon; Trees; United States; Washington; Wildfires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100703272

Sacco”, University of Milan, Milan, 20157, Italy","Epidemiological and experimental studies have revealed the effects of the room temperature, indoor air humidity, and ventilation on human health, work and cognitive performance, and risk of infection. In this overview, we integrate the influence of these important microclimatic parameters and assess their influence in offices based on literature searches. The dose-effect curves of the temperature describe a concave shape. Low temperature increases the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and elevated temperature increases the risk of acute non-specific symptoms, e.g., dry eyes, and respiratory symptoms. Cognitive and work performance is optimal between 22 °C and 24 °C for regions with temperate or cold climate, but both higher and lower temperatures may deteriorate the performances and learning efficiency. Low temperature may favor virus viability, however, depending on the status of the physiological tissue in the airways. Low indoor air humidity causes vulnerable eyes and airways from desiccation and less efficient mucociliary clearance. This causes elevation of the most common mucous membrane-related symptoms, like dry and tired eyes, which deteriorates the work performance. Epidemiological, experimental, and clinical studies support that intervention of dry indoor air conditions by humidification alleviates symptoms of dry eyes and airways, fatigue symptoms, less complaints about perceived dry air, and less compromised work performance. Intervention of dry air conditions by elevation of the indoor air humidity may be a non-pharmaceutical treatment of the risk of infection by reduced viability and transport of influenza virus. Relative humidity between 40 and 60% appears optimal for health, work performance, and lower risk of infection. Ventilation can reduce both acute and chronic health outcomes and improve work performance, because the exposure is reduced by the dilution of the indoor air pollutants (including pathogens, e.g., as virus droplets), and in addition to general emission source control strategies. Personal control of ventilation appears an important factor that influences the satisfaction of the thermal comfort due to its physical and positive psychological impact. However, natural ventilation or mechanical ventilation can become sources of air pollutants, allergens, and pathogens of outdoor or indoor origin and cause an increase in exposure. The “health-based ventilation rate” in a building should meet WHO's air quality guidelines and dilute human bio-effluent emissions to reach an acceptable perceived indoor air quality. Ventilation is a modifying factor that should be integrated with both the indoor air humidity and the room temperature in a strategic joint control to satisfy the perceived indoor air quality, health, working performance, and minimize the risk of infection. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Health; Indoor air humidity; Infection; Temperature; Ventilation; Work performance","air conditioning; human; humidity; indoor air pollution; job performance; temperature; Air Pollution, Indoor; Humans; Humidity; Temperature; Ventilation; Work Performance",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101010694

It is well known that nitrogen (N) could limit plants' response to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide and it is therefore important to include a representation of the N cycle in Earth system models. Here we present the implementation of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle in the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES)-the land surface scheme of the UK Earth System Model (UKESM). Two configurations are discussed-the first one (JULES-CN) has a bulk soil biogeochemical model and the second one is a development configuration that resolves the soil biogeochemistry with depth (JULES-CN<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">layer</span>). In JULES the nitrogen (N) cycle is based on the existing carbon (C) cycle and represents all the key terrestrial N processes in a parsimonious way. Biological N fixation is dependent on net primary productivity, and N deposition is specified as an external input. Nitrogen leaves the vegetation and soil system via leaching and a bulk gas loss term. Nutrient limitation reduces carbon-use efficiency (CUE-ratio of net to gross primary productivity) and can slow soil decomposition. We show that ecosystem level N limitation of net primary productivity (quantified in the model by the ratio of the potential amount of C that can be allocated to growth and spreading of the vegetation compared with the actual amount achieved in its natural state) falls at the lower end of the observational estimates in forests (approximately 1.0 in the model compared with 1.01 to 1.38 in the observations). The model shows more N limitation in the tropical savanna and tundra biomes, consistent with the available observations. Simulated C and N pools and fluxes are comparable to the limited available observations and model-derived estimates. The introduction of an N cycle improves the representation of interannual variability of global net ecosystem exchange, which was more pronounced in the C-cycle-only versions of JULES (JULES-C) than shown in estimates from the Global Carbon Project. It also reduces the present-day CUE from a global mean value of 0.45 for JULES-C to 0.41 for JULES-CN and 0.40 for JULES-CNlayer, all of which fall within the observational range. The N cycle also alters the response of the C fluxes over the 20th century and limits the CO2 fertilisation effect, such that the simulated current-day land C sink is reduced by about 0.5 Pg C yr-1 compared to the version with no N limitation. JULES-CNlayer additionally improves the representation of soil biogeochemistry, includ ing turnover times in the northern high latitudes. The inclu sion of a prognostic land N scheme marks a step forward in functionality and realism for the JULES and UKESM mod els. © Author(s) 2021.

Widespread grassland degradation reduces the resilience and returns to herding livelihoods. Reversing degradation and conserving grasslands could not only improve herders’ situation, but also make a huge contribution to mitigating climate change by sequestering carbon in soils. However, the means for reaching each of these objectives are not necessarily the same. To realize this potentially huge dual livelihood/climate change mitigation outcome from improved grassland management, it is necessary to have detailed understanding of the processes involved in securing better livelihoods and sequestering carbon. Based on household surveys on the Tibetan Plateau and modeling results, this study estimates economic and market costs of grassland carbon sequestration, and analyzes the implications of household and carbon project cash flows for the design of financing options. Five scenarios are modeled involving cultivation of grass on severely degraded grassland (all scenarios) and reduced grazing intensity on less degraded land, which requires destocking by 29, 38, 47, 56, and 65% in each scenario). Modeling results suggest that economic benefits for herders are positive at low levels of destocking, and negative at high levels of destocking, but initial investments and opportunity costs are significant barriers to adoption for households in all destocking scenarios. Existing rural finance products are not suitable for herders to finance the necessary investments. Market costs–the cost at which transactions between herders and carbon project developers are feasible–depend on the scale of project implementation but are high compared to recent carbon market prices. Large initial investments increase project developers’ financing costs and risk, so co-financing of initial investments by government would be necessary. Therefore, public policies to support grassland carbon sequestration should consider the potential roles of a range of financial instruments. © Copyright © 2021 Wilkes, Wang, Lipper and Chang.","carbon offsets; China; grassland; investment cost; opportunity cost; soil carbon (C) sequestration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105594774

Methods: During and after inhalations of 17O2 gas, dynamic 17O MRSI was performed in rats (n = 8) ventilated with N2O or N2 at 16.4 T. Time courses of the H217O concentration from regions of interest located in brain and muscle tissue were examined and used to fit an animal-adapted 3-phase metabolic model of oxygen consumption. CBF was determined with an independent washout method. Finally, body oxygen metabolic rate was calculated using a global steady-state approach. Results: Cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption was 1.97 ± 0.19 μmol/g/min on average. The resting metabolic rate of oxygen consumption in skeletal muscle was 0.32 ± 0.12 μmol/g/min and &gt;6 times lower than cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption. Global oxygen consumed by the body was 24.2 ± 3.6 mL O2/kg body weight/min. CBF was estimated to be 0.28 ± 0.02 mL/g/min and 0.34 ± 0.06 mL/g/min for the N2 and N2O ventilation condition, respectively. Conclusion: We have evaluated the feasibility of 17O MRSI for imaging and quantifying the oxygen consumption rate in low metabolizing organs such as the skeletal muscle at rest. Additionally, we have shown that CBF is slightly increased in the case of ventilation with N2O. We expect this study to be beneficial to the application of 17O MRSI to a wider range of organs, although further validation is advised. © 2020 The Authors.

Organic matter (OM) additions to soils can affect the rate at which SOC is mineralized by microbes, with potentially important effects on SOC stocks. Understanding how pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) affects the cycling of native SOC (nSOC) and the soil microbes responsible for these effects is important for fire-affected ecosystems as well as for biochar-amended systems. We used an incubation trial with five different soils from National Ecological Observatory Network sites across the United States and 13C-labeled 350°C corn stover PyOM and fresh corn stover OM to trace nSOC-derived CO2 emissions with and without PyOM and OM amendments. We used high-throughput sequencing of rRNA genes to characterize bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities and their responses to PyOM and OM in soils that were previously stored at 280°C. We found that the effects of amendments on nSOC-derived CO2 reflected the unamended soil C status, where relative increases in C mineralization were greatest in low-C soils. OM additions produced much greater effects on nSOC-CO2 emissions than PyOM additions. Furthermore, the magnitude of the microbial community composition change mirrored the magnitude of increases in nSOC-CO2, indicating that a specific subset of microbes was likely responsible for the observed changes in nSOC mineralization. However, PyOM responders differed across soils and did not necessarily reflect a common “charosphere.” Overall, this study suggests that soils that already have low SOC may be particularly vulnerable to short-term increases in SOC loss with OM or PyOM additions. IMPORTANCE Soil organic matter (SOM) has an important role in global climate change, carbon and nutrient cycling in soils, and soil moisture dynamics. Understanding the processes that affect SOM stocks is important for managing these functions. Recently, understanding how fire-affected organic matter (or “pyrogenic” organic matter [PyOM]) affects existing SOM stocks has become increasingly important, due to both changing fire regimes and interest in “biochar,” pyrogenic organic matter that is produced intentionally for carbon management or as an agricultural soil amendment. We found that soils with less SOM were more prone to increased losses with PyOM (and fresh organic matter) additions and that soil microbial communities changed more in soils that also had greater SOM losses with PyOM additions. This suggests that soils that already have low SOM content may be particularly vulnerable to short-term increases in SOM loss and that a subset of the soil microbial community is likely responsible for these effects. © 2021 Whitman et al.

Yet little is known about their influences on the transformation of phosphorus (P) fractions in composting. This study investigated the quantitative and qualitative changes in different P forms during composting with adding biochar or woody peat using sequential extraction and P K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES). The results showed that compost products from the treatment with adding woody peat had a higher HA/FA (the ratio of humic acid to fulvic acid) compared to biochar treatment and the control, suggesting that the addition of woody peat might benefit the humification process of composting. Sequential extraction and XANES illustrated that adding biochar or woody peat limited the P availability. Biochar increased the proportion of Pi and woody peat decreased the conversion from Po to Pi compared to the control. Structural equation modeling and redundancy analysis suggested that biochar improved the refractory P based on the indirect effects of NH4+-N by regulating microbial community, while woody peat was beneficial for Po accumulation by affecting humic acid. Taken together, this research provides basis for regulating the nutrient level of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in composts and reducing environmental risks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Charcoal-based material; Composting; Phosphorus availability; Sequential extraction; XANES","Biochemistry; Carbon; Composting; Extraction; Nitrogen; Organic acids; Phosphorus; Positive ions; X ray absorption; X ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy; Carbon and nitrogen; Environmental risks; Humification process; Microbial communities; Redundancy analysis; Sequential extraction; Structural equation modeling; X-ray absorption near-edge structure; Peat; aluminum; ammonia; biochar; calcium; carbon; fulvic acid; humic acid; iron; magnesium; nitrogen; peat; phosphorus; unclassified drug; biochar; charcoal; nitrogen; phosphorus; bioavailability; biochar; composting; environmental risk; peat; phosphorus cycle; sequential extraction; XANES spectroscopy; Article; bioaccumulation; bioavailability; composting; controlled study; electric conductivity; extraction; humification; microbial community; nutrient; pH; priority journal; redundancy analysis; sequential extraction; structural equation modeling; temperature; total organic carbon; X ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy; zeta potential; bioavailability; manure; soil; Biological Availability; Charcoal; Composting; Manure; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092794618

As such, attempts to emulate them using machine learning should reflect this. While the use of machine learning to emulate weather forecast models is a relatively new endeavour, there is a rich history of climate model emulation. This is primarily because while weather modelling is an initial condition problem, which intimately depends on the current state of the atmosphere, climate modelling is predominantly a boundary condition problem. To emulate the response of the climate to different drivers therefore, representation of the full dynamical evolution of the atmosphere is neither necessary, or in many cases, desirable. Climate scientists are typically interested in different questions also. Indeed emulating the steady-state climate response has been possible for many years and provides significant speed increases that allow solving inverse problems for e.g. parameter estimation. Nevertheless, the large datasets, non-linear relationships and limited training data make climate a domain which is rich in interesting machine learning challenges. Here, I seek to set out the current state of climate model emulation and demonstrate how, despite some challenges, recent advances in machine learning provide new opportunities for creating useful statistical models of the climate.

The adoption of an organic farming system on a large scale can reduce the use of chemicals in factory production. Therefore, in the long term, it can reduce the operation of chemical factories and reduce carbon emissions. However, the organic system cannot be applied extensively to Indonesian rice farmers. The complexity of the system, certification, the initial decrease in production, and higher cost allocation leads farmers to think that the organic system is not making an impact on their income and welfare. This study aims to determine the farming income, household income, and household welfare of organic and non-organic rice farmers in the Sambirejo sub-district. It uses a descriptive method, and the respondents were determined by the proportional random sampling method. The results show that the organic rice farming income and household income are higher than their non-organic equivalents. There is a very small difference in the price of organic and non-organic rice of only IDR 855.00/kg, so it is understandable that many non-organic farmers are reluctant to switch to the organic system. Based on the comparative test of the Rice Farmer Exchange Rate, the welfare of organic rice farmers is higher than non-organic ones, whereas, based on Food Expenditure Share, the welfare of organic rice farmers is not significantly different to their non-organic compatriots. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agriculture; Carbon; Chemical industry; Climate change; Carbon emissions; Chemical factory; Comparative tests; Cost allocation; Household income; Organic farming system; Organic systems; Random sampling method; Organic chemicals",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104877603

Lanzhou city in Northwest China, where the first photochemical smog incident occurred in China, is located in an area characterized by mountain-valley topography. The city has been known as a heavy and petrochemical industry base and heavily contaminated by PAHs. There are large knowledge gaps in the understanding of atmospheric environmental fate of PAHs in Lanzhou city due to sparse observation data. We performed extensive numerical investigations of PAHs for August (summertime) and December (wintertime) of 2014 in Lanzhou city, using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, aiming to fill knowledge gaps in the spatial-temporal distribution and health consequences across the city. Strong seasonality in the atmospheric concentrations of PAHs was found, with high concentrations in winter and low concentrations in summer. The modeling results show high days in which daily air concentrations of BaP exceeding the level Ⅱ of Chinese National Standard (CNS) (2.5 ng/m3) in several August days in industrial suburb and urban area. In December, 77% and 80% of simulated BaP daily air concentrations were well above this national standard in the two areas. The modeled NAP and PHE in the atmosphere were predominantly in gas phase, whereas BaP was mainly in particulate phase. It was also found that the dry deposition dominated total PAHs deposition in Lanzhou. The incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) ranged from 4.0 × 10−6 to 16.0 × 10−6, which were higher than the satisfactory risk level of 1.0 × 10−6, suggesting that local residents in Lanzhou city have a potential carcinogenic risk through exposure to ambient BaP. Especially, children had a higher exposure risk than adults. We suggest that the different actions in different regions of the city should be taken by the local government and those industries with high PAH emission, so as to reduce PAH contamination and risk. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CMAQ modeling; Inhalation exposure risk; PAHs; Transport and fate; Wet/dry deposition","Air quality; Barium compounds; Deposition; Health risks; Landforms; Petrochemicals; Topography; Atmospheric concentration; Chinese national standard; Community multi-scale air qualities; Health consequences; Numerical investigations; Petrochemical industry; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Spatial-temporal distribution; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100100947

In terms of the impact on PM2.5 reduction, the industrial sulfur dioxide (SO2) and industrial soot emissions are the only two factors shown significant influences. So the controls of industrial emission were the major policies during the implementation of the Clean Air Actions. In terms of the impact on the PM2.5 concentrations, industrial emission was the strongest socioeconomic factor in the beginning of the Clean Air Actions, but its dominance was then declining. In contrast, the influences of population density had been enhancing and became the greatest factor in the final year. So the new control measures should focus on the urbanization regulation. In addition, the interactions between different socioeconomic factors are proved to bivariate enhance the influences on the PM2.5 concentration levels. Multiple factors should thus be taken into account when any new control policies are going to be established. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China; Clean air actions; Natural factors; PM2.5; Socioeconomic factors","sulfur dioxide; action plan; atmospheric pollution; emission control; environmental impact assessment; industrial emission; particulate matter; policy implementation; pollution control; pollution policy; population density; socioeconomic impact; urbanization; air; air pollution; air pollution control; Article; China; concentration (parameter); environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; evaluation study; futurology; geographical detector; government regulation; industrialization; information system; natural science; particulate matter 2.5; PM2.5 exposure; population density; socioeconomics; soot; urbanization; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; prevention and control; socioeconomics; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100375056

Based on the provincial panel dataset of China from 2007 to 2017, this paper investigates the dual impacts of green credit on the economy and environment, and it establishes mediating effect models to analyze the Porter hypothesis. The results show that the green credit policy significantly improves economic performance and reduces pollutant emissions. The above results are robust to employing methods with alternative variables and instrumental variables. Second, the green credit policy contributes to innovation; that is, the green credit increases the innovation scale and improves innovation efficiency. The results of mediating effect models suggest that the Porter effect of green credit can be achieved by improving innovation efficiency. The findings of the current study indicate that the green credit policy helps achieve the win–win situation for economic goals and environmental targets. © 2021 by the authors.

District energy network, which can supply consumers with heating/cooling and electricity, is an effective and proven approach to enhance energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. Currently, the approach of integrated energy systems (including renewable energy) tends to be increasingly necessary and significant for the district energy network. This article presents a comprehensive review of energy performance of district energy networks, focusing on optimization and evaluation of district heating network combining with other relevant energy systems and renewable technologies. This review consists of the concept of district energy network, typical applications of district energy network, and significant literatures of energy performance of various energy networks based on theoretical modelling and analysis, physical experimental studies and numerical simulations. Furthermore, over 30 factors affecting energy performance have been substantially investigated and assessed. This review has demonstrated that main effects on energy network performance are significantly linked to configurations and capacities of system, climate conditions (locations and time), and the interaction between various factors.

However, it is challenging to separate krypton (Kr) from xenon (Xe) because of the chemical inertness and similar physical properties. Herein we prepared high-silica CHA zeolite membranes with ultra-high selectivity and irradiation stability for Kr/Xe separation. The suitable aperture size and rigid framework endures the membrane a strong size-exclusion effect. The ultrahigh selectivity of 51–152 together with the Kr permeance of 0.7–1.3×10−8 mol m−2 s−1 Pa−1 of high-silica CHA zeolite membranes far surpass the state-of-the-art polymeric membranes. The membrane is among the most stable polycrystalline membranes for separation of humid Kr/Xe mixtures.

Therefore, CO2capture and storage (CCS) have attracted extensive attention from both fundamental and practical research communities. However, traditional adsorbents and catalysts still have many defects in CO2capture and transformation. In recent years, nanomaterials have been considered as promising adsorbents for CO2capture due to their high adsorption capacity, low cost and wide availability. This review article describes the main technologies used for CO2capture, highlights the latest research status of nanomaterials for CO2capture, and investigates the influence of surface microstructure and modification of materials on CO2capture ability. Although many new nanomaterials and capture technologies have been developed, the high cost and the low technology scale of CO2capture remain major obstacles. Future research should focus on designing low-cost, high-availability nanomaterials to reduce CO2emission from large-scale power plants. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Costs; Greenhouse gases; Adsorption process; Environmental issues; High adsorption capacity; Large-scale power plants; Modification of materials; Research communities; Surface microstructures; Traditional adsorbents; Nanostructured materials; adsorption; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; catalyst; emission control; environmental issue; nanomaterial; power plant; research work; waste technology",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104576284

Ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) is an effective tool to study metal–oxygen reactions but has been limited to solid-state environments. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate in situ probing of potassium oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) via APXPS in ionic liquid-based air batteries. We reveal the formation and oxidation of K2O and K2O2 in K–O2 batteries, highlighting new reaction pathways in addition to the widely established one-electron process in K–O2 batteries. Importantly, we show that the formation and subsequent oxidation of K2O2 trigger irreversible cell chemistry, which could be responsible for capacity decay in K–O2 batteries. We further show that common impurities in air such as H2O and CO2 reduce chemical reversibility of ORR and OER. This study reveals root causes of irreversible cell chemistry in K–air batteries via direct probing of ionic liquid-based air batteries via APXPS, which can be widely applied to study the chemistry of solid/liquid interfaces of metal–air batteries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Interfaces; Metal–air batteries; Oxygen reduction","Degradation; Electric batteries; Electrolytic reduction; Ionic liquids; Oxygen; Oxygen reduction reaction; Photodegradation; Photoelectrons; Photons; Potassium; Solid state reactions; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Ambient-pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopies; Battery degradation; Electron process; Oxygen chemistry; Oxygen reduction/evolution; Reaction mechanism; Reaction pathways; Solid/liquid interfaces; Phase interfaces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100081117

Although rendering generates sellable fat and meal commodities, it has large environmental impacts because it is energy intensive. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a promising technology for treating SHW and reducing environmental impact through biogas production to generate heat or electricity, as well as by enabling nutrient recovery and pathogen reduction. This study compared the life-cycle energy use and global warming impact of treating SHW with traditional rendering with AD to produce heat and electricity. The study also considered the co-digestion of SHW with the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) and sewage sludge. A cradle-to-grave life-cycle assessment (LCA) method was used to quantify the energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of these systems for treating SHW. We compared three scenarios: (1) AD of SHW, (2) Co-AD of SHW with OFMSW, and (3) Co-AD of SHW with sewage sludge to reference systems of simple rendering and composting. The study findings revealed that the total cradle-to-gate energy use and GHG emissions by treating SHW with AD and co-AD were 0.5−6.7 GJ/1000 kg-SHW and 400−834 kg-CO₂-eq/1000 kg-SHW, whereas for the rendering control scenarios total cradle-to-gate energy use and GHG emissions were 1.9 GJ/1000 kg-SHW and 96.4 kg-CO₂-eq/1000 kg-SHW, respectively. However, considering all the benefits of treating SHW with co-AD, including the displacement of fossil fuel and electricity and nitrogen fertilizers generated as system outputs, these systems perform better than the rendering process. Compared to the reference systems, the GHG reduction potential of treating SHW with co-AD varied between 426.8 and 524.0 kg-CO₂-eq/1000 kg-SHW. Among all input parameters, methane (CH₄) leak from the AD system, and nitrogen fertilizer displacement were the most sensitive parameters affecting the results. By implementing AD of SHW in meat industries in the southeast US, the energy production and GHG emissions reduction potential were estimated to be 22–29 × 10⁶ GJ and 1.6–2.0 × 109 kg-CO₂-eq per year, respectively. The results indicate that the AD of SHW can substantially reduce GHG emissions of the US meat industry as well as produce bioenergy to provide energy security in the US. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion (AD); Bioenergy; Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions; Life-cycle assessment; Slaughterhouse waste (SHW)","Electric power generation; Emission control; Energy security; Energy utilization; Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Meats; Municipal solid waste; Nitrogen fertilizers; Sewage sludge; Sludge digestion; Energy productions; Global warming impact; Heat and electricity; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle energies; Organic fraction of municipal solid wastes; Sensitive parameter; Slaughterhouse waste; Anaerobic digestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100025572

It is a promising approach to adjust the operation parameters to influence the functional microorganisms for better acetic acid and formic acid production in acidogenesis. Herein, the effects of pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and carbon–nitrogen (C/N) ratio were determined in batch experiments to probe acetic and formic acids production, and were further verified in continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The results revealed that the content of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) reached to maximum at pH 6.0 or ORP -350 mV, while the production of acetic and formic acids was the highest at pH 7.0 or ORP -450 mV in 9 h fermentation. Also, fermentation products dominated by acetic and formic acids were adjusted in the CSTR under the operating conditions of pH 7.0 and ORP -450 mV. Microbiological analysis from batch test showed that fermentation at pH value of 7.0 enriched the diversity of microorganism, and provided a niche for microbes (Petrimonas, norank_f__Synergistaceae, vadinBC27_wastewater-sludge_group, and Trichococcus) to produce acetic and formic acids. Correspondingly, 78.70% of the carbon was converted to acetic and formic acids in pH 7.0. This study provides a promising strategy for the targeted regulation of acetic and formic acids production in acidogenesis of anaerobic digestion. © 2021","Acetic acid; Anaerobic digestion; Continuous stirred tank reactor; Formic acid; Optimization","Acetic acid; Anaerobic digestion; Carbon; Fermentation; Formic acid; Microorganisms; pH; Redox reactions; Batch experiments; Continuous stirred tank reactor; Fermentation products; Microbiological analysis; Operating condition; Operation parameters; Oxidation reduction potential; Volatile fatty acids (VFAs); Volatile fatty acids; acetic acid; formic acid; volatile fatty acid; formic acid derivative; volatile fatty acid; acetic acid; anaerobic digestion; detection method; experimental study; fermentation; formic acid; pH; anaerobic digestion; anaerobic fermentation; Article; carbon nitrogen ratio; controlled study; environmental parameters; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; oxidation reduction potential; pH; priority journal; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; fermentation; sewage; Petrimonas; Trichococcus; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Fermentation; Formates; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Sewage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100515568

Methods: About 81,000 COVID-19 confirmed case data, Baidu migration index data, air pollutants, meteorological data, and government response strictness index data were collected from 31 provincial-level regions (excluding Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) and 337 prefecture-level cities. The spatio-temporal characteristics of COVID-19 were explored using spatial autocorrelation, hot spot, and spatio-temporal scanning statistics. At the same time, Spearman rank correlation analysis and multiple linear regression were used to explore the relationship between influencing factors and confirmed COVID-19 cases. Results: The distribution of COVID-19 in China tends to be stable over time, with spatial correlation and prominent clustering regions. Spatio-temporal scanning analysis showed that most COVID-19 high-incidence months were from January to March at the beginning of the epidemic, and the area with the highest aggregation risk was Hubei Province (RR = 491.57) which was 491.57 times the aggregation risk of other regions. Among the meteorological variables, the daily average temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and new COVID-19 cases were negatively correlated. The air pollution concentration and migration index were positively correlated with new confirmed cases, and the government response strict index was strongly negatively correlated with confirmed COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: Environmental temperature has a certain inhibitory effect on the transmission of COVID-19; the air pollution concentration and migration index have a certain promoting effect on the transmission of COVID-19. The strict government response index indicates that the greater the intensity of government intervention, the fewer COVID-19 cases will occur. © 2021 The Authors","Air pollution concentration; COVID-19; Environment temperature; Government response strictness index; Migration index; Spatio-temporal","air pollution; Article; China; concentration (parameter); coronavirus disease 2019; environmental temperature; epidemic; human; population migration; precipitation; public policy; risk factor; spatial autocorrelation analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; virus transmission; wind speed; epidemiology; risk factor; spatiotemporal analysis; temperature; Air Pollution; China; COVID-19; Humans; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104948167

Laboratory tests were conducted to investigate methane diffusion and advection through GCLs. Gas permeability coefficient of GCL for the case with moisture content = 47.5% is one and two orders of magnitude greater than the cases with moisture content = 68.5% and 80.9%, respectively, when 20 kPa vertical stress was applied. The batch adsorption tests indicated that adsorption of methane onto bentonite is negligible. The concentration variation for the adsorption of methane onto bentonite can be neglected. However, methane concentration decreased by 14.2% for the test of methane adsorption onto GCL during the first 2–3 days. This is because methane was adsorbed by the geotextiles rather than by the bentonite in GCL. The large porosity and surface area of geotextiles provide lots of micropores for methane adsorption. Analytical model was then developed to analyze the performance of GCL-based liners system with respect to methane transport. The results indicate that methane emission fluxes for the case with SL + GCL are 7.8 and 5.1 times less than the cases with SL + CCL when the moisture contents were 25.9% and 35.1%, respectively. The methane emission fluxes for both of the SL + GCL and SL + CCL can be neglected when they are fully saturated. GCL is recommended to be used in arid and semi-arid regions rather than CCL. GCL is recommended to be used in arid and semi-arid areas rather than CCL. Advection plays a more important role in methane migration through SL + GCL and SL + CCL than that of diffusion. With moisture contents = 25.9% and 32%, methane emission flux attributed to advection accounts for more than 90% of the total emission flux for both cases of SL + GCL and SL + CCL. With the increase of moisture content of SL, the effectiveness of SL in reducing methane emission increases. The saved space for using GCL + SL composite cover compared with using a single SL cover is 0.7 m when the moisture content equals 25.9%, which is 0.5 m greater than the case when moisture content equals 32%. GMB plays a dominant role in inhibiting methane migration and reducing methane emission flux. When moisture content equals 25.9%, the methane emission fluxes for SL + GMB + GCL and SL + GMB + CCL are 343 times and 2643 times less than the cases with SL + GCL and SL + CCL, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adsorption; Diffusion coefficient; GCL; Geosynthetics; Methane; Permeability coefficient","Adsorption; Advection; Arid regions; Bentonite; Diffusion; Gas permeability; Geotextiles; Moisture; Moisture determination; Advection and diffusions; Arid and semi-arid areas; Arid and semi-arid regions; Batch adsorption tests; Concentration variation; Experimental investigations; Geosynthetic clay liners; Methane concentrations; Methane; adsorption; advection; clay liner; diffusion; experimental study; geosynthetics; methane; moisture content; permeability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093983087

Regional transport is an important contributor to high PM2.5 levels during haze episodes in the YRD, but its impact on human health is rarely analyzed. In this study, we evaluate the short-term PM2.5-related health risks and associated economic losses due to different source regions by estimating daily mortality based on model results in the YRD. The results show that regional transport induces significant health risks in the YRD during haze days, contributing over 60% of daily premature mortality in Shanghai and Nanjing (major cities in the YRD). Moreover, in Hangzhou and Jiaxing, regional transport's contribution can be as high as 70%. The total daily mean economic loss in the YRD is estimated as 526.8 million Chinese Yuan (approximately 81.4 million U.S. dollar) in winter of 2015 and 2016, accounting for 1.4% of the daily averaged gross domestic product (GDP) of the YRD. Emission control (in accordance with the 13th Five-year Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction Plan) is an effective way to reduce health risks in the YRD, reducing premature deaths during haze days by 12–33%.

This study aims to examine the impact of this “greening” policy on China's climate change mitigation. First, from an emissions reduction perspective, this study interprets greening as the process of constantly strengthening society's awareness and willingness regarding emissions reduction. Then, this study incorporates a carbon abatement willingness factor into a nonparametric model, and quantitatively simulates the impact of greening on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reduction in China. The results show that China can rapidly decrease its CO2 emissions in the early stages of greening. However, when greening passes a certain stage, it no longer affects CO2 emissions. Thus, the willingness to reduce emissions has a diminishing marginal effect on emissions reduction. Additionally, throughout the greening process, China is expected to reduce its CO2 emissions by 36.08%, or 3718.50 million tons. Finally, the impact of greening on China's CO2 emissions exhibits spatial variation, as its undeveloped western region can achieve greater CO2 emissions reductions by promoting greening.

A large number of cities across the world entered “sleep mode” sequentially due to the stay-at-home or lockdown policies. This study exploits the impact of pandemic-induced human mobility restrictions, as the response to COVID-19 pandemic, on the urban air quality across China. Different from the “traditional” difference-in-differences analysis, a human mobility-based difference-in-differences method is used to quantify the effect of intracity mobility reductions on air quality across 325 cities in China. The model shows that the air quality index (AQI) experiences a 12.2% larger reduction in the cities with lockdown. Moreover, this reduction effect varies with different types of air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO decreased by 13.1%, 15.3%, 4%, 3.3%, and 3.3%, respectively). The heterogeneity analysis in terms of different types of cities shows that the effect is greater in northern, higher income, more industrialized cities, and more economically active cities. We also estimate the subsequent health benefits following such improvement, and the expected averted premature deaths due to air pollution declines are around 26,385 to 38,977 during the sample period. These findings illuminate a new light on the role of a policy intervention in the pollution emission, while also providing a roadmap for future research on the pollution effect of COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Air pollution; COVID-19 pandemic; Health benefit; Heterogeneity; Lockdown","air quality; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; disease spread; pollution control; public health; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; viral disease; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095706660

It is found that in the short term, construction land reduction will have negative effects on the labor market of the regional economy. While significantly reducing pollutant emission intensity, this reduction will lead to factor mismatch and idleness and then inhibit construction land use efficiency, which will inhibit the Porter effect; the reduction quota will not meet the condition of cross-regional flow. Construction land reduction will produce significant short-term economic benefits when the reduction scale is controlled at 1.453∼4.403 ha per year. If local governments pay more attention to the long-term benefits, the scale of reduction can be slightly increased on this basis. The greater the financial pressure is, the smaller the scale of the reduction, and it will be easy to make the local financial network fall into the Matthew effect trap. However, financial subsidies from both the district and municipality level can effectively alleviate this problem. In the long term, construction land reduction can significantly improve construction land use efficiency and generate the Porter effect. In addition, the cross-regional flow of the reduction quota can be feasible, which can significantly increase the potential economic dividends for the entire region.

In this study, PtO/TiO2 catalysts were prepared through photodeposition and Pt/TiO2 was prepared by the photoreduction of PtO/TiO2 to avoid interference arising from co-existing Pt forms and different loading amounts. These catalysts exhibited completely reversed selectivity for CO and CH4 production during CO2 photoreduction: PtO/TiO2 tended to produce CO (100%), whereas Pt/TiO2 favored the production of CH4 (66.6%). By combining experimental analysis and theoretical calculations, the difference in selectivity was ascribed to the different charge transfer/separation and CO/H adsorption properties of PtO/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2. Photoelectric and photoluminescence (PL) analysis showed that Pt was more advantageous to the photogenerated carrier separation compared with PtO, which was conducive to the multi-electron CH4 reduction reaction. Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption/temperature-programmed reduction, and density functional theory calculations indicated that the adsorption of CO and hydrogen on Pt was stronger than that on PtO, which favored the further reduction of CO to CH4. Based on the above results, a mechanism was proposed to explain the reversed selectivity of the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 over Pt/TiO2 and PtO/TiO2.

This promising process, however, is limited by its sluggish reaction kinetics and high-cost catalysts. Construction of low-cost and high-performance non-noble metal-based catalysts have been one of the most effective approaches to address these grand challenges. Notably, the electronic structure tuning strategy, which could subtly tailor the electronic states, band structures, and adsorption ability of the catalysts, has become a pivotal way to further enhance the electrochemical water splitting reactions based on non-noble metal-based catalysts. Particularly, heteroatom-doping plays an effective role in regulating the electronic structure and optimizing the intrinsic activity of the catalysts. Nevertheless, the reaction kinetics, and in particular, the functional mechanisms of the hetero-dopants in catalysts yet remains ambiguous. Herein, the recent progress is comprehensively reviewed in heteroatom doped non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction, particularly focus on the electronic tuning effect of hetero-dopants in the catalysts and the corresponding synthetic pathway, catalytic performance, and activity origin.

Our results demonstrated that abundant and rare bacterial diversities were determined by plant community together with climatic, soil and spatial factors, but the shifts in bacterial richness and composition caused by abiotic and biotic variations varied between abundant and rare subcommunities. Rare bacterial richness significantly decreased with increasing temperature, drought and nutrient limitation, while abundant bacterial richness showed an increasing trend. Plant richness was negatively associated with abundant bacterial richness, but positively related to rare bacterial richness. Abiotic and biotic differences caused greater variations in rare species composition than that in abundant species composition. Furthermore, our results also confirmed that the spatial patterns of abundant and rare bacterial distribution differed remarkably. Our findings collectively suggest that similar abiotic and biotic drivers but distinct influences lead to distinct spatial distribution patterns of abundant and rare bacteria in harsh deserts.

Different from cellular network powered on-grid energy, the base station (BS) wakeup in HybE-Net needs to consider the solar energy of the BS and the traffic load in the network. Thus, in this article, a fuzzy logic-based wakeup strategy is proposed, which comprehensively considers the energy wakeup level and the available network resource ratio. Then, the solar energy states are analyzed mathematically by using the diffusion approximation method. Finally, to prevent BSs from switching frequently between the sleeping and nonsleeping model, the awakening threshold is optimized by the penalty function method. The simulation results demonstrate that in the proposed wakeup strategy, the wakeup threshold based on the energy state is used to avoid the phenomenon of frequent handoff of the BSs, resulting in fewer handoffs.

The distribution rules of methane, smoke and oxygen in the fire zone are obtained for different fire source locations. On this basis, the temporal and spatial distributions of the methane explosion regions at the working face are determined. The modeling results show that during the sealing process, the methane explosion limits are greatly affected by fire smoke. In the early stage of sealing, the methane explosion limit range in the fire zone is reduced due to the dilution of CO2, but later, due to the production of CO, the risk of methane explosion increases. A methane explosion region will appear in the working face tunnel within 1 h after the beginning of sealing, and the timing is closely related to the location of the fire source. When the fire source is located on the intake side of the working face, the methane explosion region first appears on the return side and has the longest duration among all the cases studied; the methane explosion region appears the earliest when the fire source is located on the return side of the working face, and the possibility of methane explosion is the largest in this case. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Explosion limits; Fire zone dynamic sealing; Gas concentrations; Methane explosion region; Mine fire","Carbon dioxide; Coal industry; Coal mines; Explosions; Mine fires; Smoke; Distribution rule; Methane explosions; Model results; Production of CO; Sealing process; Source location; Temporal and spatial distribution; Thermal balance; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098080440

We investigated for the first time the potential impact of climate change on potato distribution at a national scale. The interdecadal change of potato distribution in China in response to the climate change from 1961 to 2017 was estimated using the MaxEnt model. The annual precipitation, annual average minimum temperature, average temperature in the coldest month, and sunshine duration were selected to model the climate suitability of potato distribution. The climate optimum areas exhibited a shrinking trend, with proportion of acreage falling from 5.12 % in the 1960s to 3.49 % in the 2010s. Climate suitable areas showed the tendency to expand to the east and shrink to the north. As an illustration, the climate suitability in eastern part of North-central Region was increased, but was decreased in southern part of Southwest Region. The proportions of consistency between major planting areas and high climate suitability areas were decreased from 93.36 % in the 1980s to 79.62 % in the 2010s. The increase of potato acreage in low climate suitable areas such as Middle and Lower Reaches of Yangtze River Region, Southeast Region, and southern part of Southwest Region might bring an adverse effect to potato production. Given that the climate optimum areas were found in the marginal regions of mid-western Xinjiang province in the past 60 years, it might be potential areas for potato introduction. The evaluation of climate suitability could provide a theoretical reference for planting layout of potato, which was conducive to reducing the potential risk of climate change on potato production and developing a reasonable regionalization of climate suitability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Climate suitability; MaxEnt model; Planting acreage; Potato","agrometeorology; climate change; decadal variation; environmental risk; food production; food security; potato; regionalization; temperature profile; China; Yangtze River; Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099053336

In this study, PM2.5 sampling was conducted along with gaseous pollutant concentration measurements and meteorological parameters in the city of Yangquan, China, which has high levels of atmospheric sulfur dioxide (SO2), over the course of four seasons in 2018. PM2.5 levels in daily samples ranged from 20.4 to 250.2 μg m−3, with a mean of 75.1 μg m−3. PM2.5 levels in Yangquan exhibited clear seasonal variations, with the highest seasonal average level of 108.2 μg m−3 found in the winter, likely due to coal combustion for heating purposes, and the lowest level of 45.5 μg m−3 in the summer. The results showed that oxidation by ozone (O3) played a major role in the formation of sulfate in the spring, summer, and autumn, while nitrogen dioxide (NO2) oxidation played a major role in the formation of sulfate in the winter. As a precursor of O3, NO2 also played a key role in its formation. Therefore, controlling NO2 emissions could effectively reduce the formation of sulfate in all four seasons via reductions in O3. Meanwhile, reducing SO2 alone did not effectively decrease sulfate levels when the variations in the concentration of NO2 were small, which indicated the importance of NO2 to the formation of sulfate (SO42−) between 2014 and 2018 in Yangquan. Thus, the control and reduction of NO2 emissions should be strengthened, leveraging existing control efforts of SO2 emissions, in order to most efficiently reduce PM2.5. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","High SO2 levels; NO2 emissions; Particulate matter; Sulfate formation; Sulfur oxidation rate","ammonium sulfate; concentration (composition); Neotropic Ecozone; ozone; particulate matter; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; suspended particulate matter; urban area; China; Shanxi; Yangquan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092591372

As behavioural change is seen as a key mechanism for achieving emission reduction, this paper focuses on behaviours of business travels from four countries: Canada, Switzerland, Russia and the U.S., using values-attitudes-behaviour (VAB) theory. We employ Principal Components Analysis to reduce the variables down to four factors and related factor scores. Stepwise multiple linear regression was then used to measure causal associations. The findings show how national cultures, demographics and values influence (although at different levels) the sustainable attitudes and behaviour of business travellers. These results have implications for future corporate travel policy. The recent impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic is also addressed. © 2021 by the authors.

By using a large vegetation-plot database, we asked how local richness and abundance of alien species vary by regions, elevation, climate, soil properties, human disturbance, and habitat types. Location: Western, central and southern Europe. Methods: We linked consolidated data from the European Vegetation Archive (16,211 plots) to a habitat classification scheme, climate, soil properties and human disturbance variables. In addition, we used 250 km × 250 km regional grid cells to test whether local patterns differ among regions. We used generalized additive models (GAMs) and quantile GAMs to explore how relative alien species richness and the sum of alien species covers per plot relate to predictors. Random Forest analyses (RFs) were employed to assess the importance of individual predictors that were not multicollinear. Results: Relative alien species richness and the sum of alien species covers varied across regions and habitat types, with effects being more pronounced at the maximum rather than average responses. Both response variables declined with increasing elevation and distance to the nearest road or railroad and increased with the amount of sealed soil. Maxima in fitted functions matched plots from regional invasion hotspots in northwestern and central Europe. RFs accounted for 39.6% and 20.9% of the total variation in relative alien species richness and the sum of alien species covers, respectively, with region and habitat being the most important variables. Conclusions: The importance of maximum response quantiles and the prevalence of regional hotspots point to invasion debt in European woodlands. As alien plants expand further, their species richness and abundance in woodlands will be likely driven by the shared effects of the introduction and planting history, differences in the invaded habitat types, and dispersal corridors. © 2021 International Association for Vegetation Science","alien plants; biological invasions; Europe; European Vegetation Archive; exotic plants; forest; habitat type; invasibility; neophytes; non-native plants","abundance; biological invasion; classification; database; dispersal; habitat type; human activity; introduced species; species richness; woodland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105046558

There is a clear research gap concerning the processes of Europeanization of the energy policy in the Visegrad countries. This article aims to identify and evaluate the progress of four Visegrad countries (V4) in implementing the EU energy goals in the context of the Europeanization. The article uses three main methods: Hellwig’s method, Kendall’s rank concordance coefficient, and k-means clustering. These calculations will allow one to study the Europeanization processes, which means checking the gamma convergence. For calculations, we use the available statistical data from Eurostat for the years 2005–2018. Poland and other Central European countries, including Czechia, and Hungary, largely depend on coal for their energy needs. The empirical results have shown that there have been no significant changes in the classification of EU countries in terms of their fulfillment of the EU climate and energy targets in the analyzed period. This is the case in all EU member states, including the Visegrad Group countries, but except for Poland. This means that the level of Europeanization of the energy policy and its effectiveness is similar in all member states except for Poland, which is becoming a kind of the exception. Throughout the investigating period, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia were close to meeting the set targets and could be rated high compared to the EU countries. Poland, especially since 2015, has been noticeably and increasingly distanced from the other V4 countries. It can be perceived as a gradual drift away from Europeanization of the EU climate and energy policy in Poland. © 2021 by the authors.

Previous risk assessments have examined the health response to total PM2.5, not just PM2.5 from fossil fuel combustion, and have used a concentration-response function with limited support from the literature and data at both high and low concentrations. This assessment examines mortality associated with PM2.5 from only fossil fuel combustion, making use of a recent meta-analysis of newer studies with a wider range of exposure. We also estimated mortality due to lower respiratory infections (LRI) among children under the age of five in the Americas and Europe, regions for which we have reliable data on the relative risk of this health outcome from PM2.5 exposure. We used the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem to estimate global exposure levels to fossil-fuel related PM2.5 in 2012. Relative risks of mortality were modeled using functions that link long-term exposure to PM2.5 and mortality, incorporating nonlinearity in the concentration response. We estimate a global total of 10.2 (95% CI: −47.1 to 17.0) million premature deaths annually attributable to the fossil-fuel component of PM2.5. The greatest mortality impact is estimated over regions with substantial fossil fuel related PM2.5, notably China (3.9 million), India (2.5 million) and parts of eastern US, Europe and Southeast Asia. The estimate for China predates substantial decline in fossil fuel emissions and decreases to 2.4 million premature deaths due to 43.7% reduction in fossil fuel PM2.5 from 2012 to 2018 bringing the global total to 8.7 (95% CI: −1.8 to 14.0) million premature deaths. We also estimated excess annual deaths due to LRI in children (0–4 years old) of 876 in North America, 747 in South America, and 605 in Europe. This study demonstrates that the fossil fuel component of PM2.5 contributes a large mortality burden. The steeper concentration-response function slope at lower concentrations leads to larger estimates than previously found in Europe and North America, and the slower drop-off in slope at higher concentrations results in larger estimates in Asia. Fossil fuel combustion can be more readily controlled than other sources and precursors of PM2.5 such as dust or wildfire smoke, so this is a clear message to policymakers and stakeholders to further incentivize a shift to clean sources of energy. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Fossil fuel; Health impact assessment; Mortality; Particulate matter","combustion; concentration (composition); fossil fuel; meta-analysis; mortality; particulate matter; pollution exposure; wildfire; China; Europe; India; North America; South America; Southeast Asia; United States; fossil fuel; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; Asia; child; China; environmental exposure; Europe; human; India; infant; newborn; North America; particulate matter; preschool child; toxicity; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Asia; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Environmental Exposure; Europe; Fossil Fuels; Humans; India; Infant; Infant, Newborn; North America; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100907280

The SASE approach is unique in coevolving academic and social initiatives in parallel for the express purpose of achieving dual objectives: societally relevant research and social impact over an extended period. Distinct from typical action research approaches, the directionality between research and practice in this approach is circular or mutual rather than linear, the time frame continuous rather than discrete, and the unit of analysis the entire enterprise rather than a single project. Thus, SASE is fundamentally a bottom-up, learning-by-doing approach that developed in contexts characterized by a confluence of uncertainties for communities and a confluence of unfamiliarities for researchers and practitioners. The authors demonstrate this approach in the context of creating sustainability literacy education in Tanzania based on unique climate change impacts in the region. The academic research enterprise provides bottom-up insights about climate change and potential approaches to sustainability literacy education. A sustainability literacy education pilot project demonstrates an initiative in the social enterprise aspect of the approach.

The only way to defeat the rapid spread of COVID-19, is to shut down socio-economic activities and to maintain minimal human interaction with the implementation of a lockdown. Such lockdowns have manifested in a pollution curtailment in almost all spheres of the planet, including in marine pollution. Quantifying this decrease in pollution levels enables the scientific community to assess the contribution of anthropogenic (especially non-essential) activities to global/regional pollution levels. This paper aims to study the impact of the stringent lockdown period (phase 1 and 2) on coastal water quality along the Chennai coast of India, by analyzing suspended matter concentration (SPM), a key element of water quality and diffuse attenuation coefficient, Kd(490), using LANDSAT-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data. LANDSAT-8/OLI, L1TP scenes were subjected to radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction to derive surface reflectance values from raw digital numbers using ACOLITE software and a brief insight has been given for the Dark Spectrum Fitting algorithm used in ACOLITE. SPM concentration decreased by 15.48 and 37.50% in the Chennai and Ennore ports, respectively, due to minimal vessel movement and cargo handling. The stringent lockdown led to the operation of fewer thermal plant units, thus less fly ash was emanated, resulting in a 28.05% reduction in SPM levels over Ennore creek. As industrial and commercial activities subsided, the city’s water bodies became clearer than they were just a fortnight prior to the lockdown, with a reduction of 22.26% of SPM in Adyar and 33.97% in Cooum riverine estuaries. Decrease in Kd(490) showed a positive relationship with SPM and thus improved coastal water quality because of the reduction of SPM during this period. The variations in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were studied using National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP) data and reduced levels in particulate matter concentration (PM2.5 and PM10) for the Adyar residential area (24.38 and 28.43%) and for the Nungampakkam commercial area (36.09 and 67.18%) were observed. A significant reduction in PM2.5 concentration (45.63%) was observed in the Ennore-Manali Industrial region. © Copyright © 2021 Vijay Prakash, Geetha Vimala, Preethi Latha, Jayaram, Nagamani and Laxmi.","ACOLITE; Chennai coastal waters; COVID-19 lockdown; diffuse attenuation coefficient; suspended particulate matter; water quality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104945402

However, the interplay between this disease, changes in pollution, climate, and aversion to activation of emergency medical services represents a challenging conundrum. We aimed at appraising the impact of COVID-19, weather, and environment features on the occurrence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in a large Italian region and metropolitan area. Methods and results: Italy was hit early on by COVID-19, such that state of emergency was declared on January 31, 2020, and national lockdown implemented on March 9, 2020, mainly because the accrual of cases in Northern Italy. In order to appraise the independent contribution on changes in STEMI and NSTEMI daily rates of COVID-19, climate and pollution, we collected data on these clinical events from tertiary care cardiovascular centers in the Lazio region and Rome metropolitan area. Multilevel Poisson modeling was used to appraise unadjusted and adjusted effect estimates for the daily incidence of STEMI and NSTEMI cases. The sample included 1448 STEMI and 2040 NSTEMI, with a total of 2882 PCI spanning 6 months. Significant reductions in STEMI and NSTEMI were evident already in early February 2020 (all p<0.05), concomitantly with COVID-19 spread and institution of national countermeasures. Changes in STEMI and NSTEMI were inversely associated with daily COVID-19 tests, cases, and/or death (p<0.05). In addition, STEMI and NSTEMI incidences were associated with daily NO2, PM10, and O3 concentrations, as well as temperature (p<0.05). Multi-stage and multiply adjusted models highlighted that reductions in STEMI were significantly associated with COVID-19 data (p<0.001), whereas changes in NSTEMI were significantly associated with both NO2 and COVID-19 data (both p<0.001). Conclusions: Reductions in STEMI and NSTEMI in the COVID-19 pandemic may depend on different concomitant epidemiologic and pathophysiologic mechanisms. In particular, recent changes in STEMI may depend on COVID-19 scare, leading to excess all-cause mortality, or effective reduced incidence, whereas reductions in NSTEMI may also be due to beneficial reductions in NO2 emissions in the lockdown phase. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Acute coronary syndrome; Climate; COVID-19; Environment; Pollution; Weather","nitrogen dioxide; ozone; acute coronary syndrome; Article; climate; concentration (parameter); coronavirus disease 2019; death; environmental temperature; health impact assessment; human; incidence; information processing; Italy; lockdown; non ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; particulate matter 10; pollution; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; tertiary care center; weather; acute coronary syndrome; adverse event; aged; clinical trial; female; follow up; male; middle aged; multicenter study; pandemic; pollution; retrospective study; risk factor; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Aged; COVID-19; Environmental Pollution; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099438126

India imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 25, 2020, for more than a month to contain the COVID-19 infection. During the nationwide lockdown, transport, industries, and commercial activities were suspended, except for essential services. We made a detailed analysis of the impacts of COVID-19 on air quality in India by using the data from more than 200 Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS) and reported a change in the National Air Quality Index (NAQI), spatial distribution and concentration levels of PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, SO2, and O3 from January to April 2020 nationwide and in five major cities, namely, Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, and Hyderabad. We defined the period between February 25 to March 24, 2020, as ‘before lockdown’ and March 25 to April 30, 2020, as ‘during lockdown’. The NAQI and satellite visual maps of AOD, NO2, CO, and SO2 from January to April 2020 showed a significant decrease in air pollution levels in India. The average concentration levels of PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, and SO2 have decreased nationwide by 33, 34, 21, 47, and 21%, respectively, during the nationwide lockdown compared to their concentration levels before the lockdown. While comparing their concentration levels of the nationwide lockdown period with those observed in April 2019 at the same CAAQMS, it was found that the nationwide average concentration levels of PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, and SO2 were decreased by 53, 45, 27, 54, and 35%, respectively. The trends of decreasing air pollutants during the lockdown in five major cities were almost the same as nationwide. The concentration levels of O3 have shown an increasing trend from January–April 2020 including during the nationwide lockdown. The COVID-19 has provided a rare opportunity for India for the collection of air pollution baseline data which could be useful in the formulation of air pollution reduction policies in the future. © The Author(s).","Air quality; Air quality index; COVID-19; Lockdown; Particulate matters","Nitrogen oxides; Service industry; Sulfur dioxide; Air pollutants; Air quality indices; Ambient air quality; Average concentration; Concentration levels; Essential services; Pollution level; Pollution reduction; Air quality; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; disinfection; infectious disease; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107528736

A combination of atmospheric dynamics and uncertain emissions, including the post-monsoon agricultural stubble burning, make it challenging to resolve the role of each individual factor. Here we demonstrate the potential use of an atmospheric transport model, the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) to identify and quantify the role of transport mechanisms and emissions on the occurrence of the pollution events. The investigation is based on the use of carbon monoxide (CO) observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite and the surface measurement network, as well as the WRF-Chem simulations, to investigate the factors contributing to CO enhancement over India during November 2018. We show that the simulated column-averaged dry air mole fraction (XCO) is largely consistent with TROPOMI observations, with a spatial correlation coefficient of 0.87. The surface-level CO concentrations show larger sensitivities to boundary layer dynamics, wind speed, and diverging source regions, leading to a complex concentration pattern and reducing the observation-model agreement with a correlation coefficient ranging from 0.41 to 0.60 for measurement locations across the IGP. We find that daily satellite observations can provide a first-order inference of the CO transport pathways during the enhanced burning period, and this transport pattern is reproduced well in the model. By using the observations and employing the model at a comparable resolution, we confirm the significant role of atmospheric dynamics and residential, industrial, and commercial emissions in the production of the exorbitant level of air pollutants in northern India. We find that biomass burning plays only a minimal role in both column and surface enhancements of CO, except for the state of Punjab during the high pollution episodes. While the model reproduces observations reasonably well, a better understanding of the factors controlling the model uncertainties is essential for relating the observed concentrations to the underlying emissions. Overall, our study emphasizes the importance of undertaking rigorous policy measures, mainly focusing on reducing residential, commercial, and industrial emissions in addition to actions already underway in the agricultural sectors. © 2021 Author(s).",,"air quality; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; carbon emission; concentration (composition); extreme event; meteorology; monitoring system; Sentinel; troposphere; weather forecasting; winter; Gangetic Plain; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103946712

While their position of political influence in the Republican coalition is widely recognised, the full range of effects of this position on evangelicals' climate opinions is not. To move research on evangelicals from the margins of climate change opinion research, we review and integrate the interdisciplinary literature on US evangelicals, climate change, and politics. In assessing this literature, we identify three areas in need of further research. First, there is a critical need for more research on the climate attitudes of evangelicals of color, who comprise a growing share of the evangelical tradition in the US. Second, highlighting the Christian Right's active engagement in the climate debate, we identify a need for more experimental work examining how cues from religious elites may shape evangelicals' opinions. Finally, we suggest that to better harness insights across disciplines, researchers must become more explicitly aware of how different disciplines conceptualize temporality. Attending to temporal scale suggests that a new approach is needed to test how dominion beliefs, which are widely thought to be an important theological driver of climate skepticism, operate. We also suggest that two factors that appear to play a weak or limited role in driving climate skepticism over the short term (anti-science attitudes and evangelical religiosity) may in fact play a significant role in driving skepticism over the medium term.

However, despite its advantages, HP implementation causes several impacts on the ecological status of river systems and the preservation of characteristic landscapes. The use of decision-making tools, like multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, can provide helpful support to achieve more sustainable solutions for complex water management problems. In Aosta Valley (NW Italy), an MCDM experimental approach is being applied to define the optimal environmental flow scenario to be released by HP plants, in an attempt to balance energy production needs, economic profitability and environmental safeguard. Four criteria are considered (energy, environment and fishing, landscape, economy) and key stakeholders are involved in the entire decision-making process. However, there is a need to test also other MCDM methodologies in order to understand if an alternative approach could be more suitable for future, more complex, HP management decisions. Therefore, in this paper, seven different MCDM methods are applied to an existing small run-of-the-river HP plant for the selection of the optimal flow release scenario, i.e., SAW, WPM, AHP, TOPSIS, VIKOR, ELECTRE III, and the initially adopted method, SHARE MCA. The results obtained with the application of the different MCDM methods are investigated and statistically compared. The strengths and weaknesses of the different methodological approaches are also discussed. Based on the comparative results and the consequent evaluations, SHARE MCA, WPM, and VIKOR appear to have the most interesting characteristics in terms of overall feasibility. © Copyright © 2021 Vassoney, Mammoliti Mochet, Desiderio, Negro, Pilloni and Comoglio.","Alpine regions; decision-making processes; environmental flows; multi-criteria analysis; small hydropower; stakeholders’ involvement; sustainable Alpine river management; sustainable hydropower",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105211475

Developed communities have gained considerable momentum by investing in environmental infrastructure and integrating corporate performance disclosure and less developed communities are involved with it. Carbon disclosure is one of the aspects of green accounting in “corporate strategies,” especially those operating across the capital market. Adherence to the disclosure of facts can facilitate sustainable development in societies. This study aims to present strategic reference points matrix-based model to develop a framework for carbon disclosure strategies through institutional and stakeholder pressures throughout the capital market. Design/methodology/approach: As a case study, by reviewing similar research on carbon disclosure, this study seeks to illustrate various carbon disclosure aspects and strategies in a matrix based on institutional (vertical axis) and stakeholder (horizontal axis) pressures Findings: The study attempts to states that carbon disclosure is affected solely by the company because of the presence of agency gaps between external stakeholders and corporate executives. Originality/value: However, the firm’s decision to adopt a carbon disclosure strategy depends on the performance of stakeholder pressure (stakeholder salience level) and managers’ perceptions of institutional pressure (institutional pressure centrality level). © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Institutional theory; Stakeholder theory; Strategic reference points (SRP) matrix",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103865143

Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is an important crop for food security in the tropics and heat stress is expected to cause increasing yield losses. To study physiological responses and to characterize the genetics of heat stress tolerance, we evaluated the recombinant inbred line (RIL) population IJR (Indeterminate Jamaica Red) x AFR298 of the Andean gene pool. Heat stress (HS) conditions in the field affected many traits across the reproductive phase. High nighttime temperatures appeared to have larger effects than maximum daytime temperatures. Yield was reduced compared to non-stress conditions by 37% and 26% in 2016 and 2017 seasons, respectively. The image analysis tool HYRBEAN was developed to evaluate pollen viability (PolVia). A significant reduction of PolVia was observed in HS and higher viability was correlated with yield only under stress conditions. In susceptible lines the reproductive phase was extended and defects in the initiation of seed, seed fill and seed formation were identified reducing grain quality. Higher yields under HS were correlated with early flowering, high pollen viability and effective seed filling. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis revealed a QTL for both pod harvest index and PolVia on chromosome Pv05, for which the more heat tolerant parent IJR contributed the positive allele. Also, on chromosome Pv08 a QTL from IJR improved PolVia and the yield component pods per plant. HS affected several traits during the whole reproductive development, from floral induction to grain quality traits, indicating a general heat perception affecting many reproductive processes. Identification of tolerant germplasm, indicator traits for heat tolerance and molecular tools will help to breed heat tolerant varieties to face future climate change effects. © 2021 Vargas et al.

For example, many songbirds rely on short peaks in insect and fruit production at stopover sites during migration. Previous research indicates that migratory songbirds are able to modify their departure and arrival dates to some extent despite their reliance on more stable cues such as photoperiod and more stable endogenous factors. However, insect and plant phenology may shift more rapidly with changing climate, reducing foraging opportunities along migratory routes. To quantify changes in songbird arrival patterns at stopover sites during fall migration we analyzed forty years of banding data in nine passerine species commonly captured at banding stations in southwestern Michigan. Weather data revealed that the region has warmed by nearly 2° (C) over this timeframe. For each species, we assessed annual trends in arrival date and temperature at arrival. To determine whether arrival trends impacted stopover site function we also quantified trends in site use and morning mass gain. Arrival dates advanced significantly in three species, and were delayed significantly in three other species. However, air temperature at arrival increased significantly over time for all nine study species. Over the same time period, site use and the pattern of morning mass gain remained stable or increased for all species. Despite the changing climate and the resulting increase in temperature at arrival for migrants, our data indicate that these stopover locations continue to function as a refueling sites. Nonetheless, we must be wary of thresholds and ecological mismatches that may occur if warming trends continue. © 2021 Nordic Society Oikos.

Nevertheless, currently, an investment in such a kind of power plant might not be profitable enough, since some energy policies have led to a general decrease of both the average single national price of electricity (PUN) and its variability; moreover, in several countries, negative prices are reached on some sunny or windy days. Within this context, combined heat and power (CHP) systems appear not just as a fuel-efficient way to fulfill local thermal demand but also as a sustainable way to maintain installed capacity able to support electricity grid reliability. Innovative solutions to increase both the efficiency and flexibility of those power plants, as well as careful evaluations of the economic context, are essential to ensure the sustainability of the economic investment in a fast-paced changing energy field. This study aims to evaluate the economic viability and environmental impact of an integrated solution of a cogenerative combined cycle gas turbine power plant with a flue gas condensing heat pump. Considering capital expenditure, heat demand, electricity price, and its fluctuations during the whole system life, the sustainability of the investment is evaluated taking into account the uncertainties of economic scenarios and benchmarked against the integration of a cogenerative combined cycle gas turbine power plant with a heat-only boiler (HOB).

Yet contemporary rates of ocean warming and local disturbances are jeopardizing the reef-building capacity of coral reefs to keep up with rapid rates of sea-level rise. This study compared the reef-building capacity of shallow-water habitats at 142 sites across a potential thermal-stress gradient in the tropical Pacific Ocean. We sought to determine the extent to which habitat differences and environmental variables potentially affect rates of net carbonate production. In general, outer-exposed reefs and lagoonal-patch reefs had higher rates of net carbonate production than nearshore reefs. The study found that thermal anomalies, particularly the intensity of thermal-stress events, play a significant role in reducing net carbonate production—evident as a diminishing trend of net carbonate production from the western to the central tropical Pacific Ocean. The results also showed a latent spatial effect along the same gradient, not explained by thermal stress, suggesting that reefs in the western tropical Pacific Ocean are potentially enhanced by the proximity of reefs in the Coral Triangle—an effect that diminishes with increasing distance and isolation.

First, we considered poorly characterized potential resource sites. For these so-called characterization sites, precursor missions would investigate the material properties and address strategic knowledge gaps for their use as ISRU feedstock. Regions of interest for characterization missions include the Aristarchus plateau, Montes Harbinger/ Rimae Prinz, Sulpicius Gallus, and Rima Bode. Regional pyroclastic deposits at the Aristarchus plateau and adjacent Montes Harbinger/Rimae Prinz exhibit remotely sensed low-Ti, high-Fe2+ compositions. They differ from the high-Ti pyroclastics at Rima Bode and Sulpicius Gallus, which are similar to the pyroclastics northwest of the Taurus Littrow valley (Apollo 17 site). Thus, exploration of the Aristarchus plateau would allow investigation of previously uncharacterized materials, whereas Rima Bode or Sulpicius Gallus would allow comparison to Apollo 17 pyroclastics. Any of these sites would enable evaluation of reported H2O/OH in these deposits. Second, we examined a possible site for a direct ISRU demonstrator mission. For a stand-alone end-to-end (E2E) ISRU demonstrator, a fuller understanding of the physical and compositional characteristics of potential feedstock is required for mission risk reduction. In this case, locations near preexisting sites would allow extrapolation of ground truth to nearby deposits. Because a Ti-rich pyroclastic deposit appears advantageous from beneficiation and compositional perspectives, we examine an example E2E demo site northwest of the Taurus Littrow valley. Hydrogen and methane reduction, as well as the Fray–Farthing–Chen Cambridge process, could be tested there. © 2021. The Author(s).

We present in situ CH4emission measurements of termite mounds and termite mound subsamples performed in the Amazon rainforest. Emissions from five termite mounds of the species Neocapritermes brasiliensis were measured by use of a large flux chamber connected to a portable gas analyser measuring CH4and CO2. In addition, the emissions of mound subsamples were measured, after which the termites were counted so that a termite CH4and CO2emission factor could be determined. Mound emissions were found to range between 17.0 and 34.8 nmol mound-1s-1for CH4and between 1.1 and 13.0 μmol mound-1s-1for CO2. A termite emission factor of 0.35 μmolCH4g-1termite h-1was found, which is almost twice as high as the only other reported value for the Amazon. By combining mound emission measurements with the termite emission factor, colony sizes could be estimated, which were found to range between 55-125 thousand individuals. Estimates were similar to literature values, and we therefore propose that this method can be used as a quick non-intrusive method to estimate termite colony size in the field. The role of termites in the ecosystem's CH4budget was evaluated by use of two approaches. Termite mound emission values were combined with local mound density numbers, leading to an estimate of 0.15-0.71 nmolCH4m-2s-1, on average, emitted by termite mounds. In addition, the termite CH4emission factor from this study was combined with termite biomass numbers, resulting in an estimate of termiteemitted CH4of ~ 1.0 nmolm-2s-1. Considering the relatively low net CH4emissions previously measured at this ecosystem, we expect that termites play an important role in the CH4budget of this terra firme ecosystem. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

This work is part of a research project which focuses on dynamic modeling of vehicles aimed at analyzing and optimizing the emission and fuel consumption. To model the driver behavior, the simulation control algorithm requires a predetermined speed-time curve as an input. The completeness of this driving cycle is a crucial factor in the simulation, and as far as the legislative driving cycles are not accurate enough, it is indispensable to develop our own one representing our narrower area and driving conditions. This article considers two common drive cycle design methods, comparing the micro-trip-based approach and the Markov-chain approach. The new driving cycle has been developed applying the Markov-chain approach and compared to a driving cycle introduced in our recent paper using the micro-trip method. The comparison basis is the Speed-Acceleration Probability Distribution, which sufficiently reflects the dynamic behavior of the vehicle, and the root mean square error, including parameters such as the average speed, average cruising speed, average acceleration, average deceleration, root mean square acceleration, and idle time percentage. The representative Bus Driving Cycle for Debrecen is prepared to be applied in the vehicle dynamics simulation for evaluating and improving the fuel economy of vehicles, selecting the proper power source for various applications and the optimization of the powertrain and the energy consumption in researches to be continued. © 2020 The Author(s)","Driving cycle; Markov chain; Micro-trip method; Real traffic data; Urban bus route",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103670620

Three scenarios representing nitrate fertilization regimes: limited (30 ppm), moderate (70 ppm) and excess nitrate (100 ppm) were compared under ambient and elevated CO2 (eCO2, 850 ppm) to elucidate their combined effects on root-surface-associated bacterial community abundance, structure and function. Wheat root-surface-associated microbiome structure and function, as well as soil and plant properties, were highly influenced by interactions between CO2 and nitrate levels. Relative abundance of total bacteria per plant increased at eCO2 under excess nitrate. Elevated CO2 significantly influenced the abundance of genes encoding enzymes, transporters and secretion systems. Proteobacteria, the largest taxonomic group in wheat roots (~ 75%), is the most influenced group by eCO2 under all nitrate levels. Rhizobiales, Burkholderiales and Pseudomonadales are responsible for most of these functional changes. A correlation was observed among the five gene-groups whose abundance was significantly changed (secretion systems, particularly type VI secretion system, biofilm formation, pyruvate, fructose and mannose metabolism). These changes in bacterial abundance and gene functions may be the result of alteration in root exudation at eCO2, leading to changes in bacteria colonization patterns and influencing their fitness and proliferation. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to International Society for Microbial Ecology.",,"abundance estimation; bacterium; biofilm; colonization; community composition; exudation; genetic analysis; nitrate; rhizosphere; secretion; wheat; Bacteria (microorganisms); Burkholderiales; Proteobacteria; Pseudomonadales; Rhizobiales; carbon dioxide; nitric acid derivative; bacterium; genetics; microbiology; microflora; plant root; rhizosphere; wheat; Bacteria; Carbon Dioxide; Microbiota; Nitrates; Plant Roots; Rhizosphere; Soil Microbiology; Triticum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096211351

Associated with generating electricity from fossil fuel are environmental consequences such as greenhouse emissions and climate change. On the other hand, the country is endowed with abundant renewable energy resources that can potentially ameliorate its energy needs. This article explores the viability of renewable energy using the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis approach on the key renewable potential in the country. The result indicates that geographic position, political and economic stability and policy implementation are some of the strengths. However, Government bureaucratic processes, level of awareness and high investment cost are some of the weaknesses. Several opportunities favour switching to renewable energy, and these include regional integration, global awareness on climate change and the continuous electricity demand. Some threats hindering the renewable energy sector in the country include land ownership, corruption and erratic climatic conditions. Some policy implications are suggested based on the findings of the study. © 2021 by the authors.

Utilizing the hybrid integration approach with the Low Emissions Analysis Platform model, the study investigates the implications for transforming rural communities to sustainable renewable based energy supply and quantitatively analyses the strategy integration based on four scenarios: the reference scenario and three composite demand side management scenarios. The results show that the integration of strategies has clear benefits with the composite scenarios availing reduced energy use with significant reductions in energy demand and greenhouse gases emissions. The third demand side management scenario provides the best performance among the composite scenarios in terms of demand and emissions reductions, energy conservation, and overall reduction in energy expenditures. The integration approach provides useful insights for design and implementation of localised energy policies across different sectors in the community where productive uses are taken into account for clean and sustainable economic production.

This article aims to narratively review the vector biology, YF vaccination program, environmental factors and climatic changes, and to understand how they could facilitate the reemergence of YF. This study comprehensively reviewed articles that focused on the interplay and complexity of YF virus (YFV) vector diversity/competence, YF vaccine immunodynamics and climatic change impacts on YFV transmission as they influence the 2019/2020 sporadic outbreaks in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Based on available reports, vectorial migration, climatic changes and YF immunization level could be reasons for the re-mergence of YF at the community and national levels. Essentially, the drivers of YFV infection due to spillover are moderately constant. However, changes in land use and landscape have been shown to influence sylvan-to-urban spillover. Furthermore, increased precipitation and warmer temperatures due to climate change are likely to broaden the range of mosquitoes' habitat. The 2019/2020 YF outbreaks in SSA is basically a result of inadequate vaccination campaigns, YF surveillance and vector control. Consequently, and most importantly, adequate immunization coverage must be implemented and properly achieved under the responsibility of the public health stakeholders. © The Author(s) 2021.

Nonetheless, it is unclear whether this demand will continue to increase or begin declining into the future due to increases in income or changes in fuel prices. This study aims to understand the long-run factors influencing vehicle ownership, in particular motorcycle ownership, in the context of a state in a developing Asian country, namely Sarawak, Malaysia. This study uses a vector error correction model to analyse the relationship between socioeconomic variables (including GDP, fuel price, level of employment and road length) and motorcycle ownership using annual time series data for the period from 1980 to 2017. The results suggest that long-run effects of income and fuel price elasticity regarding motorcycle ownership are estimated to be 0.376 and -0.351 respectively. The study reveals that both income and fuel price are inelastic for motorcycle ownership in the long-run and that motorcycles are considered a necessity good in Sarawak. These results provide useful insight for the government to construct effective policies related to motorcycle demand. While fuel price fluctuations may not significantly affect motorcycle demand, the full removal of fuel subsidies may lead to adverse effects particularly on the overall transport sector. Hence, it is important for policymakers to carefully design an appropriate fuel subsidy reform along with mitigating strategies particularly for vulnerable groups of the society, to achieve sustainable transport. © 2021.

The paper shows that adaptation strategies are often parallel strategies that can be integrated simultaneously with the management of natural resources. They can make resources more efficient and resilient to climate change. The paper shows that reducing the carbon footprint by more than 50 percent by 2030 and eliminating it by 2050 might be a viable solution how to tackle the climate change and support the environmental sustainability. © 2021 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,"Carbon footprint; Disasters; Global warming; Renewable energy resources; Adaptation strategies; Climatic conditions; Environmental sustainability; Industrial pollution; Natural disasters; Parallel strategies; Viable solutions; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104474460

Using established ES methodologies, we calculated values (in 2016 USD) for the United States Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a region virtually undisturbed by humans, but slated for future oil and gas drilling. We estimated the Refuge is worth about 1957 USD/hectare/year, equal to over 15 billion USD annually. Globally important services, such as climate regulation (e.g., carbon storage) and non-use services (e.g., aesthetic information), contributed the most value and were similar to valuations from more productive ecosystems. Local services made smaller contributions to the total, but they remain vitally important to local indigenous cultures. Strikingly, a contingent valuation survey of US residents found that, after neutral educational information, willingness-to-pay to maintain the Refuge in its current state exceeded estimated values of the oil and gas deposits. Our study shows that citizens may value Arctic habitats beyond their traditional economic development potential. Our comprehensive ecosystem services valuation suggests that maintaining the Refuge in its current condition (i.e., de facto wilderness) with its full range of ES is more valuable to humanity compared to development for oil and gas. © 2021 Natural Areas Association.

We compare the two datasets with an impulse indicator saturation technique that identifies hours when the relation between Chinese and U.S. reported data diverges in a statistically significant fashion. These temporary divergences, or impulses, are 1) More frequent than expected by random chance; 2) More positive than expected by random chance; and 3) More likely to occur during hours when air pollution concentrations are high. In other words, relative to U.S.-controlled monitoring stations, government-controlled stations systematically under-report pollution levels when local air quality is poor. These results contrast with the findings of other recent studies, which argue that Chinese air quality data misreporting ended after a series of policy reforms beginning in 2012. Our findings provide evidence that local government misreporting did not end after 2012, but instead continued in a different manner. These results suggest that Chinese air quality data, while still useful, should not be taken entirely at face value. Copyright: © 2021 Turiel, Kaufmann.

Developing countries, particularly in the African region, are highly affected by extreme events such as high temperature, usually followed/accompanied by drought. Therefore, studying the probability of occurrence and return period of extreme temperatures, and possible change in these parameters, is of high importance for climate-related policy making and preparedness works in the region. This study aims to address these issues by assessing probability of exceedance and return period of extremes in annual maximum and annual mean temperatures. The analyses of historical data in this study showed that extremes in both annual maximum and mean temperature are highly likely to be exceeded more often in the future compared to the past. For the extreme event marker (threshold) defined in this study, probability of 3 exceedances in the following 19 years (for instance), at any gridpoint, is estimated to be at least 10% for extremes in annual maxima and at least 15% for those in annual means. Most places in the region, however, have much higher (up to 20%) probability of exceedance. The estimated probability of exceedance has shown increasing tendency with time. Return period, based on the most recent data, of extremes in annual maximum temperature is found to be less than 6.5 years at about 48% of the gridpoints in the region. Similarly, return period of extremes in annual mean temperature is estimated to be less than 5.5 years at about 82% of places in the region. These estimates have also shown a strong tendency of getting shorter as time goes on. On average, extremes in annual mean temperature were found to have shorter return periods (4–7 years) compared to those in annual maximum temperature (6–10 years), at 95% confidence. The empirical results presented in this study are generally in agreement with IPCC’s projections of increased warming trend. This data-driven, robust method is used in the present study and the results can also be considered as an alternative approach for detecting changes in climate via estimating and assessing possible changes in frequency of extreme events with time. © 2021 by the authors.

The study was undertaken across two regions in Durban, South Africa, one with a high industrial profile and a nearby harbour, and the other with a primarily commercial and residential profile. Multiple hybrid models were developed by integrating air pollution dispersion modelling predictions for source specific NO2, SO2, and PM10 concentrations into LUR models following the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE) methodology to characterise exposure, in Durban. Industrial point sources, ship emissions, domestic fuel burning, and vehicle emissions were key emission sources. Standard linear regression was used to develop annual, summer and winter hybrid models to predict air pollutant concentrations. Higher levels of NO2 and SO2 were predicted in south Durban as compared to north Durban as these are industrial related pollutants. Slightly higher levels of PM10 were predicted in north Durban as compared to south Durban and can be attributed to either traffic, bush burning or domestic fuel burning. The hybrid NO2 models for annual, summer and winter explained 60%, 58% and 63%, respectively, of the variance with traffic, population and harbour being identified as important predictors. The SO2 models were less robust with lower R2 annual (44%), summer (53%) and winter (46%), in which industrial and traffic variables emerged as important predictors. The R2 for PM10 models ranged from 80% to 85% with population and urban land use type emerging as predictor variables. While these results demonstrate the influence of land use variables on air pollution concentrations, our study highlighted the importance of incorporating emission source information in order to capture local variations due to emission patterns. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Dispersion modelling; Hybrid modelling; Land use regression","Briquetting; Forecasting; Industrial emissions; Land use; Nitrogen oxides; Regression analysis; Sulfur dioxide; Air pollutant concentrations; Air pollution dispersion; Air pollution effects; Ambient nitrogen dioxide; Atmospheric dispersion models; Durban , South Africa; Interaction information; Pollution concentration; Air pollution; fuel; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; nitrogen dioxide; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); land use; nitrogen dioxide; numerical model; particulate matter; pollutant source; regression analysis; sulfur dioxide; air pollution; Article; atmospheric dispersion; bush burning; concentration (parameter); domestic fuel burning; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; industrial point source; land use; meteorological phenomena; particulate matter; prediction; predictor variable; ship emission; South Africa; summer; traffic; winter; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; Durban; KwaZulu-Natal; South Africa; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrogen Dioxide; Particulate Matter; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100265352

The new Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates, based on a simple carbon stock change approach, update published information on net emissions and removals from forests in relation to (a) net forest conversion and (b) forest land. Results show a significant reduction in global emissions from net forest conversion over the study period, from a mean of 4.3 in 1991-2000 to 2.9 GtCO2yr-1in 2016-2020. At the same time, forest land was a significant carbon sink globally but decreased in strength over the study period, from -3.5 to -2.6 GtCO2yr-1. Combining net forest conversion with forest land, our estimates indicated that globally forests were a small net source of CO2to the atmosphere on average during 1990-2020, with mean net emissions of 0.4 GtCO2yr-1. The exception was the brief period 2011-2015, when forest land removals counterbalanced emissions from net forest conversion, resulting in a global net sink of -0.7 GtCO2yr-1. Importantly, the new estimates allow for the first time in the literature the characterization of forest emissions and removals for the decade just concluded, 2011-2020, showing that in this period the net contribution of forests to the atmosphere was very small, i.e., a sink of less than -0.2 GtCO2yr-1- an estimate not yet reported in the literature. This near-zero balance was nonetheless the result of large global fluxes of opposite sign, namely net forest conversion emissions of 3.1 GtCO2yr-1counterbalanced by net removals on forest land of -3.3 GtCO2yr-1. Finally, we compared our estimates with data independently reported by countries to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change, indicating close agreement between FAO and country emissions and removals estimates.

Current debates tend to consider actions to respond to climate change as either adaptive or maladaptive, leading to binary framings of outcomes as either successful or harmful. To address this, our article considers the vast space that exists between success and failure in climate change adaptation, highlighting the importance of applying the concepts of successful adaptation and maladaptation jointly in analyses of such outcomes. To this end, we develop an integrated framework to examine the major adaptive and maladaptive effects induced by large-scale seawater desalination. Now a major component of water supply in cities and regions around the world, desalination is increasingly viewed as an adaptation to water challenges linked with climate change. Based on a comprehensive review of the (successful/mal)adaptation literature, we present a matrix that will help academics and practitioners think through the complex and overlapping outcomes of adaptation via desalination in the water sector. We then discuss the insights concerning the configurations of desalination's adaptive and maladaptive outcomes. Overall, we present a threefold argument: (1) that examining successful outcomes alongside maladaptive ones enables a more complete and nuanced understanding of the overall effects of adaptation actions and their spatial and temporal distribution; (2) that a consideration of this can help to highlight the tradeoffs and constraints that are inherent in adaptation in order to support decision-making; and (3) that a more complex approach to adaptation outcomes can assist in problematizing the social-political drivers and consequences of adaptation.

There are three scenarios as follows: (I) the 2014 baseline year emission, (II) 2020 emissions reduced via the Clean Air Act (CAA), and (III) other emissions reduced stringently via the Clean Air Act. Based on the Taiwan Emission Data System (TEDs) 8.1, established in 2014, the emission of particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5 ) was 73.5 thousand tons y−1, that of SOx was 121.3 thousand tons y−1, and that of NOx was 404.4 thousand tons y−1 in Taiwan. The CMAQ model simulation indicated that the PM2.5 concentration was 21.9 µg m−3 . This could be underestimated by 24% in comparison with data from the ambient air quality monitoring stations of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (TEPA). The results of the simulation of the PM2.5 concentration showed high PM2.5 concentrations in central and southwestern Taiwan, especially in Taichung and Kaohsiung. Compared to scenario I, the average annual concentrations of PM2.5 for scenario II and scenario III showed reductions of 20.1% and 28.8%, respectively. From the results derived from the simulation, it can be seen that control of NOx emissions may improve daily airborne PM2.5 concentrations in Taiwan significantly and control of directly emitted PM2.5 emissions may improve airborne PM2.5 concentrations each month. Nevertheless, the results reveal that the preliminary control plan could not achievethe air quality standard. Therefore, the efficacy and effectiveness of the control measures must be considered to better reduce emissions in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

We provide bulk and single-cell estimates of microbial biomass production from carbon and nitrogen substrates in cool, oxic basement fluids from the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The wide range in carbon and nitrogen incorporation rates indicates a microbial community well poised for dynamic conditions, potentially anabolizing carbon and nitrogen at rates ranging from those observed in subsurface sediments to those found in on-axis hydrothermal vent environments. Bicarbonate incorporation rates were highest where fluids are most isolated from recharging bottom seawater, suggesting that anabolism of inorganic carbon may be a potential strategy for supplementing the ancient and recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon that is prevalent in the globally distributed subseafloor crustal environment.

Optimal treatment for actinic cheilitis has not been established, and evidence-based estimates of clinical cure in the dermatology literature are limited. Here, we review and synthesize outcome data published for patients with actinic cheilitis after treatment with various modalities. A systematic review was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane library for English, French and German-language studies and references of included articles from inception to 20 January 2020. Studies were included if they reported on at least six patients with biopsy-proven actinic cheilitis. After quality appraisal, results of studies with the strongest methodology criteria were synthesized. 18 studies of 411 patients (published 1985 to 2016) were included. The majority of the studies were case series. Carbon dioxide laser ablation and vermilionectomy were associated with the most favourable outcomes with fewest recurrences. Chemical peel and photodynamic therapy were associated with higher recurrence. Adverse effects generally resolved in the weeks following treatment and cosmetic outcomes were favourable overall. In conclusion, there is a lack of high-quality comparative studies evaluating different treatment options for actinic cheilitis. The included publications used various outcome measures; however, the majority reported on the recently defined core outcome sets. These results suggest that both carbon dioxide laser ablation and vermilionectomy are effective treatments for actinic cheilitis. Prospective head-to-head studies are needed to compare these treatment modalities and to assess patient preferences. © 2020 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology",,"diclofenac; fluorouracil; actinic cheilitis; actinic keratosis; bleeding; blister; burning sensation; cheilitis; chemexfoliation; clinical outcome; data base; data extraction; disease severity; eating disorder; electrodessication; electrosurgery; erythema; hematoma; human; labial tension; laser surgery; lip disease; lip reconstruction; lip swelling; mouth pain; outcome assessment; paresthesia; patient compliance; patient preference; patient satisfaction; photodynamic therapy; postoperative complication; postoperative edema; postoperative hemorrhage; recurrent disease; Review; systematic review; vermilionectomy; xerostomia; cheilitis; prospective study; skin tumor; squamous cell carcinoma; tumor recurrence; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cheilitis; Humans; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Prospective Studies; Skin Neoplasms",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098050676

This article contributes to the emerging scholarship on climate litigation by exploring whether, how and with what effects such litigation interacts with the UNFCCC negotiations. For this purpose, the article contextualizes normative claims about the influence of climate court cases through practice-embedded views of stakeholders in the loss and damage context and provides a typology of loss and damage-related cases. Having due regard to the fact that litigation for liability and compensation of climate harms is still at an early stage, it argues that this legal avenue offers significant potential to advance the UNFCCC negotiations on loss and damage, and provides recommendations on how both spheres can be more strongly interlinked. © 2020 The Authors.

Grassland restoration research and management receives less attention than forests or freshwater habitats, although grasslands are critical for sustaining ecosystems multifunctionality and capacity to support biodiversity. In this article, we introduce a Special Issue which considers major trends and prospects in grassland restoration. We identified three key topics: First, restoration must confront widespread seed and site limitations, and new monitoring methods, including remote sensing techniques, are critical for restoration projects. Second, we highlight that restored grasslands typically require ongoing disturbance management and that research is required to determine optimal approaches for implementing this management during restoration. Third, global and regional restoration agendas should be harmonized with site-level goals, and syntheses of current knowledge and research needs must guide grassland restoration across scales. We also identify research gaps to be filled, and challenges which grasslands face in the future: (1) a need for careful target vegetation selection and climate-adaptive restoration; (2) lack of knowledge in dynamics and restoration of several regions and grassland types, including drylands and (sub)tropical regions; (3) increased importance of species arrival sequence, and high stochasticity of species establishment; and finally (4) issues of post-restoration management to guarantee long-term sustainability of restored sites. A new generation of research and restoration projects to bridge these gaps is necessary to mitigate environmental challenges spanning localities to the globe as we commence the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. © 2021 The Authors.

It was quickly recognized that reduced activities (lockdowns) during the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic produced major changes in air quality. Our objective was to assess the impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns on ground-level PM2.5, NO2, and O3 concentrations on a global scale. We obtained data from 34 countries, 141 cities, and 458 air monitoring stations on 5 continents (few data from Africa). On a global average basis, a 34.0% reduction in NO2 concentration and a 15.0% reduction in PM2.5 were estimated during the strict lockdown period (until April 30, 2020). Global average O3 concentration increased by 86.0% during this same period. Individual country and continent-wise comparisons have been made between lockdown and business-as-usual periods. Universally, NO2 was the pollutant most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. These effects were likely because its emissions were from sources that were typically restricted (i.e., surface traffic and non-essential industries) by the lockdowns and its short lifetime in the atmosphere. Our results indicate that lockdown measures and resulting reduced emissions reduced exposure to most harmful pollutants and could provide global-scale health benefits. However, the increased O3 may have substantially reduced those benefits and more detailed health assessments are required to accurately quantify the health gains.

This study reports on the relevant drivers of EV uptake, showing (i) that some sociodemographic attributes positively impact the propensity to choose an EV (e.g., young age and teenage children), (ii) that the presence and visibility of charging infrastructures are important, and (iii) that the role of tourism is not a driver of EV uptake. This study confirms that policies should consider sociodemographics, social practices, and physical infrastructures as playing roles in EV uptake.

The social, environmental, and economic factors in West Papua need to be linked to improving the HDI as one of the programs to achieve SDGs. The declining poverty rate in West Papua Province in 2010-2018 has had a significant impact on increasing the HDI of West Papua. This study aims to identify factors that affect the HDI and the dynamics and predictions concerning the Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP), agricultural sector development, and low-carbon development. This study uses the system dynamic method to understand the economic and environmental variables that affect the human development index. The simulation results indicate that the national GHG emission target can be achieved by a GRDP correction of 162.66 billion based on scenario 1 (29% reduction) and 115.55 billion based on scenario 2 (41% reduction). However, the West Papua HDI will only be corrected by 0.3 (Scenario 1) and 0.2 (Scenario 2). In conclusion, the total GRDP of West Papua was corrected with emission reduction under the 41% reduction scenario, but it does not significantly affect the HDI of West Papua Province. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agricultural robots; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Planning; Agricultural sector; Domestic product; Economic factors; Emission reduction; Environmental variables; Human development index; Low-carbon development; Sustainable human development; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104182973

This is in particular true for Central European cities such as Vienna, where 28% of the total CO2 emissions are caused by the energy supply for buildings. One promising option for environmental friendly heat supply is the use of shallow geothermal energy. To determine whether shallow geothermal systems are a feasible option to meet the urban heating demand, the Python tool GeoEnPy is developed and applied to a case study in Vienna. It allows the evaluation of the anthropogenic heat input into the subsurface, the theoretical sustainable potential, the technical geothermal potential, and the heat supply rate. The overall heat flow in Vienna is 17.6 PJ/a, which represents 38% of the current heating demand or indeed 99% once all buildings are thermally refurbished. The technical geothermal potential can satisfy the current heating demand for 63% (BHE system) or rather 8% (GWHP system) of the city area. GeoEnPy reveals that BHE systems are most feasible in the eastern and southern districts of Vienna. Our findings can guide integration of shallow geothermal use in spatial energy management focused on key locations to supply buildings with decentralised and sustainable heat from the subsurface. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Borehole heat exchanger (BHE); Geographic information system (GIS); Geothermal potential; Groundwater heat pump (GWHP); Heat supply; Subsurface urban heat island (SUHI)","Carbon dioxide; Geothermal fields; Geothermal prospecting; Anthropogenic heat; Current heating; Energy supplies; Environmental-friendly; European cities; Geothermal potential; Shallow geothermal energies; Shallow geothermal systems; Heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097089412

Black carbon (BC) has significant impacts on air quality and climate, however it is poorly characterized across the region. Here we report the first continuous measurements of BC and gaseous pollutants along the YR in wintertime, with an intensive observation period from November 21 to December 4, 2015, covering ∼7° longitude over the continent in China. The highly polluted periods (HPP) with NOx &gt;80 μg m−3 indicated more localized emissions. At the western (longitude &lt;118°E) and eastern (longitude &gt;118°E) ends of the YR valley, the HPP events reduced, mostly since the western end was influenced by terrain height and regional transport, and the eastern end was influenced by easterly oceanic or westerly continental air masses. In these regions, BC core size decreased by 5%–19% during the HPP, and had modes of mass median diameter in the range 120 –180 nm, which was found to be predominately from local sources, contrasting with a more consistent mode ∼200 nm that was due to BC from mixed sources. A comparison of simultaneously measured data from the nearby monitoring stations along the river demonstrated a high consistency of PM2.5 over the river, which reflected the important regional impact on the particulate mass. This study evaluates the shipping emission and regional influence over the YR and may guide the policy maker on mitigating air pollution. © 2021. American Geophysical Union.

Detecting structure within a graph is a challenging problem. This problem is studied over a range of fields and is sometimes termed community detection, module detection, or graph partitioning. A popular class of algorithms for module detection relies on optimizing a function of modularity to identify the structure. In practice, graphs are often learned from the data, and thus prone to uncertainty. In these settings, the uncertainty of the network structure can become exaggerated by giving unreliable estimates of the module structure. In this work, we begin to address this challenge through the use of a nonparametric bootstrap approach to assessing the stability of module detection in a graph. Estimates of stability are presented at the level of the individual node, the inferred modules, and as an overall measure of performance for module detection in a given graph. Furthermore, bootstrap stability estimates are derived for complexity parameter selection that ultimately defines a graph from data in a way that optimizes stability. This approach is utilized in connection with correlation graphs but is generalizable to other graphs that are defined through the use of dissimilarity measures. We demonstrate our approach using a broad range of simulations and on a metabolomics dataset from the Beijing Olympics Air Pollution study. These approaches are implemented using bootcluster package that is available in the R programming language. © 2021 The Authors.

The main aim of the work is to evaluate if the EDGAR inventory (despite its global coverage and independent approach to emission evaluation) is accurate enough, to be used for air quality modelling in Europe. To do so, the EMEP model has been run for the entire year 2015 using the 3 aforementioned emission inventories, and the resulting concentrations have been compared with ‘background’ monitoring stations. Results show that the air quality model, run with the 3 emission inventories, provide similar results despite important differences in emissions. EDGAR emissions provide slightly better validation results for PM2.5, while the EMEP emissions lead to slightly better results for yearly average NO2. The main differences among the model applications arise in the Eastern part of Europe, where the deviations between the officially estimated emissions and those independently evaluated by EDGAR are more important. Results suggest that EDGAR, despite being a methodology aimed at global coverage, with independent sources for activity level, technologies and emission factors and generic gridding practices, can be effectively used for air quality modelling in Europe.

The spatial relationships between these social and physical components of the energy system drive its ongoing evolution in response to technological advancements, economic trends, and policy directives. A low carbon energy system transition undertaken in response to climate change will require rapid and substantial changes to all of these elements and more. To capture these relationships and inform the design of a low carbon future, we propose the use of energyshed planning. An energyshed is the geographic area that contains the land, infrastructure, people, profits, and environmental impacts connected to final energy consumption. Four distinct decarbonization scenarios are explored: each pathway strikes a different balance between centralized or decentralized energy systems and corporatized or democratized energy system governance. Finally, the energyshed lens is used to perform an initial assessment of the barriers and opportunities for U.S. states to implement a near-term low carbon transition. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Decarbonization; Electric grid; Energy democracy; Energy geography; Energy system transitions; Energysheds",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101798861

Climate action is mainstreamed in various public policies in which spatial planning has a key role and operates as a coordinating framework as well as one that enables specific interventions. At the same time, land, an indispensable element of spatial planning, is gaining attention as a natural resource that is closely related to climate change. Increasing need for land protection raises the need for a renewed role of spatial planning of all types and levels. This paper examines issues of land protection related to climate change in a peri-urban area of the Thessaloniki metropolitan area in Greece and seeks to identify how the types of spatial planning contribute to land protection. It is argued that when viewing land protection from a climate adaptation perspective, a renewed relationship between the types and levels of spatial planning that demands emphasis be placed on their cooperation and the enabling of novel approaches such as nature-based solutions becomes apparent. © 2021 by the author.

Despite intensive experimental and computational studies in the last 4 decades, the exact nature of the prototypical square-planar [FeII(TPP)] complex (1; TPP2- = tetraphenylporphyrinate dianion) remained highly debated. Specifically, its intermediate-spin (S = 1) ground state was contradictorily assigned to either a nondegenerate 3A2g state with a (dxy)2(dz2)2(dxz,yz)2 configuration or a degenerate 3Egθ state with a (dxy)2(dxz,yz)3(dz2)1/(dz2)2(dxy)1(dxz,yz)3 configuration. To address this question, we present herein a comprehensive, spectroscopy-based theoretical and experimental electronic-structure investigation on complex 1. Highly correlated wave-function-based computations predicted that 3A2g and 3Egθ are well-isolated from other triplet states by ca. 4000 cm-1, whereas their splitting ΔA-E is on par with the effective spin-orbit coupling (SOC) constant of iron(II) (≈400 cm-1). Therfore, we invoked an effective Hamiltonian (EH) operating on the nine magnetic sublevels arising from SOC between the 3A2g and 3Egθ states. This approach enabled us to successfully simulate all spectroscopic data of 1 obtained by variable-temperature and variable-field magnetization, applied-field 57Fe Mössbauer, and terahertz electron paramagnetic resonance measurements. Remarkably, the EH contains only three adjustable parameters, namely, the energy gap without SOC, ΔA-E, an angle θ that describes the mixing of (dxy)2(dxz,yz)3(dz2)1 and (dz2)2(dxy)1(dxz,yz)3 configurations, and the «rd-3»expectation value of the iron d orbitals that is necessary to estimate the 57Fe magnetic hyperfine coupling tensor. The EH simulations revealed that the triplet ground state of 1 is genuinely multiconfigurational with substantial parentages of both 3A2g (<88%) and 3Eg (>12%), owing to their accidental near-triple degeneracy with ΔA-E = +950 cm-1. As a consequence of this peculiar electronic structure, 1 exhibits a huge effective magnetic moment (4.2 μB at 300 K), large temperature-independent paramagnetism, a large and positive axial zero-field splitting, strong easy-plane magnetization (g⊥ ≈ 3 and g∥ ≈ 1.7) and a large and positive internal field at the 57Fe nucleus aligned in the xy plane. Further in-depth analyses suggested that g⊥ ≫ g∥ is a general spectroscopic signature of near-triple orbital degeneracy with more than half-filled pseudodegenerate orbital sets. Implications of the unusual electronic structure of 1 for CO2 reduction are discussed. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Electronic structure; Ground state; Iron compounds; Magnetic moments; Magnetization; Paramagnetic resonance; Paramagnetism; Spin orbit coupling; Wave functions; Computational studies; Effective magnetic moments; Electronic ground state; Hyperfine coupling tensors; Spectroscopic signatures; Temperature independents; Tetraphenyl porphyrins; Zero-field splittings; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103647961

The government has established various forest area management mechanisms to create livelihoods, environmental services, and climate change mitigation efforts. This study aims to determine the contribution of village forests to the creation of livelihoods for the community through physical observation, social observation, and in-depth interviews. The Village Forest in the study location has advantages because it consists of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, so the biodiversity richness is very high. The strength of the village forest system is that it can be managed by local communities as a source of livelihood for 59.9% of respondents, but it is not yet optimal in its management as a source of income with the majority of respondents earning less than one million rupiahs (70% of respondents). Although, the majority of the 148 respondents (37.4%) are considered that the forest areas contributed to new types of work as a source of income. The potential for exploitation and degradation of forest areas needs to be considered because of the high frequency of people entering forest areas and opening access. The existence of village forests in the region directly or indirectly contributes to efforts to mitigate global climate change. It can be conserved and protected as a carbon pool and a carbon sink. The existence of various types of new jobs and potential economic opportunities from this can reduce the rate of forest conversion and exploitation by the community which is generally done to earn income. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Aquatic ecosystems; Biodiversity; Carbon; Forestry; Rural areas; Climate change mitigation; Economic opportunities; Environmental services; Forest conversion; Forest resources; Global climate changes; High frequency HF; In-depth interviews; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104890227

Results from the experimental chamber and industrial furnace were compared, and it was proven that the built system is reliable for LPC experiments. In-situ X-ray diffraction investigations during LPC treatment were conducted at the German Electron Synchrotron Facility in Hamburg Germany. During the boost steps, carbon accumulation and carbide formation was observed at the surface. These accumulation and carbide formation decelerated the further carbon diffusion from atmosphere to the sample. In the early minutes of the diffusion steps, it is observed that cementite content continue to increase although there is no presence of gas. This effect is attributed to the high carbon accumulation at the surface during boost steps which acts as a carbon supply. During quenching, martensite at higher temperature had a lower c/a ratio than later formed ones. This difference is credited to the early transformation of austenite regions having lower carbon content. Also, it was noticed that the final carbon content dissolved in martensite reduced compared to carbon in austenite before quenching. This reduction was attributed to the auto-tempering effect. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"Austenite; Carbides; Carburizing; Martensite; Microstructural evolution; Quenching; Carbide formation; Carbon accumulation; Carbon content; Carbon diffusion; High carbons; In-situ synchrotrons; In-situ X-ray diffraction; Low pressure carburizing; X ray diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101238648

The application of tabular jet in cross flow was adopted to test the effectiveness of synchronous control. The flow rate, height, direction, and relative molecular masses were studied in this research. Results suggest that the ideal damping ratio of the sound pressure amplitude can be as high as 73.7% under the carbon dioxide jet in cross flow case. The carbon dioxide jet in cross flow case can lead to a better thermoacoustic instability suppression result than the instances of argon or helium. Besides, amplitude and frequency switching of the unsteady flame emerged during the experiment. Adding minimal inert gaseous can change the local oscillation of equivalence ratio. The suppression ratio of NOx emission can reach as high as 44% under the carbon dioxide cases, which performs better than the argon or helium cases. Moreover, the flame length declines as the tabular jet in cross flow rate increases. When the flow rate increases (or the height decreases), the size of the flame front or root will decrease. The average flame length dropped from 122 to 41 mm. The macrostructure of the flame changes significantly under different injecting heights or directions.

Due to its limited water exchange nutrients have a particularly long residence time in the sea. While several studies have analysed the costs of reducing current nutrient emissions, the costs for remediating legacy nutrient loads of past emissions remain unknown. Although the Baltic Sea is a comparatively well-monitored region, current data and knowledge is insufficient to provide a sound quantification of legacy nutrient loads and much less their abatement costs. A first rough estimation of agricultural legacy nutrient loads yields an accumulation of 0.5-4.0 Mt N and 0.3-1.2 Mt P in the Baltic Sea and 0.4-0.5 Mt P in agricultural soils within the catchment. The costs for removing or immobilising this amount of nutrients via deep water oxygenation, mussel farming and soil gypsum amendment are in the range of few tens to over 100 billion €. These preliminary results are meant as a basis for future studies and show that while requiring serious commitment to funding and implementation, remediating agricultural legacy loads is not infeasible and may even provide economic benefits to local communities in the long run. © 2021 by the authors.

The Mekong Region is highly dynamic, experiencing extensive LULC change in recent decades. This study provides a spatially and temporally continuous estimate of LULC change for the Mekong River Basin for 2001–2019 using time series analysis of MODIS data coupled with a spatiotemporal carbon bookkeeping model to track carbon losses and recovery. The LULC change product has an overall accuracy of 74.4 ± 1.9% (82.1 ± 1.7% after consolidating tree-dominated classes), including an increase of 5.6% after combining with existing MODIS products (referred to as the M-CCDC process). Two of the largest components of LULC change in the region are the establishment of plantations and agricultural expansion, which were estimated to be 33,617 ± 7342 km2 and 14,915 ± 4682 km2 between 2003 and 2014. We found that 82% of the deforested area was converted to tree plantations. Among all the newly added plantations, 86% replaced natural forests and 12% replaced agricultural land. In addition, existing maps of annual tree canopy cover (TCC) were used to assess forest disturbances that do not result in LULC conversions. The M-CCDC results combined with the forest disturbances derived from TCC maps were coupled to a spatiotemporal carbon bookkeeping model to estimate carbon emissions and uptake. Carbon emissions were 72.9 ± 6.2 Tg C yr−1 during 2001–2017; emissions increase to 102.8 ± 8.6 Tg C yr−1 if including carbon not yet released to the atmosphere in the form of decomposing slash and wood products. Carbon uptake for the same period was −35.5 ± 4.9 Tg C yr−1, with carbon uptake from new plantations offsetting almost half of the emissions from deforestation in this area. Assessment of post-deforestation land use is crucial for quantifying the short- and longer- term carbon consequences of LULC change. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon emission; CCDC; Mekong; MODIS; Southeast Asia; Time series","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Deforestation; Land use; Radiometers; Time series analysis; Watersheds; Agricultural expansion; Anthropogenic carbon; Forest disturbances; Land use and land cover; Land use/land cover change; Mekong river basins; Overall accuracies; Tree canopy covers; Carbon; agricultural land; carbon emission; climate change; land cover; land use change; MODIS; nutrient uptake; plantation; satellite altimetry; spatiotemporal analysis; Mekong Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100692767

However, we know little about the effectiveness and heterogeneity of ETS in a context of developing economy. This paper evaluates the effectiveness and heterogeneity of China’s pilot ETS, the first ETS run in a developing economy. Difference-in-difference (DID) and difference-in-difference-in-difference (DDD) methods are employed to analyze provincial industrial-level data. The heterogeneity of ETS effects is also explored from regional and industrial perspectives. The empirical results show that the pilot ETS can effectively reduce pilot industries’ carbon emissions. The reduction effect of the pilot ETS has a substantial heterogeneity for different pilot provinces and industries.

To clarify the research status of climate change in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) regions, the BRI countries can better deal with climate change. This study aims to improve our understanding of the status and trends of research on climate change in the BRI regions. Based on keywords associated with the BRI and climate change, we undertake bibliometric research by collecting 21,225 related SCI/SSCI articles published during 2013–2018. Statistics and analysis revealed the topics and hotspots of research on BRI and climate change. Following findings are distilled. First, although the number of published articles exhibited a rapidly growing trend, their distribution is extremely uneven. Articles were mainly published by institutions from USA, UK, China, India, and Germany, while individual contributions from most BRI countries was less than 1% of the publication volume. Second, existing studies focused on climate change impacts on BRI countries, in addition, climate mitigation and adaptation in BRI regions, especially the assessment of climate change risks and measures and policies in response to climate change, was less watched in the research. Third, not all BRI regions have been examined by researchers. South Africa, South Asia, and West Asia and North Africa are hotspots, while the Pacific and Central Asia are largely neglected. In the future, BRI countries need to improve their research ability on climate change and more attention should be paid to the field of climate mitigation, especially on the assessment of climate change risks, measures, and policies, and BRI countries in the Oceania and Central Asia regions. © 2021 The Authors","Belt and road initiative; Bibliometrics; Climate change; Development trends",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104472964

We argue here that fungal endophytes, an important constituent of the plant microbiome, may be key to the ability of plants to adapt to climatic stressors. The rapid adaptive response of endophytes coupled with their ability to ‘transfer’ resistance to their hosts may fast-track plants' adaptation to climate change. We briefly review the importance of Class 3 fungal endophytes of terrestrial plants and discuss how they may accelerate adaptations to climate change in crops and natural plant communities and call for efforts directed at improving the understanding of fungal endophyte-facilitated plant health.

The application of lean combustion is facing many challenges such as slow flame propagation and combustion fluctuations. Under severe operating conditions such as low-speed lean-burn conditions, the weak in-cylinder airflow worsens the fuel and air mixing yielding difficulties in stable flame kernel initiation and consequently deteriorating flame propagation. In this study, the effect of flash boiling spray on flame kernel generation, flame propagation, engine performance, and exhaust emissions of the spark ignition direct injection (SIDI) engine under homogenous lean-burn conditions are investigated. A single-cylinder four-stroke optical SIDI engine was used in this study. The in-cylinder flash boiling and subcooled sprays during engine operation were compared using the Mie scattering technique. The in-cylinder flame propagation was recorded using a high-speed camera and analyzed using a digital image processing model. The results reveal that both subcooled and flash boiling sprays have collapsed, but the liquid phase particle concentration intensity of the subcooled spray was higher compared with flash boiling spray, indicating a higher vaporization rate of the fuel droplets in the flash boiling case. Consequently, the air-fuel mixing is improved, and the wall-wetting and fuel-rich regions are reduced. The flame images and combustion analysis demonstrate that flash boiling spray can effectively improve the flame kernel initiation and accelerate flame propagation. Additionally, flash boiling lean-burn combustion showed higher in-cylinder pressure, more heat release, improved IMEP with advanced combustion phasing, and lower cyclic variation compared to subcooled case. The color model showed that the premixed flame was enhanced under the flash boiling spray. This study shows that flash boiling spray can be an effective method to improve combustion efficiency in homogenous lean-burn mode under low engine speed. © 2021 SAE International.

As key precursors of formaldehyde (HCHO) and ozone (O3), the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in China are still increasing due to the lack of mitigation measures for VOCs. In this study, we investigated the drivers of HCHO variability from 2015 to 2019 over Hefei, eastern China, by using ground-based high-resolution Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and GEOS-Chem model simulation. Seasonal and interannual variabilities of HCHO over Hefei were analyzed and hydroxyl (OH) radical production rates from HCHO photolysis were evaluated. The relative contributions of emitted and photochemical sources to the observed HCHO were analyzed by using ground-level carbon monoxide (CO) and Ox (O3 Cnitrogen oxide (NO2)) as tracers for emitted and photochemical HCHO, respectively. Contributions of emission sources from various categories and geographical regions to the observed HCHO summer-time enhancements were determined by using a series of GEOS-Chem sensitivity simulations. The column-averaged dry air mole fractions of HCHO (XHCHO) reached a maximum monthly mean value of 1.10.27 ppbv in July and a minimum monthly mean value of 0.40.11 ppbv in January. The XHCHO time series from 2015 to 2019 over Hefei showed a positive change rate of 2.380.71% per year. The photochemical HCHO is the dominant source of atmospheric HCHO over Hefei for most of the year (68.1 %). In the studied years, the HCHO photolysis was an important source of OH radicals over Hefei during all sunlight hours of both summer and winter days. The oxidations of both methane (CH4) and nonmethane VOCs (NMVOCs) dominate the HCHO production over Hefei and constitute the main driver of its summertime enhancements. The NMVOCrelated HCHO summertime enhancements were dominated by the emissions within eastern China. The observed increasing change rate of HCHO from 2015 to 2019 over Hefei was attributed to the increase in photochemical HCHO resulting from increasing change rates of both CH4 and NMVOC oxidations, which overwhelmed the decrease in emitted HCHO. This study provides a valuable evaluation of recent VOC emissions and regional photochemical capacity in China. In addition, understanding the sources of HCHO is a necessary step for tackling air pollution in eastern China and mitigating the emissions of pollutants.</p>. © 2021 EDP Sciences.

Since 2010, the Chinese government has implemented low-carbon pilot policies (LCPPs) in some regions to control carbon emissions. To evaluate the implementation effects of the LCPPs, we matched China’s macro data with Chinese household financial survey data. Specifically, we used a OLS model for assessing the impact of LCPPs on China’s household carbon emissions and conducted heterogeneous analysis. Further, we evaluated the mechanism through which LCPPs affect the carbon emissions of Chinese households. The research results yielded three main findings. (1) LCPPs can promote a reduction in household carbon emissions; however, the impact of LCPPs on household carbon emissions exhibits a time lag. (2) LCPPs reduce household carbon emissions by promoting the upgradation of the household consumption structure. The LCPP enables households to reduce consumption of products involving high levels of carbon emissions, while increasing consumption of low-carbon emission products, thereby affecting total household carbon emissions. (3) An analysis of household heterogeneity revealed that LCPPs mainly affect household carbon emissions in the country’s eastern and central regions, especially urban households’ carbon emissions. This paper describes the implementation effects of LCPPs and suggests a viable path for the further implementation of LCPPs. © Copyright © 2021 Sun and Wang.","carbon emissions; China; consumption structure; household characteristics; low-carbon pilot policies","Global warming; Carbon emissions; Chinese families; Chinese Government; Household Consumption; Implementation effects; Low-carbon emissions; Low-carbon lifestyles; Research results; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104234095

This study explains the effects of carbon emission on the optimal balanced growth path by establishing an endogenous growth model involving exhaustible resources, human capital, physical capital, and labor time under one economy and a similar system involving two economic systems. The second system is used to analyze the interactions of polluting activities across the two economic systems that it covers. The results show that the negative externality (carbon emission) caused by one economy will bring remarkable adverse impacts on the optimal resource extraction and growth rates of other economies. If the people in one economy pay greater attention to the environmental problem (carbon emission), its own resource input will be lowered to reduce carbon emissions, but carbon emissions of another economy will be increased simultaneously to accelerate the economic growth. That is why carbon emission is one of the most challenging issues in global governance. Therefore, the global environmental pollution control needs the help of the cross-regional governance mechanism. © Copyright © 2021 Sun, Li and Zhou.","carbon emission; endogenous growth; exhaustible resources; human capital; two-economic-system","Carbon; Pollution control; Balanced growth path; Endogenous growth model; Environmental pollution control; Environmental problems; Exhaustible resources; Governance mechanisms; Negative externalities; Resource extraction; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105945957

This study aimed to investigate the patterns of global carbon productivity (CP) and reduction potential of CO2 emissions, from the perspective of income gap. A meta-frontier data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used for decomposing the change of TFCP and reduction potential of CO2 emissions into three components, i.e., technology gap, scale economy, and management. The panel data for 83 countries/regions during 1990–2017 was collected for the empirical study. The results show that: (1) during 1990–2017, the TFCP based on the global meta-frontier showed a slow rising trend, with an increase by 46.17%, technological progress was the biggest promoting factor, followed by scale efficiency and management efficiency; (2) the TFCP of countries with high income levels rose faster than that with low income levels, indicating that the income gap widens global CP inequality; (3) the global annual CO2 emissions reduction potential is 21,831.4034 million tons, of which 60.94%, 22.19%, and 16.87% are expected to be contributed by improving management efficiency, technological progress, and scale efficiency, respectively. In order to further improve TFCP, the high income group should focus on improving management efficiency. The middle-high income group should narrow the technology gap among countries within the group. © 2020","Carbon productivity; Global Malmquist index; Income gap; Meta-frontier DEA","Carbon dioxide; Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Emission control; Productivity; Carbon productivities; Empirical studies; Low carbon economy; Management efficiency; Promoting factors; Reduction potential; Scale economies; Technological progress; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098803299

The teaching of the value of caring for the environment has been widely recognized by society, however, it has been eroded by modernization. To overcome the gap in cultural understanding with low implementation and realization, then this research focuses on how philosophical values are imbued in the green village program based on the perception of the local elite? The survey result of 118 local elites had been distributed across 45 villages were processed using SPSS, in form of descriptive statistics. The applicative understanding of these values is not yet detailed and technical. Thus, the implementation of philosophical values for green village development planning is still limited. In order to enhance the inspiration and realization of the philosophy, it is necessary to develop the spirit, innovation, creativity, applicability, participatory and proactivity of the local elite. We prove that the local elite must be able to change the philosophical concept within real behavior to build a sustainable green village. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Philosophical aspects; Rural areas; Cultural understanding; Descriptive statistics; Pro activities; Research focus; Village development; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104825681

The south-west Indian monsoon strongly influences the study area, and heavy rainfall or cyclones which originate from either the Bay of Bengal or the Arabian Sea, also affect the region. Optically stimulated luminescence dating places the 8 m thick sediment sequence in the climate transition phase which ranges from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age. Multi-proxy analyses including high-resolution granulometry, magnetic susceptibility, ferromagnetic mineral concentration, facies major oxide geochemistry, and micro-fossil records (from two sedimentary units) are used to study these late Holocene flood events. The latter are characterised by multiple sediment facies, depositional events, changes in channel morphology, and distinctive flood signatures. Integration of these records enables to identify two distinct aggradations viz. phase I and phase II, as well as a relative change in channel morphology. The study describes 11 flooding events and their imprints over multi-proxy records. Historic documents and instrumental records from the town of Bharuch referring to floods, movement of channel sand, channel shallowing, and the dysfunction of the ancient port of Bharuch further validate the inferences drawn from the sedimentary sequence. The study exemplifies the need to use high resolution and multi-proxy studies to interpret paleoflood records and climate signatures in order to build archives of monsoonal rivers. © Copyright © 2021 Sukumaran, Sant, Krishnan, Rangarajan, Basavaiah and Schwenninger.","ferromagnetic mineral concentration; flood events; geochemistry; Little Ice Age; magnetic susceptibility; southwest Indian monsoon","Deposition; Luminescence; Magnetic susceptibility; Morphology; Rivers; Sedimentology; Sediments; Storms; Climate signatures; Climate transition; Depositional event; Medieval Warm Period; Multi-proxy analysis; Optically stimulated luminescence; Sedimentary sequence; Sedimentary units; Floods; geochemistry; Little Ice Age; magnetic susceptibility; monsoon; paleoclimate; paleoflood; Arabian Sea; Bay of Bengal; India; Indian Ocean; Narmada River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105210523

However, its insufficient specific surface area (SSA) and surface trace O affect the nucleation, nanostructures, and mass loadings of active materials, severely limiting the mass- and area-specific energy densities of electrodes. Therefore, it is of vital importance to achieving a higher SSA and preferred chemical composition. This work proposes a novel route to modify the surface with an N-doped carbon nanolayer (about 50 nm thick, ~1 wt% of the NF) and studies its influence on the morphology regulation and capacitive performance of NiCoMn-based carbonate hydroxide (as a case study). The preparation, chemical composition, and microstructure of the nanolayer are studied in depth. The morphology evolution of the carbonate hydroxide refers to shapes (from needles to flakes), flake thicknesses (5.2–18.4 nm), and mass loadings (0.8–6.0 mg cm−2). The optimized nanoflake delivers twice mass-specific capacitance and 4.5-folds area-specific capacitance of the nanoneedle at 1.0 A g−1 in aqueous electrolytes. The reversible capacitance is 1818F g−1 (909C g−1) at 10 A g−1, with 95% retention after 10,000 cycles. The solid-state asymmetric capacitor offers a maximum energy density of 91.22 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 400 W kg−1 that is highly competitive related to reported works. © 2020","Current collectors; N-doped carbon; Nickel foams; Supercapacitors; Surface modification","Capacitance; Carbon; Doping (additives); Foams; Nanostructures; Nickel; Supercapacitor; Asymmetric capacitors; Capacitive performance; Chemical compositions; Electrical conductivity; Mass specific capacitances; Specific capacitance; Specific energy density; Specific surface area (SSA); Morphology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100270436

Aims: The objective of this study was to assess the differences in the plasticity responses of the morphological, photosynthetic, fluorescence and antioxidant parameters of Robinia pseudoacacia seedlings under water, nitrogen and phosphorus interaction conditions. Methods: We analyzed the above parameters of R. pseudoacacia seedlings using methods of morphological measurements, gas exchanges, fluorescence emission and antioxidant assays under two water levels (75% and 55% of field capacity), four nitrogen levels (no urea; 0.2 g kg−1, 0.4 g kg−1, 0.8 g kg−1), and two phosphorus levels (no superphosphate, 0.6 g kg−1). Results: The results showed that drought stress significantly reduced the morphological parameters, actual photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (ΦPSII), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, peroxidase (POD) activity and catalase (CAT) activity of R. pseudoacacia seedlings, and significantly increased nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) and the malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Excessive application of nitrogen (N) fertilizer inhibited plant growth, and phosphorus (P) deficiency significantly weakened the positive effect of the high nitrogen treatment on morphological parameters under drought stress. The high nitrogen treatment effectively weakened the inhibitory effect of drought and phosphorus deficiency on chlorophyll formation. Proper N and P fertilizers increased the SOD, POD and CAT activities and decreased the MDA content under drought stress. The mean plasticity index of POD and CAT activities in response to water, nitrogen and phosphorus was the highest, which indicated that R. pseudoacacia seedlings can adapt to changes in water and nutrients mainly by adjusting their POD and CAT activities. Conclusions: These results may explain the better survival of R. pseudoacacia under the condition of limited water and nutrient resources, which is helpful for understanding the response mechanism of R. pseudoacacia to changes in environmental factors in the future. The results also provide scientific data and a theoretical basis for vegetation restoration and sustainable development of the regional ecological environment. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","climate change; drought stress; phenotypic plasticity; Robinia pseudoacacia; water and fertilizer coupling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100305417

However, city-specific insights in urban food-systems are often missing. This study uses a novel bottom-up approach to evaluate the environmental impact of the last-mile of consumers within the food-system. Primary data was gathered by means of a survey (N=663) to model the last-mile, which was combined with secondary data sets, largely from regional studies. Jointly, they informed our hybrid Urban Metabolism - Life Cycle Analysis (UM-LCA) model. This model allowed us to assess the likely environmental impacts of the food-system on global warming, freshwater quality and land use, in relation to urban food consumption behaviour. In our case study, we found that last-mile movements of consumers account for as much as 5.3-5.8 percent of the food-system's total global warming potential. This is a considerable share, especially in proportion to the impact share of all other transport for distribution in the system (11.5-15.6 percent). This is a result of the numerous shopping trips, and while the majority of visits is almost equally shared by motorized and active modes, the vast majority of kilometres for the last-mile is travelled by motorized modes (68.2 percent). Furthermore, interesting differences could be found between city districts in terms of transport modes used by households resulting in different last-mile impacts, which is relevant to explore further for potential policy interventions to stimulate active modes. Food will inevitably get on the urban agenda, and therefore it is important to gain city-specific insights in relation to urban food consumption and its impacts. This study confirms that the influence of consumer choices is considerable and therefore it is worth further mapping these to develop adequate sustainability strategies. We argue that the bottom-up approach provides for both a measuring and monitoring tool, as well as an evaluation tool of urban policy and design towards more sustainable food systems. © 2020","Bottom-up modelling; Environmental impact assessment; Food-system; Last-mile; UM-LCA method; Urban food consumption","Food supply; Global warming; Land use; Life cycle; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Sustainable development; Bottom up approach; Climate change mitigation; Global warming potential; Life cycle analysis; Policy intervention; Secondary data sets; Sustainability strategies; Urban metabolisms; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099466344

Objective: This review intends to provide an overview on the legal requirements for testing potential contaminants in herbal drugs used for the production of herbal medicinal products. Methodology: The following issues are described and discussed:. For the assessment of pesticide residues, Chapter 2.8.13 of the European Pharmacopoeia and Regulation (EC) 396/2005 applies, for heavy metals the general Pharmacopoeia monograph as well as the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Q3D guideline on elemental impurities. The Pharmacopoeia also includes limits and acceptance criteria for microbiological purity and aflatoxins, respectively. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are mentioned in Regulation (EC) 1881/2006 for food as well as in a Reflection Paper on herbal medicinal products. For several years, a potential contamination with pyrrolizidine alkaloids was discussed which led to measures being imposed on industry and health authorities. Results: Various examples demonstrate that the evaluation of data from daily analytical practice is extremely useful to gain an overview on the occurrence of residues and/or contaminants in herbal drugs and herbal preparations. Such evaluations might assist manufacturers in their individual risk assessment and the definition of their testing strategies and contribute to guarantee the quality and safety of the marketed products. Conclusion: Annual data evaluations demonstrate that a remarkable decrease of the pyrrolizidine alkaloid content burden in herbal drugs and extracts used for the production of herbal medicinal products has been achieved over the past few years. However, it has also become clear that this issue cannot be completely solved in the near future. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","contaminants; elemental impurities; herbal medicinal products; pesticide residue; pyrrolizidine alkaloids","aflatoxin; heavy metal; herbaceous agent; mycotoxin; pesticide residue; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; pyrrolizidine alkaloid; drug; plant medicinal product; Bacillus subtilis; drug contamination; drug impurity; drug legislation; drug purity; drug quality; drug screening; Escherichia coli; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; medicinal plant; microbial contamination; microbiological examination; nonhuman; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Review; risk assessment; Salmonella; Staphylococcus aureus; weed; drug contamination; herbal medicine; Drug Contamination; Herbal Medicine; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Plant Preparations; Plants, Medicinal",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071194922

The sensitivity of riparian vegetation to climate and other abiotic factors depends on interactions between properties of the ecosystem, like flood regime, and plant characteristics. To explore these interactions, we addressed three questions: (a) does the composition and diversity of riparian vegetation vary with the flood regime; (b) do abiotic correlates of vegetation, including climate and groundwater, differ between sites that flood compared to locations that did not experience floods; and (c) which plant functional groups account for differential plant community sensitivity to abiotic factors between flood regimes?. Location: Middle Rio Grande Valley, New Mexico. Methods: We used long-term observations of plant community composition, groundwater depth, precipitation and interpolated temperature from 24 sites spanning 210 km of the Rio Grande riparian cottonwood–willow forest to explore the relative importance of climate and hydrologic correlates of riparian vegetation diversity and composition. Results: Riparian plant diversity was higher at sites flooding compared to non-flooding sites. Plant diversity positively tracked shallower groundwater depth at flooding sites, but was best predicted by intra-annual groundwater variability at non-flooding sites. Plant community composition correlated with groundwater depth and air temperature at all sites, but at non-flooding sites, also with intra-annual groundwater variability and precipitation. Relationships between native plant cover and potential environmental drivers diverged strongly between the two flood regimes; non-native plant cover had only weak relationships with most environmental predictors. Conclusions: The current flood regime of a site determined the climate and hydrologic factors that best predicted riparian plant community composition and diversity. Relationships between plant diversity or total cover and groundwater, temperature, precipitation, or groundwater variability can change in strength or direction depending on a site's flood history, highlighting the importance of flood regime to predicting the sensitivity of riparian woodlands to future environmental change. © 2021 International Association for Vegetation Science","climate change; climate variability; cottonwood; flood; groundwater; New Mexico; plant diversity; plant invasion; Rio Grande; riparian; Tamarix; warming",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109116433

Similarly, oregano has been suggested as a potential CH4 mitigating agent. This study consisted of 2 in vitro and 2 in vivo experiments. Experiment (Exp.) 1 was aimed at establishing the effect of AT on CH4 emission in vitro. Two experiments (Exp. 2 and 3) with lactating dairy cows were conducted to determine the antimethanogenic effect of AT and oregano (Exp. 3) in vivo. Another experiment (Exp. 4) was designed to investigate stability of bromoform (CHBr3) in AT over time. In Exp. 3, 20 Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with four 28-d periods. Treatments were basal diet (control) or basal diet supplemented with (dry matter basis) 0.25% AT (LowAT), 0.50% AT (HighAT), or 1.77% oregano (Origanum vulgare L.) leaves. Enteric gas emissions were measured using the GreenFeed system (C-Lock Inc., Rapid City, SD), and rumen samples were collected for fermentation analysis using the ororuminal technique. In Exp.1 (in vitro), relative to the control, AT (at 1% dry matter basis, inclusion rate) decreased CH4 yield by 98%. In Exp. 3, HighAT decreased average daily CH4 emission and CH4 yield by 65% and 55%, respectively, in experimental periods 1 and 2, but had no effect in periods 3 and 4. The differential response to AT among experimental periods was likely a result of a decrease in CHBr3 concentration in AT over time, as observed in Exp. 4 (up to 84% decrease in 4 mo of storage). In Exp. 3, H2 emission was increased by AT and, as expected, the proportion of acetate in the total volatile fatty acids in the rumen was decreased and those of propionate and butyrate were increased by HighAT compared with the control. Compared with the control, HighAT decreased dry matter intake, milk yield, and energy-corrected milk yield in Exp. 3. Milk composition was not affected by treatment, except lactose percentage and yield were decreased by HighAT. Concentrations of iodine and bromide in milk were increased by HighAT compared with the control. Milk CHBr3 concentration and its organoleptic characteristics were not different between control and HighAT. Oregano had no effect on CH4 emission or lactational performance of the cows in Exp. 3. Overall, AT included at 0.50% in the ration of dairy cows can have a large mitigation effect on enteric CH4 emission, but dry matter intake and milk production may also decrease. There was a marked decrease in the CH4 mitigation potential of AT in the second half of Exp. 3, likely resulting from CHBr3 decay over time. © 2021 American Dairy Science Association","Asparagopsis taxiformis; dairy cow; methane; oregano","methane; animal; bovine; chemistry; diet; female; fermentation; lactation; metabolism; milk; Origanum; plant leaf; rumen; seaweed; silage; veterinary medicine; Animals; Cattle; Diet; Female; Fermentation; Lactation; Methane; Milk; Origanum; Plant Leaves; Rumen; Seaweed; Silage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100315060

In the northern regions, Arctic amplification has resulted in warming two to three times greater than global mean temperature trends. Unprecedented warming is matched by intensification of wet and dry regions and hydroclimatic cycles, which is altering the spatial and seasonal distribution of surface waters in Canada. Diagnosing and tracking hydrologic change across Canada requires the implementation of continental-scale prediction models owing the size of Canada’s drainage basins, their distribution across multiple eco-and climatic zones, and the scarcity and paucity of observational networks. This review examines the current state of continental-scale climate change across Canada and the anticipated impacts to freshwater availability, including the role of anthropogenic regulation. The review focuses on continental and regional-scale prediction that underpins operational design and long-term resource planning and management in Canada. While there are significant process-based changes being experienced within Canadian catchments that are equally—if not more so—critical for community water availability, the focus of this review is on the cumulative effects of climate change and anthropogenic regulation for the Canadian freshwater supply. © 2021 by the authors.

The study was conducted over Bengaluru (India), using PM2.5 (mass concentration of particulate matter having size less than or equal to 2.5 µm) and Black Carbon mass concentration (BC) data. Open-access datasets from pollution control board (PCB) were also utilised to understand the spatial variability and region-specific reduction in PM2.5 across the city. The highest percentage reduction was observed in BCff (black carbon attributable to fossil fuel combustion), followed by total BC and PM2.5. No decrease in BCbb (black carbon attributable to wood/biomass burning) was observed, suggesting unaltered wood-based cooking activities and biomass-burning (local/regional) throughout the study period. Results support the general understanding of multi-source (natural and anthropogenic) nature of PM2.5 in contrast to limited-source (combustion based) nature of BC. The diurnal amplitudes in BC and BCff were reduced, while they remained almost the same for PM2.5 and BCbb. Analysis of PCB data reveal the highest reduction in PM2.5 in an industrial cluster area. The current lockdown situation acted as a natural model to understand the role of a few major anthropogenic activities (viz., traffic, construction, industries related to non-essential goods, etc.) in enhancing the background fine particulate matter levels.

The introduction of congeneric non-native species, in particular, can be especially problematic for native species due to competition and hybridization. Here, we quantify the impacts of climate change on the distribution of an ecologically and economically important native species, Euterpe edulis, and on the invasion potential of its congeneric E. oleracea, across the Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot. We modelled current and future environmental suitability for both species, using a comprehensive set of algorithms and climatic scenarios, and quantified the extent of overlap of their environmentally suitable areas. Climate change reduced environmental suitability for E. edulis, but had neutral effects on E. oleracea. Current and future overlap areas, where competition and hybridization are more likely, were concentrated mostly in the southeastern region of Brazil. Our results suggest that native and non-native congeneric species respond differently to climate change, and that climate change and the introduction of E. oleracea are additional threats to the threatened E. edulis. We recommend avoiding new introductions of E. oleracea especially in the southeastern portion of the Atlantic Forest, and the maintenance of protected areas especially in the southern region. © 2021 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação","Atlantic Forest; Congeneric species; Ecological niche modelling; Exotic species; Hybridization; Potential distribution",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102022432

Eight historical periods, with differing amounts of Pb emissions, were distinguished: (1) Essentially no controls (1901–1960); (2) migration to limited controls (1961–1972) by conversion to a Pb-Zn smelter-refining complex and installation of SO2 collectors in 1961–1963; (3) completion to limited control (1973–1977) by the installation of a third H2SO4 collector and a low-efficiency filtration system; (4) maintenance of limited control with no changes (1978–1987); (5) migration to strict control (1988 to 1998) by updating H2SO4 collectors and installation of fertilizer and SO2 liquid extraction plants; (6) completion to strict control (1999–2000) by the installation of state-art technology filtration systems and roofing working areas; (7) migration to abatement (2001–2003) by implantation of good management practices; and (8) maintenance of abatement following good management practices (2004–2019). Based on differences between those periods, we reconstructed the evolution of the Pb emission reduction efficiency (ER in %) and Pb emission factors (EF in gram/ton) for the Torreón complex. Pb emitted by the complex over the past 118 years totaled 23,350–27,580 t, with most of it (63–75%) occurring when emission controls were negligible (pre-1960 period). In comparisons with other facilities worldwide (e.g., the USA, Canada, and Europa), the modification in Met-Mex for control the Pb emission occurred several years. Emissions from the primary Pb-Zn smelter-refining are released mostly to the atmosphere from the sintering, smelting, drossing, and refining. While Pb emissions from the facility have declined by over an order of magnitude to contemporary levels (≤ 12.6 t/year), the current Pb rates still account for atmospheric Pb levels that are 2–3 times higher the USEPA standard and still constitutes a major health threat in Torreón. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Atmospheric emissions; Emission factor; Particulate matter; Smelter and refining; Smelter filtration systems; Torreón","atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; equipment; historical record; installation; lead; management practice; smelting; standard (regulation); Coahuila; Mexico [North America]; Torreon; lead; air pollutant; air pollution; Canada; environmental monitoring; metallurgy; Mexico; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Canada; Environmental Monitoring; Lead; Metallurgy; Mexico",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099059003

Here, we investigated how the microbial characteristics of a Pinus tabulaeformis plantation responded to different management practices to identify the role of microbial characteristics in influencing the stability of soil organic carbon (SOC). We chose a Pinus tabulaeformis plantation on the Loess Plateau where forest management practices had been conducted since 1999. Five forest management practices were implemented: two at the forest level (P. tabulaeformis with and without ground litter), and three using different vegetation restoration approaches after clear-cutting (P. tabulaeformis seedlings, abandoned grassland, and natural shrub regeneration). Microbial biomass, soil respiration, microbial community structure, microbial metabolic function, and soil oxidizable organic carbon (OC) fractions were evaluated. Forest management practices changed SOC stability by adjusting the microbial characteristics (e.g. soil microbial community diversity and microbial metabolic function diversity). The result of path analysis was that the direct path coefficient of microbial biomass on soil oxidizable OC fractions was the largest, which was 1.499. Path analysis and redundancy analysis showed that microbial biomass had the largest direct influence on soil oxidizable OC fractions. Compared with other forest management practices, natural shrub regeneration increased the nonlabile carbon fraction by increasing soil microbial characteristics, and contributed the most towards stabilizing SOC, which enhanced the stability of the soil ecosystem on the plateau.

The miscibility phenomenon between CO2 and oil in nanopores is also changed during CO2 injection for enhanced shale oil recovery (EOR). The objective of this work is to develop a general framework of a theoretical algorithm and model to study the phase behavior and miscibility of CO2-hydrocarbon mixtures in shale formations. First, an improved vapor-liquid equilibrium calculation model is proposed to determine the phase behavior of confined fluids by incorporating capillary pressure with an adsorption-dependent equation of state. Second, by introducing the critical point judgment, a novel vanishing interfacial tension algorithm is developed to calculate the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) of the CO2-Bakken oil system in bulk and nanopores. The effect of fluid adsorption and critical property shifts is considered in nature in the model and algorithm. Results show that the nanopore confinement decreases the vapor-liquid composition and density difference, and thus induces the reduction of interfacial tension (IFT). With the decrease of pore size, the IFT decreases sharply, while the capillary pressure first increases under larger pore sizes and then decreases under smaller pore sizes. When fluid adsorption is considered, the IFT and capillary pressure will be further reduced. The MMP of Bakken oil and CO2 is reduced from 20.2 MPa at 50 nm pores to 17.5 MPa at 20 nm pores. Hence, the reduction of pore size leads to a decrease in MMP, which is beneficial for CO2-EOR. ©",,"Adsorption; Binary mixtures; Capillarity; Capillary tubes; Carbon dioxide; Enhanced recovery; Equations of state of liquids; Hydrocarbons; Phase behavior; Pore size; Solubility; Critical properties; Density difference; Equation of state; Hydrocarbon mixture; Minimum miscibility pressure; Model and algorithms; Theoretical algorithms; Vanishing interfacial tensions; Nanopores",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105048731

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affords a unique opportunity to test decomposition method. Based on a wind decomposition method, this study outlined an improved method to differentiate complex meteorological and anthropogenic effects. The improved method was then applied to investigate the cause of unanticipated haze pollution in China during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Results from the wind decomposition method show that weakened winds increased PM2.5 concentrations in the Beijing–Tianjin area and northeastern China (e.g., by 3.19 μg/m3 in Beijing). Using the improved decomposition method, we found that the combined meteorological effect (e.g., drastically elevated humidity levels and weakened airflow) substantially increased PM2.5 concentrations in northern China: the most substantial increases were in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region (e.g., by 26.79 μg/m3 in Beijing). On excluding the meteorological effects, PM2.5 concentrations substantially decreased across China (e.g., by 21.84 μg/m3 in Beijing), evidencing that the strict restrictions on human activities indeed decreased PM2.5 concentrations. The unfavorable meteorological conditions, however, overwhelmed the beneficial effects of emission reduction, causing the severe haze pollution. These results indicate that the integrated meteorological effects should be considered to differentiate the meteorological and anthropogenic effects on severe air pollution. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; COVID-19; Humidity; Meteorology; Pollutant emission","Emission control; Anthropogenic effects; Anthropogenic factors; Beneficial effects; Decomposition methods; Meteorological condition; Meteorological effects; Meteorological factors; PM2.5 concentration; Air pollution; air quality; anthropogenic effect; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; decomposition analysis; haze; meteorology; particle size; particulate matter; air pollution; air quality; airflow; Article; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental temperature; haze; human; human activities; humidity; lockdown; meteorological phenomena; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; quantitative analysis; statistical model; wind; wind decomposition method; wind speed; Beijing [China]; China; Tianjin; Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101223883

Here we constructed a large collection of F1 hybrids of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by spore-to-spore mating between homozygous wild strains of the species with different genetic distances and compared growth performance of the F1 hybrids with their parents. We found that heterosis was prevalent in the F1 hybrids at 40°C. A hump-shaped relationship between heterosis and parental genetic distance was observed. We then analyzed transcriptomes of selected heterotic and depressed F1 hybrids and their parents growing at 40°C and found that genes associated with one-carbon metabolism and related pathways were generally up-regulated in the heterotic F1 hybrids, leading to improved cellular redox homeostasis at high temperature. Consistently, genes related with DNA repair, stress responses, and ion homeostasis were generally down-regulated in the heterotic F1 hybrids. Furthermore, genes associated with protein quality control systems were also generally down-regulated in the heterotic F1 hybrids, suggesting a lower level of protein turnover and thus higher energy use efficiency in these strains. In contrast, the depressed F1 hybrids, which were limited in number and mostly shared a common aneuploid parental strain, showed a largely opposite gene expression pattern to the heterotic F1 hybrids. We provide new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying heterosis and thermotolerance of yeast and new clues for a better understanding of the molecular basis of heterosis in plants and animals. © 2021 Song et al.",,"acetylcysteine; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; transcriptome; Article; carbon metabolism; controlled study; DNA damage response; DNA repair; fungus growth; genetic distance; genome analysis; heat tolerance; heterosis; heterozygosity; high temperature; homeostasis; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein metabolism; protein quality; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA sequencing; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; upregulation; yeast",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103800155

Responding to the economic downturn, some governments have declared a “green new deal” to remedy unemployment and the economic crisis. Job creation has been suggested as a driving force for sustainable economic development and climate change action. However, the question of how many and what types of green jobs are required has not been systematically examined. Are green job openings and searches matching each other in terms of timing, sectors, regions, and salary? This study aims to explore the degree of matching between green job supply and demand using a big data analysis (BDA) of online job market recruiting services in South Korea from 2009 to 2020. The BDA of the Ecojob website reveals that green jobs are concentrated in Seoul and Gyeounggi‐do metropolitan areas. The number of water‐ and air‐quality‐related jobs is high within these sectors. Job searches in the water quality sector outnumbered job openings. The findings imply that green job creation policy should reflect timing, regional, and sectoral demand and supply data. Creating and matching green jobs is expected to reduce environmental harm, enhance environmental quality, and reduce unemployment. © 2021 by the authors.

Disc specimens with different diameters (25 mm, 38 mm, 50 mm, and 75 mm) were processed for the Brazil split test. The influence of microstructures on fracture initiation and propagation was detected and analysed by the combination of X-ray computed tomography scanning, digital image correlation approach, and acoustic emission monitoring. The investigation indicated that tensile strength decreased with increasing specimen diameter, and the relationship can be described by an exponential equation. Four tensile failure modes were observed in specimens with different diameters, namely central, non-central, central edge, and central multiple pattern. Larger specimens exhibited more complicated failure patterns (central edge and central multiple failure patterns) and a greater percentage of shear failure fractures. Strain concentration and strain reversal were observed, respectively, in mineral—inclusion-rich regions and pre-existing discontinuities regions. This possibly contributed to fracture initiation, propagation, and coalescence. Fractures tended to grow along with the interface of mineral inclusion and coal matrix, and they could have propagated into and connect the pre-existing discontinuities. The greater volume of microstructure in larger specimens resulted in fractures that were more complex and may have increased the number of shear failure cracks and led to failure modes that were more complicated. © 2020, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.","Acoustic emission; Digital image correlation; Microstructure; Scale effect; Tensile failure; X-ray CT",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095998234

Their implementation may turn out to be a compromise or the creation of effective interactions that dynamize sustainable development. To achieve the SDGs, it is essential to understand how they interact with each other. It seems that in the times of the climate and health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, caring for the environment and ensuring a healthy life and promoting well-being at all ages is the basis for environmental, economic and social sustainable development. The aim of the study is to compare the degree of implementation of the goals of sustainable development in the scope of goal 13 “Climate action” and goal 3 “Good health and well-being” in the EU countries. In addition, we analyze how trade-offs and synergies between these goals have developed. Data from the Eurostat database were used to achieve the goal. The study used the method of multivariate comparative analysis—linear ordering of objects. The technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method was used to measure the studied phenomenon. The results indicate a different degree of implementation of the sustainable development goals related to climate change and the improvement of health and social well-being. Only a few countries have synergy in achieving these goals, most of them compromise, manifesting themselves in improving one goal over another. In the group of analyzed EU countries, a simultaneous deterioration in the effectiveness of achieving both objectives were also noted. Our research also shows that energy policy is an important attribute in improving the achievement of these goals. The conducted analysis fills the gap in the research on the implementation of selected sustainable development goals and their interactions. It contributes to the discussion on increasing the links between them, in particular with regard to emerging compromises. This research can provide a basis for re-prioritizing and intensifying the actions where individual EU countries are lagging most behind. © 2021 by the authors.

The territory of the Altai Territory is intensively plowed. Soils are subject to destruction and degradation. The creation of forest belts helps to improve the water regime, increase soil fertility and increase crop productivity. They bind carbon, helping to reduce the greenhouse effect and offsetting industrial carbon dioxide emissions. The role of forest belts in improving the microclimate and reducing wind erosion has been well studied. The changes in the species diversity of weeds and the structure of agrocenoses depending on the structure and species composition of forest belts have not been sufficiently studied. The article presents the results of the study of the influence of poplar forest belts of different designs (2-, 3 - and 4-row) on agrocenoses. The regularities of changes in the height and projective cover of the weed and cultural layer, the composition of weed species, depending on the location of the agrocenosis in relation to the forest belt are revealed.

Hydrogen is considered as one of the major energy solutions of the twenty-first century, capable of meeting future energy needs. Being 61a zero-emission fuel, it could reduce environmental impacts and craft novel energy opportunities. Hydrogen through fuel cells can be used in transport and distributed heating, as well as in energy storage systems. The transition from fossil-based fuels to hydrogen requires intensive research to overcome scientific and socio-economic barriers. The purpose of this paper is to reflect the current state, related issues, and projection of hydrogen and fuel elements within the conceptual framework of 61a future sustainable energy vision.

Our study sites are located in Gurugram and Mahendergarh districts in southern Haryana, where the climate is semiarid and monsoonal with distinct winter, summer and rainy seasons; the soil is old alluvium, sandy loam in texture. In our study, the forest ecosystems at different locations in Gurugram district were dominated by: Ailanthus excelsa (IVI, 38.71) and Cassia fistula (IVI, 36.71) at Bhondsi; Acacia leucophloea (IVI, 52.27) and Balanites aegyptiaca (IVI, 41.66) at Gawalpahari; Anogeissus pendula (IVI, 89.20) and Acacia leucophloea (IVI, 70.60) at Raisina. While, the forests of Mahendergarh region were dominated by: Acacia tortilis-Prosopis cineraria (IVI, 235.75) at Salimabad; Salvadora oleoides (IVI, 279.62) at Sisoth; mixed forest at Duloth; Anogeissus pendula (IVI, 133.52) at Buddin. The trees, shrubs and herbs showed a log-normal distribution of plants as the niches were shared by several species. The Shannon index of diversity (H') for different functional groups of plants in the forests ecosystems were: trees, 0.290 to 2.610; shrubs, 1.300 to 1.825; herbs, 1.953 to 6.088. The aboveground biomass in the three forests of Gurugram district ranged from 30.48 to 62.04 Mg ha-1; the belowground biomass from 8.14 to 17.28 Mg ha-1. Shrub layer biomass varied from 7.53 to 18.91 Mg ha-1. There was a linear relationship between net primary productivity and diversity of herbaceous plants across forest sites (R2 = 0.601; P &lt; 0.05). More than half of the forest biomass was stored in the aboveground live tree biomass; the belowground carbon pool ranged 20.05% to 21.95% of total carbon pool. Total biomass carbon storage in tree layer in the forests of Mahendergarh district ranged from 26.86 to 80.57 Mg C ha-1. Net carbon flux from tree layer in the forest ecosystems of Gurugram district ranged from 2.675 to 6.032 Mg C ha-1yr-1. In the forest ecosystems of Gurugram district the soil organic carbon pool (SOC) (Mg C ha-1) was: 4.923 to 7.383 (0-15 cm); 4.182 to 6.693 (15-30 cm); 3.335 to 4.166 (30-45 cm); 2.500 to 3.590 (45-60 cm). In forests of Mahendergarh district, the soil organic carbon pool ranged from 2.088 to 8.283 Mg C ha-1 across soil depths. The soil organic carbon pool at 0-30 cm soil depth was 54.73% to 64.52% of the total organic carbon pool up to 60 cm soil depth. The soil carbon pool was regulated by vegetation composition and the spatial distribution of carbon in the soil profile. We suggest that the protection of forest ecosystems would serve as carbon sink in the long-term. Mitigation and adaptation options in the forest sector needs to be fully understood for formulating strategies for promoting sustainable development of the forest ecosystems. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Biomass; Carbon; Diversity; Forests; Nutrients; Tropical region",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108247851

However, a holistic framework for assessing such complex climate change risks has not yet been achieved. Clarity is needed regarding the interactions that generate risk, including the role of adaptation and mitigation responses. In this perspective, we present a framework for three categories of increasingly complex climate change risk that focus on interactions among the multiple drivers of risk, as well as among multiple risks. A significant innovation is recognizing that risks can arise both from potential impacts due to climate change and from responses to climate change. This approach encourages thinking that traverses sectoral and regional boundaries and links physical and socio-economic drivers of risk. Advancing climate change risk assessment in these ways is essential for more informed decision making that reduces negative climate change impacts. © 2021 The Authors","aggregate risk; cascading risk; climate change; climate risk assessment; complex climate change risks; compound risk; risk determinants; risk drivers; risk interactions; risk response","adaptive management; climate change; decision making; holistic approach; innovation; mitigation; risk assessment",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104589477

We evaluated plant traits and environmental variables determining leaf temperature in tundra shrubs and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions with field measurements on deciduous tundra shrubs, Salix myrsinites and Betula nana, and evergreen Cassiope tetragona and Rhododendron lapponicum. Higher leaf-to-air temperature difference was observed in evergreen, compared to deciduous shrubs. Evergreen shrubs also showed continuously increasing photosynthesis with increasing temperature, suggesting high thermal tolerance. For the deciduous species, the optimum temperature for net photosynthesis was between our measurement temperatures of 24 °C and 38 °C. Air temperature and vapor pressure deficit were the most important variables influencing leaf temperature and VOC emissions in all the studied plants, along with stomatal density and specific leaf area in the deciduous shrubs. Using climate data and emission factors from our measurements, we modelled total seasonal tundra shrub VOC emissions of 0.3–2.3 g m−2 over the main growing season.

The development history of China's refineries was investigated for the period 1949–2018, and future development trends were predicted until 2030. The historical VOC emissions from 1949 to 2018 were estimated based on source-specific emission factors, and the emissions in 2025 and 2030 were predicted under the business-as-usual (BAU), alternative control (AC), and accelerated control (ACC) scenarios. Each scenario consisted of a policy and a technical scenario. VOC emissions from refineries increased from 0.53 Gg in 1949 to 1.12 Tg in 2018; fugitive emissions were always the most significant sources of VOCs (40.0–43.9%), followed by end-of-pipe (28.4–31.3%), tank storage (18.3–25.3%), and wastewater treatment (5.8–6.6%) emissions. Provinces in the coastal area have experienced more VOC emissions than inland areas, and Eastern China currently has the highest VOC emissions from refineries. By 2030, China could reduce its current VOC emissions by 5.4%, 35.7%, and 62.5% under the BAU, AC, and ACC scenarios, respectively. The main pressure for reducing VOC emission from China's refineries will come predominantly from Northeastern China, followed by Eastern and Northern China. The improvement of the production processes, enhancing the airtightness of equipment and containers, and implementation of improved leak detection and repair system are the more effective measures in reducing VOC emissions, accounting for more than 40% of the total reduction. In addition, the penetration and removal rate of control measures for end-of-pipe sources should be further strengthened. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China's refineries; Mitigation potentials; VOCs Emission characteristics","Gasoline; Leak detection; Petroleum refineries; Volatile organic compounds; Wastewater treatment; Development history; Development trends; Effective measures; Emission performance; Fugitive emissions; Leak detection and repair; Production process; Reduction potential; Petroleum industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099774957

This paper provides a comprehensive study regarding the PHEV's optimum powertrain design, by means of a multi-criteria analysis carried out by the interactive adaptive-weight genetic algorithm approach. The optimization aims to simultaneously minimize the PHEV's fuel consumption, exhaust emissions, electric powertrain size, battery state of health, charging time and costs. To achieve these objectives, several PHEV's design parameters are optimized such as in-wheel electric motors’ torque curves, battery voltage and capacity. The drivetrain is also optimized according to the determination of the best configuration of gearbox and differential gear ratios, taking into account constructive constraints. Furthermore, the fuzzy logic controllers responsible for the engine/electric motors power-split management and gear shifting control are included in the multi-objective optimization in order to define the best membership functions, rules and respective weights. To guarantee robust solutions, the PHEV is optimized under different driving conditions, which is given by the combination of the FTP-75, HWFET and US06 driving cycles. To evaluate the optimum PHEV performance, it is also simulated under the WLTC driving cycle and a real-world driving cycle based on the Campinas city. The best trade-off configuration results in 39.57% decrease in vehicle travel cost along with 43.39% carbon monoxide (CO), 45.13% unburned hydrocarbons (HC) and 72.64% nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions reduction under the combined driving cycle. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Battery state of health; Exhaust emissions; Fuel economy; Fuzzy logic control; Genetic algorithm optimization; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles","Air quality; Battery management systems; Carbon monoxide; Computer circuits; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy utilization; Fuels; Fuzzy logic; Genetic algorithms; Membership functions; Multiobjective optimization; Nitrogen oxides; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Secondary batteries; Battery state of health; Design and control; Driving cycle; Exhausts emissions; Fuzzy logic control; Genetic-algorithm optimizations; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimization control; Optimization design; Plugin hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV); Fuel economy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102260467

However, dynamic biophysical and biogeochemical processes that operate at local scales are seldom studied in conjunction with structural ecosystem properties that arise from broad environmental constraints. As a result, the effect of SPA interactions on how ecosystems respond to, and exert influence on, the global environment remains difficult to predict. Scope: We review recent findings that link structural and functional SPA interactions and evaluate their potential for predicting ecosystem responses to chronic environmental pressures. Specifically, we propose a quantitative framework for the integrated analysis of three major plant functional groups (evergreen conifers, broadleaf deciduous, and understory shrubs) and their distinct mycorrhizal symbionts under rising levels of carbon dioxide, changing climate, and disturbance regime. First, we explain how symbiotic and competitive strategies involving plants and soil microorganisms influence scale-free patterns of carbon, nutrient, and water use from individual organisms to landscapes. We then focus on the relationship between those patterns and structural traits such as specific leaf area, leaf area index, and soil physical and chemical properties that constrain root connectivity and canopy gas exchange. Finally, we use those relationships to predict how changes in ecosystem structure may affect processes that are important for climate stability. Conclusions: On the basis of emerging ecological theory and empirical biophysical and biogeochemical knowledge, we propose ten interpretive hypotheses that serve as a primary set of hierarchical relationships (or scaling rules), by which local SPA interactions can be spatially and temporally aggregated to inform broad climate change mitigation efforts. To this end, we provide a series of numerical formulations that simplify the net outcome of complex SPA interactions as a first step towards anticipating shifts in terrestrial carbon, water, and nutrient cycles. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Carbon-water relations; Emerging properties; Numerical modeling; Resource limitation; Soil-plant-microbe feedbacks; Spatiotemporal scaling; Symbiosis","biogeochemical cycle; climate change; ecological theory; ecosystem structure; leaf area; leaf area index; understory; water use; Coniferophyta",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079240122

This review is an attempt to synthesize information pertaining to the applications of various genomic tools and statistical models that are available to identify climate-resilient dairy cows. The different functional and economical traits which govern milk production play a significant role in determining the cost of milk production. Thus, identification of these traits may revolutionize the breeding programs to develop climate-resilient dairy cattle. Moreover, the genotype–environment interaction also influences the performance of dairy cattle especially during a challenging situation. The recent advancement in molecular biology has led to the development of a few biotechnological tools and statistical models like next-generation sequencing (NGS), microarray technology, whole transcriptome analysis, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) which can be used to quantify the molecular mechanisms which govern the climate resilience capacity of dairy cows. Among these, the most preferred option for researchers around the globe was GWAS as this approach jointly takes into account all the genotype, phenotype, and pedigree information of farm animals. Furthermore, selection signatures can also help to demarcate functionally important regions in the genome which can be used to detect potential loci and candidate genes that have undergone positive selection in complex milk production traits of dairy cattle. These identified biomarkers can be incorporated in the existing breeding policies using genomic selection to develop climate-resilient dairy cattle. © Copyright © 2021 Silpa, König, Sejian, Malik, Nair, Fonseca, Maia and Bhatta.","dairy (cows); genome-wide association study; heat stress; molecular markers; thermoregulation","biological marker; biological model; breeding; climate resilience; cow milk; cross breeding; dairy cattle; dairy industry; economics; genome-wide association study; genomics; genotype; genotype environment interaction; heat stress; high throughput sequencing; microarray analysis; milk production; milk yield; nonhuman; phenotype; quantitative genetics; Review; statistical model; whole transcriptome sequencing",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106065768

Such energy transitions are highly complex societal processes, however, necessitating intensive collaboration among regional and national governments, energy companies and utilities, research institutions, advocacy groups, and local communities. Although there has been a rising interest in collaborative approaches such as co-creation in energy transition studies, existing literature on this topic sometimes lacks theoretical rigour or faces problems in practical application. This poses a challenge in assessing what makes co-creation useful for accelerating energy transitions. The aim of this paper is to critically review co-creation and other selected collaborative approaches across the public sector literature in order to develop an assessment framework for co-creation in strategic planning for energy transitions. Based on this review, we suggest that co-creation can be assessed according to the following criteria: 1) the involvement of actors (state, market, community, and third sector) and their roles in different phases (initiation, design, and implementation) of co-creation; 2) the use of four sets of activities (expectation alignment, social learning, resource acquisition, assessment, and evaluation) to foster transformative power; and 3) the outcomes of co-creation. The latter may include new knowledge, new relationships, and new solutions, as well as increased efficiency and social acceptability of the transition processes. We illustrate the application of this conceptual framework with an example from an ongoing energy transition led by the ProjectZero organization in Sønderborg, Denmark. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Co-creation; Co-production; Critical review; Strategic energy planning; Urban energy transitions",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100615065

Although in recent years shared access-based business models have attracted the attention of the scientific community from a sustainability perspective, a very different family of circular business models are in fact being deployed in other markets and have not yet been studied from a sustainability perspective. These circular business models are product lease and pay-per-use, which are now offered by more than ten companies in the Dutch market. However, whether these business models represent environmental and material benefits is still in question. In this article, we apply a dynamic life cycle assessment modelling framework to study the material use and climate change impact implications of the long-term and potentially large-scale adoption of these two circular business models in the Dutch market of washing machines towards 2050, considering the energy transition of three regions: The Dutch, European, and global regions. Of nine scenarios modelled, the large scale and quick adoption of product leasing will represent the largest material use benefits, followed by the pay-per-wash model, both comparable to the material benefits obtained by other well studied shared-access business models. In climate change impact mitigation, the benefits of the circular business models are dwarfed by the benefits of a decarbonized electricity. Yet, with a successful energy transition, we could expect a re-prioritization of the life cycle of energy intensive appliances regarding climate change impacts in the future, from the use phase to the use and production phase, equally. © 2021","Circular business models; Life cycle assessment; Material flow assessment; Product service systems; Stock dynamics","Climate models; Commerce; Domestic appliances; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Washing; Climate change impact; Energy transitions; European Countries; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Modelling framework; Production phase; Re-prioritization; Scientific community; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099775850

New Hydrological Insights for the Region: The total streamflow in the future is projected to have widespread uncertainty in the magnitude but shows noticeable changes in the seasonality. Of the two SHPs, the one utilizing high flows with low hydraulic head shows a power generation behaviour similar to streamflow projections. Its annual hydropower production is projected to change by 2 to 21% (RCP4.5) and -5 to 40% (RCP8.5) by the end of the century. The other plant that uses lesser flows but high head maintains its designed power production consistently throughout the century.

We observed that total and saprotrophic richness decreased but ectomycorrhizal richness increased with increase in elevation. Elevational range size and nestedness analyses illustrated that saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal source communities were located at lower and higher elevations, respectively. The observed total and saprotrophic richness were directly influenced by soil properties and indirectly influenced by climate and plant communities. Ectomycorrhizal fungal richness was affected by climate and the dominance of ectomycorrhizal trees.

To reduce the negative climate change impact, the United Union's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) set a goal to limit global warming to 1.5 °C relative to pre-industrial levels based on the previous 2.0 °C target in October 2018. To understand the necessity of more stringent emission reduction, this study investigates the impacts of additional 0.5 °C global warming from 1.5 to 2.0 °C on global extreme precipitation, and especially its socioeconomic consequences. The extreme precipitation is represented by extreme precipitation frequency (R95pF), extreme precipitation percentage (R95pT), and maximum one-day precipitation (RX1day) as indicators, calculated based on daily precipitation data extracted from 29 Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) global climate models (GCMs) under two representative concentration pathways: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The exposures of economy and population to extreme precipitation events are also computed and compared for two warming levels by using the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The results show that most regions in the world are likely to suffer from increasing extreme precipitation hazards in a warming climate, with ascending gross domestic product (GDP) and population being exposed to extreme dangers with an additional 0.5 °C warming. R95pT and RX1day are projected to increase overwhelmingly throughout all continents, directly leading to intensified precipitation extremes and flash floods. In middle and low latitudes, the annual total wet-day precipitation (PRCPTOT) shows a rich-get-richer trend and R95pF decreases, which will reinforce the intensified trend of the magnitude of extreme precipitation. The exposures of GDP and population in regions with extensive exposure to extreme precipitation events at the 1.5 °C warming increase more remarkably with the additional 0.5 °C warming.

Miscanthus species have restricted to investigate functional genomics of their large genome size, which leads to challenges to genomics-aided crop improvement. Sequencing of the plastid genomes of Miscanthus is one of complementary tool making it available for genetic researches. Results: The complete chloroplast (cp) genomes of five Miscanthus species were sequenced using Illumina sequencing. Comparisons between the five chloroplast genome sequences revealed their conservation in gene content and order, including the IR/SC boundaries. However, some hotspots in coding regions and intergenic regions also occurred. Specifically a 13 bp deletion in the intergenic region of rps16-trnQ and a 17 bp deletion in rps4-trnT are shared by Miscanthus lutarioriparius L., Miscanthus sacchariflorus N. and Miscanthus × giganteus. In addition, a 39 bp deletion in trnL-trnF is shared by Miscanthus sinensis A. and Miscanthus floridulus W. Comparisons of complete chloroplast genome of Miscanthus lutarioriparius to five published grass chloroplast genomes also reveal several hotspot regions with high polymorphism. Phylogenetic analysis based on complete chloroplast genomes and coding sequences of 77 protein genes suggest a sister relationship between the Eumiscanthus clade and the Triarrhena clade. Conclusions: This report is the first comprehensive comparative analyses on Miscanthus species cp genome combining other published grass chloroplast genomes. The availability of these results will supplement valuable genetic information and framework for further phylogeography, population genetics and plastid genetic engineering researches in Miscanthus.sp. © 2021","Chloroplast genome; Miscanthus species; Multiple comparison; Phylogenomics; Structural changes; Taxonomic identification","Crops; Genetic engineering; Comparative analysis; Functional genomics; Genetic information; Miscanthus sinensis; Nutrient requirement; Phylogenetic analysis; Population genetics; Water use efficiency; Genes; Miscanthus; Miscanthus floridulus; Miscanthus sacchariflorus; Miscanthus sinensis; Miscanthus x giganteus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099400209

However, the effect of microbial action on CGS in deep saline aquifer is unclear. In this paper, numerical simulations based on previous experimental data were conducted to investigate CO2 solubility-trapping and mineral-trapping by microbial-mediated process in CGS demonstration base in Ordos, north of China. The simulation results reveal that the presence of a microbial community has a positive influence on CGS, mainly in terms of the amount of CO2 that can be injected and the manner by which it is stored. With the effect of microbial action, the amount of injected CO2 was increased by 23.33% and the CO2 mineral sequestration increased from 1.12 to 2.05%. In addition, microbial action plays different roles at different stages of CGS. In the initial stage of CO2 injection, the microbial action promotes dissolution of calcite, oligoclase and clay minerals such as chlorite and kaolinite, providing a favorable condition (more K+, Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, Fe2+ and HCO3−) for CO2 mineral-trapping. In the following stage of CGS, microbial action accelerates the precipitation of carbon-fixing minerals such as calcite and siderite, enhancing the CO2 storage security in deep saline aquifer. As such, secondary minerals such as ferroan dolomite and dawsonite were observed in advance in microbially mediated CO2–saline–sandstone interactions, further indicating that microbes play a positive role in CO2 mineral-trapping. Consequently, the microbial action can promote mineral capture of CO2 and increase the CO2 storage security in deep saline aquifer. These conclusions can provide a reference and basis for the suitability assessment of CGS in such deep saline aquifer like Erdos, China. © 2020, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.","CO2 geological storage (CGS); Microbial action; Numerical model; Precipitation and dissolution of minerals",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096312958

This study quantifies the significance of SLBs under different climates over the globe for the first time, and investigates the long-term trends in SLBs where there is significant existence of SLB. The results demonstrate that climate type plays a leading role in the significance and trends of global SLBs while special surface conditions, ocean currents, and landscapes explain abnormal cases.

These continued issues highlight the need for further mobile source NOX reductions to help California and other areas meet ambient air quality targets mandated by the U.S. EPA. Beginning in 2014, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) launched a program aimed at demonstrating technologies that could enable heavy-duty on-highway engines to reach tailpipe NOX levels up to 90% below the current standards, which were implemented in 2010. At the same time, mandated improvements to greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) require that these NOX reductions be achieved without sacrificing fuel consumption and increasing GHG emissions. The CARB demonstration program has progressed through several stages since it was initiated, and the Stage 3 Low NOX program completed in 2020 represents the culmination of these technology demonstration efforts. This effort, using a 2017 production diesel engine as a baseline, demonstrated a combination of technologies that enabled Low NOX emission levels near the 90% reduction target, while at the same time maintaining GHG emission rates at the same levels as the base engine. Previous publications have gone into detail regarding individual elements of the Stage 3 technology package. This paper will present a summary of the final configuration and final results of the Stage 3 program, including results for the fully aged aftertreatment system after the equivalent of 435,000 miles of operation. The performance of the final test article will be shown over a variety of both regulatory duty cycles and other off-cycle operations. The final fuel consumption and GHG performance of the system will also be described based on the benchmarking methods specified by EPA in the Phase 2 GHG standards. © 2021 SAE International.

Plants decipher their complex habitat situations by sensing the environmental stimuli and molecular patterns and associated with microbes, herbivores and dangers. Perception of these cues generates inter/intracellular signals that induce modifications of plant metabolism and physiology. Signals can also be transferred between plants via different mechanisms, which we classify as wired- and wireless communications. Wired communications involve direct signal transfers between plants mediated by mycorrhizal hyphae and parasitic plant stems. Wireless communications involve plant volatile emissions and root exudates elicited by microbes/insects, which enable inter-plant signalling without physical contact. These producer-plant signals induce microbiome adaptation in receiver plants via facilitative or competitive mechanisms. Receiver plants eavesdrop to anticipate responses to improve fitness against stresses.

Therefore, this experiment was conducted to investigate the responses of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) exposed pot marigold plants to various levels of MWCNT. Calendula officinalis (L.) seedlings were cultivated in Pb and Cd-polluted soils with exposure to 0, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1000 mg L−1 of MWCNT. The results demonstrated that foliar-applied MWCNT up to 250 mg L−1 not only alleviated Pb and Cd-induced toxicity by reducing oxidative damage and boosting both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defense system but also promoted the phytoremediation property of pot marigold plants by enhancing the accumulation of both Pb and Cd from the soil. Interestingly, oxidative damage exacerbation and both Pb and Cd accumulation reduction were noticed in pot marigold seedlings exposed to 500 and 1000 mg L−1 MWCNTs. The findings of this study clearly showed that the use of appropriate concentrations of MWCNTs in increasing the phytoremediation properties of pot marigold was justified, while the use of high concentrations is toxic to the plant and intensifies the toxic effects of heavy metals (HMs) on plant physiology. This study provides a novel method to facilitate the phytoremediation of HMs polluted soils using MWCNT as well as explores the potential risks of these nanoparticles to the plants. © 2021 The Authors","Antioxidant defense system; Heavy metals; Oxidative stress; Phytoremediation","ascorbate peroxidase; cadmium; catalase; dehydroascorbic acid reductase; glutathione; glutathione reductase; hydrogen peroxide; lead; monodehydroascorbate reductase; multi walled nanotube; oxidoreductase; superoxide dismutase; unclassified drug; antioxidant; cadmium; carbon nanotube; glutathione; heavy metal; lead; angiosperm; antioxidant; cadmium; carbon nanotube; defense mechanism; growth response; lead; oxidative stress; phytoremediation; redox conditions; soil pollution; Article; bioaccumulation; Calendula officinalis; concentration (parameter); controlled study; enzyme activity; leaf tissue; nonhuman; oxidative stress; phytoremediation; phytotoxicity; plant growth; plant leaf; plant physiology; risk; seedling; soil pollution; analysis; bioremediation; Calendula; drug effect; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; oxidative stress; soil; soil pollutant; toxicity; Calendula officinalis; Antioxidants; Biodegradation, Environmental; Cadmium; Calendula; Glutathione; Lead; Metals, Heavy; Nanotubes, Carbon; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Seedlings; Soil; Soil Pollutants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101054253

The world clearly needs to move rapidly to the alternative sources of environment-friendly, carbon-neutral, clean and renewable energy. To this end, amongst the promising strategies being pursued, one of the best approaches is to produce hydrogen energy from water by using sunlight, with unlimited available resource of both water and sunlight. Concurrently, there is also an emergent need to control CO2 emissions by reducing them to valuable fuels or chemicals using sunlight. For both these goals, it is essential to have efficient, robust and affordable photocatalysts. The early emphasis on semiconductor photocatalysts along with expensive noble-metals co-catalysts has prevented the speedy advance of this energy technology. Extensive efforts are now being expended on designing high-performance photocatalysts based on emergent functional materials endowed with a fascinating set of physical and chemical properties. Towards this end, two-dimensional (2D) materials and their heterostructures have been attracting significant attention lately as potentially viable candidates owing to their unique, and highly tunable optical and electronics functionalities, which are technically adequate for the efficient hydrogen production and conversion of CO2 to fuels. In this topical review, we address the recent progress made in the domain. We believe that by virtue of the uniquely distinct characteristics of their electronic density of states, surface states, high surface area, and diverse possibilities of innovative surface chemical engineering, the 2D materials hold a great promise for facilitating economically viable renewable/clean energy harvesting solution(s) on commercial-scale, thereby accomplishing the urgent task of ensuring the future energy security for the world. © 2021 The Author(s).

Majority of ships coming in and out of its course with diverse purposes are ocean-going air pollutants to coastal environment. This study estimated air pollutant emissions from ships in each port and its course, and analyzed their contributions considering domestic status in 2015 with the use of specifications of passenger ships, cargo ships, and fishing vessels. Emissions from ships were estimated to be 54,365 ton/yr for CO, 151,693 ton/yr for NOx, 38,467 ton/yr for SOx, 6,931 ton/yr for PM-10, 6,378 ton/yr for PM-2.5 and 18,003 ton/yr for VOC. Fishing vessels are attributable to 84% of total CO emission and 82.1% of total VOC emission, while cargo ships represent higher contributions on NOx(56.5%), SOx(95.4%), PM-10 (70.8%) and PM-2.5 (69.7%). On the other hand, passenger ships have a relatively low contributions to emissions by pollutants compared to other ships. When it comes to coastal environment, CO, NOx, and VOC are analyzed to represent the highest contributions, whereas SOxand PM-10, PM-2.5 have shown higher contributions in coastal cities. In coastal cities, SOxemissions are 7,487 ton/yr in Busan, 6,172 ton/yr in Jeonnam, and 3,468 ton/yr in Ulsan and each accounts for 26.5%, 21.8%, and 12.3% of total emission demonstrating higher contributions in that order. The expected outcomes of this study will provide guidance for establishing measures to reduce air pollution by ships and will analyze its effect. © 2021.

Using new data on energy and GDP, we show that adopting the same near-term low-energy growth trajectory in all regions in IPCC scenarios limiting global warming to 1.5 °C presents an unresolved policy challenge. We discuss this challenge of combining energy demand reductions with robust income growth for the 6.4 billion people in middle- and low-income countries in light of the reliance of economic development on industrialization. Our results highlight the importance of addressing limits to energy demand reduction in integrated assessment modelling when regional economic development is powered by industrialization and of instead exploring faster energy supply decarbonization.

Although well-designed NbS can deliver multiple benefits for people and nature, much of the recent limelight has been on tree planting for carbon sequestration. There are serious concerns that this is distracting from the need to rapidly phase out use of fossil fuels and protect existing intact ecosystems. There are also concerns that the expansion of forestry framed as a climate change mitigation solution is coming at the cost of carbon rich and biodiverse native ecosystems and local resource rights. Here, we discuss the promise and pitfalls of the NbS framing and its current political traction, and we present recommendations on how to get the message right. We urge policymakers, practitioners and researchers to consider the synergies and trade-offs associated with NbS and to follow four guiding principles to enable NbS to provide sustainable benefits to society: (1) NbS are not a substitute for the rapid phase out of fossil fuels; (2) NbS involve a wide range of ecosystems on land and in the sea, not just forests; (3) NbS are implemented with the full engagement and consent of Indigenous Peoples and local communities in a way that respects their cultural and ecological rights; and (4) NbS should be explicitly designed to provide measurable benefits for biodiversity. Only by following these guidelines will we design robust and resilient NbS that address the urgent challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss, sustaining nature and people together, now and into the future. © 2021 The Authors.

Cover crops may provide an additional management tool but narrow establishment windows and colder growing conditions in northern climates may limit the cover crop biomass required to suppress horseweed. Field experiments were conducted in 3 site-years in Michigan to investigate the effects of two fall-planted cover crops, cereal rye and winter wheat, seeded at 67 or 135 kg ha-1, to suppress horseweed when integrated with three preplant herbicide strategies in no-Tillage soybean. The preplant strategies were control (glyphosate only), preplant herbicide without residuals (glyphosate + 2,4-D), and preplant herbicide with residuals (glyphosate + 2,4-D + flumioxazin + metribuzin). Cereal rye produced 79% more biomass and provided 12% more ground cover than winter wheat in 2 site-years. Increasing seeding rate provided 41% more cover biomass in 1 site-year. Cover crops reduced horseweed density 47% to 96% and horseweed biomass by 59% to 70% compared with no cover at the time of cover crop termination. Cover crops provided no additional horseweed suppression 5 wk after soybean planting if a preplant herbicide with or without residuals was applied, but reduced horseweed biomass greater than 33% in the absence of preplant herbicides. Cover crops did not affect horseweed suppression at the time of soybean harvest or influence soybean yield. Preplant herbicide with residuals and without residuals provided at least 52% and 20% greater soybean yield compared with the control at 2 site-years, respectively. Cereal rye and winter wheat provided early-season horseweed suppression at biomass levels below 1,500 kg ha-1, lower than previously reported. This could give growers in northern climates an effective strategy for suppressing horseweed through the time of POST herbicide application while reducing selection pressure for horseweed that is resistant to more herbicide sites of action. © 2021 Cambridge University Press.

On the one hand, the quantity of CO raw emissions is important for emission predictions as well as for the exhaust gas after treatment. On the other hand, CO emissions are also important for predicting combustion efficiency and thus fuel consumption, since a part of unreleased chemical energy of the fuel is still bound in the CO molecules. Due to these reasons, a simulation model for predicting CO raw emissions was developed for diesel engines based on a phenomenological two-zone model. The CO model takes three main sources of CO emissions of diesel engines into account: Firstly, it contains a sub model that describes CO from local understoichiometric areas. Secondly, CO emissions from overmixed regions are considered. In these regions, the air-fuel mixture is too lean and consequently the temperatures are too low for CO to fully oxidize. Thirdly, CO emissions from cold peripheral zones near cylinder walls are determined in another sub model. To simplify the calibration process, the peripheral zone sub model is coupled to an existing nitrogen oxide (NO) peripheral zone model. For the CO model a one-step reaction mechanism for the CO oxidation was developed. This mechanism is applied to model the kinetically controlled oxidation of CO, which is initially produced by imperfect or incomplete combustion. The simulation results of the CO model have been validated against experimental data from two direct injection diesel engines. The simulation results show a high degree of accuracy for both engines. © 2021 SAE International.

We use microplastics emission data for the entire Baltic Sea region, calculate emissions for three sewage water related urban pathways and develop emission scenarios for the majority of microplastics particles. All plastics are divided into potentially floating (density 0.8–1.0 g/cmł) and sinking (1.1–1.5 g/cmł) polymers and we address the size class of 20–500 μm. 6.7 × 1013 microplastics particles enter the Baltic Sea annually from urban pathways. 62% result from stormwater runoff including sewer overflow, 25% from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and 13% from untreated wastewater. The emission scenarios serve as input for 3D-model simulations, which allow estimating transport, behaviour and deposition in the Baltic Sea environment. Our model approach suggests average annual microplastics concentrations in the water body of the central Baltic Sea of 1–4 particles/m2 sea surface and 1 particle/m3 in the upper 2 m sea surface layer. The majority of the particles is accumulated in upper sea surface layers. The model suggests that only between 6% (Arcona Basin) and 21% (Gotland Basin) of the particles are below a depth of 25 m. In coastal waters, the concentrations can exceed 10 particles/m3 in the upper 2 m surface water layer (e.g., Gulf of Riga, Gulf of Gdańsk) and 1 particle/m2 on the sediment surface. Usually within weeks, emitted microplastics are washed ashore causing annual coastal accumulations of up to 109 particles/m coastline within a few kilometres distance to emission sources. On average, above 106 particles/m are annually accumulated and trapped at coasts around the Baltic Sea. The reduction of the annual sewer overflow from presently 1.5% of the annual wastewater loads to 0.3% would reduce the total emissions to the Baltic Sea by 50%. If all sewage water would be connected to WWTPs and undergo a tertiary treatment, a reduction of 14.5% of the total emissions could be achieved. The effect of retention in rivers seems limited in the Baltic Sea region, because near coast emissions contribute around 50% of the total microplastics emissions. © Copyright © 2021 Schernewski, Radtke, Hauk, Baresel, Olshammar and Oberbeckmann.","beach; hydrodynamics; retention; sediment; sewer overflow; stormwater; wastewater",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104569069

Two modifications to the typical application of MFT are employed to allow its application to a system of molecular species. The first is the assumption that the inter-particle potential of mean force can be obtained from the molecule center-of-mass pair correlation function, which in the case of CO2 is the C-C pair correlation function. The second is a new definition of the Enskog factor that describes the effect of correlations at the surface of the collision volume. The new definition retains the physical picture that this quantity represents a local density increase, resulting from particle correlations, relative to that in the zero density homogeneous fluid limit. These calculations are facilitated by the calculation of pair correlation functions from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the FEPM2 molecular CO2 model. The self-diffusivity calculated from theory is in good agreement with that from MD simulations up to and slightly beyond the density at the location of the Frenkel line. The calculation is compared with and is found to perform similarly well to other commonly used models but has a greater potential for application to systems of mixed species and to systems of particles with long range interatomic potentials due to electrostatic interactions. © 2021 U.S. Government.",,"Carbon dioxide; Effluent treatment; Kinetic theory; Molecular dynamics; Supercritical fluid extraction; Supercritical fluids; Interatomic potential; Interparticle potential; Molecular dynamics simulations; Pair correlation functions; Particle correlations; Self-diffusion coefficients; Supercritical carbon dioxides; Typical application; Diffusion in liquids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103785633

In case of health issues, the coefficients are significant and negative, indicating that higher health issues have negative impact on economic growth. The empirics of education have confirmed significant and negative relationship with greenhouse gas emission which identifies that greenhouse gas emission can reduced by educating by rising education standards. In addition, we confirm the adverse impact of greenhouse gas emission on health. The study provides policy implications for overcoming problems in economic growth, health, education and climate change mitigation as they are linked with each other, directly or indirectly. The priority policy should be increase education having positive impact on health following greenhouse gas emission reduction and finally providing for sustainable economic growth.

In accordance with the six SDGs goals, it needs some efforts to ensure the sustainability of clean water and sanitation. The climate village program is one way to increase public awareness of the environment, especially providing clean water and proper sanitation and avoiding uncertain climate threats. This research was conducted with a qualitative approach using political (P), economic (E), social (S), technological (T), legal (L), and environmental (E) analysis in a village that was officially declared as a 'climate village.' Data collected by observation and conducting in-depth interviews with five informants who know deeply about this program. The result shows that the spirit of community cooperation is good enough to prevent environmental problems due to climate change. Every aspect of PESTLE shows a promising development, especially in Social and Environment. Still, it needs improvement for every indicator, especially financial assistance, to provide clean water and sanitation technology resistant to climate disruption. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Disasters; Environmental regulations; Rural areas; Sanitation; Sustainable development; Water supply; Clean waters; Environmental problems; Financial assistance; In-depth interviews; Public awareness; Qualitative approach; Uncertain climate; Water sustainability; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105257267

The impetus for economic growth has an impact on the carrying capacity of the environment. Thus, to achieve sustainable development goals, it is necessary to conduct a study of environmental carrying capacity which is related to the maximum capacity/entropy that can be utilized by the human being. An ecological footprint approach is an approach of the environmental carrying capacity to identify the components of natural resource consumption, waste, and availability of natural resources in each type of land use. Carbon footprint which is the biggest part of the ecological footprint has a relation with CO2 emission production, which influences climate change mitigation. The purpose of this study was to formulate land use control policies based on the ecological footprint approach. The analysis method consists of three phases. First, the calculation of biological capacity was based on the availability level of natural resources. Second, the calculation of an ecological footprint was based on the consumption level of natural resources. The final phase was sustainability calculation to get the result to accommodate the population consumption within the region. The finding showed that Mojokerto City, Surabaya City, and Sidoarjo Regency were regions which a deficit in terms of ecological sustainability. The rest regions within the Gerbangkertosusila region were considered regions that are experiencing a surplus.

Individuals, however, often misperceive the cooperation levels in a population. In the context of climate action, people underestimate the pro-climate positions of others. Designing incentives to enable cooperation and a sustainable future must thereby consider how social perception biases affect collective action. We propose a theoretical model and investigate the effect of social perception bias in non-linear public goods games. We show that different types of bias play a distinct role in cooperation dynamics. False uniqueness (underestimating own views) and false consensus (overestimating own views) both explain why communities get locked in suboptimal states. Such dynamics also impact the effectiveness of typical monetary incentives, such as fees. Our work contributes to understanding how targeting biases, e.g., by changing the information available to individuals, can comprise a fundamental mechanism to prompt collective action. © 2021 The Authors","Decision Science; Psychology; Sociology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104154053

This study analyses the carbon and water footprints of green coconut produced in seven farms located at the main producing States in Brazil (Ceará, Alagoas, Sergipe and Bahia), investigating opportunities for reducing these footprints. Methods: The carbon footprint was calculated based on ISO 14067 and the water footprint, on ISO 14046. Primary data were collected from orchards with dwarf coconut trees, located in the states of Ceará (CE1, CE2, CE3 and CE4 farms), Alagoas (AL farm), Sergipe (SE farm) and Bahia (BA farm). The impact categories considered and their assessment models were as follows: (i) for the carbon footprint, climate change impact was assessed (ILCD midpoint); (ii) for the water footprint, water scarcity (AWARE), human toxicity, cancer, non-cancer, and freshwater ecotoxicity and marine and freshwater eutrophication (ILCD midpoint) were assessed. Sensitivity analysis was performed for variations in emissions from land use change (LUC) and water scarcity characterization factors. Uncertainty analysis was applied to identify best performing farms and their practices. Results and discussion: The farms that resulted in lower footprints (AL and CE4) caused less carbon losses in LUC and used less nitrogen fertilizers and irrigation water. LUC emissions answered for one third of coconut carbon footprint when orchards were installed in areas with Caatinga vegetation. However, if coconut orchards replaced annual crops, carbon footprint may reduce up to 61%. Regarding water scarcity, in the case of applying monthly AWARE factors, the impact increased as much as 95% in relation to impacts calculated using annual factors. The use of regionalized annual or monthly AWARE factors increased impact up to 97% in relation to when annual and monthly AWARE were used. Conclusions: The analysis of alternatives for footprint reduction showed that both footprints can be reduced in all regions with changes in orchard lifespan, irrigation and fertilization. Increasing the useful life of the orchard results in a reduction of up to 38% in footprints, adjusting irrigation, up to 49%, and the amount of fertilizer, up to 70% of the carbon footprint and up to 82% of water footprint profile. Regionalized factors were more accurate for identifying critical watersheds for coconut production. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Eutrophication; Impact regionalization; Life cycle assessment; Toxicity; Water scarcity","carbon; nitrogen fertilizer; agricultural land; Article; Brazil; carbon footprint; climate change; coconut; crop management; ecotoxicity; environmental impact; environmental management; eutrophication; fertilizer application; freshwater environment; information processing; irrigation (agriculture); land use; malignant neoplasm; marine environment; mathematical computing; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; vegetation; wastewater; water insecurity; watershed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101254680

Recycling these organic amendments in agriculture has several beneficial effects such as improving plant growth, yield, soil carbon content, and microbial biomass and activity. Nevertheless, organic amendment applications have some disadvantages such as nutrient eutrophication and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Agriculture sector emits substantial quantities of GHGs (carbon dioxide-CO2, methane-CH4, and nitrous oxide-N2 O). Though quantity wise CH4 and N2 O emissions are less than CO2, they have higher global warming potential. Although there have been studies on the role of chemical fertilizer application on GHG emission, there have been very few studies on the effect of organic amendments application on GHG emission in agricultural soils. We reviewed quantification of various organic amendments used in agriculture that include manures, municipal solid waste, green manuring, crop residues and other miscellaneous organic amendments, major processes for GHG emission, and impact of organic amendment application on GHG emission from soil. The article aims to highlight the management practices to mitigate the emission and the future research needs in relation to nitrogen and carbon dynamics in soil for judicious use of organic amendments in agriculture to maintain soil health with minimum impact on GHG emission from agriculture. © 2021, Punjab Agricultural University.

At the same time, such objects are typical when organizing the internal microclimate of civil buildings. In this paper, we consider the mathematical formulation and solution of the problem of changing the temperature of internal air in a room equipped with automated local cooling systems and a background supply ventilation system under variable thermal influences. The main equations connecting the most important components of the heat flow in the room are analyzed. The dependence on time for the deviation of the room air temperature from the setpoint is presented, and the expression for the moment of time at which the maximum temperature deviation is observed, with a jump-like change in the heat flow from heat sources in the case of regulating the equipment of local cooling systems according to the integral law. Calculations were performed to confirm the analytical solution obtained using a finite-difference approximation of the differential equations of heat balance and heat transfer on the example of one of the currently existing residential buildings in the climatic conditions of Moscow, taking into account the structural characteristics of the building and the thermal properties of its enclosing structures. It is noted that the greatest deviation of the temperature from the setpoint (dynamic control error) in the first approximation is inversely proportional to the cubic root of the transmission coefficient of the regulator, as well as the moment of time for which this deviation is observed. The obtained relations are proposed to be used for an analytical assessment of the non-stationary thermal regime of an air-conditioned room served by local cooling systems equipped with an automation system with an integral law of regulation, to check the conditions of human comfort and safety, as well as to determine the required parameters of the regulator. © 2021 St-Petersburg State Polytechnical University.

There is also very little understanding and consensus on how and to what extent local communities can and should be involved in these projects. Arguably, both the concept and practice of community participation remain equivocal and contentious due to a lack of systematic effort to define the participatory framework in CCA. While the framework for community participation can be adopted from other planning and management discourses, yet they are typically expert-driven. The local communities hardly play a role in designing the framework. This study, therefore, took an alternative approach to define the meaning and implication of community participation from local communities’ perspectives. To this end, we used the grounded theory qualitative research methods to survey 50 respondents across five rural communities in climate change impacted Northern Ghana. To evaluate the communities’ meaningful participation in the adaptation projects, respondents suggested three critical parameters—First, community participation in a CCA project can be considered successful if the project contributes towards the livelihood security of the community. Second, the project outcome should be tangible.

The important question here is, does air pollution can be a good medium to increase the infection rate and spread of COVID-19. In present work, ESA remote sensing data, specifically, Sentinel 5p Level 2 data to study the air pollutants with high spatial-temporal resolution was analyzed. We used the tropospheric NO2 vertical column density, along with UV Aerosol Index (UVAI) were used to investigate the role of changing in the air pollutants on the spread of COVID-19. The continuous decrease in the in tropospheric nitrogen dioxide NO amounts in all cities in Iraq during the lockdown measures. At the same time, the results illustrate a significant increase in 2 UV Aerosol Index in all cities in Iraq. More specifically, the cities that have the highest levels of air pollution are Baghdad and Basra. The maximum declination in NO2 was 43% lower than that from 1-31 January 2020. On the other hand, we found a significantly large increase ratio in UVAI and the largest increase is 239.8 and 221.2% in June and July respectively. In the end, we concluded that the implementation control actions in Iraq have been effectively contributed to reducing the current air pollution situation and increasing the air quality but unfortunately, the effectiveness of the actions didn't help to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and decrease the number of cases of coronavirus in Iraq. © 2021 Ecological Society of India.

The prevailing planning approaches of the last two decades may be summarized as attempts to make planning more responsive, corrective, and resilient, and also more sociocratic vis à vis the traditional government-centric rationalization of planning. These adaptations make sense, yet keep planning within the pragmatic scope of purposive aspirations and pragmatic problem solving. The pivotal statement of the article is that purposive systems run down in complex societies when not adequately sustained by institutionalizing sets of public norms. Public norms fulfil a different function than goal orientation. They provide a normative compass in times of uncertainty and set conditions to social interaction rather than organizing the performance of objectives or solving problems. The article aims to highlight the interrelationships of public norms and pragmatic strategies of planning. Empirically, the article addresses the major turning points of Dutch climate policy concerning the transitions of the electricity market, the major municipal–entrepreneurial initiatives of city-heating, and the decentralization of climate policies. The method of analysis is based on policy analysis of legislation, policy documents, and published contributions to public debates. The results of the analysis highlight the differences between the high policy aspirations and the outcomes. The results give evidence of the wicked problems in the complex energy transition. The discussion questions the mischievousness of ‘good’ planning intentions in complex social figurations, and critically examines the institutionalization of the material norms and the norms of politico-ordinance. The conclusions suggest that the social normalization of public norms in Dutch climate policies is not yet adequately materialized to effectively cope with wicked problems. © 2021 by the author.

Location: Atlantic coastal habitats in Huelva (Spain). Methods: We identified the species composition of 216 paired (non-invaded and invaded) 10 × 10 m plots along the coast. For each species, we calculated its climatic niche based on the two main axis of a PCA constructed with nine climatic variables. We defined the community ensemble niche by the union of the overall climate niches of co-occurring species within a plot. We compared niche overlap metrics between non-invaded and invaded paired communities. Results: There was an almost complete overlap in the community ensemble niches between non-invaded and invaded plots for the four invaders. Plots invaded by Carpobrotus spp. presented the lowest niche stability and those invaded by A. calendula had the highest. Plots invaded by Carpobrotus spp. showed the highest values of niche unfilling and expansion. In contrast, plots invaded by O. dillenii exhibited the lowest niche unfilling. Species similarity between non-invaded and invaded plots was on average 58%. The community ensemble niches differed depending on the invasive species and were related to differences in community species similarity between non-invaded and invaded plots. Overall, there was a positive correlation between community species similarity and climatic niche stability, and a negative correlation between community difference in taxonomic richness and climatic niche stability. Conclusions: Species assemblages in coastal vegetation did not change their community ensemble climatic niches after invasion by plants with contrasted life forms. This pattern is likely the result of invasion which did not trigger major changes in species richness and composition, or alternatively, because the species that were locally displaced by invasion have been substituted by others with similar climatic requirements. © 2021 International Association for Vegetation Science","biological invasions; climatic niche; community assembly; ordination techniques; Raup-Crick similarity index; Spanish coastal vegetation; species composition; stability; Sørensen similarity index","assembly rule; biological invasion; climate conditions; coexistence; invasive species; niche; niche overlap; plant community; Andalucia; Huelva [Andalucia]; Spain; Arctotheca calendula; Calendula; Carpobrotus; Conyza bonariensis; Opuntia dillenii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104961213

AD batch tests for CH4 yield determination were carried out with DSS as inoculum between 23 and 40 °C. All results were related to organic dry matter and calculated for standard conditions (1013 hPa, 0 °C). The AD experiments at 40 °C and at 35 °C delivered specific CH4 yields of 325 ± 6 mL/g and 268 ± 27 mL/g for OFMSW alone. At lower temperatures, specific CH4 yields of 364 ± 25 mL/g (25 °C) and 172 ± 21 mL/g (23 °C) were reached. AD at 25 °C could be beneficial regarding energy input (heating costs) and energy output (CH4 yield). Plant operators could increase AD efficiencies by avoiding heating costs. The co-digestion of OFMSW together with DSS could lead to further synergies such as better exploitation of the energy potentials of DSS, but the digestate utilization could become problematic due to hygienic requirements. Efficiency potentials through lowered operating temperatures are limited. In further research, lowered process temperatures could be applied in the AD of energy crops due to large numbers of existing plants. © 2021 by the authors.

Unsurprisingly, greenhouse gas emissions per ton-km reduce as size and load factor increase. By 2040, battery and fuel cell electric trucks appear to be promising options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions per ton-km on long distance segments, even where the required range autonomy is high. This requires that various conditions are met, such as improvements at the energy storage level and a drastic reduction of the greenhouse gas intensity of the electricity used for battery charging and hydrogen production. Meanwhile, these options may be considered for urban and regional applications, where they have a competitive advantage thanks to their superior engine efficiency. Finally, these alternative options will have to compete against more mature combustion-based technologies which, despite lower drivetrain efficiencies, are expected to reduce their exhaust emissions via engine improvements, hybridization of their powertrain, as well as the use of biomass-based and synthetic fuels. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","battery; electric; freight; fuel cell; open-source; prospective; tank-to-wheel; transport","Competition; Electric energy storage; Engines; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Powertrains; Secondary batteries; Synthetic fuels; Trucks; Competitive advantage; Drivetrain efficiencies; Engine efficiency; European context; Exhaust emission; Heavy duty trucks; Heavy duty vehicles; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle; diesel fuel; hydrogen; gasoline; automation; energy storage; engine; exhaust emission; fuel cell; greenhouse gas; hydrogen; life cycle analysis; Article; biomass; carbon footprint; combustion; electricity; energy consumption; exhaust gas; hydrogen evolution; life cycle assessment; molecular weight; motor vehicle; reference database; animal; exhaust gas; greenhouse gas; life cycle stage; motor vehicle; Animals; Electricity; Gasoline; Greenhouse Gases; Life Cycle Stages; Motor Vehicles; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103629481

Using cross-sectional data from a nationally representative survey of U.S. adults (N = 1,303), we investigate the “Greta Thunberg Effect,” or whether exposure to Greta Thunberg predicts collective efficacy and intentions to engage in collective action. We find that those who are more familiar with Greta Thunberg have higher intentions of taking collective actions to reduce global warming and that stronger collective efficacy beliefs mediate this relationship. This association between familiarity with Greta Thunberg, collective efficacy beliefs, and collective action intentions is present even after accounting for respondents’ overall support for climate activism. Moderated mediation models testing age and political ideology as moderators of the “Greta Thunberg Effect” indicate that although the indirect effect of familiarity with Greta Thunberg via collective efficacy is present across all age-groups, and across the political spectrum, it may be stronger among those who identify as more liberal (than conservative). Our findings suggest that young public figures like Greta Thunberg may motivate collective action across the U.S. public, but their effect may be stronger among those with a shared political ideology.

In the transportation field, a variety of environmental protection schemes are also being considered (e.g., banning old diesel vehicles, alternate no-driving systems, electric car subsidies, and environmental cost charging by tax). Imposing environmental constraints is a good approach to reflect various environmental protections. The objective of this research was to analyze the mode-choice and route-choice changes based on imposing environmental constraints. For the objective, a combined modal split and traffic assignment (CMA) model with an environmental constraint model was developed. For the environmental constraint, carbon monoxide (CO) was adopted, because most of the CO emissions in the air are emitted by motorized vehicles. After a detailed description of the model, the validity and some properties of the model and algorithm are demonstrated with two numerical examples (e.g., a small and a real network in the city of Winnipeg, Canada). From the numerical results, we can observe that imposing the small restriction (or strict) value has more efficiency in mode change and reducing network emission. © 2021 by the authors.

Small-scale, individual-initiated burning activities are significant contributors to local pollutant emissions but are not well studied. We identified articles that describe small-scale burning interventions in order to characterize current trends, implementation science perspectives, and gaps in the literature. Methods: We conducted a global search of interventions to reduce ambient air pollution, and then conducted a keyword search among these articles to identify literature regarding interventions to reduce individual-initiated burning. We categorized these articles based on whether burning was discussed as an explicit focus or incidental finding and conducted a full-text analysis. We conducted a supplementary review on anthropological aspects of burning behaviors and burning interventions not captured in our review to inform future recommendations. Results: Ten articles describing interventions for small-scale, individual-initiated burning were identified. Four articles examined burning as an explicit focus and six discussed burning as an incidental finding. China was the country most represented in our review. All but one of the articles discussed emissions-related outcomes, while only one article discussed health outcomes. Four articles explored factors affecting implementation of interventions and regulations, but none included implementation as a primary objective. The supplementary review revealed a large amount of literature about burning in the context of spiritual and agricultural practices. However, less is known about everyday burning behaviors, such as trash burning and household burning, as well as reasons why people burn. Conclusion: There is a paucity of research that explicitly discusses interventions for small scale, individual-initiated burning practices. Gaps remain in interventions in LMICs most affected by individual-initiated burning, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Most of the current literature does not analyze factors affecting effectiveness of interventions and regulations and does not clearly identify reasons why people choose to burn. More research is needed on how to effectively implement interventions to reduce individual-initiated burning, as well as to target key geographic regions and burning sources that continue to be neglected. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Air quality; Ambient air pollution; Burning; Implementation science; LMICs; Small-scale","atmospheric pollution; burning; emission; health impact; implementation process; literature review; mortality; pollutant source; risk factor; Africa south of the Sahara; agricultural procedures; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; China; human; implementation science; incineration; low income country; middle income country; priority journal; religion; Review; accident; family size; risk factor; Sub-Saharan Africa; Accidents; Air Pollution; China; Family Characteristics; Humans; Risk Factors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100244647

The available Arctic BC deposition records are restricted to the Atlantic and North American sectors, for which previous studies suggest considerable spatial differences in trends. Here, we present first long-term BC deposition and radiocarbon-based source apportionment data from Russia using four lake sediment records from western Arctic Russia, a region influenced by BC emissions from oil and gas production. The records consistently indicate increasing BC fluxes between 1800 and 2014. The radiocarbon analyses suggest mainly (∼70%) biomass sources for BC with fossil fuel contributions peaking around 1960-1990. Backward calculations with the atmospheric transport model FLEXPART show emission source areas and indicate that modeled BC deposition between 1900 and 1999 is largely driven by emission trends. Comparison of observed and modeled data suggests the need to update anthropogenic BC emission inventories for Russia, as these seem to underestimate Russian BC emissions and since 1980s potentially inaccurately portray their trend. Additionally, the observations may indicate underestimation of wildfire emissions in inventories. Reliable information on BC deposition trends and sources is essential for design of efficient and effective policies to limit climate warming. © 2021 The Authors.

Disaster planning has been important for environmental planning in recent times. In every world, researchers, geographers, climatologists and regional planners are going to detect and minimize the impact of natural disasters.

Various geo-environmental variables are known to determine the final outcome. “Area Under Curve” (AUC) values of “Receiver Operating Characteristics” were used to validate and determine the accuracy of the predicted models. AUC shows the state or nature of the flooding. If the outcome of AUC values indicates more than 0.95, then the likelihood of flooding will be high BBO gave us the most optimal outcomes in this research out of these models (AUC = 0.98) and assured us that BBO is an influential tool for assessing flood-prone areas in eastern India and helps to take measures for strategic management and preparing for progress. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","BBO; ERT; Flood prone areas; Natural disaster; SVM","Climate change; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Heuristic algorithms; Land use; Planning; Support vector machines; Tropics; Biogeography-based optimizations; Disaster planning; Environmental planning; Environmental variables; Natural disasters; Receiver operating characteristics; Strategic management; Tropical regions; Floods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099760831

This study aims to evaluate the change in the atmospheric pollution levels by NO and NO2 in São Paulo City for the social isolation period. The NO and NO2 hourly concentrations were obtained through air quality monitoring stations from CETESB, from January 14, 2020 to April 12, 2020. Mann-Kendall and the Pettitt tests were performed in the air pollutant time series. We observed an overall negative trend in all stations, indicating a decreasing temporal pattern in concentrations. Regarding NO, the highest absolute decrease rates were observed in the Congonhas (− 6.39 μg m−3 month−1) and Marginal Tietê (− 6.19 μg m−3 month−1) stations; regarding NO2, the highest rates were observed in the Marginal Tietê (− 4.45 μg m−3 month−1) and Cerqueira César (− 4.34 μg m−3 month−1) stations. In addition, we identified a turning point in the NO and NO2 series trends that occurred close to the start date of the social isolation period (March 20, 2020). Moreover, from statistical analysis, it was found that NO2 is a suitable surrogate for monitoring economic activities during social isolation periods. Thus, we concluded that social isolation measures implemented on March 20, 2020 caused significant changes in the air pollutant concentrations in the city of São Paulo (as high as − 200% in NO2 levels). © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Air pollution; Coronavirus outbreak; COVID-19; NO2; São Paulo","atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; pollution control; spatiotemporal analysis; urban pollution; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093977699

In soils, antibiotic impact on nitrogen cycling is poorly known, notably when antibiotic mixtures are applied. We hypothesized that the impact of antibiotic mixtures would have higher effects on denitrification. We exposed soil denitrifying bacteria enrichments to tetracycline, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and tylosin, either applied single or as mixture of three antibiotics, during 7 days under denitrifying conditions. We measured the minimum inhibitory concentration of the N2O-reducing capacity of the bacterial enrichment, we deduced the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) from the experimental data and from the concentration addition hypothesis, and we quantified nosZ gene abundances. Results show that single antibiotic exposure inhibited N2O-reduction only for tetracycline at 64 mg/L. Inhibition by antibiotic mixtures always exceeded the modeled inhibition calculated by concentration addition. At high-antibiotic exposure, nosZ gene clade I denitrifiers remained abundant, of 107–108 copies/ng DNA. NosZ gene clade II denitrifiers increased with antibiotic concentrations. Our findings reveal for the first time the synergistic effects of antibiotic mixtures on soil nitrogen cycling. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Antibiotic mixture; Denitrification; Microbial ecotoxicology; N2O-reducing community; Soil",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092586206

RECENT FINDINGS: Reirradiation with protons and carbon ions demonstrated to be feasible, safe and to offer good local control rates, with the possibility of overcoming radioresistance and dosimetric issues in previously irradiated cancer patients. Chromosomal rearrangements, gene fusions and expression profiles are important to identify specific cancer subtypes and can guide tailored systemic therapy. SUMMARY: Ri-SGCs are rare and heterogeneous. Patients are often heavily pretreated and at risk of toxicities, and their management remain challenging. A multidisciplinary approach in referral centers is mandatory. Knowledge about SGCs cellular and molecular mechanisms is constantly evolving. In the last years, novel advances in therapeutic approaches, such as carbon ion radiotherapy, are emerging as safe and effective options in active treatment, but further efforts are needed to offer tailored personalized treatments and to improve survival.

This study contributes to this effort by estimating the aboveground volume and carbon present in commercial tree species in a managed forest in the forest harvest stage in Brazil’s state of Acre. A total of 12,794 trees of commercial species were measured. Trees were categorized and quantified as: “harvested trees” (“harvest or cut”), which were felled in the harvest stage, and “remaining trees” (“future cutting,” “trees in permanent protection areas or APPs,” “seed trees,” “rare trees” and “trees protected by law”) that remained standing in the forest post-harvest. Aboveground volume and carbon stocks of the 81 commercial species (diameter at breast height [DBH] ≥ 10 cm) totaled 79.19 m3 ha−1 and 21.54 MgC ha−1, respectively. The category “harvested trees” represents 44.48% and “remaining trees” 55.49% of the aboveground volume stocks. In the managed area, the category “harvested trees” is felled; this is composed of the commercial bole that is removed (19.25 m3 ha−1 and 5.32 MgC ha−1) and the stump and crown that remain in the forest as decomposing organic material (15.97 m3 ha−1 and 4.41 MgC ha−1). We can infer that the 21.54 MgC ha−1 carbon stock of standing commercial trees (DBH ≥ 10 cm) represents 13.20% of the total aboveground carbon in the managed area. The commercial boles removed directly from the forest represent 3.26% of the total aboveground carbon, and the stumps and crowns of the harvested trees represent the loss of an additional 2.70%. For sustainability of the management system in terms of carbon balance, growth in the 35-year management cycle must be sufficient to replace not only these amounts (0.27 MgC ha−1 year−1) but also losses to collateral damage and to additional logging-related effects from increased vulnerability to forest fires. Financial viability of future management cycles will depend on replenishment of commercial trees of harvestable size (DBH ≥ 50 cm). © 2021 by the authors.

Concretely, due to the economic and energy characteristics of the Andalusia, this region conditions the achievement of Spain’s goals in terms of energy efficiency. This paper aims to highlight the key role played by energy efficiency, explaining the energy consumption behaviour in Andalusia and in comparison with the Spanish average for the period 2000–2015. The paper analyses this topic through the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition method and with a decoupling index analysis. The results show although the energy efficiency measures have been globally effective in terms of reducing the energy intensity between 2000 and 2015, Andalusia still has a higher energy intensity than the Spanish average and more efforts should be made in order to reduce it and to contribute to Spain’s energy consumption targets. The main efforts should be focused on the industry and primary sectors. The energy policy recommendation are two. First, to bring the economic situation of Andalusia closer to the Spanish average and therefore to reduce energy intensity and second, to decouple the energy consumption from economic growth, thus contributing to a reduction in CO2 emissions. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Energy decoupling; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; European decarbonisation; European regions; LMDI","energy efficiency; energy market; energy policy; energy use; European Union; index method; performance assessment; Andalucia; Spain; carbon dioxide; China; economic development; energy conservation; industry; Spain; Carbon Dioxide; China; Conservation of Energy Resources; Economic Development; Industry; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099031502

Therefore, assessing irrigation requirements is essential for the development of effective water-related policies for an efficient management of water resources. Moreover, global-scale analyses are becoming increasingly relevant, motivated by globalized production and international trade of food as well as by the need of common strategies to address climate change. In this study, a comprehensive model to estimate crop growth and irrigation requirements of 26 main crops at global scale is presented. The model computes a soil water balance using daily precipitation and reference evapotranspiration based on a high-resolution ERA5 reanalysis dataset from the European Copernicus Program. The irrigation requirement, defined as the minimum water volume to avoid water stress, is computed for year 2000 at the resolution of 5 arc-min (or 0.0833°) and aggregated at different spatial and temporal scales for relevant analyses. The estimated global irrigation requirements for 962 km3 is described in detail, also in relation to the spatial variability and to the monthly variation of the requirements. A focus on different areas of the world (California, Northern Italy and India) highlights the wealth of information provided by the model in different climatic conditions. National data of irrigation withdrawals have been used for an extensive comparison with model results. A crop-specific validation has also been made for the State of California, comparing model results with local data of irrigation volume and independent estimates of crop water use. In both cases, we found a good agreement between model results and real data. © 2021 Rolle et al.

Earlier studies outlined how Mediterranean Europe has be-come a global hotspot of climate warming and land use change. The present work assumes the olive tree, a typical Mediterranean crop, as a candidate bioclimatic indicator, delineating the latent impact of climate aridity on traditional cropping systems at the northern range of the biogeographical distribution of the olive tree. Since the olive tree follows a well-defined latitude gradient with a pro-gressive decline in both frequency and density moving toward the north, we considered Italy as an appropriate case to investigate how climate change may (directly or indirectly) influence the spatial distribution of this crop. By adopting an exploratory approach grounded in the quali-quantitative analysis of official statistics, the present study investigates long-term changes over time in the spatial distribution of the olive tree surface area in Northern Italy, a region traditionally considered outside the ecological range of the species because of unsuitable climate conditions. Olive tree cul-tivated areas increased in Northern Italy, especially in flat districts and upland areas, while they decreased in Central and Southern Italy under optimal climate conditions, mostly because of land abandonment. The most intense expansion of the olive tree surface area in Italy was observed in the northern region between 1992 and 2000 and corresponded with the intensification of winter droughts during the late 1980s and the early 1990s and local warming since the mid-1980s. Assuming the intrinsic role of farmers in the expansion of the olive tree into the suboptimal land of Northern Italy, the empirical results of our study suggest how climate aridity and local warming may underlie the shift toward the north in the geographical range of the olive tree in the Mediterranean Basin. We finally discussed the implications of the olive range shift as a part of a possible landscape scenario for a more arid future. © 2021 by the authors.

I build on scholars’ work in critical caring, the Black principalship, and radical hope to call for an expansion of narrow frameworks of effective school leadership to include an ethic of radical care within urban school leadership. Method: This study represents a counterstory in the tradition of critical race theory, centering the voice and perspectives of a Black male urban school principal. Using ethnographic research methods, this case study was based on prolonged and embedded engagement in the field including observations, informal and formal interviews, and document review. Data were collected and analyzed over a 2-year period. Findings: Five components of effective school leadership emerged from analysis of the data that, taken together, can be described as a radical care framework. These components include the folowing: (a) adopting an antiracist, social just stance; (b) cultivating authentic relationships; (c) believing in students’ and teachers’ capacity for growth and excellence; (d) strategically navigating the sociopolitical and policy climate; and (e) embracing a spirit of radical hope. Conclusion: In addition to highlighting the power of counterstories in educational leadership research, this study reinforces the critical need for leadership preparation that is grounded in antiracism and social justice, and comprises all aspects of an ethic of radical care. Furthermore, the study points to the need for targeted recruitment of Black and Latinx school leaders, particularly in urban contexts. © The Author(s) 2020.","antiracist leadership; Black principals; counterstory; critical care; social justice leadership",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085689359

In relation with climate change, more frequent floods, of higher intensity, can be expected due to anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The objective of this review paper is to address the many ways in which geosynthetics contribute to sustainable construction of dykes and thus to water systems management. This review paper, prepared by the four Technical Committees and the Sustainability Committee of the International Geosynthetics Society, briefly describes geosynthetics and their function, dykes and dyke fail-ure modes, before presenting the main focus of the use of geosynthetics for the design and construction of durable dykes to ensure the protection of life and infrastructure. The optimization of dyke construction with geosynthetics to increase their resilience not only results in performance ad-vantages, but also in economic advantages. The way geosynthetics can contribute to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions for a sustainable river management is discussed. This is done not only by allowing more economic construction methods to be implemented, but also solutions with increased resilience to face the extreme stresses related to climate change, while at the same time bringing about a positive contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions during the construction process itself. Finally, it is shown that by following state of the art standards and design practice any possible risk associated with the use of geosynthetics in dykes can be mitigated. © 2021 by the authors.

There is thus a need both to prevent climate change or soften its effects (mitigation) and to address and deal with effects that are already occurring (adaptation). To facilitate climate action in a creative way, new forms of collaboration are needed, which will lead to increased transformative potential for individuals, for the economy, and for society as a whole. Against this background, community-academic partnerships can serve as an innovative format for collaboration. However, to ensure that these partnerships develop to their full potential, they must be designed in such a way that all involved can participate effectively. Consequently, the question arises of what the success factors and conditions for effective practices are for community-academic partnerships focusing on climate change adaptation and/or mitigation. To answer this question, a Delphi study was conducted with a panel of experts on cocreation processes and climate change adaptation and/or mitigation under the auspices of the European project TeRRIFICA. The results of the study show how community-academic partnerships should be structured and designed to ensure that all stakeholders are involved in the entire process and that positive contributions to climate change adaptation and mitigation can be made. Overall, the results confirm existing findings on success factors for community-academic partnerships, but the relevance of hands-on activities and supportive tools is emphasized much more clearly than in the existing literature.

A consequence of emission miti gation that has received limited attention is a reduced effi ciency of the ocean carbon sink. Historically, the roughly exponential increase in atmospheric CO2 has resulted in a proportional increase in anthropogenic carbon uptake by the ocean. We define growth of the ocean carbon sink exactly proportional to the atmospheric growth rate to be 100 % ef ficient. Using a model hierarchy consisting of a common reduced-form ocean carbon cycle model and the Community Earth System Model (CESM), we assess the mecha nisms of future change in the efficiency of the ocean carbon sink under three emission scenarios: Aggressive mitigation (1.5 °C), intermediate mitigation (RCP4.5), and high emis sions (RCP8.5). The reduced-form ocean carbon cycle model is tuned to emulate the global-mean behavior of the CESM and then allows for mechanistic decomposition. With inter mediate or no mitigation (RCP4.5, RCP8.5), changes in ef ficiency through 2080 are almost entirely the result of future reductions in the carbonate buffer capacity of the ocean. Un der the 1.5 °C scenario, the dominant driver of efficiency de cline is the ocean s reduced ability to transport anthropogenic carbon from surface to depth. As the global-mean upper ocean gradient of anthropogenic carbon reverses sign, carbon can be re-entrained in surface waters where it slows further removal from the atmosphere. Reducing uncertainty in ocean circulation is critical to better understanding the transport of anthropogenic carbon from surface to depth and to improv ing quantification of its role in the future ocean carbon sink. © Author(s) 2021.

The load demand consists of water pumping system with a water desalination unit. Various options containing three different power sources: only DG, PV-B system, and hybrid PV-DG-B, two different sizes of reverse osmosis (RO) units; RO-250 and RO-500, two strategies of energy management; load following (LF) and cycle charging (CC), and two sizes of DG; 5 and 10 kW were taken into account. Eight attributes, including operating cost, renewable fraction, initial cost, the cost of energy, excess energy, unmet load, breakeven grid extension distance, and the amount of CO2, were used during the evaluation process. To estimate these parameters, HOMER® software was employed to perform both the simulation and optimization process. Four different weight estimation methods were considered; no priority of criteria, based on a pairwise comparisons matrix of the criteria, CRITIC-method, and entropy-based method. The main findings (output results) confirmed that the optimal option for the case study was hybrid PV-DG-B with the following specification: 5 kW DG, RO-500, and load following control strategy. Under this condition, the annual operating cost and initial costs were $ 5546 and $ 161022, respectively, whereas the cost of energy was 0.077 $/kWh. The excess energy and unmet loads were 40998 and 2371 kWh, respectively. The breakeven grid extension distance and the amount of CO2 were 3.31 km and 5171 kg per year, respectively. Compared with DG only, the amount of CO2 has been sharply reduced by 113939 kg per year. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.","Al-Minya city (Egypt); Energy efficiency; Multi-criteria decision-making; Optimization; Renewable energy; Reverse osmosis units","Carbon dioxide; Computer software; Desalination; Operating costs; Renewable energy resources; Water filtration; Annual operating costs; Electrical energy sources; Entropy-based methods; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Multi criteria decision making; Simulation and optimization; Water pumping systems; Weight estimation methods; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104875162

Yet it has not been well-received by the climate change expert community. This is evident in the authoritative reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which emphasize SRM's governance, political, social, and ethical challenges. I find seven such challenges identified in the IPCC reports: that SRM could lessen mitigation; that its termination would cause severe climatic impacts; that researching SRM would create a “slippery slope” to its inevitable and unwanted use; that decisions to use it could be contrary to democratic norms; that the public may not accept SRM; that it could be unethical; and that decisions to use SRM could be unilateral. After assessing the extent to which these challenges are supported by existing evidence, scholarly literature, and robust logic, I conclude that, for six of the seven, the IPCC's claims variously are speculative, fail to consider both advantages and disadvantages, implicitly make unreasonable negative assumptions, are contrary to existing evidence, and/or are meaninglessly vague. I suggest some reasons for the reports' failure to meet the IPCC's standards of balance, thoroughness, and accuracy, and recommend a dedicated Special Report on SRM.

Introduction of 2 ppm NO2 in the cathode feed gas caused a spatial performance distribution and voltage drop of 80 and 130 mV for high- and low-Pt samples, respectively. A full recovery of the cell voltage was observed after stopping the NO2 injection in the air stream only for high-Pt cells, while low-Pt cells had a partial recovery. The performance loss could be attributed to the dissociative adsorption of NO2 on Pt with the formation of NO and its further reduction to N2O via two consecutive electron and proton transfer steps. Cathode exposure to 2–5 ppm NO2 led to a decrease in the electrochemical area (ECA) of 17–18 and 21–23% for the high- and low-Pt samples, respectively, which exceeded the ECA loss in reference tests in pure air. The low-Pt PEMFC performance loss after poisoning by 1–2 ppm NO2 could be recovered applying cyclic voltammetry.

Both options are focused on greenhouse agricultural production, but could be applied to other applications. The influence of factors, such as the air/fuel rate and turbulence inside the combustion chamber, is studied. Our results show that for pine pellets, olive pits, tomato-crop residues, and a blend of the latter mixed with almond prunings (75–25%), the thermal losses ranged from 19.5–53.1, 20.5–58.9, 39.9–95%, and 29.4–75.5%, respectively, while the NOX emissions were 30–247, 411–1792, and 361–2333 mg/Nm3, respectively. The above-mentioned blend was identified as the best set-up. The thermal losses were 39.2%, and the CO, NOX, and SO2 concentrations were 11,690, 906, and 1134 mg/Nm3, respectively (the gas concentration values were recalculated for 0% O2). Currently, no other work exists in the literature include a similar analysis performed using a boiler with a comparable thermal output (160.46 kW). The optimal configurations comply with the relevant local legislation. This optimization is important for future emission control strategies relating to using crop residues as a CO2 source. The work also highlights the importance of ensuring a proper boiler set-up for each case considered. © 2021 by the authors.

During the last two decades, access to multi-system integration of climate models has given rise to the concept of using model ensembles to issue probabilistic climatological projections. These probabilistic projections have not yet been exploited to the full extent in decision support, and are still used to mainly quantify uncertainty bands only for selected climate variables and indicators. One of the reasons of this limited use is the fact that the multi-system ensemble dispersion is sub-optimal and does not provide an accurate and reliable representation of the predictive probability density, which is essential for rational decision support under uncertain conditions. The aims of this paper are twofold. First, it seeks to highlight the potential benefits of using climate projections in conjunction with Bayesian paradigms towards educated decision-making. Second, it discusses how to appropriately formulate probabilistic forecasts by coherently integrating information contained in climate projection ensembles with observations to improve the estimation of the probability density function of future climate states. The results show that the proposed Bayesian approach yields unbiased and sharper predictive distributions for temperature with respect to using the unprocessed ensemble distribution. It also yields improved predictive densities with respect to the Reliability Ensemble Averaging (REA) method. © 2021 The Authors.

Here we present a high-resolution multiproxy speleothem record (stable oxygen and carbon isotope ratios, petrography and magnetic properties) from Rio Martino Cave (Piedmont, Southern Alps, Italy), which covers the first part of the Penultimate Glacial (early MIS 6, 182–157 ka). During early MIS 6, the combination of high climatic precession and obliquity amplified the peak in Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer insolation intensity at ca. 174 ka to almost interglacial levels, leading to northward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the enhancement of the boreal monsoon system. At orbital scale, the hydroclimatic record from Rio Martino closely follows the precession pattern, and shows a wet interstadial phase between 180 and 170 ka, peaking at the precession minimum, characterized by glacial retreat and by the likely development of soils and vegetation up to 1900–2000 m a.s.l. in this alpine sector. This phase can be traced across the Southern Alps, and corresponds to pluvial conditions inferred from Western Mediterranean records, and to the interval of deposition of the cold Sapropel S6 in the eastern Mediterranean. We suggest that the interaction between an intensified northwesterly cold flow (relating to increased ice volume under glacial conditions), and the relatively warm waters of the NW Mediterranean (due to the peculiar atmospheric configuration occurring at the precession minimum) strongly enhanced the autumn cyclogenesis in the Northern Tyrrhenian Sea, fuelling intense precipitation to reach the Southern Alps. The Rio Martino record also shows a prominent sub-orbital variability, the overall structure of which is coherent with hemispheric changes in climate driven by cyclic perturbations of North Atlantic conditions related to the operation of the bipolar seesaw. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Alps; Penultimate glacial; Speleothem magnetic properties; Speleothems","Caves; Climate models; Magnetic properties; Magnetism; Alp; Condition; Environmental response; Hydrological response; Interstadials; Multiproxy records; Orbitals; Penultimate glacial; Speleothem; Speleothem magnetic property; Glacial geology; boundary condition; carbon isotope ratio; cyclogenesis; environmental response; interglacial; interstitial environment; Northern Hemisphere; speleothem; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Italy; Mediterranean Sea; New Zealand; Piedmont [Italy]; South Island; Southern Alps; Tyrrhenian Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102151183

However, the benefits of water injection strongly depend upon water evaporation and distribution of water vapours inside the combustion chamber. In this regard, water injector location and orientation are two significant geometrical parameters which decide the in-cylinder positioning of the water spray, evaporation, and vapour distribution. Therefore, this CFD study presents the effects of water injector location, and orientation on the in-cylinder air-water interaction, water evaporation, vapour distribution, performance and emission characteristics of a wall-guided GDI engine. It also presents the effects of water injector location and orientations on water evaporation rate, water droplet distribution, heat release rate, IMEP, and exhaust emissions. In this study, the spark-plug is considered as located in the middle of the cylinder head, and the water injector is mounted in between the exhaust valves. Four locations of the water injector (21 mm, 25 mm, 29 mm, and 33 mm from the spark-plug) are considered for the investigation. Also, the injector orientation is varied from 12° to 28°, in the step of 4°. The engine is operated under naturally aspirated and full-load conditions at an engine speed of 2000 rev/min. Analysis of results shows that the water evaporation rate increases when more amount of water is sprayed in the region where the velocities of water droplets are in the opposite direction of that of the in-cylinder air. It is found that the water injector located at 29 mm with the orientation of 24° is found to be optimum configuration, where the IMEP improved by about 9.2%, while NOx and soot emissions reduced by about 48.2% and 22.6% respectively compared to those of the case of no_water. © 2020 Karabuk University","CFD; GDI engine; Water evaporation; Water injector parameter; Water vapour distribution",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093695428

In general, rice farming in swampland is cultivated once a year before the dry season depending on land classification. This paper presents the swampland rice farming system's role as local wisdom that needs to be maintained for environment preservation and climate change mitigation. Data was collected through interviews with farmers and extension workers and reviews of relevant experimental studies and articles. The success of rice farming in swampland is primarily determined by nature such as sudden flood and drought. Swampland is divided into three typologies, namely shallow swampland, mid swampland, and deep swampland. The nursery system and rice variety selection are key for successful rice farming in swampland. There are dry and floating nursery systems in South Sumatra. The dry nursery is carried out in dry land and field beds, usually done for shallow swampland; floating nursery is carried out in higher water level swampland using rafts made from waterweeds. Some of superior adaptive varieties in swampland are Inpara-1, Inpara-2, Inpara-4, Batutegi, Limboto, Inpari-1, Inpari-4, Inpari-6, Inpari-9 and Mekongga which may increase production in swampland. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Drought; Water levels; Climate change mitigation; Dry land; Dry seasons; Environment preservation; Farming system; Field bed; Increase productions; Sumatra; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104836238

The increasing population growth, coupled with the contamination challenges of various water bodies through domestic and industrial activity, further exert pressure in the provision of fresh waste supply, necessitating the need for the country to improve its efficiency in treating municipality and industrial wastewater streams. Various physio-chemical processes for the treatment of industrial and domestic effluents are well established. However, as the policies on emission standards become more stringent, these technologies are becoming progressively inadequate as they often create secondary problems in the form of chemical baring sludge, which is extremely difficult to dispose of and is prohibitively expensive. Biotechnology-based (Bioremediation) approaches for the treatment of contaminated waste streams presents potential alternatives for both the domestic and industrial wastewater treatment sectors, at the time when energy costs are increasing and diverse environmental effects are becoming more and more apparent as a result of conventional chemical technologies. The environmental component of the South African bioeconomy identifies several biotechnological interventions that should be nurtured to assist in addressing the issues of the contaminated environment generally and wastewater in particular. This Introductory Note aims to reflect on some high-level strategic focus areas of the environmental component of the South African Bioeconomy Strategy, and also-to highlight some of the bioremediation Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) interventions that are being implemented in support of the county's transition to the circular economy including the conceptualization and development of the AWARE initiative-the technical outputs of which led to the compilation of this book. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Bioeconomy strategy; Bioremediation; Environmental biotechnology and wastewater treatment",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109207749

We hypothesize that efficient MUB having plant growth-promoting (PGP) attributes can be used for developing novel bio-inoculant for flooded paddy ecosystem which might not only reduce methane emission but also assist in improving the plant growth parameters. Hence, soil and plant samples were collected from the phyllosphere, rhizosphere, and non-rhizosphere of five rice-growing regions of India at the tillering stage and investigated for efficient methane-oxidizing and PGP bacteria. Based on the monooxygenase activity and percent methane utilization on NMS medium with methane as the sole C source, 123 isolates were identified and grouped phylogenetically into 13 bacteria and 2 yeast genera. Among different regions, a significantly higher number of isolates were obtained from lowland flooded paddy ecosystems of Aduthurai (33.33%) followed by Ernakulum (20.33%) and Brahmaputra valley (19.51%) as compared to upland irrigated regions of Gaya (17.07%) and Varanasi (8.94%). Among sub-samples, a significantly higher number of isolates were found inhabiting the phyllosphere (58.54%) followed by non-rhizosphere (25.20%) and rhizosphere (15.45%). Significantly higher utilization of methane and PGP attributes were observed in 30 isolates belonging to genera Hyphomicrobium, Burkholderia, Methylobacterium, Paenibacillus, Pseudomonas, Rahnella, and Meyerozyma. M. oryzae MNL7 showed significantly better growth with 74.33% of CH4 utilization at the rate of 302.9 ± 5.58 and exhibited half-maximal growth rate, Ks of 1.92 ± 0.092 mg CH4 L−1. Besides the ability to utilize CH4, P. polymyxa MaAL70 possessed PGP attributes such as solubilization of P, K, and Zn, fixation of atmospheric N and production of indole acetic acid (IAA). Both these promising isolates can be explored in the future for developing novel biofertilizers for flooded paddies.

Understanding relationships between these factors helps develop effective water and land management plans for these wetlands. In this study, variations in planktonic metabolism and microbial carbon substrate utilization were investigated in the semi-arid floodplain wetlands of the Macquarie Marshes, south-eastern Australia, by comparing three geomorphologically distinct zones with different historical inundation frequencies (zones 1: moderate, 2: low, and 3: very low). Floodplain soil samples collected from each zone were inundated artificially in controlled laboratory conditions. GPP and PR were determined using biological oxygen demand methods. Biolog EcoPlates™ were used to assess microbial utilization of carbon substrate. Among the zones examined, zone 1 had the highest GPP and lowest PR, while zone 3 had the lowest GPP and highest PR. GPP/PR showed zones 1 and 2 autotrophic, and zone 3 heterotrophic. EcoPlates showed the highest and lowest microbial activity in zone 3 and zone 1 respectively, indicating a strong link between microbial carbon substrate utilization and PR for heterotrophy in the rarely inundated zone. Inundation of drier wetland zones may lead to a large pulse in PR, at least for a short period of time, potentially leading to anoxic water events. When making decisions for environmental water allocations, the antecedent hydro-geomorphological and microbial condition of the targeted wetlands should be considered to help predict expected aquatic ecosystem responses. © 2021.

In this study, we focus on extreme associated with atmospheric rivers (ARs). ARs are characterized by intense moisture transport usually from the tropics to the extra-tropics. They can either be beneficial, providing critical water supply, or hazardous, when excessive precipitation accumulation leads to floods. Here, we examine the uncertainty in gridded precipitation products included in the Frequent Rainfall Observations on GridS (FROGS) database during two atmospheric river events in distinct Mediterranean climates: one in California, USA, and another in Portugal. FROGS is composed of gridded daily-precipitation products on a common 1° × 1° grid to facilitate intercomparison and assessment exercises. The database includes satellite, ground-based and reanalysis (RE) products. Results show that the precipitation products based on satellite data, individually or combined with other products, perform least well in capturing daily precipitation totals over land during both cases studied here. The RE and the gauge-based products show the best agreement with local ground stations. As expected, there is an overall underestimation of precipitation by the different products. For the Portuguese AR, the multi-product ensembles reveal mean absolute percentage errors between -25% and -60%. For the western US case, the range is from -60% to -100%. © 2021 The Author(s).

The presented GCI combustion strategy is based on a multi-mode combustion strategy at various operating conditions. This study presents a part of work on the development of an optimum combustion strategy at medium loading condition for commercial gasoline fuel with research octane number (RON) = 91. The single cylinder engine with a compression ratio (CR) = 16 features a centrally mounted multi-hole injector with a spark plug at a distance from the injector under shallow pent-roof combustion chamber design. The design of combustion chamber and piston was previously optimized based on CFD numerical analysis. The experimental study at medium load condition (IMEP = 6 bar) investigated the effect of fuel injection strategy, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and re-breathing on the targeted engine results. The study revealed that large amount of EGR is required with single injection strategy to meet the required engine out nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission target with a reasonable maximum rate of pressure rise (MRPR) and indicated specific fuel consumption (ISFC) whereas double injection strategy could potentially lower the required EGR dilution to meet the same NOx target. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed and the results support the experimental finding in terms of best injection timing by providing spray wall interaction and mixture preparation for SI strategy. The ignition delay based on fuel-mass-weighted mean equivalence ratio and temperature was used to explain combustion phase and agreed well with the engine experimental findings. The re-breathing favors to reduce the NOX emission lower to 0.2 g/kWh with lower hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions compared to single and double injection strategies. While the NOX emission target could be met based on the various strategies, HC emission is not within the emission target. This study recommends further optimization studies in the near future to meet the overall engine out emission targets. © 2021 SAE International.

Data on agricultural systems to produce food, provide income for smallholders and reduce greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions are scarce in Sub-Saharan Africa countries. Here, we assessed the potential of agroecological practices (AP) on economic benefits to farmers, GHG balance derived from agricultural activities, and efficiency of economic investments to mitigate GHG. The study was based on a NGO rural development project, which promoted AP: agroforestry, compost, and System of Rice Intensification. The economic and GHG mitigation benefits were projected over a period of 20 years on three scenarios. Two scenarios, differing by two expected levels of AP adoption, were compared to a reference one, in which there was no NGO intervention. Socio-economic, yield and soil data were gathered on 192 farms during five growing seasons (2013–2018). The GHG balance was estimated with TropiC Farm Tool and EX-ACT. The GHG emissions were reduced in both scenarios compared to the reference one: −5.2 to −13.6 tCO2eq farm−1 yr−1 for scenario 1 and 2 respectively. At the regional scale, the projected amount of C saved per euro invested was estimated at −0.25 tCO2eq euro−1 and -0.41 tCO2eq Euro−1 (or € 4 to 2.5 tCO2eq−1) under scenario 1 and scenario 2. The annual cash flow of farmers increased over the 20 years. Our study highlighted the potential of AP for increasing productivity and profitability of smallholder agricultural systems for the Malagasy farmers, while simultaneously contributing to climate change mitigation. © 2020","Agroforestry; Carbon footprint; Compost; Emission; Sink; System of rice intensification","Agricultural implements; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Climate change; Composting; Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Regional planning; Agricultural activities; Agricultural system; Climate change mitigation; Greenhouse gas balance; Smallholder farmers; Sub-saharan africa; Sustainable agriculture; System of rice intensifications; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097065326

Box 64, Helsinki, 00014, Finland","Simulations by the EURO-CORDEX (European branch of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment) regional climate models indicate a widespread future decrease in snow water equivalent (SWE) in northern Europe. This concurs with the negative interannual correlation between SWE and winter temperature in the southern parts of the domain but not with the positive correlation observed further north and over the Scandinavian mountains. To better understand these similarities and differences, interannual variations and projected future changes in SWE are attributed to anomalies or changes in three factors: total precipitation, the snowfall fraction of precipitation and the fraction of accumulated snowfall that remains on the ground (the snow-on-ground fraction). In areas with relatively mild winter climate, the latter two terms govern both the long-term change and interannual variability, resulting in less snow with higher temperatures. In colder areas, however, interannual SWE variability is dominated by variations in total precipitation. Since total precipitation is positively correlated with temperature, more snow tends to accumulate in milder winters. Still, even in these areas, SWE is projected to decrease in the future due to the reduced snowfall and snow-on-ground fractions in response to higher temperatures. Although winter total precipitation is projected to increase, its increase is smaller than would be expected from the interannual covariation of temperature and precipitation and is therefore insufficient to compensate the lower snowfall and snow-on-ground fractions. Furthermore, interannual SWE variability in northern Europe in the simulated warmer future climate is increasingly governed by variations in the snowfall and snow-on-ground fractions and less by variations in total precipitation. © Author(s) 2021.",,"annual variation; cryosphere; long-term change; snow cover; Northern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103769658

However, until now there has been no in-depth study about Kelambut music. The purpose of this study is to identify the traditional music of Kelambut musically and to know the meaning of Kelambut for the Waena tribe. This research was conducted using qualitative methods. The data source is the music of Kelambut itself; the informants are the chief of the Waena tribe, performers, and local cultural observer. All data collected through participative observation, interviews, records, and FGDs were analyzed using ethnic music theory and structural-functional theory. The results are: (1) Kelambut is a traditional musical instrument made from natural environmental wood in the Sentani area. It resembles a boat and is played by hitting the inside part and functions as a communication tool and musical accompaniment to dance. (2) Besides valuing it as a work of art, to balance life with the environment, the Waena tribe also interprets Kelambut as sacred music which provides protection, as a liaison with their ancestors, as a sign of the appointment of a tribal chief (Ondoafi), and as the cultural identity. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Climate change mitigation; Communication tools; Cultural identity; Data-source; In-depth study; Music theory; Qualitative method; Structural-functional; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104847558

In light of these growing challenges, we used data collected in 2018 from farm households in Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, and Mozambique to investigate the climate threats encountered by farmers and the ex-ante climate risk adaptation strategies they adopted. Drought, floods, hailstorms, and crop pests and diseases were the most common climate threats in these countries. Unlike previous studies, we also assessed the adaptive capacity at the macro level by using secondary data. We reviewed the factors that affect the adaptive capacity of each nation to address climate risks. At the micro-level, we assessed the factors influencing the choice of ex-ante adaptation measures by using primary data collected from 4351 farm households. Micro-level data also include the variables that indicate the adaptive capacity of farm households, such as asset ownership, demographic characteristics, and participation in local institutions. Results showed five major ex-ante climate risk adaptation strategies – change in farming practice, sustainable land management, seek alternative livelihood, saving, and other unspecified strategies – are prevalent in the region. We used a multivariate probit model to investigate the factors explaining the choice of ex-ante climate risk adaptation strategy. Results showed that female-headed households and households with married heads were more likely than male-headed households to change farming practices to adapt to climate risk. Surprisingly, land ownership was found to be insignificant in all cases. Relatively rich families tended to apply either change in farming practice or saving as a measure to adapt to climate risks. Training on climate-smart agriculture was found to enhance the adoption of sustainable land management as adaptation strategies by farm households. Our findings exhibit substantial differences within and among countries regarding the adoption of ex-ante climate adaptation strategies by farm households. In comparison to farmers in Mozambique's northern region, farmers in all other locations were more likely to apply agricultural measures such as change in farming practice and sustainable land management, while they were more likely to apply non-agricultural measures to adapt to risk. Macro-level indicators show that national adaptive capacity is substantially low in all countries, but considerably varies across them. © 2021","Climate risks; Ex-ante climate adaptation measures; Farm household; Macro-level indicators of adaptive capacity; Sub-Saharan Africa",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112509250

Notwithstanding rigorous analyses of its electronic properties, little attention has been paid so far to explore and tailor the thermal transport characteristics of silicene. This study employed optimized Tersoff potential to extensively investigate the thermal conductivity (TC) of pristine and defective silicene using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations. We analyzed the influence of temperature variation, percentage of carbon doping, and monovacancy concentration on the phonon TC along both armchair and zigzag directions and elucidated the underlying mechanisms that modulate these effects. The simulation results reveal excellent isotropic behavior of the material in the considered temperature regime. Our predicted room-temperature TC of pristine silicene of ~ 20 W/m.K shows excellent conformity with prior studies. Simulation results suggest that the TC deteriorates significantly with increasing concentration of carbon doping. It is revealed that incorporating only 5% of carbon dopants can reduce the TC of silicene by ~ 71%. Meanwhile, with the increase in temperature from 100 K to 600 K, the thermal conductivities of both pristine and carbon-doped silicene are also found to decline dramatically by ~14 W/m.K and ~9 W/m.K, respectively. The vacancy defect study reveals that thermal conductivities of both pure and carbon-doped silicene are also a strong function of vacancy concentration and can be reduced by ~ 58% by removing only 1% of silicon atom from the pristine nanosheet. It is further disclosed that the impact of vacancy on regulating the TC is more pronounced in pristine silicene than the carbon-doped silicene. To obtain a detailed insight into the thermal transport mechanism, phonon density of states (PDOS) is computed using the fast Fourier transform of the atomic velocity autocorrelation function. The PDOS discloses interesting phonon spectrum features under impurity doping, temperature variation, and increased vacancy concentration. Overall, this study offers a comprehensive roadmap for engineering the thermal conductivity of silicene and will grease the wheels for designing efficient thermal management systems for the present silicon-based semiconductor industry. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon doping; Phonon Density of States (PDOS); Silicene; Thermal conductivity (TC); Thermoelectric devices; Vacancy defects","Carbon; Defects; Electronic properties; Fast Fourier transforms; Molecular dynamics; Phonons; Semiconductor device manufacture; Semiconductor doping; Silicene; Spectrum analysis; Temperature distribution; Thermal Engineering; Non equilibrium molecular dynamic (NEMD); Phonon density of state; Phonon spectrum feature; Phonon thermal conductivity; Semiconductor industry; Temperature variation; Thermal management systems; Vacancy concentration; Thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100592638

Temporal changes in rainfall were assessed using a linear regression method, while aridity conditions at each meteorological station were measured using the United Nations Environment Programme climate aridity index. In this study, drought and wet spell patterns were identified using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The Spearman's Rho (SR) test was applied to find trends in the temporal 1-month and 12-month SPEI data. Balakot, Dir, Kakul, Kalam, Malam Jabba, Parachinar, Patan and Saidu were humid whereas Cherat and Timergara were sub-humid meteorological stations while Bannu, Chitral, Drosh and Peshawar were semi-arid and D.I. Khan was found to be the only arid meteorological station in the study area. The regression results revealed that the amount of rainfall is decreasing at Balakot, Kakul and Dir, while in the southern part of the province the amount of rainfall is increasing, such as in Parachinar and Cherat. The SPEI results revealed distinct drought spells in 1971-1974, 1984-1989, 1998-2004 and recently in 2017-2018, in almost all met-stations results. The SR results indicated a significant wet trend at met-station Parachinar, located in the west, while a significant drying trend has been noted at Balakot in the north-eastern part of the study area.

HMA incorporated with a high RAP content (e.g., 40%), which is the most commonly used, may have prominent adverse effects on life cycle, performance properties, and related costs. Thus, before utilizing RAP, it is essential to investigate whether it is still economical to use under the local climate by taking into consideration the life cycle performance. Therefore, for this paper, a case study was conducted using 20% RAP, assessed in terms of materials related to cost analysis. The results of the analysis showed that, from the total life cycle costing measurement, a total of 14% cost reduction was reported using RAP as compared to conventional materials. Moreover, the two materials (conventional HMA and RAP) are manufactured in different types of manufacturing plants. Thus, in analyzing the cost difference between the two chosen manufacturing plants for virgin materials and RAP, a total of 57% cost reduction was observed for a RAP manufacturing plant. Besides this, no cost difference was observed in the rest of the phases, such as manpower, materials transportation, and construction activities, as the same procedures and types of machinery are used. Furthermore, assessing the carbon dioxide impact and cost, the transportation and machinery emissions were considered, while the plant’s operation emission was omitted due to the unavailability of the data. © 2021 by the authors.

In this analysis, using five global integrated assessment models, we quantify the emission reductions in key air pollutants resulting from the decarbonization of energy systems and the resulting changes in premature mortality attributed to the exposure to ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter. The emission reductions differ by sectors. Sulfur emissions are mainly reduced from power plants and industry, cuts in nitrogen oxides are dominated by the transport sector, and the largest abatement of primary fine particles is achieved in the residential sector. The analysis also shows that health benefits are the largest when policies addressing climate change mitigation and stringent air pollution controls are coordinated. We decompose the key factors that determine the extent of health co-benefits, focusing on Asia: changes in emissions, urbanization rates, population growth and ageing. Demographic processes, particularly due to ageing population, counteract in many regions the mortality reductions realized through lower emissions. © 2021 The Author(s).

Study focus: Quantification of urban greening effects usually requires relatively complex and integrated models. In this contribution, we apply well-established hydrological, biomass and energy balance equations to derive meta-models for the estimation of runoff reduction, urban surface heating and thermal protection of buildings, in order to quantify the effects of the greening of 1 m2 of impervious surface (e.g. roofs, sealed ground surfaces and underground parking lots). New hydrological insights for the region: We propose empirical meta-models for the quick appraisal of urban greening benefits including: urban runoff reduction due to soil water retention and evapotranspiration, land surface temperature reduction, reduction of the indoor temperature beneath the greened surface, dry biomass growth. We show that the choice of vegetation growth parameters has a limited effect on the results, although the amount of produced bulk biomass obviously depends on vegetation type. The proposed meta-models can be applied for the assessment of urban greening benefits at the stage of policy evaluation, land planning and the programming of investments at regional or continental scale, before undertaking more detailed and site-specific calculations as required in the design phase. © 2021","Climate change mitigation; Energy; Runoff; Urban greening; Urban heat island",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099609130

This study assessed the likely hydrologic responses and changes in streamflow due to future climate change within the Alabama River Basin (ARB) for the mid-21st century 2045 (“2030–2060”) and end-21st century 2075 (“2060–2090”). Using an integrated modeling approach, General Circulation Model (GCM) datasets; the Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques Climate Model 5 (CNRM-CM5), the Community Earth System Model, version 1–Biogeochemistry (CESM1-BGC.1), and the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 2 (HADGEM2-AO.1), under medium Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5, and based on World Climate Research Program (WCRP)’s Couple Model Intercomparison Phase 5 (CMIP5), were assimilated into calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Mann–Kendall and Theil Sen’s slope were used to assess the trends and magnitude of variability of the historical climate data used for setting up the model. The model calibration showed goodness of fit with minimum Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) coefficient values of 0.83 and Coefficient of Determination (R2) of 0.88 for the three gages within the ARB. Next, the research assessed changes in streamflow for the years 2045 and 2075 against that of the reference baseline year of 1980. The results indicate situations of likely increase and decrease in mean monthly streamflow discharge and increase in the frequency and variability in peak flows during the periods from the mid to end of the 21st century. Seasonally, monthly streamflow increases between 50% and 250% were found for spring and autumn months with decreases in summer months for 2045. Spring and summer months for 2075 resulted in increased monthly streamflow between 50% and 300%, while autumn and spring months experienced decreased streamflow. While the results are prone to inherent uncertainties in the downscaled GCM data used, the simulated dynamics in streamflow and water availability provide critical information for stakeholders to develop sustainable water management and climate change adaptation options for the ARB. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we probed the displacement physics that govern the oil mobilization during tertiary carbonated water injection (CWI) and the subsequent depressurization process in an oil-wet carbonate. To this end, a series of miniature core-flooding experiments were performed at elevated pressure and temperature conditions, utilizing a customized core-flooding setup integrated with a high-resolution micro-CT scanner. The results showed that CWI and the in situ CO2 exsolution substantially reduce the remaining oil saturation left stranded after blank (i.e., unadulterated) waterflooding. Furthermore, in situ contact angle measurements yielded direct evidence of wettability reversal toward reduced oil wetness due to the CWI. The wettability reversal occurred nonuniformly mainly due to the interactions between the rock surface and carbonated water. We found that pore-scale mechanisms governing oil mobilization during the tertiary CWI included a decrease in the threshold brine pressure of displacements, swelling and coalescence of oil ganglia due to the CO2 diffusion from brine to the oil phase, and brine flow diversion. During the in situ CO2 exsolution process, gas bubbles preferably formed, grew, and resided in larger pore elements. The growth of the gas globules induced gas-to-oil-to-brine double displacements. Further, oil formed spreading layers sandwiched between the gas and brine phases. The synergistic effects of spreading oil layers and oil displacements prompted the isolated oil globules to coalesce, enhanced the local connectivity of the oil phase, and facilitated the oil mobilization. The oil mobilization realized by in situ degassing was mainly achieved in medium-sized pores. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Computerized tomography; Contact angle; Floods; Porous materials; Wetting; Depressurizations; Elevated pressure; Experimental investigations; Local connectivity; Remaining oil saturations; Synergistic effect; Wettability reversal; X ray microtomography; Secondary recovery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105051457

However, the relevant research for banana plantations to date is limited. In this study, natural forest and banana plantations with different cultivation ages (3, 7, 10, and 22 y) were chosen in a subtropical region, and the 15N dilution technique was used to determine the gross MNorg and ONH4 rates. The objective was to evaluate the effect of the conversion of natural forests to banana plantations on inorganic N supply capacity (MNorg + ONH4) and other relevant factors. Compared to other natural forests in tropical and subtropical regions reported on by previous studies, the natural forest in this study was characterized by a relatively low MNorg rate and a high ONH4 rate in the soil, resulting in the presence of inorganic N dominated by nitrate. Compared to the natural forest, 3 y banana cultivation increased the MNorg and ONH4 rates and inorganic N availability in the soil, but these rates were significantly reduced with prolonged banana cultivation. Furthermore, the mean residence times of ammonium and nitrate were shorter in the 3 y than in the 7, 10, and 22 y banana plantations, indicating a reduced turnover of ammonium and nitrate in soil subjected to long-term banana cultivation. In addition, the conversion of natural forest to banana plantation reduced the soil organic carbon (SOC), total N and calcium concentrations, as well as water holding capacity (WHC), cation exchangeable capacity (CEC), and pH, more obviously in soils subjected to long-term banana cultivation. The MNorg and ONH4 rates were significantly and positively related to the SOC and TN concentrations, as well as the WHC and CEC, suggesting that the decline in soil quality after long-term banana cultivation could significantly inhibit MNorg and ONH4 rates, thus reducing inorganic N supply and turnover. Increasing the amount of soil organic matter may be an effective measure for stimulating N cycling for long-term banana cultivation © 2021 by the authors.

The lack of consensus on dust dynamics from sources to leeward regions fundamentally limits interpretation of the preserved past climate and dust record. Here, we investigate chronostratigraphic variability of aeolian deposits in upwind regions of the modern Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) and attempt to understand dust dynamics that potentially affects loess deposition downwind. The strata consist of alternating layers of typical loess, well-sorted sand, and sandy loess, with obvious unconformities occurring at the transitions from loess to sand. We suggest that pre-existing typical loess in regions to the northwest of the modern CLP was eroded by wind, providing a significant source of homogeneous dust for the dust deposits downwind. The sand deposits interbedded with typical loess at the study sites suggests that proximal deserts have greatly expanded and contracted repeatedly prior to the Holocene. However, the spatial extents of the deserts, as inferred from the sections here, have not markedly diminished after the major expansion during the Last Glacial Maximum. Such a pattern of proximal desert dynamics plays an important role in regulating dust emission and transport, strongly affecting dust sequences on the CLP. Our results suggest a complex scenario of dust dynamics in upwind regions of the CLP at least over the Late Quaternary; the involved processes have to be considered when using conventional proxies from Chinese loess deposits to recover the history of climate and dust changes. © Copyright © 2021 Qiang, Stevens, Li, Hu, Wang, Lang and Chen.","aeolian deposits; Chinese loess; dust; erosional hiatus; proximal desert","Arid regions; Deposits; Dust; Dynamics; Landforms; Aeolian deposits; Alternating layers; Chinese Loess Plateau; Global climates; Last Glacial Maximum; Late quaternary; Loess deposition; Spatial extent; Sediments; depositional environment; dust; eolian deposit; eolian process; loess; Quaternary; sediment transport; China; Loess Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104974890

However, little is known about core players and their mechanisms in this process due to the complexity of PAH degradation and the large number of microorganisms involved. Here we analyzed potential core players in a black-odorous sediment using gradient-dilution culturing, isolation and genomic/metagenomic approaches. Along the dilution gradient, microbial PAH degradation and sulfate consumption were not decreased, and even a significant (p = 0.003) increase was observed in the degradation of phenanthrene although the microbial diversity declined. Two species, affiliated with Desulfovibrio and Petrimonas, were commonly present in all of the gradients as keystone taxa and showed as the dominant microorganisms in the single colony (SB8) isolated from the highest dilution culture with 93.49% and 4.73% of the microbial community, respectively. Desulfovibrio sp. SB8 and Petrimonas sp. SB8 could serve together as core players for sulfate-reduction coupling PAH degradation, in which Desulfovibrio sp.

However, the adoption of electric vehicles would bring great challenges to the distribution transformer, as their charging behavior would make the transformer operate under the varying load and therefore submit to overload risk. Hence, the insulation aging which shortens the transformer lifetime would be accelerated. In this research, we study the impacts of electric vehicle charging on the aging of the distribution transformer with conventional and higherature insulations. The number of households, base load and charging habits of a district in Jiaxing city are collected, and then a Monte Carlo simulation model is proposed to evaluate the additional load demand due to the electric vehicle charging. Furthermore, the simulated load demand is input to a model, which is modified based on the algorithm stipulated in IEEE C57.91, to calculate the thermal rise and the aging of the distribution transformer. The results imply that the electric vehicle charging would exacerbate the swing of the load demand. Particularly, the lifetime of the conventional distribution transformer would be significantly reduced. In comparison, the higherature insulation could mitigate the negative impacts of the electric vehicle charging on the transformer ageing. © 2021 IEEE.","ageing; electric vehicle; insulation; overload; transformer","Charging (batteries); Electric automobiles; Electric transformer insulation; Electric transformer loads; Monte Carlo methods; Additional loads; Carbon emissions; Distribution transformer; Electric vehicle charging; Insulation aging; Jiaxing cities; Overload risks; Transformer ageing; Electric load distribution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114025020

In the current study, the crystalline and valency factors that influence the CO2R activities of OD-Cu are revisited by employing single crystal Cu(111) foils that exclude convolutions from initial morphological and crystallographic heterogeneity. We observe that the overall CO2R performance, especially the C2H4 selectivity, correlates well with the initial oxidation level of the Cu(111) foil, of which the surface oxide layer is reduced into small fragments comprising rich grain boundaries and diversely orientated facets. Nonetheless, we find that the polycrystallinity and grain boundaries of OD-Cu, in this circumstance, are not the major causes of the observed activity enhancement. Instead, a transition state between the initial oxide and the finally reduced copper phases, as well as its longevity, dictates the catalytic property of OD-Cu in electrochemical CO2 reduction. Consequently, this work furnishes further evidence and in-depth understanding to help clarify the catalytic mechanism of OD-Cu in CO2R. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Copper; Grain boundaries; Reduction; Single crystals; Activity enhancement; Catalytic mechanisms; Catalytic properties; In-depth understanding; Initial oxidation; Multielectron transfer; Polycrystallinity; Surface oxide layer; Copper compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105089390

The large number of people who have low incomes means there is a risk of household economic conditions being threatened when food prices are not controlled. We present a different approach by measuring rice price volatility at the local market level with climate and macroeconomic variables. The model succeeds in representing the variables that affect rice prices by an average of 75% nationally. The influence of macroeconomic variables and climate dynamics was found to have a non-uniform pattern from one region to another. The factors that dominate the volatility of rice prices in each province were different. To help address these problems, it is suggested to model and integrate climate data and macroeconomic variables. The output can be used to determine national policies for controllable factors and anticipate climate dynamics to reduce the risk that communities will have difficulty accessing food. © 2021 by the authors.

However, SRF plantations could also be sources of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions, which can impact atmospheric air quality. In this study, emissions of isoprene and 11 monoterpenes from the branches and forest floor of hybrid aspen, Italian alder and Sitka spruce stands in an SRF field trial in central Scotland were measured during two years (2018-2019) and used to derive emission potentials for different seasons. Sitka spruce was included as a comparison as it is the most extensive plantation species in the UK. Winter and spring emissions of isoprene and monoterpenes were small compared to those in summer. Sitka spruce had a standardised mean emission rate of 15 μgCg-1 h-1 for isoprene in the dry and warm summer of 2018 - more than double the emissions in 2019. However, standardised mean isoprene emissions from hybrid aspen were similar across both years, approximately 23 μgCg-1 h-1, and standardised mean isoprene emissions from Italian alder were very low. Mean standardised total monoterpene emissions for these species followed a similar pattern of higher standardised emissions in the warmer year: Sitka spruce emitting 4.5 and 2.3 μgCg-1 h-1 for 2018 and 2019, aspen emitting 0.3 and 0.09 μgCg-1 h-1, and Italian alder emitting 1.5 and 0.2 μgCg-1 h-1, respectively. In contrast to these foliage emissions, the forest floor was only a small source of monoterpenes, typically 1 or 2 orders of magnitude lower than foliage emissions on a unit of ground area basis. Estimates of total annual emissions from each plantation type per hectare were derived using the MEGAN 2.1 model. The modelled total BVOC (isoprene and monoterpenes) emissions of SRF hybrid aspen plantations were approximately half those of Sitka spruce for plantations of the same age. Italian alder SRF emissions were 20 times smaller than from Sitka spruce. The expansion of bioenergy plantations to 0.7 Mha has been suggested for the UK to help achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The model estimates show that, with such an expansion, total UK BVOC emissions would increase between < 1% and 35 %, depending on the tree species planted. Whereas increases might be small on a national scale, regional increases might have a larger impact on local air quality. © Author(s) 2021.",,"coniferous tree; deciduous tree; emission; isoprene; monoterpene; plantation forestry; United Kingdom; Picea sitchensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104502220

This study evaluates and compares the potential environmental effects of electric, hybrid, petrol, and diesel cars in Spain using a cradle-to-grave Life Cycle Assessment approach. It aims to accomplish a precise analysis of a wide range of environmental impact categories. To this end, we provide a transparent inventory of components and vehicle manufacture, their distribution, use phase, and end-of-life, together with a detailed description of the Spanish 2014–2018 electricity generation mix. Furthermore, based on European projections, the work evaluates future energy scenarios, 2030 and 2050, to assess the impact of increasing renewable electricity in electric cars. In the current Spanish scenario and assuming a lifetime of 150,000 km, BEV life cycle CO2-eq emissions are 48% lower than petrol ICEV. Future scenarios of the Spanish electricity grid confirm that a massive introduction of renewable energies would lead to a 19.26% and 27.41% decrease of CO2-eq emissions in 2030 and 2050, respectively. Nevertheless, current and future energy scenario predictions show that electric vehicles will produce an increase in fine particulate matter formation (26%), human carcinogenic (20%) and non-carcinogenic toxicity (61%), terrestrial ecotoxicity (31%), freshwater ecotoxicity (39%), and marine ecotoxicity (41%) relative to petrol vehicles. Transfer of environmental burdens from the use phase to the raw materials extraction and manufacturing phases entails a delocalisation of the impacts, which constitutes a new challenge at environmental, social, and legal levels.

It is a fast-growing tree of high economic and cultural importance. On the other hand, it is an invasive species, causing changes in soil chemistry and light regime, and consequently altering the plant communities. Previously published models developed for the potential distribution of R. pseudoacacia concerned 2070, and were based mainly on data from Western and Central Europe; here we extended these findings and included additional data from Eastern Europe. To fill the gap in current knowledge of R. pseudoacacia distribution and improve the reliability of forecasts, we aimed to (i) determine the extent to which the outcome of range modeling will be affected by complementing R. pseudoacacia occurrence data with sites from Central, Southeastern, and Eastern Europe, (ii) identify and quantify the changes in the availability of climate niches for 2050 and 2070, and discuss their impacts on forest management and nature conservation. We showed that the majority of the range changes expected in 2070 will occur as early as 2050. In comparison to previous studies, we demonstrated a greater eastward shift of potential niches of this species and a greater decline of potential niches in Southern Europe. Consequently, future climatic conditions will likely favor the occurrence of R. pseudoacacia in Central and Northeastern Europe where this species is still absent or relatively rare. There, controlling the spread of R. pseudoacacia will require monitoring sources of invasion in the landscape and reducing the occurrence of this species. The expected effects of climate change will likely be observed 20 years earlier than previously forecasted. Hence we highlighted the urgent need for acceleration of policies aimed at climate change mitigation in Europe. Also, our results showed the need for using more complete distribution data to analyze potential niche models. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","bioclimatic modeling; biological invasions; forest management; MaxEnt; nature conservation; niche modeling; species distribution models","bioclimatology; biological invasion; climate change; climate effect; forest management; locust; maximum entropy analysis; nature conservation; niche; population distribution; range expansion; Europe; Robinia pseudoacacia; climate change; Eastern Europe; Europe; reproducibility; Robinia; Climate Change; Europe; Europe, Eastern; Reproducibility of Results; Robinia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099811974

Given that the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions increases until 2050 will come from low- and middle-income countries, finding cost-effective ways to mitigate climate change while meeting development targets is essential. However, recent research has shown some of the limitations of broad financing mechanisms, such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and existing carbon markets. This has resulted in a growing interest in designing novel investment support schemes, such as modifications of feed-in tariffs (FiTs) that may be more cost effective and better targeted towards particular outcomes when compared to traditional deployment subsidies or broad financing mechanisms. We evaluate the design and outcomes of one such novel support schemes: the GET FiT (Global Energy Transfer Feed-in Tariff) investment support scheme in Uganda, which has attracted ~ 453 million USD in private sector investment for 17 small-scale renewable energy projects (solar, hydro, bagasse) in only three years. Using financial modelling on detailed project-level data, we find that most projects were additional and would therefore not have been built without the subsidy. In addition, using firm-level panel data, we show that power outages hamper manufacturing performance in Uganda. In the absence of reliable outage-data for the entire Ugandan territory, we use nightlight variations to proxy changes in outages.

The main objective of this study is to determine the effects of these land use land cover (LULC) transformations on regional meteorology over this region. Satellite derived LULC classes in 2003 and 2012 reveal conversion of significantly large areas of barrenland to open shrubland and open shrubland to cropland over Northwest India. Model simulations show that these LULC changes (LULCC) alone decreases sensible heat flux (SHF) over this region by −5.85 ± 0.24Wm−2 and enhances latent heat flux (LHF) by 11.03 ± 0.41Wm−2, with prominent changes over the exact regions of LULCC. These alterations lead to decrease in surface level air temperature by −0.14 ± 0.005 K and increase in relative humidity by 1.48 ± 0.03%. While reanalysis data show increase (decrease) in LHF (SHF) at a rate of 8.5Wm−2dec−1 (−5.67Wm−2dec−1), satellite measurements show increasing trend in near surface relative humidity at a rate of 2.13%dec−1 with an increasing trend in daily mean air temperature (0.3Kdec−1). However, day time air temperature and diurnal temperature range decreases at rates of −0.007Kdec−1 and − 0.6Kdec−1 respectively. To delineate the contribution of LULCC from the measured trend of daily mean temperatures, Observation Minus Reanalysis (OMR) method has been employed. OMR analysis shows a decreasing trend in daily mean temperature (−0.48Kdec−1) and increasing trend in RH (6.85% dec−1), corroborating the model simulated changes. The study shows increase in vegetated area over Northwest India, which leads to increase in evapo-transpiration. This affects the regional meteorology by enhancing humidity and SHF and reducing LHF and temperature. These results demonstrate that the land-based mitigation strategies yield measurable climatic benefits over the period of one or two decades, in contrast to the much longer time period generally required for greenhouse gases to cycle through the climate system. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Humidity; IRS-P6 AWiFS; Land use land cover; Latent heat flux; OMR method; Sensible heat flux; Temperature","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Atmospheric temperature; Greenhouse gases; Heat flux; Land use; Diurnal temperature ranges; Land use/ land covers; Land use/land cover; Mean air temperatures; Mitigation strategy; Model simulation; Satellite measurements; Sensible heat flux; Meteorology; air temperature; anthropogenic effect; climate change; evapotranspiration; land cover; land use change; latent heat flux; regional climate; relative humidity; Resourcesat; satellite data; sensible heat flux; vegetation cover; air temperature; article; climate; cropland; evapotranspiration; greenhouse gas; heat; humidity; India; meteorology; scrub; simulation; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092668543

This review compares the activation of three model substrates (H2, H2C=CH2, CO2) by (i) 9,10-dihydro-9,10-diboraanthracene dianions, (ii) their neutral carbene-stabilized congeners, (iii) 1,3,2,5-diazadiborinines, and (iv) 1,4,2,5-diazadiborinines. Distinct structure-properties relationships become apparent, the most influential factors being (i) the steric demands of the B-bonded substituents, (ii) the charges on the B-doped (hetero)arenes, (iii) charge polarization as a result of additional N-doping, and (iv) the energies and nodal structures of the frontier orbitals. The observed reactions are explained by a transition metal-like activation mechanism. If the two boron atoms are chemically inequivalent, contributions of a B(+I)/B(+III) mixed-valence state determine the observed regioselectivities when polar substrates are added. The lessons learned from the conversions of the model substrates are subsequently used to rationalize the behavior of the B2 heterocycles also toward more sophisticated substrate molecules.

This investigative review examines spatial and temporal trends in UFP concentrations in North America. We analyze (i) multiyear (2006–2016) datasets from 11 stationary sampling sites and (ii) shorter duration, but highly spatially resolved mobile/stationary sampling data (2017–2019) in three cities (Baltimore, Oakland, and Pittsburgh). UFP concentrations have fallen by an average 30% over the past decade, similar to the reduction of PM2.5 mass concentration (35%). UFP reductions are likely a co-benefit of PM2.5 and other pollutant regulations. UFP have a factor of two to three spatial variation both within and between cities. Traffic is a major factor influencing intra-urban spatial variations. New particle formation (nucleation) is also an important source of UFP in many places. Regulations to reduce SO2 emissions from coal combustion have reduced nucleation events in the Eastern U.S., but some coastal areas with Mediterranean climates still have consistent new particle formation events. Highly spatially resolved UFP exposures in urban areas can be estimated using spatial models such as land use regression (LUR) fit to high spatial resolution data. Data collection for these models often uses mobile monitoring or other short-term sampling strategies because there is not a national-scale monitoring network for UFP. Short-term sampling produces LURs with modest (R2 &lt; 0.5) performance; model performance can be improved with additional sampling. The current ability to estimate exposure at high spatial resolution over larger (e.g., national) scales is limited by a lack of data. We discuss strategies to improve UFP quantification and therefore exposure estimates. © 2021 The Author(s)","Exposure; PM2.5; Ultrafine particles","Crystallization; Data acquisition; Image resolution; Land use; Nucleation; Sulfur dioxide; Additional sampling; Fine particulate matter; High spatial resolution; Land use regression; Mediterranean climates; New particle formation; Spatial and temporal trends; Ultrafine particle exposures; Coal combustion; coal combustion; diameter; land use change; particulate matter; performance assessment; pollution exposure; quantitative analysis; regression analysis; spatial resolution; spatial variation; article; city; climate; combustion; Maryland; particulate matter 2.5; seashore; ultrafine particulate matter; urban area; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103721655

It is generally known that domestic wastewater management activities are significant contributors to the emissions due to its biological process that produces methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide. Various studies related to GHGs emissions from this sector have been conducted. However, only limited studies focused on the on-site sewage treatment. Since 72% of total existing wastewater treatment facilities in Indonesia are on-site systems, this study attempted to estimate GHGs emissions from each component in the system using the IPCC method. Depok City was chosen as the study case and the estimation was limited to on-site treatment tank, wastewater collection tank, and fecal sludge treatment system. Our study estimated that the total annual emissions from the on-site sewage system in Depok City were 232.45 Gg CO2eq, consisted of 232.39 Gg CO2eq of on-site emissions and 0.0662 Gg CO2eq of off-site emissions. Among the system component, direct emissions from the on-site treatment such as septic tanks is the highest contributor to the total emission (70% followed by direct emission from fecal sludge treatment plant (19%). Through scenario evaluations, this study suggests that converting private septic tanks into the communal type is the most effective strategy in reducing total GHGs emissions from on-site wastewater treatment systems. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Global warming; Nitrogen oxides; Septic tanks; Sewage treatment; Wastewater treatment; Global warming and climate changes; On-site sewage systems; On-site sewage treatment; On-site wastewater treatment systems; Scenario evaluation; Sludge treatment plants; Wastewater collection; Wastewater treatment facilities; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104893779

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method is the most commonly used in estimating the emissions from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). However, it is difficult to establish technical strategies in emissions reduction as the method cannot identify which treatment unit contributes to the total emission. In this study, we estimated GHGs from WWTPs using the Bridal Model based on the operations and processes in each treatment plant unit. We applied the model to three WWTPs located in Fukushima, Koriyama, and Nihonmatsu City, Japan. The results were evaluated by comparisons with those estimated by the IPCC method. The bridle model results showed that the average daily GHG emissions in Fukushima, Koriyama, and Nihonmatsu in the 2015-2018 period were 86.4, 55.2 and 6.2 ton CO2 eq/day. Furthermore, emissions from the three WWTPS per m3 of treated wastewater were insignificantly different from those estimated by the IPCC method. Sludge treatment was the most sensitive treatment unit as it contributes to 31.8-70.3% of the total emission, followed by chemical and biological treatment units. The study suggests that utilizing biogases produced from the sludge treatment could reduce 21.4-49% of total emissions from a WWTP. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Emission control; Global warming; Sewage pumping plants; Sewage treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Chemical and biologicals; Emissions reduction; Global warming and climate changes; Greenhouse gases emissions; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Reducing emissions; Treated wastewater; Wastewater treatment plants; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104847358

In this study, the selective mechanisms for detecting AA, DA, and UA molecules on the graphene and graphene oxide substrates were illustrated through the charge population analysis from the density functional theory (DFT) calculation results. Our substrate models contained the 1:10 oxygen per carbon ratio of reduced graphene oxide, and the functionalized configurations were selected according to the formation en-ergy. Geometry optimizations were performed for the AA, DA, and UA on the pristine graphene, epoxy‐functionalized graphene, and hydroxyl‐functionalized graphene at the DFT level with vdW‐ DF2 corrections. From the calculations, AA was bound to both epoxy and hydroxyl‐functionalized GO with relatively low adsorption energy, while DA was adsorbed stronger to the electronegative epoxy groups. The strongest adsorption of UA to both functional groups corresponded to the largest amount of electron transfer through the pi orbitals. Local electron loss created local electric fields that opposed the electron transfer during an oxidation reaction. Our analysis agreed with the results from previous experimental studies and provided insight into other electrode modifications for electrochemical sensing. © 2021 by the authors.

Assessing the future distribution of biodiversity under different climate change scenarios is an essential step towards conservation planning and policy implementations. To understand the climate change impacts, the present study used Garcinia gummi-gutta cash crop species as a case study that is even exported, adding the nation’s foreign reserve. Given the importance of this crop for local and national economy, the main objectives of the study were to analyse the impact of present and future climates on ecologically susceptible G. gummi-gutta species in the Western Ghats based on maximum entropy model (MaxEnt). Future projections with RCP scenarios for 2050 and 2070 were made using the data of 84 species occurrence and climatic variables of three climate models from IPCC 5th assessment. The contribution of climatic variables was analysed by jackknife test, and 0.888 of AOC indicates high accuracy of the model results. It was found that annual precipitation, coldest quarter precipitation, and precipitation seasonality were the key determining factors for the suitability of this species. In addition, the results of all scenarios showed that the current suitability of the species would be dramatically decreased by 2050 and 2070. The study suggests how the MaxEnt approach can be an important tool for agricultural development, management of species habitats, conservation of biodiversity, and climate change rehabitation planning. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Agricultural sustainability; Climate change; Conservation planning; Garcinia gummi-gutta; Maximum entropy modelling","accuracy assessment; agricultural development; biodiversity; cash cropping; climate change; climate modeling; conservation planning; software; India; Western Ghats; Garcinia gummi-gutta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087090331

Plant biodiversity can also influence C exchange, yet few studies integrate how biotic and abiotic factors may directly or interactively impact ecosystem C flux. Here, we examine the link between simultaneous changes in multiple dimensions of plant diversity and peak growing season ecosystem C uptake across a climatic gradient in the Rocky Mountains, Colorado, USA. We found that taxonomic diversity (species richness), functional diversity (functional evenness), and phylogenetic diversity (mean pairwise distance) were significantly and positively related to peak growing season ecosystem C uptake (i.e., net ecosystem exchange) when considered independently. However, when abiotic and biotic factors were integrated in a structural equation model, only plant phylogenetic diversity was significantly related to C uptake. In addition, we found that actual evapotranspiration (AET—a measure that integrates precipitation and temperature) affected ecosystem C exchange indirectly via its impact on the three dimensions of plant diversity that we examined. These findings highlight complex relationships among key measures of biodiversity and ecosystem C uptake in a rapidly warming ecosystem, and the possible mechanisms that underlie relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

Besides abiotic factors, such as climate and soil properties, plant-plant interactions within communities are likely to affect the performance of potential invaders in their exotic range. The biotic resistance hypothesis predicts that high indigenous species richness hampers plant invasions. The biotic acceptance hypothesis, on the other hand, predicts a positive relationship between indigenous and exotic species richness. We tested these two hypotheses using observational data along an elevational gradient in a southern African biodiversity hotspot. Species composition data of indigenous and exotic plants were recorded in 20 road verge plots along a gradient of 1775–2775 m a.s.l. in the Drakensberg, South Africa. Plots were 2 × 50 m in size and positioned at 50 m elevational intervals. We found a negative correlation between indigenous and exotic richness for locations with poorly developed mineral soils, suggesting biotic resistance through competitive interactions. A strong positive correlation for plots with very shallow soils at high elevations indicated a lack of biotic resistance and the possibility of facilitating interactions in harsher environments. These results suggest that biotic resistance is restricted to the lower and mid elevations while biotic acceptance prevails in presence of severe abiotic stress, potentially increasing the risk of plant invasions into montane biodiversity hotspots. © 2021, The Author(s).","Alien invaders; Altitudinal gradient; Mountainous ecosystems; Native species; Sani pass","abiotic factor; biodiversity; biological invasion; community structure; correlation; environmental stress; invasive species; mountain region; native species; species richness; Drakensberg",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101244689

One of the biggest sources of climate change is anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. In Canada, buildings are the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases, contributing to 12% of the country's equivalent Carbon dioxide emissions. These emissions have various negative impacts on the planet, which impede the transition towards a cleaner environment and more sustainable communities. Attention has now shifted towards Carbon dioxide reduction in addition to the currently practiced energy efficiency improvements and source switching, which is also important in achieving Canada's 2030 climate action goals. The current study attempts to address the above gap by investigating the feasibility of installing carbon capturing unit at building level, based on the perceptions of building managers in both multi-unit residential buildings and non-residential buildings. A Modified Digital Logic approach was used to identify the key factors that determine the acceptability of the unit, based on experts’ input. Six primary criteria were identified to design a questionnaire and structured interviews to evaluate the acceptability of building level carbon capturing unit to stakeholders. The findings indicated that around 50% of non-residential building managers were interested in installing the carbon capturing unit, whereas none of the multi-unit building managers were in favor of the unit installation. The lack of interest is attributed to different factors such as unit scalability, inability to accurately estimate the short and long-term economic benefits, and other alternate plans to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Specifically, when establishing relationship between cost and unit scalability, 82% of residential unit managers and 50% of non-residential managers opined that the unit should be capable of being upgraded to accommodate a larger area and capture more emissions in order to justify the proposed cost of the unit. The findings provide important insights for policy makers in understanding the acceptability of carbon capturing unit at building level and to further develop and promote this emerging technology in the market. © 2021","Building level emissions reduction; Carbon capturing; Climate change mitigation; Modified digital logic; Multi-unit residential building; Non-residential building","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Managers; Population statistics; Scalability; Surveys; Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon dioxide reduction; Emerging technologies; Energy efficiency improvements; Global climate changes; Industrial activities; Sustainable communities; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100898210

Diamond-like carbon films have been obtained by vapor-gas phase carbon concentration on glass substrates, using defocused NTS 300 laser beam for graphite targets evaporation in vacuum. Defocused laser beam provided an area of 3 mm in diameter on the target for carbon direct evaporation. It has been established that diffraction of electrons identifies diamond reflections (111) and (220), and this corresponds to interplane spacing d111 = 0.207 nm, d220 = 0.119 nm of the diamond lattice. The obtained values of interplanar distances are close to the values of interplanar distances of carbon macroscopic crystals with d111 = 0.205 nm and d220 = 0.125 nm. The research of the film atomic structure shows that sp3-bonding generally participate in assembling carbon atoms into diamond clusters having the size less than 1 nm. The ratio of graphite clusters formed by sp2-bonds within the structure of diamond-like carbon films is negligible. In spite of the pronounced cluster pattern of the structure, the film is not an analogue of the polycrystalline one with graded junction from one crystalline domain to another observed. As distinguished from polycrystals, there is no structure stepwise changing on the mating clusters boundaries. It is shown that clusters are linked with each other into homogeneous cluster structure by sp3- and sp2-bonds. These bonds are well-identified in the diamond-like carbon film structure, as the length of sp2-bonds exceeds considerably the length of sp3- bonds. Carbon film properties are determined by diamond clusters due to domination of clusters with tetragonal diamond lattice, for instance, the film is a good dielectric. © 2021","Cluster structure; Diamond clusters; Diamond-like carbon film; Graphite clusters; sp3- and sp2- bonds","Atom lasers; Atoms; Carbon films; Crystal atomic structure; Crystal lattices; Diamonds; Graphite; Laser beams; Substrates; Vacuum evaporation; Carbon concentrations; Crystalline domains; Defocused laser beam; Direct-evaporation; Glass substrates; High-resolution transmission microscopies; Homogeneous cluster; Interplanar distance; Diamond like carbon films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101619420

Improving resource efficiency—that is, reducing the resources required to generate a unit of economic output—is a prominent goal pursued across levels of scale. How does resource efficiency relate to decarbonization? Do economies decrease their emissions as they become more efficient? We examine this relationship for Austria from 2000 to 2015 by conducting an index decomposition analysis at the sectoral level by using consumption-based indicators from the multi-regional input–output model Exiobase. Our analysis shows that for Austria, the currently popular pursuit of material efficiency appears to run the risk of coinciding with higher emissions, suggesting that the opportunities to achieve both decarbonization and dematerialization are limited. The Austrian service sectors could contribute to a reduction of the CO2 footprint via material efficiency improvements, but strong economic growth foils this possibility coming to fruition. The Austrian economy would do well to either curb demand for goods and services driving global CO2 emissions or to produce imported goods and services domestically in an environmentally more benign manner. © 2020 The Authors.

This review aims at analysing the current knowledge on road traffic NEE regarding sources, particle generation processes, chemical and physical characterization, and mitigation strategies. The literature on this matter often presents highly variable and hardly comparable results due to the heterogeneity of NEE sources and the absence of standardized sampling and measurement protocols. As evidence, emission factors (EFs) were found to range from 1 mg km−1 veh−1 to 18.5 mg km−1 veh−1 for brake wear, and from 0.3 mg km−1 veh−1 to 7.4 mg km−1 veh−1 for tyre wear. Resuspended dust, which varies in even wider ranges (from 5.4 mg km−1 veh−1 to 330 mg km−1 veh−1 for cars), is considered the prevailing NEE source. The lack of standardized monitoring approaches resulted in the impossibility of setting international regulations to limit NEE. Therefore, up until now the abatement of NEE has only been achieved by mitigation and prevention strategies. However, the effectiveness of these measures still needs to be improved and further investigated. As an example, mitigation strategies, such as street washing or sweeping, proved effective in reducing PM levels, but only in the short term. The replacement of internal combustion engines vehicles with electric ones was instead proposed as a prevention strategy, but there are still concerns regarding the increase of NEE deriving from the extra weight of the batteries. The data reported in this review highlighted the need for future studies to broaden their research area, and to focus not only on the standardization of methods and the introduction of regulations, but also on improving already existing technologies and mitigating strategies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Electric vehicles; NEE; Particulate matter; Urban environment","Brakes; Dust; Wear of materials; International regulations; Measurement protocol; Mitigation measures; Mitigation strategy; Monitoring approach; Particle-generation process; Physical characterization; Prevention strategies; Roads and streets; atmospheric pollution; combustion; electric vehicle; particulate matter; pollution control; road traffic; sampling; source parameters; traffic emission; air pollution; combustion; particulate matter; railway; review; standardization; traffic; urban area",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098944053

Knowledge about the technical challenges of these technologies is rapidly advancing, but the challenges related to their public acceptance are still underinvestigated. Here we try to close this research gap by investigating public perceptions of CCS and public attitudes towards policies to scale up these technologies in the United States, where most existing industrial-scale CCS projects are operating. Based on a demographically representative sample of US residents, we find that awareness of CCS is very low. Using a conjoint experiment, we show that policies that outlaw the construction of new coal- and gas-fired power plants without CCS find higher public support than CCS subsidies and increases in taxes on unabated fossil fuel power generation. Public support decreases with rising costs of CCS deployment and decreasing minimal distance requirements of CCS plants from residential areas. Our results provide insights into the political feasibility of a large-scale deployment of CCS and show that specific policy design choices play an important role in influencing public support for policies to scale up these technologies. © 2021 The Author(s)","Carbon capture and storage; Climate change policy; Conjoint experiment; Decarbonization; Energy policy; Public support","Carbon capture; Coal; Decarbonization; Energy policy; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas plants; Industrial research; Capture and storage technologies; Climate change mitigation; Climate change policies; Conjoint experiments; Decarbonisation; Energy; Public acceptance; Public support; Scale-up; Technical challenges; Climate change; carbon sequestration; climate change; energy policy; environmental policy; gas storage; perception; power plant; preference behavior; public attitude; technological change; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102897454

The municipality in which flood risk mitigation is addressed as a social issue exhibits a larger size of the network mitigating flood risk, more diverse actors involved, and a more central location of the politicians and senior management. Moreover, the analysis points to the salience of a bureaucratic policy entrepreneur in promoting this shift toward addressing it as a social issue, and shows how they use relational strategies to frame the issue as relating to climate change action. The article operationalizes sociability and credibility, two of the attributes of policy entrepreneurs, and thus, contributes to the theoretical and methodological discussion of policy entrepreneurs in general, and as they pertain to environmental policy in particular.

However, from an environmental perspective, this sector contributes negatively by releasing tons of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in the atmosphere, which consequently gives rise to other environmental hazards such as global warming and ozone depletion. The use of off-site modular construction practices in developed countries is increasing due to its environmental benefits over conventional cast-in-situ method. However, the environmental performance of a construction method may vary across various geographical regions, which is why environmental assessment of construction methods specific to a region is required. This study provides a calculation of GHG emissions in modular and conventional construction methods utilized in Pakistan, considering two single-family single-storey buildings with similar characteristics. The study also provides recommendations to homebuilders for the improvements in low-performance areas in both modular and conventional building methods. The results of the study show that modular building accounts for a total of 3449.73 kgCO2-equivalent GHG emissions whereas conventional building resulted in a total of 6501.91 kgCO2-equivalent GHG emissions. Modular building results in a reduction of 3052.19 kgCO2-equivalent GHG emissions (46.9%) as compared to a conventional site-built building. This implies that the modular construction method is a more environmentally viable option than conventional construction, which needs to be adopted on a large scale to reduce GHG emissions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Conventional construction; Developing country; Embodied GHG emissions; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; Modular construction; Sustainability","Buildings; Construction industry; Developing countries; Economics; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Gas hazards; Global warming; Modular construction; Ozone layer; Building construction; Conventional constructions; Environmental assessment; Environmental benefits; Environmental hazards; Environmental performance; Quantitative assessments; Single-storey buildings; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101486608

One of the main contributions to GHG emissions comes from the household sector. This paper shows that the household sector, when organised into a form of prosumer microgrids, including renewable sources for electric, heating and cooling energy supply, can be efficiently decarbonised. This paper investigates one hypothetical prosumer microgrid with the model RES2GEO (Renewable Energy Sources to Geothermal). The aim is to integrate a carbon-free photovoltaic electricity source and a shallow geothermal reservoir as a heat source and heat sink during the heating and cooling season. A total of four cases have been evaluated for the Zagreb City location. The results represent a balance of both thermal and electric energy flows within the microgrid, as well as thermal recuperation of the reservoir. The levelised cost of energy for all cases, based on a 20-year modelling horizon, varies between 41 and 63 EUR/MWh. On the other hand, all cases show a decrease in CO2 emissions by more than 75%, with the best case featuring a reduction of more than 85% compared to the base case, where electricity and gas for heating are supplied from the Distribution System Operator at retail prices. With the use of close integration of electricity, heating and cooling demand and supply of energy, cost-effective decarbonisation can be achieved for the household sector. © 2021 by the authors.

Research shows that chemical fertilizers are the main cause of agricultural carbon emissions in Fujian. The agricultural carbon footprints and carbon emission intensity in the research area have not yet met the ""inverted U-shape""assumed by EKC.

Hub-spoke networks are used to serve a large number of destinations with a high frequency. The concentration of flights and demand leads to positive economic effects: additional indirect effects come from the high number of destinations. Airlines may prefer indirect passengers over direct passengers, at the expense of local welfare, if the willingness-to-pay of the former is higher. Furthermore, indirect effects are a redistribution of the direct effect, and may lead to double counting. Empirical evidence on environmental performance is mixed. Some case studies suggest hub-spoke networks are more harmful, given aircraft technologies and load factors. Proposed climate policies increase costs of operations, likely leading to a strengthening of the hub-spoke system. Further research into network development and the effect of climate policy on airline behaviour is necessary to support climate and aviation policy. © 2020 The Author","Airports; Aviation; Economic effects; Externalities; Hub-spoke","air transportation; airport; empirical analysis; future prospect; hub and spoke network; literature review; transportation development; transportation policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090488846

The Seeland region of Switzerland is characterised by fens that have been intensively used for agriculture for 150 years. Our site is a degraded fen with a remaining peat layer of 60 cm that had been used as cropland until 2009. In connection to a nature protection project it has been managed as extensive permanent grassland since then. The net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was determined for two years (2015-2016). For this purpose, the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) and CH4 fluxes were measured by eddy covariance, and the carbon removed by harvest was quantified. Our degraded fen site was found to be a net carbon source of 477±73g C m−2 yr -1 and 434±51 g C m-2 yr−1 in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Annual CH4 emissions were marginal in both years with 0.4±0.8 g CH4-C m−2 yr -1 (2015) and 0.7±0.7 g CH4-C m−2 yr -1 (2016). In contrast to NECB, the NEE was considerably higher in 2015 than in 2016 (308±71 g C m−2 yr -1 vs 117±39 g C m−2 yr -1). The year 2015 was characterised by partial flooding of the grassland, followed by a dry and hot summer leading to lower CO2 uptake due to reduced growth, which was reflected in lower harvest compared to 2016. Thus, the short-term plant-induced carbon fluxes were altered, whereas total soil carbon loss remained rather constant. This was verified by an intra site comparison between the flooded and non-flooded part in 2015. Our results indicate that the soil carbon loss of this highly degraded peatland with a shallow peat layer is relatively moderate and hardly influenced by interannual weather variations. © 2021",,"agricultural soil; annual variation; carbon balance; carbon sink; fen; flooding; grassland; methane; net ecosystem exchange; peatland; Denmark; Sjaelland; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099684259

Recent studies have increasingly tested these assumptions and provide empirical evidence for the contributions of tree planting programs, as well as their feasibility and limits, for solving or mitigating urban environmental and social issues. We propose that current evidence supports local cooling, stormwater absorption, and health benefits of urban trees for local residents. However, the potential for urban trees to appreciably mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution over a wide array of sites and environmental conditions is limited. Consequently, urban trees appear to be more promising for climate and pollution adaptation strategies than mitigation strategies. In large part, this is due to space constraints limiting the extent of urban tree canopies relative to the current magnitude of emissions. The most promising environmental and health impacts of urban trees are those that can be realized with well-stewarded tree planting and localized design interventions at site to municipal scales. Tree planting at these scales has documented benefits on local climate and health, which can be maximized through targeted site design followed by monitoring, adaptive management, and studies of long-term eco-evolutionary dynamics. © Copyright © 2021 Pataki, Alberti, Cadenasso, Felson, McDonnell, Pincetl, Pouyat, Setälä and Whitlow.","climate adaptation; climate mitigation; ecosystem disservices; ecosystem services; forestry; policy; sustainability; urban ecology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104618762

Given that the levels of PFCs have been regulated in many regions, a granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption process has been used in drinking water treatment plants to maintain concentrations of PFCs, perfluorohexyl sulfonate (PFHxS), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), below 70 ng/L. However, it was found that these concentrations in the final product water in local water utilities unexpectedly increased because of inappropriate operation and maintenance methods of GAC, such as its inefficient regeneration and replacement cycle. In this study, the changes in PFC concentration were monitored and analyzed in raw and final water of two large-scale water treatment plants for eight months. Additionally, the correlation of the GAC replacement cycle with the removal efficiency of PFHxS and PFOA was investigated in a total of 30 GAC basins of two drinking water treatment plants. A lab-scale experiment with a coconut-shell-based GAC column showed the possibly different mechanism of removal between PFHxS and PFOA, indicating that the sulfonate-based PFCs may be a limiting factor in GAC replacement cycle for PFCs removal. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, a binderless coke was produced by changing the flow rates of nitrogen and air as a carrier gas during heat treatment of coal tar pitch and using this, a green body was formed at 150 MPa and carbonized to produce a high-density carbon block. We express the binderless coke produced in this way by N10A0, N7A3, N5A5, N3A7, N0A10 according to the ratio of nitrogen and air, and in the case of carbon block, we have added CB in front of it. We then considered the effect of oxygen content in the binderless cokes on the optical, chemical, and mechanical properties. It was observed that the produced binderless cokes develop into a dense mosaic structure with a small particle size as the air flow rate increased. To survey the change in oxygen content of the produced binderless coke, O1s and C1s regions were measured using X-ray photoelectric spectroscopy (XPS), and O1s/C1s was calculated. The O1s/C1s ratio steadily increased as the air flow rate increased, and in the case of N0A10, it increased about twice as much as that of N10A0 to 11.20%. β-resin has a very large effect on the mechanical strength of the carbon block in addition to air in the pitch. And in the case of CB-N0A10, it shows the best mechanical strength with a density of 1.72 g/cm3, bending strength of 87 MPa, and shore hardness of 93 HSD. © 2021 by the authors.

A total of 53 commonly used equipment for agriculture, base construction, paving construction, and material handling were selected. Time-based and fuel-based emissions were quantified by different duty and engine modes. Three duty modes (idling, moving, and working) were used. Ten engine modes were defined based on normalized engine revolutions-perminute and manifold absolute pressure, respectively. Composite emission factors taking into account both duty modes and its corresponding time percentage during a typical duty cycle were estimated. Results showed that there existed a large off-road equipment variability in emissions. Depending on duty and engine modes, time-based NO emissions ranged from 3.1 to 237.9,29.1–1475.6, 83.2–681.6, and 3.2–385.2 g/h for agriculture, base construction, paving construction and material handling equipment, respectively while for fuel-based NO emissions these ranges were 5.3–52.0, 11.7–69.0, 4.8–30.8, and 11.0–54.6 g/kg, respectively. Furthermore, emission factors derived from this study exhibited a much larger variability compared to those used in NONROAD by US EPA and National Guideline for Off-road Equipment of China. This implied that localized measurements of emissions are needed for improvement of accuracy of emission inventory. Furthermore, both equipment types and operations should be considered for development of emission inventory and control strategy.

People who live in the forest area and depend on the forestry sector need to get protection, especially in terms of variations in livelihood sources to not depend on the forest sector and exploitation of forest resources. One prospective livelihood option is through carbon pricing. This study aimed to analyze the role of government in terms of creating livelihoods for vulnerable communities in the face of climate change, especially through carbon pricing mechanisms. The study used a qualitative approach with the literature review and desk study. Based on research results, it is known that the government had tried to establish international cooperation for carbon pricing. At present, the partnership had been established with 2 institutions in the European Union with a carbon trade value of 5 USD/ton CO2eq. Through this mechanism, people who live around forest areas have new livelihood options that can withstand land conversion and exploitation of timber resources. Thus, the rate of climate change can be reduced, and mitigation efforts can be strengthened through the carbon trading mechanism. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon; Costs; Emission control; Forestry; International cooperation; International trade; Timber; Climate change impact; Forest resources; Land conversion; Literature reviews; Qualitative approach; Research results; Timber resources; Vulnerable communities; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104885928

For the energy conservation purpose, it is considered as an ideal power supply with prolonged work time and substantial power output. The two-phase flow and vibration effects are the two important factors to be considered in practical fuel cell applications because the gas/liquid two-phase flow is a non-negligible threat in acidic fuel cells. In this study, a two-phase flow computational model is developed to investigate the vibration effects on cell characteristics based on a multi-physics coupling process. The model accuracy is validated with the previous experiment. Major results demonstrate that: (1) Vibration intensity and frequency have negative impacts on cell performance owing to the severe fuel crossover and delayed gas phase discharge; (2) Increasing the feed liquid flow rate is a resultful approach to resist the vibration effects, alleviate fuel crossover, and improve the current and power outputs. However, these are achieved at the expense of fuel utilisation and exergy efficiency; (3) Increased contact angle also plays the positive part in decreasing gas phase fraction; (4) The cell performance depends strongly on vibration intensity, and improving the anti-seismic performance of MFC mainly increases the ability of the cell to resist vibration intensity. In conclusion, the fuel cell is a clean effective power supply device for the emission reduction and sustainable development, and the work lays the foundation for improving the shock-absorbing design and microfluidic fuel cell performance. This technology is generally applied to the portable electronic equipment, the analysis reveals the flow state of cell, and this research method is used for reference to performance analysis of other types of fuel cells. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Exergy efficiency; Flow-through anode; Microfluidic fuel cell; Performance assessment; Two-phase flow; Vibration effects","Contact angle; Electronic equipment; Emission control; Exergy; Gases; Lithium-ion batteries; Microbial fuel cells; Microfluidics; Antiseismic performance; Energy transformation; Gas/liquid two phase flow; Microfluidic fuel cell; Multi-physics couplings; Performance analysis; Portable electronic devices; Two phase flow model; Two phase flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097051395

Cannabis is most often smoked indoors, but few measurements have been made of fine particle mass concentrations produced by secondhand cannabis smoke in indoor settings. We conducted 60 controlled experiments in a 43 m3 room of a residence, measuring PM2.5 concentrations, emission rates, and decay rates using real-time monitors designed to measure PM2.5 mass concentrations. We also measured the room's air exchange rate. During each experiment, an experienced smoker followed an identical puffing protocol on one of four different methods of consuming marijuana: the pre-rolled marijuana joint (24 experiments), the bong with its bowl containing marijuana buds (9 experiments), the glass pipe containing marijuana buds (9 experiments), and the commercially available electronic vaping pen with a cartridge attached containing cannabis vape liquid (9 experiments). For comparison, we used the same puffing protocol to measure the PM2.5 emissions from Marlboro cigarettes (9 experiments). The results indicated that cannabis joints produced the highest indoor PM2.5 concentrations and had the largest emission rates, compared with the other cannabis sources. The average PM2.5 emission rate of the 24 cannabis joints (7.8 mg/min) was 3.5 times the average emission rate of the Marlboro cigarettes (2.2 mg/min). The average emission rate of the cannabis bong was 67% that of the joint; the glass pipe's emission rate was 54% that of the joint, and the vaping pen's emission rate was 44% that of the joint.

A Movement Control Order (MCO) was implemented in Malaysia starting from the March 18, 2020 as a pandemic control strategy which restricted all movement and daily outdoor activities. To investigate the impact of MCO, air pollutants: particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm (PM10), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and carbon monoxide (CO) in nine major cities in Malaysia were measured before and during the implementation of the MCO. The non-carcinogenic health risk assessments of the air pollutants are also determined using the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Health Risk Assessment method. Overall, NO2 recorded an average percentage reduction of 40% with the highest reduction observed at Kota Kinabalu (62%). The largest reductions of PM10, PM2.5, SO2, O3 and CO were recorded at Kota Kinabalu (17%), Kuantan (9.5%), Alor Star (38%), Kota Bharu (15%), and Ipoh (27%) respectively. All cities had hazard quotient (HQ) values of &lt;1 suggesting no non-carcinogenic health effects. The highest HQ was observed for PM2.5 during the MCO period (4.53E-02) in Kuala Lumpur. An average hazard index (HI) value of 1.44E-01 (before the MCO) and 1.40E-01 (during the MCO) showed higher human health risks before the MCO than during the MCO.

Initially, the plant was designed and constructed for achieving BOD and TSS to <30 mg/L and <50 mg/L, respectively. Recently, due to the advent of stringent effluent standards for BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand), TSS (Total Suspended Solids), and TN (Total Nitrogen) to <10 mg/L, with a strong emphasis on non-potable re-use of treated effluent, the existing system needed intensive upgradation. The upgraded STP was modified from two hours to five hours of hydraulic retention time (HRT). The upgraded plant was examined by removing organic carbon and nitrogen from municipal wastewater through both partial nitrification-denitrification (PND) by aerobic and anoxic reactors and simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) process by PVA (Poly Vinyl Alcohol) gel aerobic reactor. After ten months of operation and monitoring, the plant has reached its upgraded effluent discharge standard. It was found that average BOD, COD, TSS, TN, and TP (Total Phosphorus) concentrations were 8 mg/L, 25 mg/L, 12 mg/L, 9 mg/L and 5 mg/L respectively, with 91 %, 90 %, 93 %, 84 %, and 64 %, removal efficiency.

This allows cylinders to dynamically alternate among 3 potential states designated as: High Fire, Low Fire, and Skip (deactivation). The Low Fire state is achieved through an aggressive Miller cycle with Early Intake Valve Closing (EIVC). The three operating states in mDSF can be used to simultaneously optimize engine efficiency and driveline vibrations. Acceleration performance is retained using the all-cylinder, High Fire mode. mDSF can be implemented cost-effectively using an asymmetric intake valve lift strategy, with one high-flow power charging port and one high-efficiency Miller port. Prototype mDSF cylinder heads were based on the EA888 Gen 3B engine by retrofitting the valvetrain with asymmetric intake cams, deactivatable roller finger followers and two oil control valves per cylinder. Event-based engine controls were developed to enable for each cylinder dynamic selection of the three mDSF operating modes: High Fire, Low Fire and Skip. Appropriate air estimation, fuel control and ignition control techniques were employed to ensure acceptable torque delivery and tailpipe emissions. Engine dynamometer tests showed a 23% reduction in engine fuel consumption at 1500 rpm, 2 bar NMEP. Maximum torque and power from the baseline production engine up to 5000 rpm were also achieved. mDSF vehicle tests on the WLTC demonstrated a 6% reduction in CO2 from Miller 2-step. Euro 6d compliant emissions were also reported. Further improvements in fuel economy, drivability and NVH may be possible by leveraging mixed firing densities more extensively. © 2021 SAE International.

Derived information from projections is critical to understanding likely impacts in water management. In 2019, the UK published an ensemble of high-resolution model simulations. The UKCP Local (2.2 km) projections can resolve smaller scale physical processes that determine rainfall and other variables at subdaily time-scales with the potential to provide new insights into extreme events, storm runoff and drainage management. However, simulations also need to inform adaptation. The challenge ahead is to identify and provide derived products without the need for further analysis by decision-makers. These include a wider evaluation of uncertainty, narratives about rainfall change across the projections and bias-corrected datasets. Future flood maps, peak rainfall estimates, uplift factors and future design storm profiles also need detailed guidance to support their use. Central government support is justified in the provision of up-to-date impacts information to inform flood risk management, given the large risks and exposure of all sectors. The further development of projections would benefit from greater focus and earlier scoping with industry representatives, operational tool developers and end users.

People can commute easily from one place to another. The operations of the LRT System are entirely dependent on the electric power supply, from the movement of trains between stations to the facilities inside the train itself. High consumption of electric grid has contributed to the increase in environmental pollution. In the long-term, the effect can be seen in the decrease in sea level as well as drop-in water supply. Due to that, renewable energy demand is continuously increasing, and current prediction shows that this trend is going to further continues yearly. Usage of electricity from renewable sources such as the solar panel has been proposed in this project paper in order to reduce the negative effect been encountered. The solar PV is a mechanism that can transform the sunlight into direct current electricity by using semiconductors. Hence, with the use of the solar panel, it will reduce energy pollution and climate change impact due to high consumption of electric grid. This research is meant to explore the possibility of using solar panels as an alternative for generating electricity for the Light Rail Transit (LRT) as renewable energy instead of using the power grid.

In a quantitative scenario, these pathways are scaled up to district level, asking ‘How many actors must do how much, to reach the target?’ An interwoven qualitative approach highlights organizational aspects. The upscaled backcasting scenario is normative, in part prognostic and explorative. Feasibility is ensured through integrating the issues of ‘What to Change’ and’ Change by Whom’. Results indicate that the local target is feasible if most actors maximize the use of their individual transition pathways. Additionally, Stockholm City and other external actors must realize their targets, including technological development.

This approach to soil analysis will be especially useful when conducting an environmental risk management for petroleum contamination in soil. This study evaluated the potential of VNIR diffuse reflectance spectra for rapid non-destructive quantitative analysis of extractible total petroleum hydrocarbon (ETPH) in soils. It also assessed the effect soil organic carbon (SOC) has on the performance of partial least square regression (PLSR) models developed for characterizing ETPH in soils. Model performance was evaluated based on the coefficient of determination (R2), ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) and the root means square error (RMSE). Result show that VNIR DRS can be a potentially viable analytical tool for petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in soils. However, model quality was found to be affected by spatial variations within soil samples. Models developed from contaminated soils from highly variable geological origins had fair but promising model statistics (R2 = 0.72, RPD = 1.4) as against excellent predictions obtained from contaminated soils with similar geology (R2 = 0.97, RPD = 4.5) implying that the VNIR DR approach to characterizing petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in soils will be better suited to development of local prediction models. PLSR models developed for soil groups with SOC range (0.94–26.5% OC) gave quite robust prediction (R2 = 0.90–0.97, RPD = 2.7–4.5), though a high SOC content slightly lowered PLSR model statistics. These results suggest that VNIR DRS can be quite useful for rapid characterization of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination especially when low budgets and reduced timelines are desirable for remediation purposes. © 2021","Chemometrics; Petroleum hydrocarbon estimation; Soil organic carbon; VNIR spectroscopy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104320245

Using household survey data for the period 2009–2015, I estimate the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) model to obtain elasticities and use them to simulate consumer responses to price changes resulting from carbon taxation. Results show that an increase in electricity and public transport prices following a carbon tax policy is regressive while a price increase in motor fuel is progressive. In addition, when there is a simultaneous increase in the prices of energy goods, the poorest and middle income households disproportionately suffer a higher welfare loss compared to the richest households. I also show that income is important in determining whether rural households experience a higher or lower welfare loss than urban households. Furthermore, revenue recycling in terms of lump-sum transfers of the tax revenue to households below the national poverty lines and the bottom 40% would offset the welfare loss from a carbon tax policy in South Africa. © 2021","Carbon tax policy; Household; South Africa; Welfare","Automotive fuels; Carbon; Cost accounting; Costs; Emission control; Surveys; Carbon taxation; Consumer Response; Household surveys; Public transport; Rural households; Urban-household; Welfare effects; Welfare impacts; Taxation; electricity supply; environmental economics; household survey; pollution tax; poverty; rural economy; tax system; welfare economics; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097347770

This study presents sedimentological and ichnological data from the upper Miocene to lower Pliocene Bouse Formation, which accumulated during regional transgression at the margin of a tidal strait near the north end of the ancestral Gulf of California. The basal carbonate member of the Bouse Formation records deposition in a tide-influenced, compositionally mixed carbonate–siliciclastic system dominated by salt marsh, tidal flat and channel environments. The basal carbonate member is an overall deepening up succession of facies associations comprising: Facies Association 1 – siliciclastic-rich heterolithic facies, lime mudstone with desiccation cracks, and plant debris rich carbonate silt interpreted as siliciclastic-rich tidal flats; Facies Association 2 – well-sorted gravels, siliciclastic-rich sandy strata, lime mudstone with desiccation cracks, and sandy microbial micrite interpreted as tidal-channel deposits; Facies Association 3 – carbonate-rich heterolithic lime mudstone to well-sorted, cross-bedded bioclastic grainstone interpreted as intertidal to shallow subtidal deposits; and Facies Association 4 – lime mudstone interpreted as shallow to deep subtidal low-energy deposits that record the end of tidal conditions in the basin. Trace fossils include marine forms Gyrolithes, Teichichnus and Thalassinoides, and non-diagnostic forms Arenicolites, Cochlichnus, Conichnus, Lockeia, Planolites, Skolithos and Treptichnus (known from marine, brackish and freshwater environments). The diminutive size of trace fossils reflects brackish conditions created by mixing of freshwater and seawater. This study provides evidence for a late Miocene to early Pliocene humid climate in south-western North America, in stark contrast to the modern hyperarid climate. Factors that controlled the relative percentage of mixed carbonate and siliciclastic sediment include siliciclastic input from local rivers, in situ carbonate production, current energy, degree of tidal mixing and relative sea level. Pronounced facies variability at bedform, outcrop and basin scale documented in this study appears to be an important characteristic of mixed carbonate–siliciclastic deposits in tidal depositional systems. © 2020 The Authors.

The analysis is complex and requires innovative analytical approaches. To address this complexity, we used an original approach that combines a multivariate regression tree (MRT), data analysis, and spatial mapping. We applied this approach to the main cropping region in France (mainly the Paris basin of production) using an existing dataset (i.e. soil, climate, crop sequences and management) from the French National Ecosystem Assessment to determine relationships between agricultural production, two services to farmers – nitrogen provision to crops and water provision to crops – and three services to society – blue water provision, water quality regulation, and climate regulation. To support land managers and decision-makers, we also analyzed the extent to which manageable soil properties and agricultural practices (crop rotation and management) are major drivers of trade-offs or synergies. We demonstrated that water quality regulation, nitrogen provision to crops, and climate regulation have synergistic relationships in production situations in the northeastern region of the study area due to the types of crop rotation, frequency of cover crops in the crop rotation, the soil pH, and the soil available water capacity. We also identified that cover crops, while promoting these three ES, can drive a trade-off between two key water-related services: water provision to crops and blue water provision (i.e. between a service to farmers and one to society). By capturing non-linear relationships and threshold effects, our MRT-based approach overcomes the main limitations of classic statistical approaches. The approach is also spatially explicit and simple and intuitive to interpret, especially for non-scientists; our results thus provide researchers and ecosystem managers (e.g. agricultural policy makers) with key information to design ecosystem management strategies that promote a balanced bundle of ES. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cropping systems; Ecosystem services; Multivariate regression tree; Regional scale; Relationships; Temperate climate","Agricultural robots; Crops; Decision making; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Forestry; Managers; Nitrogen; Regression analysis; Soils; Trees (mathematics); Water quality; Agricultural policies; Agricultural practices; Agricultural productions; Ecosystem management; Multivariate regression trees; Non-linear relationships; Soil available waters; Statistical approach; Ecosystems; agricultural production; cover crop; cropping practice; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; regression analysis; temperate environment; trade-off; agroecosystem; Article; biophysics; climate; crop management; crop rotation; cropland; cropping system; ecosystem health; ecosystem resilience; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; environmental protection; environmental temperature; fertilization; France; priority journal; soil acidity; water availability; water management; water quality; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092915936

Finding novel approaches to coordinate the movements of a fleet of aircraft at an airport in order to improve system resilience to disruptions with increasing autonomy is at the center of many key studies for airport airside operations. Moreover, autonomous taxiing is envisioned as a key component in future digitalized airports. However, state-of-the-art routing and scheduling algorithms for airport ground movements do not consider high-fidelity aircraft models at both the proactive and reactive planning phases. The majority of such algorithms do not actively seek to optimize fuel efficiency and reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions. This paper proposes a new approach for generating efficient four-dimensional trajectories (4DTs) on the basis of a high-fidelity aircraft model and gain-scheduling control strategy. Working in conjunction with a routing and scheduling algorithm that determines the taxi route, waypoints, and time deadlines, the proposed approach generates fuel-efficient 4DTs in real time, while respecting operational constraints. The proposed approach can be used in two contexts: ① as a reactive decision support tool to generate new trajectories that can resolve unprecedented events; and ② as an autopilot system for both partial and fully autonomous taxiing. The proposed methodology is realistic and simple to implement. Moreover, simulation studies show that the proposed approach is capable of providing an up to 11% reduction in the fuel consumed during the taxiing of a large Boeing 747-100 jumbo jet. © 2021","Aircraft model; Four-dimensional trajectory; Intelligent taxiing; Optimization","Aircraft models; Airports; Decision support systems; Efficiency; Fleet operations; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Ground operations; Scheduling; Taxicabs; Trajectories; Decision support tools; Four-dimensional trajectory; Gain scheduling control; Operational constraints; Reactive planning; Routing and scheduling algorithms; Simulation studies; System resiliences; Aircraft control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103704510

Here, we report the results from the first 4 years. As expected, warming of 5.1 °C more than doubled CH4 emissions in both plant communities. We propose this was caused by a combination of four mechanisms: (i) a decrease in the proportion of CH4 consumed by CH4 oxidation, (ii) more C substrates available for methanogenesis, (iii) reduced competition between methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria, and (iv) indirect effects of plant traits. Plots dominated by Spartina patens consistently emitted more CH4 than plots dominated by Schoenoplectus americanus, indicating key differences in the roles these common wetland plants play in affecting anaerobic soil biogeochemistry and suggesting that plant composition can modulate coastal wetland responses to climate change. © Author(s) 2021.",,"biogeochemistry; carbon emission; coalbed methane; global warming; methane; Schoenoplectus americanus; Spartina patens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104542888

Much of the work on phenology, especially leaf out and flowering, has been conducted on woody plant species. Less is known about the responses in phenology of herbaceous species induced by global change even though they represent a large and important part of biodiversity worldwide. A globally coordinated research effort is needed to understand the drivers and implications of such changes and to predict effects of global change on plant species phenology and related ecosystem processes. Here, we present the rationale of the PhenObs initiative—botanical gardens as a global phenological observation network. The initiative aims to collect data on plant phenology in botanical gardens which will be used alongside information on plant traits and site conditions to answer questions related to the consequences of global change: What is the variation in plant phenology in herbaceous species across the growing season and in response to changes in climate? How can plant phenology be predicted from species’ trait composition, provenance, position and extent of the distribution range and species’ phylogeny? What are the implications of this variation with respect to species performance and assembly, biotic interactions (e.g. plant–pollinator interactions) as well as ecosystem processes and services under changing land use and climate? Here, we lay out the development of a straightforward protocol that is appropriate for monitoring phenology across a vast diversity of growth forms of herbaceous species from various habitats and geographical regions. To focus on a key number of stages necessary to capture all aspects of plant species phenology, we analysed associations between 14 phenological stages. These data were derived from a 2-year study on 199 species in four German botanical gardens. Based on the relationships of the phenological stages, we propose to monitor three vegetative stages (‘initial growth’, ‘leaves unfolding’ and ‘senescence’) and two reproductive stages (‘flowers open’ and ‘ripe fruits’) to fully capture herbaceous species phenology.

As a component of energy system in China, rural energy is becoming more and more important. With the development of rural economy in China, the efforts of energy conservation and emission reduction have been continuously strengthened and expanded in China. Sustained, safe, and green energy supply is the material basis for the sustainable development of rural economy in China, and it is also a prerequisite for improving the quality of life of rural residents in China. Given living habits and income levels, energy consumption in rural areas in China is still dominated by traditional energy sources such as coal and firewood. There is little use and consumption of new energy. Rural energy is gradually declining for the investment in special funds for rural energy projects is not enough. New energy technology research and development are lagging. At the same time, rural areas have low using efficiency but high demand of energy, which leads more contradictions. In order to meet the needs of farmers for energy production and increase their income, it is necessary to study the countermeasures of rural energy development, which becomes an important part of the construction of a new socialist countryside. Based on the analysis of rural energy developing status and rural energy consumption structure in China, this article pointed out the problems including unreasonable energy structure, insufficient supply, the contradiction between supply and demand, and the lagging construction of follow-up service management system, and uncompleted energy support policies and imperfect incentive measures. We also put forward corresponding countermeasures and suggestions. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.",,"Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Investments; Rural areas; Sustainable development; Tourism; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Energy productions; Energy structures; Follow-up service; Incentive measures; New energy technologies; New socialist countrysides; Supply and demand; Coal industry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104602320

In this study, the simple solid-state method is employed for coupling Ni (electron donors) with lower-Fermi-level MoO2 or WOx (electron acceptors) into donor-acceptor ensembles with well-designed interfaces as robust electrocatalysts for OER. The resulting Ni/MoO2 and Ni/WOx electrocatalysts exhibit smaller overpotentials of 287 and 333 mV at 10 mA cm-2 as well as smaller Tafel slopes of 51 and 65 mV/dec, respectively, with respect to the single Ni, MoO2, WOx, and even the benchmark RuO2 in 1 M KOH. Specially, on account of a higher Fermi level of Ni in comparison with MoO2 and WOx, their strong electronic interaction results in directional interfacial electron transfer and increases the hole density over Ni, dramatically enriching the population of high-valence Ni3+ active sites and decreasing the Fermi level of Ni. The existence of Ni3+ can strengthen the chemisorption of OH-, and the downshift of the Ni Fermi level can significantly expedite migration of electrons toward the surface of catalysts during OER, thus synergistically boosting the OER catalytic performance. Furthermore, the inner Ni/MoO2 and Ni/WOx heterostructures and the electrochemically induced surface layers of oxides/hydroxides collectively boost the OER kinetics. This study highlights the importance of designing highly efficient OER electrocatalysts with high-valence active species (Ni3+) and better matched energy levels induced by the work function difference through interfacial engineering. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","decreased Fermi level; high-valence Ni3+; oxygen evolution reaction; solid-state method; strong electronic interaction","Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Electrocatalysts; Electrolysis; Electron transport properties; Energy storage; Fermi level; Interface states; Metal-air batteries; Molybdenum oxide; Oxygen; Oxygen evolution reaction; Phase interfaces; Pollution control; Potassium hydroxide; Ruthenium compounds; Carbon dioxide reduction; Catalytic performance; Electronic interactions; Energy storage and conversions; Interfacial electron transfer; Oxygen evolution reaction (oer); Solid state method; Work-function difference; Nickel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104909203

Samples of CaBAl glass with composition (30.97-x)CaO-49.90B2O3-10.22Al2O3-8.90CaF2-xCeO2, with values of x varying from 0.25 to 1.25 mol.%, were prepared by the conventional melt-quenching technique, adding carbon as a reducing agent. The samples studied had amorphous nature confirmed by the results of X-ray diffraction (XRD). The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) results showed that the vitreous network is formed by BO3 and BO4 structures, and the calculated values of the fraction of BO4 groups (N4) revealed that the increment of cerium favored the conversion of BO3 to BO4. The optical absorption spectra presented an intense broad band assigned to a charge transfer of the Ce4+, with a shift of ultraviolet (UV) absorption edge to longer wavelength, and a decrease in the band gap as result of the CeO2 concentration increase. The photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra showed that Ce3+-doped CaBAl glasses can be excited in a wide range of the UV spectral region (320-405 nm). The luminescence band of Ce3+ transitions 5d1 → 2F5/2, 2F7/2 was observed with different maximum in the emission bands for different excitation wavelengths, originate from Ce3+ ions placed mainly in two different sites in the glass network, resulting in distinct band positions and symmetries.

The new required recommendations can be applied to all countries of the world. The main objective of this study is to evaluate, analyse and compare the indoor air condition (comfort rate and CO2 concentration), and energy consumption, prevailing in a family building built in eight cities (Douala, Kinshasa, Abidjan, Lagos, Pretoria, Dakar, Antananarivo and Addis Ababa), located in eight countries (Cameroon, DRC, Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria, South Africa, Senegal, Madagascar and Ethiopia) in Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, this study assesses the total cost of the life cycle of a new building over a period of 50 years in each country. Parameter simulations and optimizations are carried out over three periods (current, 2030 and 2050) with Design Builder software renowned in this area. The results showed that the comfort potential is around 10–21% higher in the residential buildings located at altitude compare to those ones in coastal regions. The thermal comfort range is found between 20 °C and 29 °C in these different cities. The preferred thermal environment in altitude regions, where it makes cold, should be “slightly warm”, corresponding to around 1 °C above the neutral temperature, in order to satisfy the majority of the building occupant. In addition, the preferred thermal environment in coastal regions, where it makes warm, should be “slightly cold”, corresponding to around 1 °C below the neutral temperature, in order to satisfy the majority of the occupants of the building. Finally, the building's Life cycle cost (LCC) ranges between 25% and 35% for construction cost; from 30%to 40%, for operation cost; between 2% and 3% for maintenance cost; between 9% and 15% for energy cost on the whole LCC in Sub-Saharan-Africa. © 2021 International Solar Energy Society","Bioclimatic potential; CO2-emission; Energy consumption; Life cycle cost; Sub-Saharan Africa","Architectural design; Carbon dioxide; Coastal zones; Costs; Housing; Solar energy; 'current; Bioclimatic potential; Case-studies; CO$-2$/ emission; Coastal regions; Energy-consumption; Neutral temperature; Residential building; Sub-saharan africa; Thermal environment; Energy utilization; building; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; concentration (composition); energy use; life cycle analysis; optimization; residential location; simulation; software",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102864657

In order to achieve this goal, various technologies must be applied. Additionally, fuels other than gasoline should also be considered. In order to investigate the potential of the efficiency improvement, a SI engine was designed and optimized using 0D/1D methods. Some of the advanced features of this engine model include: High stroke-to-bore-ratio, variable valve timings with Miller cycle, EGR, cylinder deactivation, high turbulence concept, variable compression ratio and extreme downsizing. The fuel of choice was gasoline. With the proper application of technologies, the fuel consumption at the most relevant operating window could be decreased by approximately 10% in comparison to a state-of-the-art spark-ignited direct-injection four-cylinder passenger car engine. Furthermore, the potential of methanol as fuel was investigated in the same manner. Thanks to its almost knock-free properties, the center of combustion could be kept at its optimum value of 8°CA aTDC for the whole engine map, even though compression ratio was increased by 4 units. Also, wall heat losses and losses through exhaust gas are kept low due to methanol's lower combustion temperatures. As a result, an approximately 10% further increase in efficiency at low and medium loads was observed.

Past trends in rainfall and air temperature facilitate projecting future climate changes for informed policy responses. We used a combination of the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and observed data from 1968 to 2017 to assess changes in rainfall, moisture stress, and air temperature variability over time on bioclimatic regions of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province, South Africa. Indi- cators used included consecutive dry days (CDDs), consecutive wet days (CWDs), very heavy rain- fall days (R20), monthly maximum daily maximum air temperature (TXx), monthly minimum daily minimum air temperature (TNn), the total number of rainfall days, and monthly air temperature averages. Trends in rainfall and moisture stress are notable in different bioclimatic regions across the province. However, these trends are diverse, in general, and spatially different across and within the bioclimatic regions. Further, related rainfall indicators do not respond in the same way as would be expected. Air temperature trends were consistent with global trends and land-air temperature anomalies. Although daytime air temperatures showed a positive trend, extreme air temperature events and increases are predominant in inland regions. Night-time air temperatures showed an upward trend in most stations across KZN. Local weather-and-climate related characteristics are evolving due to climatic variability and change. The study shows that changes in climatic activities are detectable at a local level from existing historical weather data; therefore, adaptation strategies should be contextualised to respond to local and area-specific challenges. © 2021 by the authors.

To guide future expectations about droughts, this study aims to assess large-scale variability of hydrological stores (groundwater, soil moisture, and surface water) and their responses to drought intensities over large semi-arid domains in Australia. Multi-scaled indicators synthesised from in-situ rainfall (SPI-standardised precipitation index), water budget (SPEI-standardised evapotranspiration precipitation index), model (soil moisture-SM), and satellite observations (groundwater storage-GWS, surface water extent-SWE, and terrestrial water storage-TWS) are employed to assess this variability in climatic hotspots identified through statistical rotation. The link between these hotspots and climate modes are diagnosed using gaussian kernel-based SVMR (support vector machine regression), and quantile function of storage (QFS) is used to assess the response of hydrological stores to climate variability. The capability of these indicators to capture impacts of water deficit on agricultural systems is explored by implementing a PLSR (partial least square regression). Results show that (i) drought characteristics and intensities vary greatly across Australia but hotspots of higher drought duration and intensity are predominant in regions below latitude 25°S, (ii) hydrological drought indicators (SPEI/SPI-12) are better predictors of hydrological stores such as TWS and GWS, though the latter shows strong but opposite phase relationship with climate data, (iii) influence of climate teleconnections is better diagnosed and predicted with SPEI/SPI-12, and the Murray Darling basin-MDB (r=0.84, α=0.05) and central/east coast (r=0.80, 0.79, α=0.05) are major teleconnection hotspots, (iv) SM and GWS losses in the MDB occurred 60% and about 44% of the time, respectively, during the 2002-2017 period, (v) extreme events (droughts and floods) affect the distribution of SWE, and (vi) meteorological drought indicators (SPEI/SPI-3) are excellent metrics that capture variability in crop production. Choosing appropriate indicators that reflect the response of freshwater ecosystems (including groundwater) to climatic and anthropogenic constraints is part of a key process to guide investments in drought resilience and sustainable management of water resources. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Australia; Climate change; Climate variability; Droughts; Groundwater; Hydrology","Agricultural robots; Budget control; Cultivation; Digital storage; Drought; Economics; Floods; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Rain; Risk management; Soil moisture; Stream flow; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Surface waters; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Drought characteristics; Meteorological drought; Partial least square regression; Satellite observations; Socio-economic systems; Support vector machine regressions; Sustainable management; Terrestrial water storage; Climate change; ecosystem resilience; flooding; groundwater resource; hydrometeorology; precipitation intensity; rainfall; risk perception; soil moisture; water availability; water management; water storage; water stress; Australia; Murray-Darling Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101323435

An econometric model is designed to examine the influence of short-run marginal costs, electricity demand and emission intensities on carbon pass-through to spot electricity prices. Our sample period from July 2009 to June 2016 allows us to analyse three different sub-periods in order to quantify pass-through effects: the period before the CPM, the period when the pricing mechanism was effective, as well as the period after its repeal. Therefore, our study allows a comprehensive evaluation of the effect of carbon pricing on the Australian electricity spot market. Our results demonstrate a high degree of carbon costs pass-through across the considered markets, while the increase in electricity prices typically exceeds carbon costs, in particular for the markets in New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia. Furthermore, we find a negative relationship between carbon pass-through rates and emission intensities in the regional markets: pass-through rates were relatively low for Victoria that is characterised by electricity generation from fossil fuels and high emission intensities, while they were the highest for South Australia, a market with the lowest emission intensities and a higher share of renewable energy generation. We also find that for most markets, emission intensities were only reduced by a relatively small margin during the tax period and electricity prices have never reverted back to their pre-tax levels after the repeal of the tax. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon pass-through rates; Carbon tax; Climate policy; Electricity prices","Carbon; Fossil fuels; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Australian electricities; Comprehensive evaluation; Electricity generation; High emission intensity; National electricity markets; Renewable energy generation; Short run marginal costs; Spot electricity prices; Costs; demand analysis; econometrics; electricity generation; environmental policy; fossil fuel; pollution tax; price determination; price dynamics; Australia; New South Wales; Queensland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101179395

In EU countries, the agricultural sector is the source of above 94% of the total anthropogenic emissions of ammonia, of which manure removal systems account for 56%. In view of the reason for the agricultural waste management by formation and propagation of ammonia gas—the bacterial and enzymatic degradation of organic components in excrement—it is important to evaluate the effect of biotreatment of 100% natural composition (contain Azospirillum sp. (N) (number of bacterial colonies −1 × 109 cm−3), Frateuria aurentia (K) (number of bacterial colonies −1 × 109 cm−3), Bacillus megaterium (P) (bacterial colony count −1 × 109 cm−3), seaweed extract (10% by volume), phytohormones, auxins, cytokinin, gibberellins, amino acids, and vitamins) on the emission of ammonia from organic waste. Experimental research was carried out to determine significant differences of dynamics in agrochemical composition of manure, NH3 gas emissions, depending on biotreatment, manure storage duration, and ventilation intensity of the barn. Gas emission was obtained via laser gas analyzer using a spectroscopic method in a specially reconstructed wind tunnel chamber. About 32% manure biotreatment effect on reduction of ammonia emissions was established. The maximum effect of the biodegradable compound on gaseous propagation was assessed after 28–35 days of manure storage and proved all biotreatment effect time of 49–56 days. By the saving nitrogen loses priority, manure biotreatment could reduce nitrogen losses from manure and inorganic N fertilizers by approximately 5%, also could reduce approximately 5911.1 thousand tones nitrogen fertilizer in the world and reduce approximately 5.5 Eur ha−1 . “The biotreatment impact assessment confirmed that proper application of biotreatment can reduce ammonia emissions from manure and environmental pollution from agriculture”. © 2021 by the authors.

Many underlying functions, like nutrient retention, carbon sequestration or water regulation, strongly depend on regular inundation. So far, these are approached on the basis of what are called ‘active floodplains’. Active floodplains, defined as statistically inundated once every 100 years, represent less than 10% of a floodplain’s original size. Still, should this remaining area be considered as one homogenous surface in terms of floodplain function, or are there any alternative approaches to quantify ecologically active floodplains? With the European Flood Hazard Maps, the extent of not only medium floods (T-medium) but also frequent floods (T-frequent) needs to be modelled by all member states of the European Union. For large German rivers, both scenarios were compared to quantify the extent, as well as selected indicators for naturalness derived from inundation. It is assumed that the more naturalness there is, the more inundation and the better the functioning. Real inundation was quantified using measured discharges from relevant gauges over the past 20 years. As a result, land uses indicating strong human impacts changed significantly from T-frequent to T-medium floodplains. Furthermore, the extent, water depth and water volume stored in the T-frequent and T-medium floodplains is significantly different. Even T-frequent floodplains experienced inundation for only half of the considered gauges during the past 20 years. This study gives evidence for considering regulation functions on the basis of ecologically active floodplains, meaning in floodplains with more frequent inundation that T-medium floodplains delineate. © 2021 by the author.

Here, we describe a unique negative feedback mechanism enabling the global NtrB/NtrC regulator to rapidly respond to nitrogen starvation over the course of histidine utilization (hut) in Pseudomonas fluorescens. NtrBC directly activates transcription of hut genes, but overexpression will produce excess ammonium leading to NtrBC inactivation. To prevent this from occurring, the histidine-responsive repressor HutC fine-Tunes ntrBC autoactivation: HutC and NtrC bind to the same operator site in the ntrBC promoter. This newly discovered low-Affinity binding site shows little sequence similarity with the consensus sequence that HutC recognizes for substrate-specific induction of hut operons. A combination of genetic and transcriptomic analysis indicated that both ntrBC and hut promoter activities cannot be stably maintained in the ΔhutC background when histidine fluctuates at high concentrations. Moreover, the global carbon regulator CbrA/CbrB is involved in directly activating hut transcription while de-repressing hut translation via the CbrAB-CrcYZ-Crc/Hfq regulatory cascade. Together, our data reveal that the local transcription factor HutC plays a crucial role in governing NtrBC to maintain carbon/nitrogen homeostasis through the complex interactions between two TCSs (NtrBC and CbrAB) at the hut promoter. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Thereafter, various lockdown impacts were observed, and one of the immediate effects was a reduction in air pollution levels across the world and in India as well. In this study, we have observed approximately 40% reduction in air quality index (AQI) during one month of lockdown in India. The detailed investigations were performed for 14 major hotspot places where the COVID-19 cases were &gt;1000 (as of 1st June 2020) and represents more than 70% associated mortality in India. We assessed the impact of lockdown on different air quality indicators, including ground (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, and AQI) and tropospheric nitric oxide (NO2) pollutants, through ground monitoring stations and Sentinel-5 satellite datasets respectively. The highest reductions were noticed in NO2 (-48.68%), PM2.5 (-34.84%) and PM10 (-33.89%) air pollutant (unit in μg/m3) post-lockdown. Moreover, tropospheric NO2 (mol/m2) concentrations were also improved over Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Thane, and Ahmedabad metro cities.

As such, there has been a call for research, exploration, and the usage of alternative energy which is believed to improve the depleting quality of the environment. This study investigates the relationship between energy efficiency, green energy investment, and energy innovation in a panel of nine highly industrialized countries, namely Canada, Japan, France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, the USA, and the UK. Relying on the environmental Kuznets’ hypothesis (EKC), we employ the quantile-on-quantile regression approach to the data obtained between 1980 and 2018. The empirical estimates validate the EKC hypothesis in most of these industrialized nations considered. The findings also reveal that the continuous use of non-renewable energy consumption escalates emissions, while the use of renewable energy reduces the level of emissions “in” the environment. Therefore, energy efficiency leads to an increase in emissions in the first 3 quantiles and reduces emissions in the remaining quantiles. Also, energy innovation leads to a high amount of emissions. Finally, the study calls for increased investments in renewable energy as well as energy efficiency to ensure continuous improvement in the quality of the environment. © 2021, Crown.","Energy efficiency; Energy innovation; Green energy investment; Quantile Approach","alternative energy; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental degradation; environmental economics; environmental quality; fossil fuel; innovation; Kuznets curve; spatiotemporal analysis; Canada; France; Germany; Italy; Japan; Spain; Switzerland; United Kingdom; United States; carbon dioxide; Canada; developing country; economic development; energy conservation; France; Germany; Italy; Japan; renewable energy; Spain; Switzerland; Canada; Carbon Dioxide; Conservation of Energy Resources; Developed Countries; Economic Development; France; Germany; Italy; Japan; Renewable Energy; Spain; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098770815

In this study, the impact of COVID-19 lockdown inter-ventions on five major air pollutants during the pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown periods is analysed in three urban areas in Northern England: Leeds, Sheffield, and Manchester. A Gener-alised Additive Model (GAM) was implemented to eliminate the effects of meteorological factors from air quality to understand the variations in air pollutant levels exclusively caused by reductions in emissions. Comparison of lockdown with pre-lockdown period exhibited noticeable reductions in concentrations of NO (56.68–74.16%), NO2 (18.06–47.15%), and NOx (35.81–56.52%) for measured data. However, PM10 and PM2.5 levels demonstrated positive gain during lockdown ranging from 21.96–62.00% and 36.24–80.31%, respectively. Comparison of lockdown period with the equivalent period in 2019 also showed reductions in air pollutant concentrations, ranging 43.31–69.75% for NO, 41.52–62.99% for NOx, 37.13–55.54% for NO2, 2.36–19.02% for PM10, and 29.93–40.26% for PM2.5 . Back trajectory analysis was performed to show the air mass origin during the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods.

Small-capacity renewable power sources represented by photovoltaics and wind are continuously increasing as a form of microgrid to supply electric power to a community or island. As a result, microgrids based on renewable resources have come into wide usage around small areas or islands in Korea. In particular, the microgrid development policy of Korea is focused on electric power quality, as well as expansion in renewable energy supply for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. From 2009, the government began to develop independent carbon-free microgrids with photovoltaic and wind powers instead of traditional power diesel generators for small islands. The goal of this paper is to investigate a feasible economic microgrid topology for implementing the carbon-free island (CFI) under an acceptable level of reliability. First, we derive three scenarios of power systems including photovoltaics, wind, battery, and fuel cells. Next, we assess economic feasibility on top of the power supply reliability of the scenarios. Then, we perform a sensitivity test to suggest economic conditions for achieving the CFI goals. Finally, we present carbon-free-based microgrid models considering the CFI policy of Korea. © 2021 by the authors.

Different combinations of RE sources examined for minimal GHG emission and financial viability under two circumstances - with and without considering a set of vital system constraints. Optimized participations of RE sources in hybrid microgrid architecture are found that resulted in maximum GHG emission reduction along with reducing reliance upon diesel generators at isolated chosen site.

Applications of dicamba that are most cited for off-Target movement have occurred in June and July in many states when weeds are often in high densities and at least 10 cm or taller at the time of application. For registration purposes, most field studies examining pesticide emissions are conducted using bare ground or very small plants. Research was conducted in Knoxville, TN, in the summer of 2017, 2018, and 2019 to examine the effect of application surface (tilled soil, dead plants, green plants) on dicamba emissions under field conditions. Dicamba emissions after application were affected by the treated surface in all years, with the order from least to most emissions being dead plants < tilled soil < green plant material. In fact, dicamba emissions were >300% when applied to green plants compared to other surfaces. These findings suggest that dicamba applications made to bare ground will likely underestimate what may occur under normal field use conditions when POST applications are made and the crop canopy or weed groundcover is nearly 100% green material. A potential change to enhance the accuracy of current environmental simulation models would be to increase the theoretical findings to allow for the effect of green plant material on dicamba emissions under field conditions. © 2021 Cambridge University Press.

The carbon capture and storage technology is the primary solution to reach the reduction target of carbon dioxide emissions. The carbon capture and storage activities involve CO2 capturing, transporting, and storing in geological storage, requires number planning. The process integration approach by pinch analysis method can be used for the carbon capture and storage planning problem and to develop the carbon capture and storage network design. However, the applicability of the method needs to be evaluated when some constraints in carbon capture and storage network design are applied. This paper proposes an improved pinch analysis based method for carbon capture and storage target and network design. The method begins with targeting the maximum carbon exchange in the carbon capture and storage system, which is followed by designing the carbon capture and storage network. Next, the capital-carbon trade-off is introduced as a new strategy for assessing carbon capture and storage network design to show the economic feasibility of the design. Four case studies demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method to the carbon capture and storage systems in the central and western part of Indonesia.

Hydrogen has been identified by the scientific community, industry, and policy makers as part of the solution to this challenge. Hydrogen has been used for decades in many industries, formerly making up approximately 50% of the Town Gas used for heating and cooking in UK homes in the mid 20th century. It is now crucial to ensure safety regulations are met, and public acceptance gained, before hydrogen can start being used for residential heating. Demonstration projects require hydrogen distribution networks to be odorised. This study examines the use of sulphur-based odorants, which are currently in use in the UK and Europe to odorise Natural Gas, to be used in a 100% hydrogen gas demonstration network in the UK. We undertook a comparative testing programme to evaluate the escape detection properties of odorised hydrogen against odorised methane and natural gas. This comparative approach will help address the question asked by UK and EU regulators: is hydrogen ‘as safe as’ natural gas? The results show that untrained participants can identify an escaping gas odorised with Odorant New Blend and standby odorant 2, in hydrogen, natural gas or methane, at the regulatory threshold of 1% gas in air.

Our study employs both CLAMP (Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program) and LMA (Leaf Margin Analysis), the first time these two techniques have been directly compared, and is based on 25 morphotypes (representing 23 taxa) of woody dicot leaves from a single stratigraphic unit (layer LV6). Both methods have provided a similar result. Although the standard deviation of LMA is higher than CLAMP, the results of LMA are coherent with CLAMP. The palaeoclimatic variables obtained from CLAMP shows a marked contrast between WMMT and CMMT and between 3-WET (836.3 ± 145.4 mm) and 3-DRY (113 ± 33 mm). Meanwhile, the GROWSEAS (9.30 ± 0.7 months) points out that the growth season lasted almost all the year. These variations signal a seasonal contrast, showing the existence of a dry season. Results indicate a warm temperate climate with hot and dry summers. The palaeoclimatic variables obtained using CLAMP are: MAT 17.2 ± 1.7 °C, WMMT 25.5 ± 1.3 °C, CMMT 10 ± 1.8 °C and GSP 1480 ± 204 mm. The palaeoclimatic variables obtained using LMA are MAT 17.11 ± 4.61 °C (regression equation for data from East Asia) and 16.8 ± 4.7 °C (regression equation for data from Europe). The palaeoclimatic values estimated from La Val site match those obtained from other Oligocene sites from Iberia (e.g. As Pontes site) that rely on different palaeoclimate methods. These palaeoclimatic values obtained from La Val are also similar to those from several Oligocene localities (e.g. the Rot flora) in Europe and reflect peak temperature corresponding to the late Oligocene warming episode. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Chattian; Palaeoclimatology; Southern Europe; Spain","biostratigraphy; climate variation; fossil record; growing season; morphotype; Oligocene; paleoclimate; reconstruction; type locality; Europe; Far East; Iberian Peninsula",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101104264

One way to treat this waste in an environmentally sound, energy-sustainable and economically cost-effective manner is anaerobic digestion. The biogas generated can be used as fuel and as a renewable source of energy (providing a solution to the energy supply problem from an environmental point of view). It has been shown that, when treated along with sludge from a Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor, the crop malt residue produces about 1604 NmL of biogas per 100 g; with a content in methane of 27.486%. The development of the process has been studied with a novel indicator, hydrogen generation, and it has been determined that the process takes place in two phases. It has been demonstrated that this solution is beginning to be energy-efficient and therefore to produce energy for external uses in regions that have at least 6000 hectares of planted barley. At best, it can be considered, in a given region, the equivalent of a 115 MW power plant. It could supply energy to 10 thousand homes per year. Therefore, it is considered an energy-efficient solution that com-plies with the Sustainable Development Goals #1, #7, #10, #12 and #13. It guarantees access to energy in isolated areas or with supply problems, and results in a 55.4% reduction in emissions of equivalent-CO2 (which equals 38,060 tons of equivalent-CO2 in Spain). © 2021 by the authors.

Box 217, Enschede, 7500AE, Netherlands","The conversion of the initial intermediate CO in the electrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 on the surface of oxide-derived Cu electrodes has been investigated as a function of partial pressure and pH, manipulated by the composition of the electrolyte. We show that in inert gas, an increase in partial pressure of CO results in a continuous increase in Faradaic efficiency (FE) for ethylene, at various potentials ranging from -0.7 to -1.1 V versus RHE, with the highest FE of ∼28% obtained using 1 bar CO at -0.8 V. When the partial pressure of CO is increased in a mixture of CO and CO2, an optimum in the ethylene FE was found for the partial pressure of CO in the range from 0.5 bar (at -1.1 V, FE is ∼45%) to 0.8 bar (at -0.9 V, FE is ∼35%). At lower negative potentials (-0.8 to -0.7 V), the presence of CO2 has negligible influence, and similar data to reduction of CO in inert gas were obtained. Variation of the anion in solution (0.1 M concentration) shows that the optimized FE toward ethylene increases from 5.2% in KH2PO4 to 43.2% in KOH. The observed differences in selectivity are attributed to anion buffering capacity and the associated local pH near the surface of the electrode. Using in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS), it was determined that the CO coverage increases as a function of increasing pH, confirming that CO coverage and pH correlate. Collectively, the data herein outline the critical role of reactant partial pressures and the significant effect of anion composition (pH) on the surface coverage of CO and concomitant selectivity in electrochemical reduction of CO2 to ethylene. © 2021 The Authors.

We propose an original computational approach to predict the morphology of carbonaceous materials for arbitrary densities that we apply here to graphitic phases at low densities from 1.15 to 0.16 g/cm3, including glassy carbon. This approach, dynamic reactive massaging of the potential energy surface (DynReaxMas), uses the ReaxFF reactive force field in a simulation protocol that combines potential energy surface (PES) transformations with global optimization within a multidescriptor representation. DynReaxMas enables the simulation of materials synthesis at temperatures close to experiment to correctly capture the interplay of activated vs entropic processes and the resulting phase morphology. We then show that DynReaxMas efficiently and semiautomatically produces atomistic configurations that span wide relevant regions of the PES at modest computational costs. Indeed, we find a variety of distinct phases at the same density, and we illustrate the evolution of competing phases as a function of density ranging from uniform vs bimodal distributions of pore sizes at higher and intermediate density (1.15 g/cm3 and 0.50 g/cm3) to agglomerated vs sparse morphologies, further partitioned into boxed vs hollow fibrillar morphologies, at lower density (0.16 g/cm3). Our observations of diverse phases at the same density agree with experiment. Some of our identified phases provide descriptors consistent with available experimental data on local density, pore sizes, and HRTEM images, showing that DynReaxMas provides a systematic classification of the complex field of amorphous carbonaceous materials that can provide 3D structures to interpret experimental observations. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","amorphous carbon; carbon nanotubes; glassy carbon; global optimization; graphitic phases; PES transformations; pore-size distribution","Amorphous carbon; Global optimization; Molecular physics; Pore size; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Quantum chemistry; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Bimodal distribution; Carbonaceous materials; Computational approach; Intermediate densities; Reactive force field; Simulation protocols; Stochastic simulations; Structure/property relationships; Morphology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103773715

We assessed the biomass productivity of six willow cultivars in a 14.5-ha field in Pennsylvania through two rotation cycles of 3 yr each, comparing the realized and biophysical yield potential. We also evaluated the relationship of yield with plant density and the harvest efficiency. The realized yield of the best cultivars was about 8 Mg ha–1 yr–1, well below the calculated harvestable potential of 14 Mg ha–1 yr–1. Uniform stands of willow without planting gaps may maximize yield with 8 × 103 plants ha–1, but upright cultivars may benefit from higher densities. Harvest is relatively slow at 1 ha h–1 or 20 Mg h–1 in the longest rows with optimal ground conditions, which makes the harvest cost per hour high. Biotic stresses built up gradually during the 7 yr of the experiment affecting two cultivars severely. The cultivar S. miyabeana × S. viminalis ‘Preble’ was defoliated by a growing population of willow leaf beetle (Plagiodera versicolora), whereas the cultivar S. purpurea ‘Fish Creek’ was affected by two fungal diseases and suffered a major stand loss in the winter of 2019/2020. Both examples justify breeding for insects and diseases resistance. The moderate harvestable yield and high harvest cost imply that in the northeastern United States, the viability of willow for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage as a tool to reduce CO2 emissions may depend on the provision and monetization of additional ecosystem services. © 2021 The Authors.

These impacts are negative in most of the sectors but benefits also occurred in specific fields. Tourism was one of the most negatively affected economic sectors, and in terms of benefits, the improvement of air quality can be highlighted, with positive health implications. This paper aims to evaluate the impacts on these two particular fields-tourism and air quality-focusing on Portugal due to the relevance of tourism in the country. The research carried out in this paper enables us to find the most critical areas and identifies lessons learnt and recommendations for the post-COVID period. Tourism and air quality data were collected for both 2019 and 2020 and compared in terms of quantitative and spatial analysis. The Lisbon metropolitan area-the geographical area where the capital of the country is located-was the area that suffered the most negative impacts in terms of tourism activity but was also the one where highest benefits in terms of air pollution reduction and human exposure were felt. Recommendations for future strategies are suggested, including new concepts of tourism connected to the environment; the investment in online/virtual tourism activities; promotion of the domestic market; mitigation of the over-tourism problem and using environmental issues, such as air quality, as new attractiveness criteria for tourism destinations. © 2021 by the authors.

The physiological responses of most terrestrial ectotherms (such as insects and spiders) to clinal gradients of climate, and in particular gradients of temperature, can be the product of both phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation. This study aimed to determine how the biogeographic position of populations and the body size of individuals set the limits of cold (freezing) resistance of Dolomedes fimbriatus. We compared D. fimbriatus to its sister species Dolomedes plantarius under harsher climatic conditions in their distribution range. Using an ad hoc design, we sampled individuals from four populations of Dolomedes fimbriatus originating from contrasting climatic areas (temperate and continental climate) and one population of the sister species D. plantarius from continental climate, and compared their supercooling ability as an indicator of cold resistance. Results for D. fimbriatus indicated that spiders from northern (continental) populations had higher cold resistance than spiders from southern (temperate) populations. Larger spiders had a lower supercooling ability in northern populations. The red-listed and rarest D. plantarius was slightly less cold tolerant than the more common D. fimbriatus, and this might be of importance in a context of climate change that could imply colder overwintering habitats in the north due to reduced snow cover protection.

This work analyzes the effects of economic growth and energy resources (renewable and nonrenewable) on the emissions of greenhouse gasses (GHG). A 2000–2016 panel data from 25 developing Asian countries is analyzed through a robust Random Effect (RE) approach and Hausman Taylor Regression (HTR). Findings show a positive correlation between economic growth and energy consumption, while a 1% increase in renewable energy consumption results in a 0.193% decrease in carbon emissions. Economic growth and renewable energy are positively correlated in both the short and long term, which implies a valid feedback hypothesis. The findings indicate the significant contribution of nonrenewable energy resources to greenhouse gas emissions and the positive impact of renewable resources on greenhouse gas emissions' control. Furthermore, this study highlights the potential of developing Asian economies to preserve the environment through more robust regional environmental policies and renewable energy resources. In light of this study's findings, policymakers in Asian developing economies should develop policies on Renewable Energy infrastructure (RE) to improve GDP and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Asian economies; Econometric model; Environment management; Greenhouse gasses; Renewable energy; Sustainability","carbon; natural gas; carbon dioxide; alternative energy; carbon emission; economic growth; energy efficiency; energy planning; Gross Domestic Product; infrastructural development; policy making; Article; Asian; carbon footprint; econometric model; economic aspect; economic development; energy consumption; energy resource; environment; environmental management; greenhouse gas; gross national product; nonrenewable energy; renewable energy; renewable resource; Asia; greenhouse gas; renewable energy; Asia; Asia; Carbon Dioxide; Economic Development; Greenhouse Gases; Renewable Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100434106

The increasing integration into the power grid of renewable energy sources (RES), such as wind and solar, is becoming more prevalent and this trend is expected to continue. However, the intermittent behaviour of these renewable energy sources poses a significant challenge for power systems in terms of dispatchability and the ability to maintain stable grid operation. We propose and implement a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based technique to control each independent region of a power system. The PSO control strategy will coordinate and schedule the renewable energy resources (wind and solar) and conventional generators for each region. A cost function is optimized, and the operating cost for the power system is calculated based on the fitness of each particle. All proposed strategies and algorithms are implemented using MATLAB and validated using the IEEE-39 bus system model. © 2021 IEEE.","optimized cost function; Particle swarm Optimization; Renewable energy sources; Wind and solar integration in grid","Cost functions; Electric power transmission networks; Natural resources; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Combined emissions; Control strategies; Conventional generators; Dispatchability; Economic Dispatch; Grid operation; Integration of renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Electric load dispatching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113369880

Being environmentally hazardous and plentiful presence in nature, CO2 utilization as C1 resource into fuels and feedstock is very demanding from the green chemistry perspectives. To accomplish this CO2 utilization issue, functional organic materials like porous organic polymers (POPs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as well as organic-inorganic hybrid materials like metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), having characteristics of large surface area, high thermal stability and tunability in the porous nanostructures play significant role in designing the suitable catalyst for the CO2 hydrogenation reactions. Although CO2 hydrogenation is a widely studied and emerging area of research, till date review exclusively focused on designing POPs, COFs and MOFs bearing reactive functional groups is very limited. A thorough literature review on this matter will enrich our knowledge over the CO2 hydrogenation processes and the catalytic sites responsible for carrying out these chemical transformations. We emphasize recent state-of-the art developments in POPs/COFs/MOFs having unique functionalities and topologies in stabilizing metallic NPs and molecular complexes for the CO2 reduction reactions.

The present study was conducted in West Garo hills district of Meghalaya state in NEI, to evaluate the impact of plantations (rubber, tea, areca nut, cashew nut and pineapple) on SOC stocks in comparison with a natural forest. Soil samples were collected from plantations of different age classes (0–5, 5–10, 10–15, 15–20, 20–25, 25–30, and 30–40 years old) to assess their potential for C storage. RothC model was run at equilibrium on forest land-use, and thereafter was calibrated and validated to model SOC stocks in the plantations over the 40 years chrono-sequence using the baseline average climate data. Results showed that with increase in age of plantations (at 40 years), SOC stocks decreased to 57.4, 50.3 and 44.4 Mg C ha−1 in rubber, areca nut and pineapple plantations at the average rate of 0.41, 0.58 and 0.73 Mg C ha−1 yr−1, respectively. This corresponded to a SOC stock loss of about 22, 32 and 40% compared to the initial SOC stock under forest (73.6 Mg C ha−1). Conversely, SOC stocks in tea and cashew nut plantations increased to 83.4 and 75.4 Mg C ha−1 (at the average rate of 0.24 and 0.05 Mg C ha−1 yr−1), corresponding to a SOC gain of about 13 and 2.5% compared to that under forest over 40 years. The data on abrupt climate change (ACC) scenario by RothC simulations showed that rubber, areca nut, pineapple and forest land uses would lose carbon at the rate of 0.65, 0.65, 1.42 and 0.13 Mg C ha−1 yr−1, respectively. Conversely, tea and cashew nut plantations might gain C at the rate of 0.35 and 0.23 Mg C ha−1 yr−1, respectively, representing a valuableoption for storing C and mitigating and adapting to climate change. Further, protecting and restoring natural forests and/or mixed stands of native tree species might reduce the risks of the loss of biodiversity and be a viable option for sustainable land management in NEI. © 2021","Chronosequence; Forest conversion; RothC; Soil organic carbon; Tropical plantations","Biodiversity; Climate change; Climate models; Digital storage; Forestry; Land use; Organic carbon; Rubber; Rubber plantations; Soils; Tea; Abrupt climate change; Native tree species; Natural forests; Northeast india; Soil carbon stock; Soil organic carbon; Sustainable land managements; Sustainable lands; Magnesium; biodiversity; carbon storage; climate change; forest management; land management; land use change; plantation forestry; soil carbon; soil organic matter; stand structure; India; Meghalaya; Anacardium occidentale; Ananas comosus; Areca catechu; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101830170

Flooding poses its own hazards, but in recent years, chemical releases triggered by extreme weather, such as hurricanes, have become more frequent, exposing nearby communities to toxic chemicals in the midst of natural disaster. This article reviews the public health implications of chemical releases triggered by extreme weather and provides commentary on possible policy solutions. The Gulf Coast, where there is an abundance of chemical facilities, is particularly vulnerable to these events, one of the latest examples being the August 2020 BioLab chlorine factory fire in Lake Charles, Louisiana, during Hurricane Laura. Low-wealth, Black, and Hispanic communities are disproportionately located near high-risk chemical facilities. The cumulative burden of flooding, toxic chemical releases, and other social stressors borne of systemic racism harms these communities, highlighting a critical environmental injustice. The federal and state governments have failed to develop regulatory safeguards that would prevent chemical releases triggered by extreme storms. State regulators should make facility reporting data available to the public and establish a regulatory regime for aboveground storage tanks. State regulators should also complete an analysis of flood risks to high-risk chemical facilities and impacts on historically disenfranchised communities, require permitted facilities to implement climate-responsive spill preventions practices, and establish a task force that can investigate strategies to prevent climate-driven chemical disaster and engage key stakeholders. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.","chemical releases; environmental justice; extreme weather; fugitive chemicals; natural hazards; toxic floodwaters","climate conditions; extreme event; flood; public health; Gulf Coast [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104515344

Since the effective working time is reduced by the cold climate, it is necessary to solve the problem of intermittent filling of the core wall at low temperature. However, freeze–thaw (FT) cycles in the filling process will change the deformation behavior of gravelly soil. For 300 m-high earth core rockfill dams, the deformation of gravelly soil is a crucial factor in predicting the long-term deformation and settlement after dam construction. To investigate the influence of FT cycles on the deformation characteristics, the deformation of the gravelly soil under different amounts of FT cycles was tested using an MTS-810 test system. The deformation characteristics were discussed, and a modified Burgers model was used to describe the deformation characteristics. The results show that the freeze–thaw action makes the coarse particles break, resulting in an increase in the fine content. The FT cycles can make the creep characteristics of gravelly soil more obvious. The creep strain has a large contribution to the total strain with the increasing in the FT cycles. It is thus suggested that the coverage of thermal insulation material would effectively prevent freezing of the gravelly soil and control the deformation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Deformation characteristics; Freeze–thaw cycles; Gravelly soil; Particle breakage","Cold working; Dams; Rock mechanics; Soils; Temperature; Thawing; Thermal insulation; Coarse particles; Creep characteristics; Deformation behavior; Deformation Characteristics; High earth rockfill dam; Long-term deformation; Modified burgers models; Thermal insulation materials; Creep; alpine environment; deformation; deformation mechanism; freeze tolerance; freeze-thaw cycle; gravel; insulation; rockfill dam; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103582434

With this aim, in recent years, Ducted Fuel Injection (DFI) concept has been developed: DFI is based on the idea of injecting the fuel spray through a small cylindrical pipe within the combustion chamber at a certain distance from the nozzle injector hole. Recent research studies have highlighted the high potential of this innovative concept for soot mitigation in both constant volume vessel and engine-like operating conditions. However, the mechanisms driving the soot reduction have not yet been fully understood. The aim of this research work is to further investigate the DFI concept, evaluating its impact on the spray characteristics, on the air/fuel mixing and, therefore, on the soot formation phenomena. Firstly, an experimental activity was carried out by means of a constant volume vessel test bench with optical accesses to compare the spray evolution and sizing with and without duct adoption, over a wide range of vessel thermodynamic conditions and injection pressures. After that, a simulation setup was defined in the commercially available 3D-CFD software CONVERGE reproducing the experimental test bench, calibrating and validating the spray model. Firstly, the spray model was calibrated and validated considering the same non-reacting conditions exploited in the experimental analysis. Then, the calibrated spray model was used as a virtual tool to investigate the air entrainment process. As a results, the DFI adoption increases the air entrainment in the near-nozzle region caused by the high velocity spray that generates a pumping effect at the duct inlet. Moreover, mixing process is also enhanced by the turbulence distribution at the duct exit resulting in a narrower distribution of equivalence ratio at the ignition. As a consequence of the more effective air entrainment and improved turbulent mixing, DFI remarkably mitigates soot emissions, with a reduction up to 80% with respect to free spray configuration in all tested operating conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Diesel; Ducted Fuel Injection; Fuel spray; Mixing combustion","Air; Damage detection; Ducts; Dust; Engines; Fuel injection; Fuels; Mixing; Software testing; Soot; Spray nozzles; Compression ignition engine; Constant-volume vessel; Experimental activities; Experimental analysis; Experimental test benches; Numerical investigations; Spray characteristics; Thermodynamic conditions; Air entrainment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098674114

A more detailed study about industrial emissions is required in order to discriminate different activities contributing to pollutant sources. In this sense, gaseous pollutants (NO2, SO2 and O3) and PM10 levels has been studied in a complex industrial area in the southwest of Spain (La Rabida and the nearby city of Huelva) during the period 1996–2017. Hourly, daily, monthly and annual variations of PM10 and gaseous pollutants concentrations point to the industrial activity as the main SO2 source. Furthermore, traffic and resuspension emissions contribute to the NO2 and PM10 levels, respectively. Results from chemical composition of PM10 at both sites during the period 2015–2017 are characterized by high concentrations of the crustal components derived from natural and local resuspension. Arsenic is found to be the main geochemical anomaly at La Rabida (annual mean of 7 ng m−3), exceeding the European annual target of 6 ng m−3, which supposes a risk for the nearby population. An emission source from Cu-smelter has been identified in La Rabida and Huelva. A second source corresponding to emissions from polymetallic sulfides handling in a port area has been described for the first time in La Rabida. In addition, arsenic speciation results have identified three different As impacts scenarios as a function of the dominant wind direction, the SO2 episodes and the As extraction efficiency: impact of the Cu-smelter, impact of the bulk polymetallic sulfides and a mixed impact of both sources. © 2020","Arsenic speciation; Complex industrial area; PM10; Pollutant gases; Sulfide material","Fog; Industrial emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Sulfur dioxide; Annual variations; Arsenic speciation; Chemical compositions; Gaseous pollutants; Geochemical anomaly; Industrial activities; Pollutant sources; Source contributions; Lanthanum; arsenic; arsenic; atmospheric pollution; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; particulate matter; pollutant source; speciation (chemistry); sulfide; sulfur dioxide; air quality; Article; chemical analysis; concentration (parameter); controlled study; geochemical analysis; human; leaching; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; particulate matter 10; population research; relative humidity; risk factor; Spain; air pollutant; air pollution; city; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; Andalucia; Huelva [Andalucia]; Spain; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Arsenic; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100268711

They often have a climate sceptic approach and do away with mitigation policies when coming to power. Increasing impacts of extreme meteorological events linked to climate change could lead to a situation where the supporters of the populist leader or elites crucial for the survival of an authoritarian regime are pushing to do something to address climate change. In order not to lose power, the leader may look for quick and cheap solutions. In such a context, solar radiation modification (SRM), for example, by stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), will become very attractive as it is likely to have low costs and rapid effects. Populist or authoritarian governments are unlikely to care for negative impacts of SRM abroad as they often act nationalistically with an explicit disdain for multilateral solutions. We discuss the incentive structure and political economy that populist and authoritarian leaders may face regarding unilateral use of SRM and elaborate how the international community could try to prevent or at least ‘contain’ such unilateral uses of SRM. Unfortunately, such ‘containment’ is contingent on the most powerful states not being populist or authoritarian regimes. © 2021 Durham University and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104998132

Over the past decades, considerable efforts have been made to improve ground-level PM2.5 using remotely sensed data. Here we present two new approaches for estimating atmospheric PM2.5 and chemical composition based on the High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL)-retrieved aerosol extinction values and types and Creating Aerosol Types from Chemistry (CATCH)-derived aerosol chemical composition. The first methodology (CMAQ-HSRL-CH) improves EPA's Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) predictions by applying variable scaling factors derived using remotely-sensed information about aerosol vertical distribution and types and the CATCH algorithm. The second methodology (HSRL-CH) does not require regional model runs and can provide atmospheric PM2.5 mass concentration and chemical speciation using only the remotely sensed data and the CATCH algorithm. The resulting PM2.5 concentrations and chemical speciation derived for NASA DISCOVER-AQ (Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from COlumn and VERtically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality) Baltimore-Washington, D.C. Corridor (BWC) Campaign are compared to surface measurements from EPA's Air Quality Systems (AQS) network. The analysis shows that the CMAQ-HSRL-CH method leads to considerable improvement of CMAQ's predicted PM2.5 concentrations (R2 value increased from 0.37 to 0.63, the root mean square error (RMSE) was reduced from 11.9 to 7.2 μg m−3, and the normalized mean bias (NMB) was lowered from −46.0 to 4.6%). The HSRL-CH method showed statistics (R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 8.6 μgm−3, and NMB = 24.0%), which were better than the CMAQ prediction of PM2.5 alone and analogous to CMAQ-HSRL-CH. In addition to mass concentration, HSRL-CH can also provide aerosol chemical composition without specific model simulations. We expect that the HSRL-CH method will be able to make reliable estimates of PM2.5 concentration and chemical composition where HSRL data are available. © 2021 The Author(s)","Aerosol chemical composition; AQS; CATCH; CMAQ; HSRL; PM2.5","Aerosols; Air quality; Chemical speciation; Mean square error; NASA; Optical radar; Remote sensing; Spectral resolution; Surface measurement; Aerosol chemical composition; Chemical compositions; Community multi-scale air qualities; High spectral resolution lidars; PM2.5 concentration; Remotely sensed data; Root mean square errors; Vertical distributions; Atmospheric chemistry; aerosol; air quality; algorithm; concentration (composition); estimation method; numerical model; speciation (chemistry); vertical distribution; aerosol; air quality; algorithm; article; Maryland; particulate matter 2.5; prediction; simulation; species differentiation; Washington; Baltimore; Maryland; United States; Washington",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101400770

Yet the surface temperature effects of Asian aerosols spread across the whole globe. Here, we remove Asian anthropogenic aerosols from two independent climate models (ECHAM6.1 and NorESM1) using the same representation of aerosols via MACv2-SP (a simple plume implementation of the second version of the Max Planck Institute Aerosol Climatology). We then robustly decompose the global distribution of surface temperature responses into contributions from atmospheric energy flux changes. We find that the horizontal atmospheric energy transport strongly moderates the surface temperature response over the regions where Asian aerosols reside. Atmospheric energy transport and changes in clear-sky longwave radiation redistribute the temperature effects efficiently across the Northern Hemisphere and to a lesser extent also over the Southern Hemisphere. The model-mean global surface temperature response to Asian anthropogenic aerosol removal is 0.26±0.04 °C (0.22±0.03 for ECHAM6.1 and 0.30±0.03 °C for NorESM1) of warming. Model-to-model differences in global surface temperature response mainly arise from differences in longwave cloud (0.01±0.01 for ECHAM6.1 and 0.05±0.01 °C for NorESM1) and shortwave cloud (0.03±0.03 for ECHAM6.1 and 0.07±0.02 °C for NorESM1) responses. The differences in cloud responses between the models also dominate the differences in regional temperature responses. In both models, the northern-hemispheric surface warming amplifies towards the Arctic, where the total temperature response is highly seasonal and weakest during the Arctic summer. We estimate that under a strong Asian aerosol mitigation policy tied with strong climate mitigation (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 1-1.9) the Asian aerosol reductions can add around 8 years' worth of current-day global warming during the next few decades. © Author(s) 2021.",,"aerosol; atmospheric transport; climate modeling; decomposition analysis; longwave radiation; regional climate; surface temperature; Asia; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104522679

This study investigates the effects of nitrification inhibitors Dicyandiamide (DCD) and 3,4-dimethyl pyrazole phosphate (DMPP) with urea application on soil N budget and microbial community in a subtropical pasture field. A field experiment consisting of four treatments, including control, urea, urea DCD, and urea DMPP was conducted in 2016 and 2017. Nitrous oxide emission and inorganic-N losses through leaching and runoff were quantified. In addition, soil microbial community response to the imposed treatments was characterized by analysis of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA). The results showed that DCD and DMPP applications significantly reduced fertilizer-induced N2O emission by over 76% and 67%, respectively. Although nitrification inhibitors’ (NIs) applications greatly reduced NO3– in runoff and leaching, there was no significant impact of either NI on pasture biomass yields. Comparing to the plant N uptake, N loss through N2O emission, runoff, and leaching were small in pasture. The low N losses would indicate that NI's potential to increase yield is small. Addition of 10 kg DCD ha−1 and 1 kg DMPP ha−1 reduced the negative effect induced by urea on total microbial PLFA, and benefited fungi, bacteria, and actinomycetes in short-term. Overall, the results demonstrate the positive effects of NIs on greenhouse gas reduction, water quality, and improving soil health through enhancing total microbial activity and reducing microbial environmental stress. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","DCD; DMPP; Greenhouse gas; Leaching; Nitrification inhibitor; Nitrous oxide; Runoff; Soil microbial community","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Bacteria; Budget control; Fatty acids; Greenhouse gases; Leaching; Metabolism; Nitrification; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Phospholipids; Runoff; Soils; Tropics; Urea; Water quality; Environmental pollutions; Fertilizer management; Greenhouse gas reductions; Microbial communities; Nitrification inhibitor; Nitrous oxide emissions; Phospholipid fatty acids; Soil microbial community; Soil pollution; agricultural soil; biomass; community response; fatty acid; inhibitor; microbial activity; microbial community; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient uptake; pasture; subtropical region; Actinobacteria (class)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100233682

The primary air temperatures were assessed from 20 to 130 °C. The co-combustion characteristics were included the co-combustion behaviors and emissions. In order to reveal the features of the combustion process in the porous bed, a two-dimensional unsteady state model was employed to investigate the combustion process in a fixed bed of blended biomass on the combustion process in a fixed bed reactor. Conservation equations of the bed were implemented to describe the combustion process. The gas phase turbulence was modeled using the k-ε turbulent model and the particle phase was modeled using the kinetic theory of granular flow. Results showed that by increasing primary air temperature the residual mass on bed decreased, while the average burning rates and ignition front propagation velocity increased At the primary air temperature of 85 °C the smallest unburned carbon was left in the ash, and the emissions of nitrogen-compounds were relatively small. In contrast, the primary air temperature of 85 °C was found to be well-operating condition, which can be suggested for industrial boiler during blend co-combustion. The simulation results were then compared with experimental data for different temperature, which shows that the combustion process in the fixed bed is reasonably simulated.

Mental health was consistently affected by the pandemic, with the emergence of newly diagnosed psychiatric disorders and the exacerbation of pre-existing ones. Urban areas were particularly affected by the virus spread. In this review, we analyze how the urban environment may influence mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, considering two factors that profoundly characterize urbanization: air pollution and migration. Air pollution serves as a possibly risk factor for higher viral spread and infection severity in the context of urban areas and it has also been demonstrated to play a role in the development of serious mental illnesses and their relapses. The urban environment also represents a complex social context where minorities such as migrants may live in poor hygienic conditions and lack access to adequate mental health care. A global rethinking of the urban environment is thus required to reduce the impact of these factors on mental health. This should include actions aimed at reducing air pollution and combating climate change, promoting at the same time a more inclusive society in a sustainable development perspective. © 2021 by the authors.

The paper is aimed at identifying structural-institutional transformations in the business environment and their impact on the development of small businesses. The analysis of socio-economic parameters of the business environment is based on the elasticity method and the system approach, which have been tested on the example of cities in the Western region of Ukraine. Outlining the features of setting up the business environment and its functioning has provided the grounds for detecting major problems hampering efficient business development. The comparative analysis has confirmed a close relationship between socio-economic transportation processes and conditions created for businesses. The evaluation of institutional environment has confirmed that cities striving to improve transparency in climate regulation and urban environment management achieve the growing investment activity and positive dynamics of small businesses development. The calculated elasticity coefficients prove that the growing investment activity positively impacts the number of small businesses and the volume of products sold by them. However, the expected growth in employment was not achieved due to the high level of shadow activity on the labor market and migration activity of the population. © 2021 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

It has been proposed that bigger and denser cities are more resource-efficient than smaller ones because they tend to demand less infrastructure, consume less fuel for transportation and less energy for cooling/heating in per capita terms. This hypothesis is also called Brand’s Law. However, as cities get bigger, denser and more resource-efficient, they also get richer, and richer inhabitants consume more, potentially increasing resource demand and associated environmental impacts. In this paper, we propose a method based on scaling theory to assess Brand’s Law taking into account greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from both direct (energy and fuels locally consumed) and indirect (embedded in goods and services) sources, measured as carbon footprint (CF). We aim at understanding whether Brand’s Law can be confirmed once we adopt a consumption-based approach to urban emissions. By analyzing the balance between direct and indirect emissions in a theoretical urban system, we develop a scaling theory relating carbon footprint and city size. Facing the lack of empirical data on consumption-based emissions for cities, we developed a model to derive emission estimations using well-established urban metrics (city size, density, infrastructure, wealth). Our results show that, once consumption-based CF is considered, Brand’s Law falls apart, as bigger cities have greater purchase power, leading to greater consumption of goods and higher associated GHG. Findings also suggest that a shift in consumption patterns is of utmost importance, given that, according to the model, each new monetary unit added to the gross domestic product (GDP) or to other income variables results in a more than proportional increase in GHG emissions. This work contributes to a broader assessment of the causes of emissions and the paradigm shift regarding the assumption of efficiency in the relationship of city size and emissions, adding consumption behavior as a critical variable, beyond Brand’s Law. © 2020 by the authors.

Our model approach includes geographically distributed data on plastic waste, land use, wind, precipitation, and rivers and calculates the probability for plastic waste to reach a river and subsequently the ocean. This probabilistic approach highlights regions that are likely to emit plastic into the ocean. We calibrated our model using recent field observations and show that emissions are distributed over more rivers than previously thought by up to two orders of magnitude. We estimate that more than 1000 rivers account for 80% of global annual emissions, which range between 0.8 million and 2.7 million metric tons per year, with small urban rivers among the most polluting.

Dynamic Economic Emission Dispatch is the extended version of the traditional economic emission dispatch problem in which ramp rate is taken into account for the limit of generators in a power network. Purpose. Dynamic Economic Emission Dispatch considered the treats of economy and emissions as competitive targets for optimal dispatch problems, and to reach a solution it requires some conflict resolution. Novelty. The decision-making method to solve the Dynamic Economic Emission Dispatch problem has a goal for each objective function, for this purpose, the multi-objective problem is transformed into single goal optimization by using the weighted sum method and then control/solve by Whale Optimization Algorithm. Methodology. This paper presents a newly developed metaheuristic technique based on Whale Optimization Algorithm to solve the Dynamic Economic Emission Dispatch problem. The main inspiration for this optimization technique is the fact that metaheuristic algorithms are becoming popular day by day because of their simplicity, no gradient information requirement, easily bypass local optima, and can be used for a variety of other problems. This algorithm includes all possible factors that will yield the minimum cost and emissions of a Dynamic Economic Emission Dispatch problem for the efficient operation of generators in a power network. The proposed approach performs well to perform in diverse problem and converge the solution to near best optimal solution. Results. The proposed strategy is validated by simulating on MATLAB® for 5 IEEE standard test system. Numerical results show the capabilities of the proposed algorithm to establish an optimal solution of the Dynamic Economic Emission Dispatch problem in a several runs. The proposed algorithm shows good performance over the recently proposed algorithms such as Multi-Objective Neural Network trained with Differential Evolution, Particle swarm optimization, evolutionary programming, simulated annealing, Pattern search, multi-objective differential evolution, and multi-objective hybrid differential evolution with simulated annealing technique.

Understanding how mangroves have responded to historical sea-level rise (SLR) is fundamental to assessing their resilience and capacity to store carbon as SLR accelerates. We quantified landscape-level temporal and spatial trends in historical coastal wetland sediment accumulation and associated SOC content (i.e., storage) along coastal-to-inland gradients in Southeast Florida. The observed trends were transgressive and attributed to the historical rise in sea level. Our results indicate an overall significant increase in the SOC content of the historic wetland sediment succession caused by the vertical accumulation and landward migration of carbon-rich mangrove-dominated plant communities (mean = 0.08 g cm−3) into and over carbon-poor wet prairie plant communities (mean = 0.02 g cm−3). The observed historical increase in SOC is predicted to diminish over time as the difference between rates of SLR and vertical sediment accumulation increases and because the landward migration of mangrove-dominated plant communities is now obstructed by a shore-parallel flood-control levee. These results are likely to unfold in other low-latitude coastal wetlands where they are sandwiched between rising seas and an urbanized landscape. © 2021, Society of Wetland Scientists.","Coastal wetlands; Organic-carbon accumulation; Sea-level rise; South Florida","coastal wetland; flood control; geoaccumulation; historical perspective; landscape structure; levee; mangrove; organic carbon; plant community; saltmarsh; sea level change; sediment chemistry; transgression; Everglades; Florida [United States]; United States; Florida; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102803227

However, geoengineering is similarly subject to clashing interests, knowledge-traditions and geopolitics. Modelling and technical assessments of geoengineering are facilitated by assumptions of a single global planner (or some as yet unspecified rational governance), but the practicality of international governance remains mostly speculative. Using evidence gathered from state delegates, climate activists and modellers, we reveal three underlying and clashing ‘geofutures’: an idealised understanding of governable geoengineering that abstracts from technical and political realities; a situated understanding of geoengineering emphasising power hierarchies in world order; and a pragmatist precautionary understanding emerging in spaces of negotiation such as UN Environment Assembly (UNEA). Set in the wider historical context of climate politics, the failure to agree even to a study of geoengineering at UNEA indicates underlying obstacles to global rules and institutions for geoengineering posed by divergent interests and underlying epistemic and political differences. Technology assessments should recognise that geoengineering will not be exempt from international fractures; that deployment of geoengineering through imposition is a serious risk; and that contestations over geofutures pertain, not only to climate policy, but also the future of planetary order. © 2021 The Authors.

Despite their importance, wetlands have been lost to different local, regional, and global drivers. Remaining wetlands are extremely sensitive to changing temperature and precipitation regimes. Management of grassland areas in wetland catchments may be an effective strategy for counteracting potentially negative impacts of climate change on wetlands. Our objective was to estimate the effects of climate changes on wetland hydrology, and to explore strategies for increasing surface-water inputs to wetlands. We coupled a field study with process-based simulation modeling of wetland-water levels. We found that climate change could decrease the number of wetlands that hold ponded water during the waterfowl breeding season by 14% under a hot wet scenario or 29% under a hot dry scenario if no upland-management actions were taken. Upland burning reduced pond losses to 9% (hot wet) and 26% (hot dry). Upland grazing resulted in the smallest loss of ponded wetlands, 6% loss under the hot-and-wet scenario and 22% loss under the hot-and-dry scenario. Overall, water inputs could be increased by either burning or grazing of upland vegetation thereby reducing pond losses during the waterfowl breeding season. While field results suggest that both grazing and burning can reduce the vegetative structure that could lead to increases in runoff in grassland catchments, our model simulations indicated that additional actions may be needed for managers to minimize future meteorologically driven water losses. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Climate change; Grassland management; Migratory waterfowl; PHyLiSS; Prairie-pothole wetlands","action plan; agricultural catchment; breeding season; catchment; climate change; climate effect; grassland; grazing; management practice; runoff; vegetation structure; water level; waterfowl; Anatidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099349929

Planning for SLR is a critical step to ensure timely and adequate responses. Despite our rapidly increasing understanding of SLR impacts and the need to adapt, few studies have looked at how countries are planning for SLR. We surveyed experts from the 32 European countries with a coastline about how their country is planning for SLR. Our online survey focused on four areas: (1) whether SLR planning exists and at what level of government; (2) which climate information and scenarios are used in planning; (3) what planning horizons and corresponding levels of SLR are used; and (4) how uncertainty in handled and whether high-end sea level rise is being considered in planning. Additionally, we asked experts to assess the status of sea level rise planning in their country. Our results indicate that most coastal countries in Europe are planning for SLR, but 25% still do not. We find that the planning horizon 2100 is most common and many countries are considering around 1m (adjusted for local conditions) of SLR at that point in time. However, there are significant differences between countries, which may lead to unequal impacts, over time.

On the basis of precise laboratory data, a rich collection of more than 200 familiar and exotic molecules have been identified in the interstellar medium, the vast majority by their unique rotational fingerprint. Despite this large body of work, there is scant evidence in the radio band for the basic building blocks of chemistry on earth - five- and six-membered rings - despite long-standing and sustained efforts during the past 50 years. In contrast, a peculiar structural motif, highly unsaturated carbon in a chainlike arrangement, is instead quite common in space. The recent astronomical detection of cyanobenzene, the simplest aromatic nitrile, in the dark molecular cloud TMC-1, and soon afterward in additional prestellar and possibly protostellar sources, establishes that aromatic chemistry is likely widespread in the earliest stages of star formation. The subsequent discovery of cyanocyclopentadienes and even cyanonaphthalenes in TMC-1 provides further evidence that organic molecules of considerable complexity are readily synthesized in regions with high visual extinction but where the low temperature and pressure are remarkably low. This review focuses on laboratory efforts now underway to understand the rich transition region between linear and planar carbon structures using microwave spectroscopy. We present key features, advantages, and disadvantages of current detection methods, a discussion of the types of molecules found in space and in the laboratory, and approaches under development to identify entirely new species in complex mixtures. Studies focusing on the cyanation of hydrocarbons and the formation of benzene from acyclic precursors are highlighted, as is the role that isotopic studies might play in elucidating the chemical pathways to ring formation. ©",,"Aromatization; Carbon; Clouds; Electric current measurement; Microwave spectroscopy; Molecules; Temperature; Aromatic nitriles; Astronomical detection; Basic building block; Current detection; Interstellar mediums; Six-membered rings; Structural motifs; Transition regions; Synthesis (chemical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104934056

Using data from the European Environment Agency, European Drought Observatory of Joint Research Centre, the pairwise relationship between surface air temperature anomalies, precipitation anomalies, soil moisture index anomalies, and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation anomalies (fAPAR) was evaluated during summer time of 2018, a particularly intense virus outbreak. The empirical results of this study indicate that total precipitation during 2018 was extremely high, nearly 500% above the average. These conditions contributed to the increase of soil moisture index anomaly and fAPAR, creating an ideal microenvironment (wet soils and green pastures) for mosquito breeding. This phenomenon was directly associated with a drastic outbreak of West Nile virus cases in the area, compared with earlier years. Our results indicate how unusually high values of summer precipitation may have contributed (both through direct and indirect ecological channels) to the rapid spread of the West Nile virus in West Attica, causing a significant number of confirmed cases and fatalities.

These blooms impose a major burden on residents (e.g. rotting beached Sargassum, unpleasant odor, toxic gases), the local economy of countries with affected coast lines (e.g. impacting tourism and aquaculture, costs for remediation), and have a significant impact on the environment (e.g. beaches and coastal areas) and local marine wildlife. Here we present a Techno-Economic Analysis to demonstrate how this burden can be turned into an economic, social and environmental asset. The suggested process involves sustainable ship-based harvesting of excess biomass (up to 6.3 MT·year−1) and using hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and established fuel refining processes to deliver renewable liquid fuels. Sea-based harvesting of Sargassum addresses the primary cost impediment for algae-based renewable fuel production, reducing capital and operating costs by 78% and 66% respectively compared with currently modelled land-based microalgae renewable fuel production processes. The modelled approach charts a path to cost competitive renewable fuels that reduce CO2 emissions while mitigating the economic, social and environmental problems caused by these large Sargassum algae blooms. The financial analysis of the process yielded an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) between 2.4% and 28.1% based on the scenarios analyzed. The process could generate up to 8500 bbl of crude oil per day profitably at US$43 bbl−1 (10% IRR), equivalent to 470 ML of diesel or jet fuel per year as well as biofertilizers and recycled nutrients, employ around 200 direct personnel and create up to 1000 indirect jobs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Circular bioeconomy; Hydrothermal liquefaction; Macroalgae; Renewable fuel; Sargassum",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099232924

The research is based on the theoretical position that interpretation of risks and responses of social groups are shaped by frames of cultural knowledge and values, and investigates the influence resident’s values have in shaping the resilience of their community in two coastal regions in Germany and Italy. Information was derived from desk research, semi-structured, narrative interviews, and observation. Specifically, the author was interested in how residents’ views and narratives affected their risk behavior, shaped their needs and which role path dependencies and societal contexts played in the formation of risk knowledge, risk management and action. The author found that values, knowledge and identity highly matter in building community resilience. Moreover, the cases illustrate how past and present societal trajectories shape local and regional responses to climate change and why this concerns political decision makers at all levels, who are aiming to mainstream mitigation and adaptation strategies confronting climate change effects and in turn shaping resilience at local and regional levels. © Copyright © 2021 Martinez.","action; coasts; culture; Europe; knowledge; resilience (enviromnental); risk; values",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105945926

The position and orientation of the electric field with respect to the molecules undergoing charge rearrangement are often crucial to the progress of the reaction. Recently, several molecular (electro)catalysts have been designed to contain spatially positioned charged groups that can engage in specific intramolecular electrostatic interactions. For instance, iron complexes of the tetra(o-N,N,N-trimethylanilinium)porphyrin ligand, which has four cationic groups, have been used to great effect for both CO2 and O2 reduction. Because of the ortho-substitution pattern on the porphyrin ligand, there are four possible atropisomers - such as the αβαβ isomer with trimethylanilinium groups on alternating faces of the porphyrin - and thus four unique electrostatic environments. This study details the synthesis and characterization (1H NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X-ray diffraction, and cyclic voltammetry) of these four metalloporphyrin isomers in both the ferric (FeIII) and ferrous (FeII) forms by using a synthetic route that preserves atropisomeric purity. The atropisomers are different in some respects but show remarkable similarities in others, such as their reduction potentials. This study also shows that the widely-cited literature method used previously to prepare the molecular electrocatalyst for CO2 and O2 reduction yields a mixture of atropisomers rather than a single one, as was previously assumed. These results identify the ways in which intra- and intermolecular electrostatic effects affect both solution and solid-state properties as well underscoring the challenges associated with preparing metalloporphyrins with high atropisomeric purity. ©",,"Carbon dioxide; Cyclic voltammetry; Electric fields; Electrocatalysts; Iron compounds; Isomers; Ligands; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Plants (botany); Porphyrins; Single crystals; Chemical transformations; Electrostatic effect; Electrostatic environments; Position and orientations; Reduction potential; Single crystal x-ray diffraction; Solid-state properties; Synthesis and characterizations; Iodine compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103993322

It is foreseen that bioleaching will play a complementary role in either concentration-as it does in Minera Escondida Ltd. (MEL)-or chloride main leaching plants. In that way, it will be possible to maximize mines with installed solvent-extraction and electrowinning capacities that have not been operative since the depletion of their oxide ores. One of the main obstacles for widening bioleaching technology applications is the lack of knowledge about the key events and the attributes of the technology’s critical events at the industrial level and mainly in ROM copper bioleaching industrial operations. It is relevant to assess the bed environment where the bacteria-mineral interaction occurs to learn about the limiting factors determining the leaching rate. Thus, due to inability to accurately determine in-situ key variables, their indirect assessment was evaluated by quantifying microbial metabolic-associated responses. Several candidate marker genes were selected to represent the predominant components of the microbial community inhabiting the industrial heap and the metabolisms involved in microbial responses to changes in the heap environment that affect the process performance. The microbial community’s predominant components were Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, At. thiooxidans, Leptospirillum ferriphilum, and Sulfobacillus sp. Oxygen reduction, CO2 and N2 fixation/uptake, iron and sulfur oxidation, and response to osmotic stress were the metabolisms selected regarding research results previously reported in the system. After that, qPCR primers for each candidate gene were designed and validated. The expression profile of the selected genes vs. environmental key variables in pure cultures, column-leaching tests, and the industrial bioleaching heap was defined. We presented the results obtained from the industrial validation of the marker genes selected for assessing CO2 and N2 availability, osmotic stress response, as well as ferrous iron and sulfur oxidation activity in the bioleaching heap process of MEL. We demonstrated that molecular markers are useful for assessing limiting factors like nutrients and air supply, and the impact of the quality of recycled solutions. We also learned about the attributes of variables like CO2, ammonium, and sulfate levels that affect the industrial ROM-scale operation. © 2021 by the authors.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the newly developed single particle analysis technique in terms of chemical characterization and source apportionment of ambient aerosols by comparing it with traditional filter-based methods. In this study, an air quality monitoring campaign was conducted over a period of 25 days at an urban area in Yulin city, southern China, by employing both SPAMS and traditional filter-based measurements to establish the performance of SPAMS. It was observed that the chemical characterization of particles based on SPAMS did not agree well with the filter-based analysis. Based on the filter analysis, sulfate was the most abundant component in PM2.5 (23.5%), followed by OC (18.1%), while for single particle analysis (number concentration), EC-containing particles showed the largest contribution to PM2.5 (&gt;40%), followed by OC (15.7%). In terms of source apportionment via positive matrix factorization, six sources were identified by each of the two approaches. Both the approaches showed relatively good agreements for secondary species, traffic, and dust sources; however, discrepancies were noted for industry, fossil fuel, and biomass burning sources. Finally, investigation of diurnal profiles and two specific emission episodes monitored during the Chinese New Year and traffic activities demonstrated the relative advantage of single particle analysis over filter-based methods. Overall, single particle analysis can provide source apportionment with a high time resolution, which is helpful for policy makers to analyze and implement emergency control strategies during air pollution episodes. However, SPAMS performs quantification of number concentration rather than mass concentration and is limited to particles larger than 200 nm, which leads to discrepancies between the two methods.

The elevated levels of PM2.5 exposure concentration in India are related to higher premature mortality. However, health benefits or avoidable premature mortality by reducing PM2.5 concentration is uncertain. Objectives: Here we simulated the health benefits by assuming the achievement of 1) National Ambient Air Quality Standards of India (PM2.5 annual average = 40 μg m−3), 2) National Clean Air Programme policy (30% reduction) and 3) World Health Organization standard (10 μg m−3). Methodology: Using Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program – Community Edition (BenMAP-CE), the health benefits are estimated at national, state and district levels for various health endpoints viz., all-cause, ischaemic heart disease (IHD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer and stroke. PM2.5 data, concentration-response coefficient, population, and baseline incidence rate are specified as input data in BenMAP–CE. Results: At the national level, all-cause health benefits in three simulations range from 0.79 to 2.1 million cases during 2019. Similarly, IHD, COPD, lung cancer, and stroke related health benefits are in the range of 0.28–0.68, 0.17–0.39, 0.01–0.03, and 0.14–0.34 million cases, respectively. State-level estimates showed that Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal are having maximum health benefits whereas north-eastern states are found with lowest estimates. Districts such as Allahabad, Lucknow, Muzaffarpur, Patna, and Sultanpur are estimated to have highest health benefits. States and districts with higher PM2.5 concentration and exposed population are found with maximum health benefits. Among the three simulations, achievement of the World Health Organization standard resulted in highest estimates. Further, the limitations and sensitivity of input parameters used in this study are discussed in detail. Conclusion: Study results highlighted the need for state and district-specific air quality management measures to increase PM2.5 related health benefits. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Avoidable premature mortality; BenMAP-CE; India; PM2.5","Air quality; Air quality standards; Biological organs; Population statistics; Pulmonary diseases; Quality management; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Environmental benefits; Exposure concentration; Fine particulate matter; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); National ambient air quality standards; Response coefficient; World Health Organization; Particles (particulate matter); air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; computer simulation; health impact; mortality; particulate matter; standard (regulation); air pollution control; air quality standard; Article; Bihar; cerebrovascular accident; chronic obstructive lung disease; concentration response; ischemic heart disease; lung cancer; particulate matter 2.5; premature mortality; priority journal; simulation; Uttar Pradesh; West Bengal; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental exposure; India; particulate matter; standard; Allahabad; Bihar; India; Lucknow; Muzaffarpur; Patna; Sultanpur; Uttar Pradesh; West Bengal; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Exposure; India; Particulate Matter; Reference Standards",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094619822

While its aftermath for calcifying microbes has been widely studied, the effect of ocean acidification (OA) on marine viruses and their microbial hosts is controversial, and even more in combination with another anthropogenic stressor, i.e., human-induced nutrient loads. In this study, two mesocosm acidification experiments with Mediterranean waters from different seasons revealed distinct effects of OA on viruses and viral-mediated prokaryotic mortality depending on the trophic state and the successional stage of the plankton community. In the winter bloom situation, low fluorescence viruses, the most abundant virus-like particle (VLP) subpopulation comprising mostly bacteriophages, were negatively affected by lowered pH with nutrient addition, while the bacterial host abundance was stimulated. High fluorescence viruses, containing cyanophages, were stimulated by OA regardless of the nutrient conditions, while cyanobacteria of the genus Synechococcus were negatively affected by OA. Moreover, the abundance of very high fluorescence viruses infecting small haptophytes tended to be lower under acidification while their putative hosts' abundance was enhanced, suggesting a direct and negative effect of OA on viral–host interactions. In the oligotrophic summer situation, we found a stimulating effect of OA on total viral abundance and the viral populations, suggesting a cascading effect of the elevated pCO2 stimulating autotrophic and heterotrophic production. In winter, viral lysis accounted for 30 ± 16% of the loss of bacterial standing stock per day (VMMBSS) under increased pCO2 compared to 53 ± 35% in the control treatments, without effects of nutrient additions while in summer, OA had no significant effects on VMMBSS (35 ± 20% and 38 ± 5% per day in the OA and control treatments, respectively). We found that phage production and resulting organic carbon release rates significantly reduced under OA in the nutrient replete winter situation, but it was also observed that high nutrient loads lowered the negative effect of OA on viral lysis, suggesting an antagonistic interplay between these two major global ocean stressors in the Anthropocene. In summer, however, viral-mediated carbon release rates were lower and not affected by lowered pH. Eutrophication consistently stimulated viral production regardless of the season or initial conditions. Given the relevant role of viruses for marine carbon cycling and the biological carbon pump, these two anthropogenic stressors may modulate carbon fluxes through their effect on viruses at the base of the pelagic food web in a future global change scenario. © Copyright © 2021 Malits, Boras, Balagué, Calvo, Gasol, Marrasé, Pelejero, Pinhassi, Sala and Vaqué.","carbon fluxes; eutrophication; microbial food web; ocean acidification; viral shunt","chlorophyll a; trichloroacetic acid; Article; bacterial growth; bacteriophage; controlled study; cyanobacterium; eutrophication; flow cytometry; fluorescence; food web; inorganic nutrient; lysogenization; microbial activity; microbial food web; microplankton; mortality; nonhuman; ocean acidification; photosynthesis; phytoplankton; picoplankton; Prochlorococcus; spectrophotometry; summer; Synechococcus; virus like agent; virus particle; winter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104965793

The objective of this study was to: (a) examine historical weather data for the Canadian Prairie provinces and determine if there has been a change in the annual accumulation of CHU (ΣCHU), and (b) use updated technology and improved access to weather data to revise ΣCHU maps. Daily temperature data, recorded over the past century at 8,750 weather stations across Canada and consolidated into 1,413 sites were downloaded. There were 466 sites in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. The daily CHU were summed over the growing season for each site by year. The annual growing season for corn in the Prairies increased by 3–12 d over the past century, with greatest increases in southern and western locations. The change coincided with warmer springtime temperatures, allowing for earlier seeding, and warmer autumn temperatures, allowing for delayed harvest. During the past century, ΣCHU increased by 200–400 depending upon location, and the area with ΣCHU suitable for growing corn for silage has more than doubled to 915 thousand km2 (46% of the total area). These results provide tangible proof of climate change and its impacts on the potential for growing corn on the Prairies. The new ΣCHU maps can help farmers select regionally adapted corn hybrids.

In the last decade, spotted-wing drosophila Drosophila suzukii has emerged as an internationally significant agricultural pest as it rapidly spread across Europe and the Americas. However, the underlying drivers of its global invasion remain unstudied, while countries like Australia, presently free from D. suzukii, require robust estimates of spread and establishment potential to aid development of effective preparedness strategies. Here, we analysed the ecoclimatic and human-mediated drivers of the global invasion of D. suzukii to understand historical spread patterns and improve forecasts of future spread potential. Using a modular approach, climate-driven population dynamics were linked in space via dispersal processes to simulate spread at continental scales. Combined with biological parameters measured in laboratory studies, the spread model was parameterized and validated on international spread data. Model accuracy was high and was able to predict 83% of regional presence–absence through time in the United States and, without further model fitting, 78% of the variation in the Europe incursion. Omitting human-assisted spread from the model reduced predictability by over 20%, highlighting the large anthropogenic influence in this modern biological invasion. Economic activity (GDP) rather than human population density was more strongly associated with human-mediated spread. Simulations predicted that eastern Australian coastal regions, particularly those near major cities with high economic activity, will result in the fastest spread of D. suzukii. Synthesis and applications. Incursions of Drosophila suzukii into Australia will have significant consequences for horticultural industries with the predicted speed of spread making eradication programs extremely difficult.

The apparent quantum efficiency of the optimized sample is 4.47% at 420 nm, and the CO2 to CO selectivity reaches up to â 95%. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of 3DF Ag-CeO2-ZnO can be assigned to the prolonged absorption in the visible light region induced by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect, the efficient separation of photogenerated charges, and the Z-scheme configuration. Furthermore, the photocatalyst displays excellent stability and reusability.

Anode materials and their morphological structures play a crucial role in the formation of electroactive biofilms that enable the direct electron transfer. In this work, modified electrodes with nanomaterials, such as multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), Al2O3/rGO or MnO2/MWCNTs nanocomposites were synthesized, characterized and utilized to support the growth of electrochemically active biofilms. The MFC's performance is optimized using anode-respiring strains isolated from biofilm-anode surface, while the adjusted operation is conducted with the consortium of (Enterobacter sp.). Besides the formation of matured biofilm on its surface, MnO2/MWCNTs nanocomposite produced the highest electrical potential outputs (710 mV) combined with the highest power density (372 mW/m2). Thus, a correlation between the anode nanostructured materials and the progression of the electrochemically active biofilms formation is presented, allowing new thoughts for enhancing the MFC's performance for potential applications ranging from wastewater treatment to power sources.

An emerging method to reduce adverse effects of the growing three-wheeler fleet is hybrid-electric technology. The overall efficiency of a hybrid electric vehicle heavily depends on the power management strategy used in controlling the main powertrain components of the vehicle. Recent studies highlight the need for a comprehensive report on developing an easy-to-implement and efficient control strategy for hybrid electric three-wheelers. Thus, in the present study, a design methodology for a rule-based supervisory controller of a pre-transmission parallel hybrid three-wheeler based on an optimal control strategy (i.e., dynamic programming) is proposed. The optimal control problem for minimizing fuel, emissions (i.e., HC, CO and NOx) and gear shift frequency are solved using dynamic programming (DP). Numerical issues of DP are analyzed and trade-offs between optimizing objectives are presented. Since DP strategy cannot be implemented as a real-time controller, useful strategies are extracted to develop the proposed rule-based strategy. The developed rule-based strategy show performance within 10% of the DP results on WLTC and UDC-NEDC drive cycles and has the clear advantage of being near-optimal, easy-to-implement and computationally less demanding. © 2021 by the authors.

To meet this goal, the international community will have to aggressively reduce emissions and also remove CO2 from the atmosphere on an unprecedented scale, through an array of biological and technical Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) options. This paper considers governance challenges that arise from the need to rely on CDR to meet the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal. It looks at how heavy this reliance may have to be, over what timeframe, involving what options and, crucially, how best to ensure that CDR does not, while trying to address one problem, create many other challenges for sustainable development. After identifying the potential scale and pace of CO2 removal needed to meet the 1.5°C goal, we identify key governance gaps and challenges that arise from large-scale CDR implementation and propose a series of policy responses to be addressed by policy makers as a matter of priority, to enable CDR to contribute to 1.5°C-consistent pathways at the scale and pace required. © 2021 Durham University and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104990525

This paper explores how a recent shift towards bond-based funding mechanisms offer an opportunity to integrate green building practices, and influence regional social, environmental and economic outcomes. A novel system dynamics model is developed to forecast a business as usual (BAU) and green-building scenario framed around the recently introduced Australian Affordable Housing Bond Aggregator (AHBA) policy framework. The purpose of the model is to examine how a mandate on green building standards together with the use of green versus conventional bonds impact social, environmental and economic outcomes of the framework over a 20-year horizon, within the South East Queensland metropolitan area of Australia. The study determined that the green building framework would deliver 2.37% less housing overall due to higher initial capital costs. However, offers substantial long-term energy and water efficiency benefits, improved affordability for tenants due to reduced utility costs, deferred water and energy infrastructure benefits, and considerable contributions towards Australia's carbon emission reduction targets. Tenants are expected to benefit from a 45–59% reduction in energy and a 27% decrease in water bills. Moreover, a shift to affordable green building policy could contribute to 2.9% of Australia's Conference of Parties (2030) carbon emissions reduction target if applied nationally. The study concludes with a sensitivity analysis to reveal policy refinement recommendations that would yield the benefits of green affordable housing without sacrificing the small reduction in housing stock delivered by the proposed program. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Affordable-housing policy; Green bonds; Green building; Sustainable development; System dynamics","Building codes; Carbon; Costs; Emission control; Housing; Reduction; Sensitivity analysis; Affordable housing; Affordable housing policies; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon emissions reductions; Conference of parties; Funding mechanisms; Green building standards; System dynamics model; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100691197

In this regard, hovering unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) represent an emerging technology. The study herein provides guidance for optimized atmospheric sampling by hovering copter-type UAVs. Large-eddy simulations are conducted for species having chemical lifetimes ranging from reactive (i.e., 102 s) to long-lived (i.e., 108 s). The case study of fair-weather conditions over an equatorial tropical forest is used because of previous UAV deployments in this region. A framework is developed of influence length and horizontal shift of upwind surface emissions. The framework quantifies the length scale of the contribution of upwind forest emissions to species concentrations sampled by the downwind hovering UAV. Main findings include the following: (1) sampling within an altitude that is no more than 200 m above the canopy is recommended for both high- and intermediate-reactivity species because of the strong decrease in species concentration even in a highly turbulent atmosphere; (2) sampling durations of at least 5 and 10 min are recommended for intermediate- and high-reactivity species, respectively, because of the effects of atmospheric turbulence; and (3) in the case of heterogeneity of emissions across the underlying landscape, maximum recommended altitudes are presented for horizontal sampling strategies that can resolve the variability in the landscape emissions. The coupled effects of emission rate, wind speed, species lifetime, turbulence, and UAV sampling duration on influence length must all be considered for optimized and representative sampling over forests. © 2021.

Ultrathin 2D materials with tunable electronic structure display great potential towards photocatalytic CO2 reduction. However, the photocatalytic performance still remains unsatisfied due to high activation energy of CO2 molecules on catalytic sites. To this end, surface vacancy engineering can endow coordinately unsaturated sites as actively catalytic sites for CO2 molecules chemisorption and activation. In this review, we focus on vacancy-engineered ultrathin materials for CO2 photoreduction. Different vacancies with classified anion vacancies, cation vacancies, vacancy pairs, voids, and their corresponding role in CO2 photoreduction are proposed. The different strategies based on vacancy engineering, including direct modulation of vacancy concentrations, refining vacancy states by heteroatom, and vacancy-engineered heterostructure, are presented. Finally, the future developments and their associated challenges concerning defective ultrathin 2D materials are discussed. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","CO2 reduction; photocatalysis; ultrathin 2D materials; vacancy engineering","Activation energy; Electronic structure; Hydrocarbon refining; Molecules; Cation vacancies; Direct modulation; High activation energy; Large-scale applications; Photocatalytic performance; Surface vacancies; Vacancy concentration; Vacancy engineering; Carbon dioxide",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101495017

However, since there are differences among studies in terms of selected climate variables and timescales used to calculate drought indices, there is uncertainty regarding the magnitude and direction of the dryness/wetness, trend even for the same region. We used 40 years weather station data (1970–2010) and studied the uncertainties of dryness/wetness trends in conterminous China. The effects of selected climate variables, timescales and their interaction on the dryness/wetness trends were quantified by comparing the Standardized Precipitation Index, Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) with the Thornthwaite equation and SPEI with the Penman–Monteith equation at 3-, 12- and 24-month timescales. The results indicated that (a) higher uncertainties occurred in relatively arid and humid regions; (b) timescale tended to exaggerate the effect of climate variables, even though its effect was substantially lower than climate variables; (c) relative humidity and precipitation were the primary climate variables affecting observed dryness/wetness trend uncertainties. Since the key climate variables changed depending on the selected timescale, the role of timescale should be further examined the Inner Mongolia and Northeast regions. In general, the study results suggest that the trend analysis of dryness/wetness should include the interaction of both climate variable and timescale selection, particularly when a single drought index is used to estimate the dryness/wetness trend in diverse regions. © 2021 Royal Meteorological Society","climate variables; drought indices; dryness/wetness trend; timescale; uncertainty","Drought; Extreme weather; Climate variables; Drought indices; Extreme climates; Inner Mongolia; Northeast regions; Standardized precipitation index; Trend analysis; Weather stations; Uncertainty analysis; climate change; drought; Penman-Monteith equation; timescale; trend analysis; uncertainty analysis; wetting-drying cycle; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099991052

However, the merger product of binary NS remains an open question. An X-ray plateau followed by a steep decay (“internal plateau”) has been found in some short GRBs, implying that a supramassive magnetar operates as the merger remnant and then collapses into a newborn black hole (BH) at the end of the plateau. X-ray bump or second plateau following the “internal plateau” are considered as the expected signature from the fallback accretion onto this newborn BH through the Blandford–Znajek mechanism (BZ). At the same time, a nearly isotropic wind driven by the Blandford–Payne mechanism (BP) from the newborn BH’s disk can produce a bright kilonova. Therefore, the bright kilonova observation for a short GRB with “internal plateau” (and followed by X-ray bump or second plateau) provides further evidence for this scenario. In this paper, we find that GRB 160821B is a candidate of such a case, and the kilonova emission of GRB 160821B is possibly powered by the BP wind from a newborn BH. Future GW detection of GRB 160821B–like events may provide further support to this scenario, enable us to investigate the properties of the magnetar and the newborn BH, and constrain the equation of state of neutron stars. © 2021.

O2 concentration plays a key role in AME-D, yet little is understood about how it impacts microbial interactions. Here, we applied isotopically labeled K15NO3 and 13CH4 and metagenomic analyses to investigate the metabolic and microbial link of AME-D at different O2 levels. Among the four experimental O2 levels of 21%,10%, 5% and 2.5% and a CH4 concentration of 8% (i.e., the O2/CH4 ratios of 2.62, 1.26, 0.63 and 0.31), the highest NO3−-N removal occurred in the AME-D system incubated at the O2 concentration of 10%. Methanol and acetate may serve as the trophic linkage between aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifers in the AME-D systems. Methylotrophs including Methylophilus, Methylovorus, Methyloversatilis and Methylotenera were abundant under the O2-sufficient condition with the O2 concentration of 21%, while denitrifiers such as Azoarcus, Thauera and Thiobacillus dominated in the O2-limited environment with the O2 concentration of 10%. The competition of denitrifiers and methylotrophs in the AME-D system for CH4-derived carbon, such as methanol and acetate, might be influenced by chemotactic responses. More methane-derived carbon flowed into methylotrophs under the O2-sufficient condition, while more methane-derived carbon was used for denitrification in the O2-limited environment. These findings can aid in evaluating the distribution and contribution of AME-D and in developing strategies for mitigating CH4 emission and nitrogen pollution in natural and engineered ecosystems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aerobic CH4 oxidation coupled to denitrification; Aerobic methanotrophs; Denitrifers; Metagenomic analyses; O2 concentration","Carbon; Ecosystems; Metabolism; Methane; Methanol; Nitrogen; River pollution; Chemotactic response; Developing strategy; Isotopically labeled; Metagenomic analysis; Methane oxidation; Microbial interactions; Nitrogen pollution; Research interests; Denitrification; acetic acid; carbon 13; citric acid; formaldehyde; methane; methanol; nitrogen 15; oxygen; bioremediation; concentration (composition); denitrification; emission control; genomics; metabolism; methane; microbial activity; nitrifying bacterium; oxic conditions; oxidation; stable isotope; Article; Azoarcus; carbon source; controlled study; denitrification; isotope labeling; metagenomics; Methylophilus; Methylotenera; methylotroph; Methyloversatilis; Methylovorus; microbial community; nonhuman; oxidation; priority journal; Thauera; Thiobacillus; ecosystem; metagenomics; oxidation reduction reaction; Azoarcus; Methylophilus; Methylotenera; Methylovorus; Thauera; Thiobacillus; Denitrification; Ecosystem; Metagenomics; Methane; Oxidation-Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093656723

Here, we updated and expanded a high-resolution forest carbon modelling approach previously developed for the state of Maryland to 11 states in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) domain, which includes Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont. In this study, we employ an updated version of the Ecosystem Demography (ED) model, an improved lidar initialization strategy, and an expanded calibration/validation approach. High resolution (90 m) wall-to-wall maps of present aboveground carbon, aboveground carbon sequestration potential, aboveground carbon sequestration potential gap (CSPG), and time to reach sequestration potential were produced over the RGGI domain where airborne lidar data were available, including 100% of eight states, 62% of Maine, 12% of New Jersey, and 0.65% of New York. For the eight states with complete data, an area of 228 552 km2, the contemporary forest aboveground carbon stock is estimated to be 1134 Tg C, and the forest aboveground CSPG is estimated to be larger at >1770 Tg C. Importantly, these estimates of the potential for added aboveground carbon sequestration in forests are spatially resolved, are further partitioned between continued growth of existing trees and new afforested/reforested areas, and include time estimates for realization. They are also assessed for sensitivity to potential changes in vegetation productivity and disturbance rate in response to climate change.

Results show that (1) low-carbon city pilot policies stimulates the green technological innovation of enterprises as manifested in their application of green invention patents; (2) the introduction of pilot policies is highly conducive to green technological innovation in eastern cities and enterprises in high-carbon emission industries; and (3) tax incentives and government subsidies are important fiscal and taxation tools that play the role of pilot policies in low-carbon cities.

The presence of heavy metals in mangrove wetlands can influence soil microbial communities with implications for decomposition of soil organic matter and emission of greenhouse gases. In this study, field monitoring and a microcosm experiment were conducted to examine the impacts of heavy metal pollution on soil microbial communities and greenhouse gas fluxes. The results show that heavy metal pollution decreased the richness and diversity of the overall soil microbial functional groups (heterotrophs and lithotrophs); however, it did not inhibit the activities of the methanogenic communities, possibly due to their stronger tolerance to heavy metal toxicity compared to the broader soil microbial communities. Consequently, the presence of heavy metals in the mangrove soils significantly increased the emission of CH4 while the emission of CO2 as a proxy of soil microbial respiration was decreased. The soil organic carbon content could also buffer the effect of heavy metal pollution and influence CO2 emissions due to reduced toxicity to microbes. The findings have implications for understanding the complication of greenhouse gas emissions by heavy metal pollution in mangrove wetlands. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Greenhouse gas emission; Heavy metal pollution; Mangrove wetland; Methanogenic communities; Soil organic carbon","Carbon dioxide; Forestry; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Heavy metals; Inclusions; Microorganisms; Organic carbon; Soils; Toxicity; Wetlands; Greenhouse gas fluxes; Heavy metal pollution; Heavy metal toxicity; Methanogenic community; Microcosm experiments; Soil microbial community; Soil microbial respiration; Soil organic carbon content; Soil pollution; carbon dioxide; heavy metal; methane; organic carbon; carbon; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; antimicrobial activity; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; field method; functional group; global warming; heavy metal; mangrove; methane; methanogenic bacterium; microbial activity; microbial community; microcosm; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; species diversity; species richness; wetland; carbon footprint; controlled study; field study; greenhouse gas; heavy metal poisoning; heterotroph; lithotroph; mangrove; methanogenic bacterium; microbial community; microbial diversity; microbial respiration; microcosm; nonhuman; soil microflora; soil pollution; species richness; wetland; environmental monitoring; microbiology; soil; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Monitoring; Metals, Heavy; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094597152

Nutrients stoichiometry patterns across various plant organs can reflect the plants' trade-offs to obtain resources and their growth strategy. However, it is still unclear how these nutrients are allocated among desert plant organs and how they are related to the arid climate conditions. This study aimed to examine how plant N and P stoichiometry varies among the organs of desert plants, and how they respond to climate and soil factors. Therefore, we analyzed N and P stoichiometry of leaves, stems, and roots collected from 29 desert sites in Xinjiang, China, to achieve this goal. Our studies indicated that the mean N and P concentrations in the stems (17.5 ± 0.2 and 1.0 ± 0.02 mg g−1, respectively) and roots (10.3 ± 0.2 and 0.7 ± 0.01 mg g−1, respectively) were significantly lower than those in leaves (21.4 ± 0.3 and 1.2 ± 0.02 mg g−1, respectively); the N:P ratio in stems (19.1 ± 0.3) was significantly higher than those in roots (17.6 ± 0.4), but N:P in leaves (18.2 ± 0.3) was not significantly different from those in stems and roots. Across plant life forms, N and N:P of both leaves and roots were respectively higher in shrubs than those in trees and herbs, P in three organs were significantly lower in trees than those in shrubs and herbs. Moreover, our results demonstrated that most soil factors had direct influences on N and P stoichiometry among different organs, and climate factors had indirect effect on N and P stoichiometry by affecting soil factors. This study provided the N and P stoichiometric characteristics of desert plant organs and explored their relationships with environmental variables, which can help understand nutrient stoichiometry patterns and utilization strategy of N and P and their potential responses to global climate changes in the desert ecosystems of central Asia. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Arid region; Climate factors; Desert ecosystem; Edaphic factors; Nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometry; Plant organs","climate change; global climate; leaf; nitrogen; phosphorus; stem; stoichiometry; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098196463

Despite of discussions on different accounting approaches, the forest-based sector can contribute with the production of long-lasting wood products to reach international climate goals. This leads to high demands on forests and on what they can deliver both at EU and the national levels. In Austria it has been bemoaned by the Environmental Agency in its recent –eleventh- control report, that a comprehensive concept for the use of wood is missing. The report asks for consideration of increasing future needs for raw wood and energy under considerations of sustainability and under inclusion of all actors involved. Apparently there are some disparities within the different policy instruments. In order to successfully concertise the national policy framework it is of paramount importance to gather the policy actors involved and examine their suggestions for solving the issue. The article is enquiring amongst a number of high level Austrian experts and stakeholders about their perspectives and solutions for enhancing the contribution of the forest based sector to combat climate change. We examine the nature of the suggested instruments and outline the perceived options for action within the capacities of the forest based sector. This is done by way of a triangulation of face-to-face qualitative interviews, moderated focus group discussions and one survey. For the increase in carbon efficiency, all the participants notably emphasise long lasting material use and increase in use. Yet the opinions are contradicting when it comes to energetic use. Our findings indicate that the expert views reflect diverging perspectives on the use of wood for energy consumption. Some opt for policies that support energy consumption of wooden biomass to replace fossil fuels, others want any energy use of wood to become restricted drastically. As a final result, the article derives 16 principle policy measures and instruments that were brought up and assessed by the stakeholders in several rounds of interaction. We conclude that small improvements to existing measures could have ample impacts. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Expert opinion; Forest based sector; Greenhouse gas emissions; Policy recommendations; Policy stakeholders; Triangulation; Wood use","Carbon; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Forestry; Fossil fuels; Sustainable development; Wood fuels; Wood products; Carbon efficiency; Environmental agency; Harvested wood products; National policy framework; Policy instruments; Policy measures; Qualitative interviews; State of research; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100084119

Learning more about how and why different post-fire management strategies regulate the ability of forest ecosystem properties (e.g. plant diversity and function) to simultaneously recover after wildfire and provide multiple ecosystem functions is of critical importance. This study aims to evaluate how unburned, burned managed and burned unmanaged plots regulate the responses of multiple forest ecosystem properties (e.g. plant diversity, nutrient cycling, soil carbon stocks, water regulation, decomposition and wood production) and overall multifunctionality to wildfires. In September 2017, we selected two post-fire management strategies in a 3-km2 watershed previously affected by a wildfire in July 2012: contour-felled log debris (CFD), log erosion barriers area (LEB), and also unburned and unmanaged plots (BNA). We randomly distributed 12 plots among the three post-fire management strategies (three plots per treatment) and unburned. The results showed that multiple forest ecosystem properties were significantly affected by wildfire and that specific post-fire management treatment (e.g. LEB and CFD) can be used to efficiently support plant diversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results revealed that the general indicators of ecosystem functions decreased in Mediterranean forests after wildfires and post-fire management strategies (LEB and CFD) significantly helped to recover the ecosystems’ short-term community-level properties and ecosystem functions (5 years after a wildfire event) to pre-fire levels. Synthesis and applications. These findings demonstrate that multiple ecosystem functions are affected by wildfires in Mediterranean forests and show that post-fire management treatments can promote multifunctionality and plant diversity. Our results unfold the potential of log erosion barriers (LEB) and contour-felled log debris (CFD) as effective strategies for recovering community-level properties and forest functions in the short term. © 2021 British Ecological Society","forest; multifunctionality; multiple ecosystem functions; post-fire management; soil enzymatic activity; soil nutrients; wildfires","ecosystem function; fire management; forest ecosystem; global change; soil carbon; species diversity; watershed; wildfire; wood quality; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099474668

The therapy of acute stress ulcers has always been an important challenge. Carbon dots (CDs) have been reported to show excellent biological activities, but research on the stress ulcer curative effect of CDs is unprecedented. Here, we prepared a series of semi-carbonized nanodots (SCNDs) from natural plants or herbs as precursors and the as prepared SCNDs were later proved to be effective in the treatment and inhibition of stress gastric ulcers in a rat model. One kind of SCND from edible and medicinal plants, charred Atractylodes macrocephala (SCNDs-1), is demonstrated in detail for its strong anti-stress gastric ulcer effect with inhibition up to 90% and shows extremely high biocompatibility and ultra-low toxicity. These SCNDs lead to the reduction of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress, and the protection of the gastric mucosa. The SCNDs also reduce the excessive neuroendocrine response caused by stress, regulate the energy metabolism and the structure of intestinal flora, improve the damage to the body caused by the stress state, thus alleviating the occurrence of stress-induced gastric ulcers. This work provides new insights into the preparation of carbon nanomaterials from natural plants through a semi-carbonization process and opens new ways to apply bio-active and bio-safe SCNDs in the modern pharmaceutical field. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Biocompatibility; Carbon; Carbonization; Metabolism; Nanodots; Carbon nano-materials; Carbonization process; Curative effects; Energy metabolism; Intestinal flora; Medicinal plants; Pharmaceutical fields; Stress-induced; Diseases; animal; medicinal plant; metabolism; oxidative stress; rat; stomach mucosa; stomach ulcer; Animals; Gastric Mucosa; Oxidative Stress; Plants, Medicinal; Rats; Stomach Ulcer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104231524

With the recent implementation of first-level public health emergency response (FLPHER) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in China (a total of 77 041 confirmed cases by February 22, 2020), human activities were extremely decreased nationwide and almost all economic activities were suspended. Here, we show that this scenario represents an unprecedented ""base period""to probe the short-term emission control effect of air pollution at a city level. We quantify the FLPHER-induced changes of NO2, SO2, PM2.5, and PM10 levels in 174 cities in China. A machine learning prediction model for air pollution is established by coupling a generalized additive model, random effects meta-analysis, and weather research and forecasting model with chemistry analysis. The short-term control effect under the current energy structure in each city is estimated by comparing the predicted and observed results during the FLPHER period. We found that the short-term emission control effect ranges within 53.0%-98.3% for all cities, and southern cities show a significantly stronger effect than northern cities (P < 0.01). Compared with megacities, small-medium cities show a similar control effect on NO2 and SO2 but a larger effect on PM2.5 and PM10. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","air pollution; COVID-19; emission reduction; machine learning; public health emergency","Chemical analysis; Economics; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Predictive analytics; Random processes; Sulfur dioxide; Turing machines; Weather forecasting; Air pollutant emission; Chemistry analysis; Economic activities; Generalized additive model; Health emergencies; Human activities; Prediction model; Weather research and forecasting models; Air pollution; nitric oxide; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; economic activity; emission control; machine learning; megacity; meta-analysis; pollution control; public health; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; China; city; clinical article; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental temperature; forecasting; human; humidity; lockdown; machine learning; meteorological phenomena; meteorology; minimum concentration; pandemic; particulate matter 2.5; weather; air pollution; communicable disease control; meta analysis; particulate matter; prevention and control; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103993614

To evaluate the reduction of PM2.5 concentration in the YRD region by the epidemic lockdown policy, this study employs big data, including PM2.5 observations and 29 independent variables regarding Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), climate, terrain, population, road density, and Gaode map Point of interesting (POI) data, to build regression models and retrieve spatially continuous distributions of PM2.5 during COVID-19. Simulation accuracy of multiple machine learning regression models, i.e., random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and artificial neural network (ANN) were compared. The results showed that the RF model outperformed the SVR and ANN models in the inversion of PM2.5 in the YRD region, with the model-fitting and cross-validation coefficients of determination R2 reached 0.917 and 0.691, mean absolute error (MAE) values were 1.026 µg m−3 and 2.353 µg m−3, and root mean square error (RMSE) values were 1.413 µg m−3, and 3.144 µg m−3, re-spectively. PM2.5 concentrations during COVID-19 in 2020 have decreased by 3.61 µg m−3 compared to that during the same period of 2019 in the YRD region.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has suggested that large-scale biosequestration in the form of forest restoration or tree plantation establishment is a potential form of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) that could contribute significantly to climate change mitigation. Yet it has also cautioned that this approach has social and environmental trade-offs that need to be addressed through enhanced land governance. Land governance, per definition, has a strong local dimension as most lands are inhabited by local communities. Glocal and other multi-scale governance approaches have been proposed to address potential conflicts between global policies and the rights, needs and priorities of local communities. Yet these approaches often overlook the power imbalances between the actors that design global climate policies and the local, often politically and economically marginalized, indigenous and other forest-dependent communities that are directly impacted by these policies. The paper will explore to what extent theoretical concepts like rights-based approaches have been able to address these conflicts and power imbalances, and whether more profound changes in governance systems are required to ensure equitable implementation of CDR. © 2020 Durham University and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104942201

The capability of forests to act as carbon sinks makes them a key resource to reduce CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. However, carbon which has been fixed can be suddenly emitted again as a consequence of disturbances such as pests or wildfires. Mediterranean plant phenology, climatic conditions, and the accumulation of fuel biomass due to abandonment of traditional forest uses generate a scenario prone to large wildfires and consequently large greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. The abandonment could be offset by considering the economic value of forest ecosystem services, principally carbon fixation. Nevertheless, currently existing forest carbon markets consider only anthropogenic fixation based on a business as usual scenario without disturbances that cannot be applied to Mediterranean forest reality. Thus, a methodology to monetize carbon fixed has been developed and applied. A range between 55.5 and 250 million € produced by the monetization of 16.5 million potential carbon credits has been obtained based on anthropogenic avoided emissions produced over a 10 year‐period. Thereby, the potential for offsetting emissions of the pilot region was between 1.2% and 5.6% of total diffuse GHG emissions. Consequently, sustainable forest management represents an important opportunity to combat climate change, taking advantage of the margin of improvement that the Mediterranean forests currently have to avoid GHG emissions through forest fire prevention silviculture. © 2021 by the authors.

Designing effective ocean observing systems therefore warrants deliberate, quantitative strategies. We leverage adjoint modeling and Hessian uncertainty quantification (UQ) within the ECCO (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean) framework to explore a new design strategy for ocean climate observing systems. Within this context, an observing system is optimal if it minimizes uncertainty in a set of investigator-defined quantities of interest (QoIs), such as oceanic transports or other key climate indices. We show that Hessian UQ unifies three design concepts. (1) An observing system reduces uncertainty in a target QoI most effectively when it is sensitive to the same dynamical controls as the QoI. The dynamical controls are exposed by the Hessian eigenvector patterns of the model-data misfit function. (2) Orthogonality of the Hessian eigenvectors rigorously accounts for redundancy between distinct members of the observing system. (3) The Hessian eigenvalues determine the overall effectiveness of the observing system, and are controlled by the sensitivity-to-noise ratio of the observational assets (analogous to the statistical signal-to-noise ratio). We illustrate Hessian UQ and its three underlying concepts in a North Atlantic case study. Sea surface temperature observations inform mainly local air-sea fluxes. In contrast, subsurface temperature observations reduce uncertainty over basin-wide scales, and can therefore inform transport QoIs at great distances. This research provides insight into the design of effective observing systems that maximally inform the target QoIs, while being complementary to the existing observational database. © 2021.

This study explores how the presentation of fuel economy information can influence valuation using a stated choice experiment with comparative experimental conditions. We randomly assigned a nationally representative sample of 1,612 intended vehicle purchasers in the United States to one of six conditions, which varied in their presentation of fuel economy information as follows: miles per gallon, annual fuel costs, five-year fuel cost, lifetime fuel cost, amount of money saved/spent over five years compared to the average vehicle per class, and the full government-mandated fuel economy label (in the US). We find that consumer valuation of fuel economy is causally impacted by the information presented. In particular, we observe significantly higher willingness-to-pay values for participants in the condition with the full fuel economy label, relative to conditions only presented with the annual fuel cost, five-year fuel cost, and spend/save comparison. Valuation also varied with the demographic characteristics of participants: fuel economy was more highly valued among older participants and those that anticipated a relatively lower purchase price for their next vehicle. This study suggests that the observed inconsistencies in consumer valuation of fuel economy in the literature may stem in part from differences in the framing of fuel economy information across studies – at least for stated preference studies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate policy; Consumer survey; Fuel economy; Stated choice experiment; Willingness-to-pay","Economic and social effects; Economics; Fuels; Choice experiments; Consumer valuations; Demographic characteristics; Experimental conditions; Fuel economy labels; Representative sample; Stated choice experiments; Stated-preference studies; Fuel economy; discrete choice analysis; environmental policy; fuel consumption; questionnaire survey; savings; transportation economics; valuation; willingness to pay; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101612081

Land use strategies were widely proposed, but the spillover effects on biological flow are rarely explored. Here, we simultaneously assessed the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and cropland footprints of China's pig production at the provincial scale in 2017. The environmental impacts of land use strategies were further evaluated. Results show that one kg live-weight pig production generated an average of 1.9 kg CO2-equiv and 59 g Nr emissions, occupying 3.5 m2 cropland, with large regional variations. A large reduction in GHG (58-64%) and Nr (12-14%) losses and occupied cropland (10-11%) could be achieved simultaneously if combined strategies of intensive crop production, improved feed-protein utilization efficiency, and feeding co-products were implemented. However, adopting a single strategy may have environmental side-effects. Reallocating cropland that pigs used for feed to plant food alternatives would enhance human-edible energy (3-20 times) and protein delivery (1-5 times) and reduce C and N footprints, except for rice and vegetables. Reallocating cropland to beef and milk production would decrease energy and protein supply. Therefore, a proper combination of land use strategies is essential to alleviate land use changes and nutrient emissions without sacrificing food supply. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Cultivation; Environmental impact; Food supply; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Mammals; Nitrogen; Proteins; Environmental footprints; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Land-use strategies; Nutrient emissions; Reactive nitrogen; Regional variation; Spillover effects; Utilization efficiency; Land use; carbon; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; nitrogen derivative; nitrogen; detection method; land use change; livestock; livestock farming; strategic approach; Article; calculation; carbon footprint; catering service; crop production; cropland; environmental factor; environmental impact; exhaust gas; fodder crop; food processing; greenhouse gas; land use; leaching; life cycle assessment; manure; nonhuman; opportunity cost; pig farming; plant; vegetable; animal; bovine; China; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; pig; China; Animals; Carbon Footprint; Cattle; China; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Nitrogen; Swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104926601

The impacts of climate change are especially tangible in dense urban areas due to the inherent characteristics of urban structure and materiality. To assess impacts of densification on urban climate and potential adaptation strategies a densely populated Viennese district was modeled as a typical sample area for the city of Vienna. The case study analyzed the large-scale densification potential and its potential effects on microclimate, air flow, comfort, and energy demand by developing 3D models of the area showing the base case and densification scenarios. Three methods were deployed to assess the impact of urban densification: Micro-climate analysis (1) explored urban heat island phenomena, wind pattern analysis (2) investigated ventilation and wind comfort at street level, and energy and indoor climate comfort analysis (3) compared construction types and greening scenarios and analyzed their impact on the energy demand and indoor temperatures. Densification has negative impacts on urban microclimates because of reducing wind speeds and thus weakening ventilation of street canyons, as well as accelerating heat island effects and associated impact on the buildings. However, densification also has daytime cooling effects because of larger shaded areas. On buildings, densification may have negative effects especially in the new upper, sun-exposed floors. Construction material has less impact than glazing area and rooftop greening. Regarding adaptation to climate change, the impacts of street greening, green facades, and green roofs were simulated: The 24-h average mean radiant temperature (MRT) at street level can be reduced by up to 15 K during daytime. At night there is only a slight reduction by a few tenths of 1 K MRT. Green facades have a similar effect on MRT reduction, while green roofs show only a slight reduction by a few tenths of 1 K MRT on street level. The results show that if appropriate measures were applied, negative effects of densification could be reduced, and positive effects could be achieved. © 2021 by the authors.

This model can discriminate desirable and undesirable outputs and solve the problem of total CO 2 emission amount control. Then, we add the equity principle to the constraint conditions, namely, the proportion of carbon emission allowance approaching the proportion of GDP. Finally, we establish a CO 2 emission allocation scheme based on the equity-efficiency tradeoff while considering the relationship between economic development and carbon emissions as well as achieving maximum efficiency.

Second, the periodic air temperature, heat radiation, and heat conduction were computed every half hour under a cloudless sky on a summer day, i.e., the worst-case climate conditions. The transient structural temperatures were then analyzed over a period of several days of sunshine with a rational initial structural-temperature distribution until the whole set of structural temperatures converged to the results obtained the day before. As a result, the temporal and spatial characteristics of the temperature distribution for the radio telescope were statistically investigated. Furthermore, the phenomenon called the solar cooker effect was found to exist in such a Cassegrain reflector system.

Despite the extensive studies conducted in this region, there are insufficient data on the chemical composition, formation mechanism, potential sources, and regional transport contribution of PM2.5 in Zhangjiakou, Hebei province. In this study, the chemical and spatiotemporal variation in PM2.5 in Zhangjiakou were investigated at four urban sites in Zhangjiakou in 2019. The mean (± standard deviation, SD) observed PM2.5 concentration was 43.0 ± 34.2 μg/m3. The concentrations of PM2.5 and its major components were generally higher in the south than in the north, and in winter than in summer. The major chemical components were organic matter (OM, 31.8%), secondary inorganic ions (SIA, 25.7%), and mineral dust (14.7%). Higher NO3−/EC, SO42−/EC, sulphur oxidation ratios (SOR), and nitrogen oxidation ratios (NOR) were observed on pollution days, implying intense secondary production of nitrate during pollution periods. Heterogeneous reactions were important contributors to secondary sulphate formation. Secondary organic carbon (SOC) proportions (i.e., SOC/OC and SOC/EC ratios) decreased markedly from clean days to heavy pollution days in response to enhanced primary organic carbon (POC) emissions on pollution days. The source contributions varied among sites, seasons, and pollution levels according to positive matrix factorization (PMF) model; combustion and SIA sources were the key factors for air pollutant emission reduction. Small-scale and short-distance air mass transport from the northwestern and southern regions greatly impacted PM2.5 pollution according to potential source analysis. Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF) was coupled with Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx), and found that regional transport contributed significantly to PM2.5 pollution in Zhangjiakou (74.6%). The results of this study indicate that joint prevention and control of regional air pollution would meaningfully improve air quality in the BTH region. © 2021","Chemical components; Formation mechanisms; PM2.5 pollution; Source apportionment; Transport contribution",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106468417

Here, the biogeochemistry of inorganic carbon in an intertidal aquifer and related SGD-derived fluxes into Tolo Harbor, Hong Kong was investigated over tidal and seasonal time scales. The results revealed the production of total alkalinity (TAlk) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the intertidal aquifer over the entire salinity range. The locally produced TAlk and DIC in the intertidal aquifer contributed to &gt;50% of the TAlk and DIC discharged with SGD to the ocean. The distributions of TAlk and DIC in the transition (mangrove) and high salinity (bare beach) zones were different due to the distinct hydrogeological and geochemical conditions. In the organic-rich mangrove zone, TAlk and DIC productions were driven by biotic processes such as aerobic respiration, denitrification, and sulfate reduction. In the organic-poor bare beach zone, TAlk and DIC productions were likely driven by abiotic processes such as precipitation/dissolution of carbonate minerals. Temperature, pH, physical mixing, and iron cycling in the intertidal aquifer also considerably influenced the carbonate biogeochemistry. TAlk inventory in the intertidal aquifer was seasonally stable but TAlk discharged with SGD was ~60% greater in the wet season than in the dry season (73.3 vs. 45.6 mol d−1 per m coastline). The DIC inventory in the intertidal aquifer and DIC discharged with SGD were ~24% and 95% higher, respectively, in the wet season than dry season. Overall, through analyzing TAlk:DIC ratios and related fluxes, SGD was thought to reduce the CO2 buffering capacity of the receiving ocean, and act as a local driver of ocean acidification. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biogeochemistry; Coastal inorganic carbon; Intertidal aquifer; Mangrove; Wetlands","Acidification; Alkalinity; Aquifers; Beaches; Biogeochemistry; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Drought; Mineral industry; Oceanography; Organic carbon; Organic minerals; pH; Sulfur compounds; Aerobic respiration; Buffering capacities; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Dissolved nutrients; Geochemical conditions; Ocean acidifications; Submarine groundwater discharge; Total alkalinities; Groundwater resources; alkalinity; aquifer; beach profile; biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; discharge; mangrove; ocean acidification; timescale",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100646831

In order to meet the different optimization objectives of the system under different new energy consumption states, a new energy consumption potential assessment and optimized operation method based on intuitionistic fuzzy rough set theory is proposed. By using the intuitionistic fuzzy rough set theory, the continuous attribute data is divided into different levels and the results of its membership and non-membership are gotten at different levels. The membership results of real-time consumption data are matched with the rule sets, and then the system consumption state judgment result is obtained. In this article, the system consumption situation is divided into five states, and compared with the traditional division method, so the system state can be described more comprehensively. At the same time, the fuzzy set is used to deal with the ambiguity of the boundary between each state. The intuition theory is used to solve the problem of the uncertainty of the consumption state, and then the accurate judgment can be realized. In response to different consumption states, an optimal scheduling model is established in which a hydrogen heat energy system (HHES) is involved to meet different requirements, and a hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to solve the model. Adopting the IEEE-30 bus system as the network structure of EHHS in the simulation, the analysis shows that the dynamic state division method based on intuitionistic fuzzy rough set theory can better be used to judge the system state according to real-time variable factors. The system optimization based on the consumption state division has the advantages of improving the operating economy and increasing the consumption of new energy. © Copyright © 2021 Liu, Zhao and Zhong.","determination results of consumption state; electricity heat hydrogen hybrid system; intuitionistic fuzzy rough set; new energy consumption; optimal scheduling","Energy utilization; Fuzzy set theory; Fuzzy sets; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Continuous attribute; Hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm; Intuitionistic fuzzy; Network structures; Optimal scheduling; Optimized operations; Real-time variable; System optimizations; Rough set theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105590832

In the context of China's power market reform, this paper studies the impact of introducing carbon prices into the wholesale market, and conducts a case study based on the data of a certain area in GD province. The results show that after the carbon price is transmitted to the electricity price, the more low-carbon and environmentally friendly power generation technologies will gain greater advantages in the electricity market, which is conducive to the clean energy transformation of the power system.

Over the past decade, the strong clean-Air policies in China have resulted in substantial reductions of anthropogenic emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and primary particulate matter, and air quality in China has consequently improved. However, the resultant aerosol radiative forcings have been poorly understood. In this study, we used an advanced global climate model integrated with the latest localized emission inventory to quantify the aerosol radiative forcings by the changes of anthropogenic emissions in China between 2008 and 2016. By comparing with multiple observation datasets, our simulations reproduced the considerable reductions of sulfate and black carbon (BC) mass loadings reasonably well over eastern China (the key region subject to stringent emission controls) during the period and accordingly showed a clear decline in both aerosol optical depth and absorption aerosol optical depth. The results revealed a regional annual mean positive direct radiative forcing (DRF) of C0.29Wm2 at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) due to the reduction of SO2 emissions. This positive aerosol radiative forcing was comprised of diminished sulfate scattering (C0.58Wm2), enhanced nitrate radiative effects (0.29Wm2), and could be completely offset by the concurrent reduction of BC emissions that induced a negative BC DRF of 0.33Wm2. Despite the small net aerosol DRF (0.05Wm2) at the TOA, aerosol radiation interactions could explain the surface brightening in China over the past decade. The overall reductions in aerosol burdens and associated optical effects mainly from BC and sulfate enhanced the regional annual mean downward solar radiation flux at the surface by C1.0Wm2 between 2008 and 2016. The enhancement was in general agreement with a long-Term observational record of surface energy fluxes in China. We also estimated that aerosol effects on cloud radiative forcings may have played a dominant role in the net aerosol radiative forcings at the TOA in China and over the northern Pacific Ocean during the study period. This study will facilitate more informed assessment of climate responses to projected emissions in the future as well as to sudden changes in human activities (e.g., the COVID-19 lockdown). © 2021 EDP Sciences.

Here, we propose a facile oxidative polymerization-carbonization strategy to synthesize O, S, N codoped carbon planar helixes for superior EM wave absorbers. The spiral cetyltrimethylammounium bromide crystallites act as a template for the in-situ oxidative polymerization of pyrroles into ordered PPy spiral nanowires. Sintering temperature (Ts) was used to adjust the defects, heteroatoms, graphitization degree, and properties of the carbonized products. With Ts varying from 400 °C to 800 °C, internal stress and heteroatom (N, O, S) content decreased, causing the decreased defect/dipole polarization and increased graphitization degree and conductivity loss. As a result, one broad high-frequency absorption band was exhibited by carbon planar helixes produced at 400 °C− 500 °C, two broad absorption bands were exhibited by those formed at 600 °C, and three absorption bands were exhibited by those formed at 700 °C − 800 °C. The carbon planar helix formed at 700 °C exhibited broader bandwidth (4.96 GHz), thinner sample thickness (1.4 mm), and stronger absorption (−35.44 dB) than those of other absorbers. The superior properties are attributed to a combination of dipole/defect polarization, interface polarization, conductivity loss, multiple scattering, and multiple LC-resonances generated from the unique planar helical structure, defects, heteroatoms, and local electric network. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Absorption mechanism; Carbon planar helix; EM wave attenuation capability; Formation mechanism; Oxidative polymerization-carbonization strategy","Carbonization; Circuit theory; Crystallites; Defects; Electric losses; Electromagnetic waves; Graphite; Graphitization; Nanowires; Polarization; Polymerization; Sintering; Graphitization degree; Helical structures; High frequency HF; Oxidative polymerization; Sintering temperatures; Situ oxidative polymerization; Strong absorptions; Superior microwave; Polypyrroles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099300424

In this paper, a super-efficiency slacks-based measure (SBM) model is adopted to measure the industrial green development efficiency (IGDE) of 289 cities in China from 2008 to 2018. Moreover, we analyze their spatiotemporal differentiation pattern. On this basis, the multiscale geographical weighted regression (MGWR) model is used to analyze the scale differences and spatial differences of the driving factors. The results show that the IGDE is still at a low level in China. From 2008 to 2018, the overall polarization of IGDE was relatively serious. The number of high-and low-efficiency cities increased, while that of medium-efficiency cities greatly decreased. Secondly, the IGDE presented an obvious spatial positive correlation. MGWR regression results show that the technological innovation, government regulation, and consumption level belonged to the global scale, and there was almost no spatial heterogeneity. Other driving factors were urbanization, industrial structure, economic development, and population density according to their spatial scale. Lastly, the influence of economic development and technological innovation had a certain circular structure in space; the influence of population size mainly occurred in the cities of the southeast coast and northeast provinces; the influence of urbanization was more obvious in the most northern provinces of the Yangtze River, while that of industrial structure was mainly concentrated in the most southern cities of the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB). Spatially, the influence of consumption was manifested as a distribution trend of decreasing from north to south, and the government regulation was manifested as increasing from west to east and then to northeast. © 2021 by the authors.

Herein, we reported three functionalized polyoxo-titanium clusters (PTCs)-based photocatalysts applied for photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR): Ti6 functionalized with phenylphosphonic acid (PPOA), Ti8-Fcdc and Ti6-Fcdc functionalized with 1,1-ferrocene dicarboxylic acid (Fcdc). Notably, the light absorption range of Ti8-Fcdc and Ti6-Fcdc can be significantly expanded to the visible region, because the introduction of the Fcdc ligand with the ability to quickly transfer electrons triggers the intense electron transfer effect between Ti-oxo nucleus and Fcdc ligands. On this foundation, these three PTCs are demonstrated to be molecular photocatalysts to conduct visible light-driven photocatalytic CO2RR in water with triisopropanolamine (TIPA) as holes scavenger. In particular, both of the Fcdc-functionalized Ti8-Fcdc and Ti6-Fcdc can accomplish the CO2-to-HCOO- photoreduction in water with very high selectivity (96.2% and 97.5%, respectively) and activity (170.30 and 350.00 μmol g-1 h-1, respectively). Most importantly, the photosynthetic of CO2-to-HCOO- activity for Ti6-Fcdc is the highest among the reported PTC photocatalytic for CO2RR.

Using the nifH gene as a molecular marker, we studied the combined effect of eCO2 and eN on the diazotrophic community and abundance at two growth stages in rice (tillering, TI and heading, HI). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) showed that eN had no obvious effect on nifH abundance in rice roots under either ambient CO2 (aCO2) or eCO2 treatment at the TI stage; in contrast, at the HI, nifH copy numbers were increased under eCO2 and decreased under aCO2. For rhizosphere soils, eN significantly reduced the abundance of nifH under both aCO2 and eCO2 treatment at the HI stage. Elevated CO2 significantly increased the nifH abundance in rice roots and rhizosphere soils with nitrogen fertilization, but had no obvious effect without N addition at the HI stage. There was a significant interaction [CO2 × N fertilization] effect on nifH abundance in root zone at the HI stage. In addition, the nifH copy numbers in rice roots were significantly higher at the HI stage than at the TI stage. Sequencing analysis indicated that the root-associated diazotrophic community structure tended to cluster according to the nitrogen fertilization treatment and that Rhizobiales were the dominant diazotrophs in all root samples at the HI stage. Additionally, nitrogen fertilization significantly increased the relative abundance of Methylosinus (Methylocystaceae) under eCO2 treatment, but significantly decreased the relative abundance of Rhizobium (Rhizobiaceae) under aCO2 treatment. Overall, the combined effect of eN and eCO2 stimulates root-associated diazotrophic methane-oxidizing bacteria while inhibits heterotrophic diazotrophs. © Copyright © 2021 Liu, Han, Zhu, Cao, Luo, Zhang, Zhang, Jia, Yu, Zhao and Bao.","elevated atmospheric CO2; growth stages; nitrogen fertilization; plant-associated nitrogen-fixing bacteria; rice paddy","carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide fertilizer; genomic DNA; molecular marker; nitrogen; nitrogen fertilizer; nitrogenase; nitrogenase iron protein; unclassified drug; amino acid sequence; Article; atmosphere; carbon dioxide fixation; community structure; controlled study; diazotroph; DNA extraction; DNA sequencing; fertilization; gene sequence; growth curve; microbial community; nitrogen fixation; nitrogen-fixing bacterium; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; plant growth; plant height; plant product; population abundance; principal component analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; rhizosphere; rice root; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; soil treatment; vegetative stage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105592054

Identifying total phosphorus (TP) sources is important for the management of watersheds. As a primary tributary of the Yangtze River, the Tuojiang River Basin (TJRB) plays important roles in the economy and ecology of the region. A watershed-level anthropogenic TP emission inventory was established using emission factors and loss coefficients for 2017 in the TJRB. The annual TP emissions to the TJRB were estimated to be 9253.55 t, of which livestock contributed 52.52%. The agricultural TP emissions to water bodies was 5201.87 t, followed by domestic emissions (3621.19 t) and industrial emissions (430.49 t). The TP contributions of the nonpoint sources were 3.07 times greater than those of the point sources. According to the Monte Carlo method, the uncertainty of TP emissions was [-69.71%, +68.06%] for the 95% confidence interval. Industrial emissions were identified as the largest contributor to the uncertainty [-33.75%, +38.37%]. The establishment of effective livestock breeding management practices along with the comprehensive utilization of facilities could help reduce TP emissions into the TJRB. This study presents an approach to the calculation of an estimated annual emission inventory of TP for the TJRB. The results enhance the fundamental data regarding pollution sources for subsequent research investigations. © 2021","Emission factors; Phosphorus emissions; Point and nonpoint sources; Watersheds","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Eutrophication; Monte Carlo methods; Phosphorus; River pollution; Rivers; Watersheds; Comprehensive utilizations; Confidence interval; Domestic emissions; Emission inventories; Livestock breeding; Loss coefficients; Management practices; Pollution sources; Industrial emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101363779

One of the aspects that affects the indicators and prospects of sustainable development is the efficiency of energy source use. Nationwide reductions in the greenhouse gas emissions of motor vehicles could have a direct effect on ambient temperature and reducing the effects of global warming, which can affect future environmental, societal, and economic development. Significant reductions in fuel consumption can be achieved by increasing the efficiency of use, and the performance, of current cargo vehicles. This aspect is directly related to cargo delivery systems and supply chain efficiency and effectiveness. The article solves the problem of increasing the effectiveness of cargo delivery and proposes a model that would minimize transportation costs that are directly related to fuel consumption, shortening transportation time. The model addresses the problem of a lack of models evaluating the efficiency of cargo to Lithuania that is using several different modes of transportation. For the solution to this problem, the article examines the complexity of the rational use of land and water vehicles depending on the type of cargo transported, the technical capabilities of the vehicles (loading, speed, environmental pollution, fuel consumption, etc.), and the type (cars, railways, ships). The novelty of the findings is based on the availability to select the most appropriate vehicles, on a case-by-case basis, from the available options, depending on their environmental performance and energy efficiency. This model, later in this article, is used for calculations of Lithuanian companies for selecting the most rational vehicle by identifying the most appropriate route, as well as assessing the dynamics of the economic and physical indicators. The model allows for creating dependencies between the main indicators characterizing the transport process—the cost, the time of transport, and the safety, taking into account the dynamics of economic and physical indicators, that lead to a very important issue—reducing the amount of energy required to provide products and services. © 2021 by the authors.

Accordingly, this study employed a field experiment to investigate the investment decisions under risk and uncertainty by 213 farmers from four regions of Taiwan. Each was asked 30 questions that paired ‘‘no investment,’’ ‘‘investment with crop insurance,’’ ‘‘investment with subsidized crop insurance,’’ and ‘‘investment’’ as possible responses. By providing imperfect information and various probabilities of certain states occurring, the experimental scenarios mimicked various types of weather-forecasting services. As well as their socioeconomic characteristics, the background information we collected about the participants included their experiences of natural disasters and what actions they take to protect their crops from weather damage. The sampled farmers became more conservative in their decision-making as the weather forecasts they received became more precise, except when increases in risk were associated with high returns. The provision of insurance subsidies also had a conservatizing effect. However, considerable variation in investment preferences was observed according to the farmers’ crop types. For those seeking to create comprehensive policies aimed at helping the agricultural sector deal with the costs of damage from extreme events, this study has important implications. This approach could be extended to research on the perceptions of decision-makers in other climate-exposed sectors such as the construction industry. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: While farmers have shown their eagerness to obtain timely weather forecasts and better forecasting precision, we would like to understand how they respond to an enhanced weather-forecast service. We observe 213 Taiwanese farmers’ investment preferences using a field experiment involving 30 questions. Two weather states, good and bad, are used to mimic various types of agricultural harvest environment. The proportion of weather states indicates the likelihood of states occurring. The unknown state, controlled by providing imperfect information, implies the accuracy of forecasts. The less that is unknown, the more accurate is the forecast. In addition, we examine farmers’ decisions in the experiment in accordance with their socioeconomic characteristics and experiences of natural disasters in the real world. Our findings suggest that, in general, farmers could be more conservative as the weather forecast became more precise. However, such an effect varies with the farmers’ crop types. Moreover, the provision of insurance subsidies also has a conservatizing effect. We also provide policy implications not only in relation to enhanced weather forecasting, but also in regard to crop insurance against natural disasters. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.","Agriculture; Communications/decision making; Experimental design; Field experiments; Forecast verification/skill; Insurance","decision making; disaster; experimental study; farmers knowledge; hydrometeorology; insurance system; probability; uncertainty analysis; weather forecasting; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101769738

In this study, the continuous measurements of aerosol light absorption were conducted in Nanjing, east China, from January 3 to March 31, 2020. Our results showed that the contribution of black carbon (BC) to light absorption at the different wavelengths was more than 75% and the rest light absorption was contributed by brown carbon (BrC), which was mainly originated from primary emissions. Secondary BrC absorption, which was mainly produced by photochemical oxidation, constituted a minor fraction (2–7%) of the total absorption. Compared with the sampling in the pre-lockdown, the significant decreases of BC (43%) and secondary BrC absorption (31%) were found during the lockdown period, resulting in a substantial decrease of solar energy absorbance by 36% on a local scale. The control measures also changed the diurnal variations of light absorption. Due to the reduced emissions, the relative fraction of fossil fuel to BC also dropped from 78% in the pre-lockdown to 71% in the lockdown. The concentrations of BC, PM2.5 and NO2 decreased 1.1 μg m−3, 33 μg m−3 and 9.1 ppb whereas O3 concentration increased 9.0 ppb during the COVID-19 lockdown period. The decreased concentrations of BC, PM2.5 and NO2 were mainly contributed by both emission reduction (51–64%) and meteorological conditions (36–49%). Our results highlighted that the balance of control measures in alleviation of particulate matter (PM) and O3 pollution, and meteorology should be seriously considered for improvement of air quality in this urban city of China. © 2021 Elsevier LtdReduced emissions decreased the concentrations of primary pollutants, aerosol light absorption and solar energy absorbance, but increased O3 levels on a local scale. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosol light absorption; Brown carbon; COVID-19; Fossil fuel; Lockdown; Solar energy absorbance","Aerosols; Air quality; Bromine compounds; Carbon; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Quality control; Solar energy; Aerosol light absorption; Carbonaceous aerosol; Chemical and physical properties; Continuous measurements; Emission reduction; Meteorological condition; Photochemical oxidation; Relative contribution; Light absorption; black carbon; fossil fuel; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; fossil fuel; aerosol composition; aerosol formation; brown carbon; concentration (composition); COVID-19; fossil fuel; light availability; solar power; aerosol; aerosol light absorption; air quality; Article; carbonaceous aerosol; China; circadian rhythm; complex formation; concentration (parameter); controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; emission reduction; environmental aspects and related phenomena; geographic distribution; high temperature; humidity; light absorption; lockdown; meteorology; particle size; particulate matter; photooxidation; physical chemistry; precipitation; solar energy; solar energy absorbance; urban area; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; city; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; human; China; Coronavirus; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Fossil Fuels; Humans; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100683393

Although the production process of bioethanol is currently constrained by its low yield and also relies on considerable amounts of arable land to cultivate, but the adoption of bioethanol has an advantage in reducing THC, CO, VOCs and NMHC emissions. The results show most of the regulated and unregulated emissions are much lower for the Euro IV and V vehicles compared to Euro III vehicle for all the three fuels tested. The largest reduction in emissions was predicted to occur when the E10 fuel blend was employed (Scenario C) in conjunction with a 10% scrappage rate.

TGF-b and IL-6 promote Th17 differentiation; however, these cytokines have multiple targets. The identification and screening of additional molecules that regulate IL-17A and IL-22 responses in certain inflammatory conditions is of great clinical significance. In this study, we show that CDDO-Im, a specific Nrf2 activator, promotes IL-17A and IL-22 responses in murine Th17 cells. In contrast, CDDO-Im inhibits IL-17A response in multiple sclerosis patient-derived PBMCs. However, Nrf2 specifically regulates IL-22 response in vivo. Nrf2 acts through the regulation of antioxidant response element (ARE) binding motifs in target genes to induce or repress transcription. Promoter analysis revealed that Il17a, Rorc, and Ahr genes have several ARE motifs. We showed that Nrf2 bound to ARE repressor (ARE-R2) of Rorc and inhibited Rorc-dependent IL-17A transactivation. The luciferase reporter assay data showed that CDDO-Im regulated Ahr promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative PCR data showed that Nrf2 bound to ARE of AhR. Finally, we confirmed that the CDDO-Im-mediated induction of IL-22 production in CD4+T cells was abrogated in CD4-specific Ahr knockout mice (AhrCD4). CH-223191, a specific AhR antagonist, inhibits CDDOIm- induced IL-22 production in CD4+ T cells, which further confirmed the AhR-dependent regulation. Collectively, our data showed that Nrf2 via AhR pathways regulated IL-22 response in CD4+T cells. © 2021 American Association of Immunologists.

Perfecting the energy efficiency of the mining sector is extremely important for ensuring China's energy security, emission reduction, and promoting China's economic growth. Various factors influence the mining sector's energy efficiency. Based on the provincial-level panel data in China, this paper adopts a two-way fixed-effect model to explore the effect of industrial agglomeration on the total factor energy efficiency (TFEE) of the mining sector in China. Also, the threshold panel model is used to calculate the impact of industrial agglomeration in regions with different economic development levels on the energy efficiency of the mining industry. The results indicate that increasing industrial agglomeration improves the energy efficiency of the mining sector. Furthermore, with the increase in regional economic development, the impact of industrial agglomeration on energy efficiency is gradually decreased. The government could reduce the capacity, which eliminates redundant mining capacity in eastern China, and develop high-quality mining clusters in central and western China. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Industrial agglomeration; Mining industry; Threshold panel model; Total factor energy efficiency","Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy security; Industrial economics; Mining; Regional planning; Eastern China; Economic growths; Emission reduction; Fixed effect models; Industrial sector; Mining sector; Regional economic development; Total factor energy efficiencies; Energy efficiency; economic development; energy efficiency; industrial agglomeration; mining industry; numerical model; panel data; regression analysis; article; China; economic development; government; mining; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097791733

However, when disturbed they can become significant sources of carbon emissions. Understanding carbon dynamics in freshwater wetlands is a research priority to maximise carbon drawdown opportunities through effective management. Grazing can have considerable impacts on the health of freshwater wetland functionality. Fencing to exclude livestock from freshwater wetlands is one approach used to reduce grazer impacts; however, this is not always feasible. Managing grazing intensity is one option that is amenable to most farmers and resource managers; however, to date there have been no studies to evaluate its efficacy. The impacts of seasonal grazing intensity (by sheep) on carbon sequestration by rain-filled freshwater wetlands were investigated in south eastern Australia (Wimmera region). Over a 1-year study duration, this research compared: a) the effects of continuous grazing (sheep present across all seasons); b) crash grazing (sheep present within the spring); and c) exclusion plots (controls; no sheep access) on above-ground plant biomass, soil carbon concentration, and fluxes across seasons. Results suggest that above-ground biomass was 6.4% higher within exclusion plots compared to grazed plots in both continuous and crash grazing regimes. Exclusion plots had 30% higher soil carbon concentration compared to grazed plots. Open-continuously grazed plots had higher fluxes (8.69 ± 10.61 g CO2 m−2 day−1) compared with exclusion plots (6.92 ± 15.86 g CO2-e m−2 day−1). This study shows that exclusion plots had higher soil carbon concentration and lower carbon emissions. Further, excluding grazing from wetlands within the Wimmera region would increase above-ground biomass and soil carbon stock by 545,300 tons of carbon while reducing CO2 emissions by 782,412 tons of CO2 year−1. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Carbon sequestration; Freshwater wetlands; Grazing impact; Greenhouse gas emissions; Soil organic carbon","aboveground biomass; biomass; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; emission control; grazing; grazing pressure; livestock; sheep; soil carbon; wetland; Australia; Victoria [Australia]; Wimmera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099576183

Decentralized stormwater treatment systems (DS) and test procedures to monitor their performance, have been developed in recent years. At present in Germany, only lab-based tests are officially established to determine the removal efficiency of Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and in situ monitoring is still lacking. Furthermore, the fine fraction of TSS with particle sizes less than 63 µm (TSS63) have been established as a new design parameter in Germany, because of their substitute characteristics of adsorbing pollutant substances. For research and evaluation purposes continuous data of urban stormwater runoff quantity and quality at the in-and outflow of two different DS at two different sites were collected. Turbidity is used as a surrogate for TSS. Continuous turbidity data and time proportional sampling served to obtain (i) regression coefficients and (ii) to determine the TSS removal efficiency of DS. For a wide range of events the total removal efficiency of DS1 was 29% for TSS and 19% for TSS63 and for DS2 19% for TSS and 16% for TSS63. An event-based data analysis revealed a high variability of the efficiencies and its uncertainties. Moreover, outwash of still suspended or remobilization of already deposited material was observed at individual events. At both sites TSS63 dominates urban stormwater runoff as indicated by the mean ratios of TSS63 to TSS of 0.78 at the inflows and 0.89 at the outflows of both DS. A significant shift of TSS63 ratio from inflow to outflow demonstrates that TSS63 particles were removed less efficiently than coarser particles by DS1, for DS2 data was too heterogeny. It clarifies that common sedimentation methods can only contribute to a small extent to the reduction of solid emissions if the stormwater runoff contains mainly fine-particle solids. The findings suggest that treatment of urban stormwater runoff with high TSS63 pollution requires additional techniques such as a proper filtering to retain fine particles more effective. © 2021 by the authors.

Water shortages could hamper coal-fired power plants productions and result in economic losses. In this study, we simulate monthly river flows in China on a 0.5 0.5 spatial resolution using a calibrated physically based hydrological model, H08, that incorporates human interventions during the current (1981-2014) and future period 2050s (2035-2065) under two carbon emission scenarios Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6 and 8.5. Water demands by individual power plants are calculated based on plant-level data. We define power plants as facing low-flow water risks when the monthly 10 year return low flow is projected to be below the plant's water withdrawal requirement. We find that around 10% of China's coal-fired power capacities face low-flow water risks from July to October (the monsoon peak in the eastern Asia), and 20% the rest of the year. Particularly in the North Grid, around 35% to 60% of its regional coal-fired power capacity is at such risks from December to June. Under climate change, low-flow amounts are expected to increase in the current dry northern China except decreasing in the northwest, which is expected to alleviate the low flow water risks facing coal power plants in China except in the Northwest Inland River Basin. In the East and South Grids, if their growing electricity demands continue depending on coal, increasing utilization rate of coal power facilities can lead to heightened demand-driven water risks. © 2021 The Author(s).

In China (the largest producer of tea), the industry is growing, and there is a need to understand current greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and sequestrations and the potential for mitigation so that climate action can be strategically undertaken. Life cycle assessment and carbon footprint methods were used to quantify emissions in tea cultivation and processing in the 16 major producing regions for the year 2017. The system boundary was from cradle to factory gate, which was divided into three subsystems, namely agricultural materials production, tea production and tea processing. Several units of analysis were chosen: The production region (province), the production area (ha) and the product (kg loose tea), etc. Total GHG emissions were 28.75 Mt CO2eq, which were mainly attributable to energy use in tea processing (41%), fertilizer production (31.6%) and soil emissions (26.7%). This equated to 12.0 t CO2eq per ha and 10.8 kg CO2eq per kg processed tea. Production in Hubei, Yunan, Guizhou, Sichuan and Fujian provinces contributed almost two thirds of industry emissions, representing priority areas for strategic action to reduce GHG emissions. At the same time, the total carbon sink amounted to 21.37 MtCO2, representing 74.3% of total GHG emissions. The proportions stored in soil, biomass, and tea production were 49.3%, 30.0%, and 20.7%, respectively. If best recommended management practices for fertilizer application were adopted and biomass was used as a source of energy for tea processing, the GHG emissions reduction potential was 16.66 Mt CO2eq, or 58% of total emissions. The GHG emissions associated with tea production and processing in China appeared high by comparison to other regions of the world. However, considering the carbon sink and emissions reduction potential, the tea industry should be viewed as an important sector for climate action. Moreover, the potential for substantial GHG emissions reduction through the adoption of improved practices seems very realistic.

Human urban activities consume about 70% of the world's energy and emit nearly 80% of global greenhouse gases. Studying urban carbon metabolism can provide new ideas for urban low carbon development. This paper established an urban carbon metabolism analogy model based on Kleiber's law, and used panel data of urban construction land scale from three districts in Hangzhou, to discuss whether urban carbon metabolism was analogous to biological metabolism. We found that the β exponent of the carbon metabolism model in urban traffic land was greater than 1, indicating carbon metabolism in traffic land was not similar to biological metabolism; the β exponents in industrial land, other urban construction lands, and the overall construction land were less than 1, which indicated the existence of an analogy between carbon metabolism and biological metabolism. So urban carbon metabolism was generally similar to that of living organisms, that is, larger cities had higher energy efficiency. Coupled with the population to further control variables, we found there was a negative correlation between population size and carbon emission rate, so the benefits from the increase of construction land scale were enlarged by the effects of population size. Therefore, the government of developed cities of developing countries can build larger cities to achieve low-carbon development and pay more attention to the rationalization and adjustment of transportation land use to alleviate traffic congestion. This study provides differentiated guidance for collaboration on sustainable urban development at different levels of government. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Construction land; Panel analysis; Urban carbon metabolism; Urban scale; Urbanization","Biology; Developing countries; Energy efficiency; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Motor transportation; Population statistics; Traffic congestion; Urban growth; Biological metabolism; Carbon metabolism; Construction land; Control variable; Low-carbon development; Negative correlation; Sustainable urban development; Urban construction; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100030255

However, quantifying city-level CO2 emissions is generally a difficult task due to lacking or lower quality of energy-related statistics data, especially for some underdeveloped areas. To address this issue, this study used a set of open access data and machine learning methods to estimate and predict city-level CO2 emissions across China. Two feature selection technologies including Recursive Feature Elimination and Boruta were used to extract the important critical variables and input parameters for modeling CO2 emissions. Finally, 18 out of 31 predictor variables were selected to establish prediction models of CO2 emissions. We found that the statistical indicators of urban environment pollution (such as industrial SO2 and dust emissions per capita) are the most important variables for predicting the city-level CO2 emissions in China. The XGBoost models obtained the highest estimation accuracy with R2 &gt; 0.98 and lower relative error (about 0.8%) than other methods. The CO2 emissions predictive accuracy can be improved modestly by combing geospatial and meteorological interpolation predictor variables (e.g., DEM, annual average precipitation, and air temperature). We also observed an S-shape relationship between urban CO2 emissions per capita and urban economic growth when the rest variables were held constant, rather than a U-shaped one. The findings presented herein provide a first proof of concept that easily available socioeconomic statistical records and geospatial data at urban areas have the potential to accurately predict city-level CO2 emissions with the aid of machine learning algorithms. Our approach can be used to generate carbon footprint maps frequently for the undeveloped regions with scarce detailed energy-related statistical data, to assist policy-makers in designing specific measures of reducing and allocating carbon emissions reduction goal. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","City-level CO2 emissions; Geospatial dataset; Machine learning algorithms; Socioeconomic statistical information","accuracy assessment; air quality; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; emission control; environmental quality; estimation method; greenhouse gas; machine learning; China; carbon dioxide; access to information; China; city; machine learning; Access to Information; Carbon Dioxide; China; Cities; Machine Learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098762299

However, urban thermal characteristics of local climate zones (LCZ) are different within cities and most studies lack regional perspective. This study explored surface thermal performances of cities in three urban agglomerations (Jing-Jin-Ji, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta) in China using MODIS land surface temperature (LST). Besides that, the diurnal and seasonal LST variations of LCZs are also studied. Moreover, the optimal LCZs for better urban cooling are also investigated in this study. Although the thermal distributions of LCZs are different in China, there are still some similar features. Our four key findings were as follows. (1) LCZs in China are well classified, with average overall accuracy of 82% being higher than that in some previous studies. (2) The LST of mid-rise (LCZ 2, 5) is higher than that of highand low-rise buildings (LCZ 1, 3, 4, 6); and compact buildings are warmer than open buildings (LCZ 1-3 > LST 4-6) in summer of China. That shows both mid-rise and compact buildings are not beneficial to cool urban. In addition, LST variations at daytime and in summer are more significant than nighttime and other seasons. (3) LST differences within LCZs are significant at p < 0.05, and are most significant in Jing-Jin-Ji (JJJ). The LST difference within built types (LCZ 1-10) is more significant than within natural types (LCZ A-G), showing that built types alteration will be more effective for thermal environmental improvement. (4) Under the current population and urban area, increasing greenness and water area in compact high-rise buildings are the most effective strategies for urban cooling in all three urban agglomerations, with the largest reduction in LST of 4.11 K in JJJ. These findings will provide support for thermal environment mitigation, urban planning and sustainable urban development. © 2021 by the authors.

However, large-scale conversion of CO2 into selective products remains a challenge. Coupled thermal–electrochemical catalysis could offer an attractive approach to upgrading CO2 into value-added products if selective electrocatalysts and integrated devices were developed. Here we identify a mechanistic route to selectively producing either CO or CH4 with high selectivity (&gt;95%) using Ir–ceria-based catalysts in an intermediate-temperature (400 °C) CO2 electrolyser that operates at low overpotential and ambient pressure. We show that tuning of the Ir–O hybridization by controlling the Ir speciation can alter the catalyst surface chemical environment, enabling the stabilization of specific transition states for the production of either CO or CH4 during electrocatalysis. By achieving CO2 electrohydrogenation in tandem with light-alkane electrodehydrogenation, we further demonstrate that such an advanced electrolyser could be extended to the upgrade of different carbon resources in one-step, significantly enhancing the techno-economic feasibilty of the process.

The Five-Year-Plans have been an important administrative tool for China in climate change mitigation. However, the emissions transfer inside China has raised the problem of pollution haven affect and challenges to the effectiveness of the mitigation policies. This study examines whether mitigation policies can promote emissions reduction and whether it causes the pollution haven effect in China. It establishes an Extended Provincial Input-Output Model to calculate province production-based emissions, consumption-based emissions, and emissions transfer from 2005 to 2015. The results show that: (1) The mitigation policy is effective as a 1% increase of the completeness of the mitigation target is related to a 0.118% decrease of production-based emissions. (2) Stringent mitigation policies increase net emissions outflow as a 1% increase of the completeness of the target is related to an 18.5% increase of the net emissions transfer. (3) Subsequent policy enforcement will weaken once the mitigation goal is accomplished.

Most land surface models, including Noah-MP, employ an idealized “big-leaf” concept to regulate water and carbon fluxes in response to soil moisture stress through empirical soil hydraulics schemes (SHSs). However, such schemes have been shown to cause significant uncertainties in carbon and water simulations. In this paper, we present a novel plant hydraulics scheme (PHS) for Noah-MP (hereafter, Noah-MP-PHS), which employs a big-tree rather than big-leaf concept, wherein the whole-plant hydraulic strategy is considered, including root-level soil water acquisition, stem-level hydraulic conductance and capacitance, and leaf-level anisohydricity and hydraulic capacitance. Evaluated against plot-level observations from a mature, mixed hardwood forest at the University of Michigan Biological Station and compared with the default Noah-MP, Noah-MP-PHS better represents plant water stress and improves water and carbon simulations, especially during periods of dry soil conditions. Noah-MP-PHS also improves the asymmetrical diel simulation of gross primary production under low soil moisture conditions. Noah-MP-PHS is able to reproduce different patterns of transpiration, stem water storage and root water uptake during a 2-week dry-down period for two species with contrasting plant hydraulic behaviors, i.e., the “cavitation risk-averse” red maple and the “cavitation risk-prone” red oak. Sensitivity experiments with plant hydraulic capacitance show that the stem water storage enables nocturnal plant water recharge, affects plant water use efficiency, and provides an important buffer to relieve xylem hydraulic stress during dry soil conditions. © 2021.

With the aim of characterizing the emissions, in this study, a bottom-up approach of county level emission inventory from paved road dust based on field investigation was developed. An inventory of high-resolution paved road dust (PRD) emissions by monthly and spatial allocation at 1 km × 1 km resolution in Harbin in 2016 was compiled using accessible county level, seasonal data and local parameters based on field investigation to increase temporal-spatial resolution. The results demonstrated the total PRD emissions of TSP, PM10, and PM2.5 in Harbin were 270,207 t, 54,597 t, 14,059 t, respectively. The temporal variation trends of pollutant emissions from PRD was consistent with the characteristics of precipitation, with lower emissions in winter and summer, and higher emissions in spring and autumn. The spatial allocation of emissions has a strong association with Harbin’s road network, mainly concentrating in the central urban area compared to the surrounding counties. Through scenario analysis, positive control measures were essential and effective for PRD pollution.

To more clearly understand the effectiveness of penalty policies, this paper proposes two assessment indicators and assesses Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) penalty policy based on the behaviors of governments and ships. By establishing an evolutionary game model that considers the competitive relationships between ships, we obtain evolutionary stable strategies. Furthermore, we quantitatively assess the effectiveness of EPA's penalty policy for different routes and ship types, and discuss the impacts of accurate penalty fine calculations. Finally, recommendations on penalty policy implications are proposed. The results of this paper show that EPA's penalty policy is less effective overall and that its effectiveness differs for different routes and ship types. Fortunately, the effectiveness of EPA's penalty policy can be improved by accurately calculating penalty fines, and using Automatic Identification System data to pre-identify violations and determine penalty fines is a potential way to improve EPA's penalty policy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Emission control areas; Game theory; Maritime transportation; Penalty policy assessment","assessment method; emission control; environmental protection; game theory; maritime transportation; policy analysis; shipping; state role; transportation policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101402833

The low-cost TiO2 with suitable band structure and high resistibility to light corrosion has proven to be very promising for photoreduction of CO2 using water as the source of electrons and protons. However, the narrow spectral response range (ultraviolet region only) as well as the rapid recombination of photo-induced electron-hole pairs within pristine TiO2 results in the low utilization of solar energy and limited photocatalytic efficiency. Besides, its low selectivity toward photoreduction products of CO2 should also be improved. Combination of TiO2 with other photoelectric active materials, such as metal oxide/sulfide semiconductors, metal nanoparticles and carbon-based nanostructures, for the construction of well-defined heterostructures can enhance the quantum efficiency significantly by promoting visible light adsorption, facilitating charge transfer and suppressing the recombination of charge carriers, resulting in the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the composite photocatalytic system. In addition, the adsorption and activation of CO2 on these heterojunctions are also promoted, therefore enhancing the turnover frequency (TOF) of CO2 molecules, so as to the improved selectivity of photoreduction products. This review focus on the recent advances of photocatalytic CO2 reduction via TiO2-based heterojunctions with water oxidation. The rational design, fabrication, photocatalytic performance and CO2 photoreduction mechanisms of typical TiO2-based heterojunctions, including semiconductor-semiconductor (S-S), semiconductor-metal (S-M), semiconductor-carbon group (S-C) and multicomponent heterojunction are reviewed and discussed. Moreover, the TiO2-based phase heterojunction and facet heterojunction are also summarized and analyzed. In the end, the current challenges and future prospects of the TiO2-based heterostructures for photoreduction of CO2 with high efficiency, even for practical application are discussed. © Copyright © 2021 Li, Teng, Wang and Min.","CO2 photoreduction; heterostructures; high efficiency; TIO2-based photocatalysts; water oxidation",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104933054

The generated flue gas condensates are very corrosive, but very limited information is available to select appropriate alloys for the cost-effective construction and long-term safe operation of flue gas components. Thus, this study investigated the corrosion performance of P91 and DSS 2205 steels in the simulated condensates at 60°C–150°C. The dominant reactions on the two steels were considerable oxide formation and high chemical dissolution of the formed oxides instead of localized pitting. The increase in temperature leads to an exponential increase in the long-term corrosion rates of the steels. Benefited from its high Cr and Mo contents, DSS 2205 steel exhibited much better corrosion resistance, and the formed surface scales consisted of inner Fe-enriched and outer Cr-enriched oxides in which Cr2O3 was transformed into Cr(OH)3 with the increase in temperature. The corrosion products on P91 steel consisted of inner Cr–Fr–Mo oxides and outer Fe-enriched oxides, which were porous and unable to protect the steel. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","condensed phase corrosion; Fe–Cr steels; oxy-fired; temperature","Chromium compounds; Corrosion protection; Corrosion rate; Corrosion resistance; Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Flue gases; Fluidized beds; Gas condensates; Iron oxides; Molybdenum oxide; Nickel steel; Oxygen; Steel corrosion; Chemical dissolution; Corrosion performance; Corrosion products; Exponential increase; High energy efficiency; Limited information; Long-term corrosion; Pressurized fluidized bed combustion; Fluidized bed combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093668718

Spatial autocorrelation of provincial industrial CO2 emissions from 2003 to 2017 has been demonstrated. The results are as follows: (1) 30 provinces in China are categorized into 8 types of spatiotemporal transition, among which 24 provinces are characterized by stable spatial structure and 6 provinces show significant spatiotemporal transition; (2) For all types of spatiotemporal transition, economic scale effect is mostly contributed to industrial CO2 emission, while energy intensity effect is the most crucial driving force to reduce industrial carbon dioxide emission; (3) provinces of type HH-HH, HL-HL and HL-HH are most vital for CO2 emission reduction, while the potential CO2 emission increase of developing provinces in LL-LL, LH-LH and LL-LH should also be taken into account.

Here, we ingeniously proposed an improved estimation method from a bottom-up perspective, integrating ten technical indicators affecting point-source GHG emissions from coal mines, coal transport routes, and coal power units. This method quantifies provincial GHG emission factors of the coal-to-electricity chain in 2016, varying greatly within 964-1232 g CO2eq / kWh, and explains for the first time how the micro technical indicators affect macro carbon emission levels. Our estimates have a higher spatial resolution and lower uncertainty than existing studies, which can well represent the status quo in different provinces. Based on these emission factors, the total GHG emissions from the Chinese the coal-to-electricity chain in 2016 are estimated at 4232 Mt CO2eq and being spatially intensive in northern and eastern China. They are expected to peak in 2025 according to current policy but in advance by 2019 if transformation is accelerated. The variation province by province suggests that carbon reduction strategies should be tailored to the local specific situation and overall coordinated across the country. © 2020","Bottom-up; Carbon emission; China; Coal-to-electricity chain; Greenhouse gas emission","Carbon; Coal; Coal industry; Coal mines; Gas emissions; Transportation routes; Uncertainty analysis; Bottom up approach; Carbon emissions; Carbon reduction; Estimation methods; Spatial resolution; Statistical datas; Technical indicator; Transport routes; Greenhouse gases; bottom-up approach; carbon emission; coal mining; emission control; estimation method; greenhouse gas; air pollution control; carbon footprint; China; Chinese; coal mining; coal power; coal to electricity chain; combustion; controlled study; environmental policy; point source pollution; pollution; power supply; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095570339

This study constructs a gridded near-surface PM2.5 concentration dataset across China covering 1980–2019 using the space-time random forest model with atmospheric visibility observations and other auxiliary data. The modeled daily PM2.5 concentrations are in excellent agreement with ground measurements, with a coefficient of determination of 0.95 and mean relative error of 12%. Besides the atmospheric visibility which explains 30% of total importance of variables in the model, emissions and meteorological conditions are also key factors affecting PM2.5 predictions. From 1980 to 2014, the model-predicted PM2.5 concentrations increased constantly with the maximum growth rate of 5–10 μg/m3/decade over eastern China. Due to the clean air actions, PM2.5 concentrations have decreased effectively at a rate over 50 μg/m3/decade in the North China Plain and 20–50 μg/m3/decade over many regions of China during 2014–2019.

For low pressure centrifugal chiller applications, R123 with non-zero ODP and R245fa with high GWP, will be phased out. For the current study, the performance of R1233zd(E) and newly developed R1224yd(Z) were evaluated in view of replacement for R123 and R245fa for two-stage centrifugal chiller applications. The system-level thermal performance, component-level heat transfer performance/sizing, and life time environmental performance are investigated at a fixed cooling capacity of 500 t (1750 kW). Both fluids have an equivalent COP. R245fa and R1224yd(Z) can achieve a volume capacity 60% higher than that of R123, while that of R1233zd(E) is 40% higher. R245fa and R1233zd(E) can achieve a mass flow rate $$\sim 10$$% lower than that of R123, and R1224yd(Z) displays a mass flow rate $$\sim 5$$% higher than that of R123. R1233zd(E) and R1224yd(Z) demonstrate an evaporator shell side heat transfer coefficient 19% and 16% higher, respectively, as compared with R123. R1233zd(E) has a condenser shell side heat transfer performance 32% higher than that of R123, and those of R245fa and R1224yd(Z) are $$\sim 24$$% higher. R1233zd(E) and R1224yd(Z) exhibit compressor impeller diameters 17.8% and 19.7% less, respectively, as compared with R123. Both R1233zd(E) and R1224yd(Z) can exhibit a $$\sim 10$$% life cycle emission reduction as compared with R245fa. To sum up, R1233zd(E) and R1224yd(Z) can be good candidates to replace R123, and R1224yd suits better than R1233zd(E) to replace R245fa for centrifugal chiller systems, which is due to its heat transfer area close to that of R245fa and smaller compressor modifications. It is anticipated that the current study can be beneficial for the chiller community to maintain the maximum sustainability and economic benefits. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,"Centrifugation; Cooling systems; Emission control; Environmental management; Global warming; Life cycle; Mass transfer; Ozone layer; Sustainable development; Centrifugal chiller system; Centrifugal chillers; Environmental performance; Global warming potential; Life cycle emissions; Ozone depletion potential; Performance assessment; Shell side heat transfer coefficients; Heat transfer performance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111704019

If so, how do the effects evolve? This paper exploits monthly fluctuations in the number of extremely hot days within a city to identify their effects on firm-level exports in that city. We find robust evidence that hot temperatures have persistent adverse effects on firm-level exports. Specifically, export losses gradually arise following a heat shock, beginning from an undetectable impact and eventually accumulating to a large and significant impact. An additional >30 °C day in a month could generate cumulative losses up to 0.83% of a firm's annual exports twenty-four months later. The negative effects of extreme heat are mainly through its adverse impacts on the firm's investment, capital, and production output. Capital-intensive sectors and FDI-related enterprises are among the most affected by high temperatures.

The pre-mixture was flexibly prepared by the direct pre-injection of blended fuels, and the ignition timing could be controlled robustly by the diesel jet-injection. Engine experiments were conducted at 75% engine load with an engine speed of 3000 rpm. The results indicate that an obvious two-stage high-temperature heat release process is achieved by modulating the injection parameters of dual-direct injectors independently. The late combustion phasing resulted from the retarded diesel jet-injection effectively depress the reaction rate. When the pre-injection is delayed within the sensitivity interval, the local richer premixed charge accelerates the pre-mixture combustion stage. The indicated thermal efficiency is increased by 7.4%, and nitrogen oxide emission is reduced by 16.9% compared to the conventional diesel combustion mode. The increased pre-injection pressure can suppress the reaction rate but causes wall-wetting issues. The stratification of the equivalence ratio prepared by the double direct pre-injection strategy diminishes the maximum pressure rise rate by over 64% compared to that with single direct pre-injection. It is also revealed that the start of the second pre-injection plays a dominant role in modulating the combustion process, which illustrates the potential to extend the engine load of premixed combustion mode. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Dual–direct injectors; Jet controlled compression ignition; Maximum pressure rise rate; Reaction rate; Turning point","Ignition; Mixtures; Nitrogen oxides; Reaction rates; Compression ignition; High temperature heat release; Indicated thermal efficiency; Injection parameters; Injection pressures; Light-duty diesel engines; Nitrogen oxide emissions; Premixed combustion; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097799140

Although there has been growing literature on this topic, there has been limited progress in practice, and the lack of quantification limits consideration of inequality in the policy process. Controversy remains regarding the best approaches to formally incorporate inequality, when these approaches should be used, and even whether it makes sense to quantify inequality in this context. The objective of this article is to review the literature on approaches for incorporating estimates of, and concerns for, inequality into regulatory impact analyses, especially those where environmental justice considerations are relevant, and consider the interpretation of these approaches and the implications for decision making. Using the case example of the Transportation and Climate Initiative, a collaboration among Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states to reduce carbon emissions from the transportation sector, multiple strategies are described that could be used to shed light on health risk inequality and inequity, consider them in pending policy decisions, and evaluate their implications for the policy or instrument choice.

This provided an opportunity to study positive effects on environment and subsequent impact on terrestrial ecosystems such as urban, peri-urban, forest and agriculture. A variety of studies presented so far mainly include improved air quality index, water quality, reduced pollutants etc. The present study focused on few novel parameters from both polar and geostationary satellites that are not studied in context to India, and also attempts deriving/quantifying benefits rather than merely indicating qualitative improvements. Due to lack of anthropogenic activities during complete lockdown-1 (21 days from 25 March 2020) in India nighttime cooling of land surface temperature (LST) of the order of 2–6 K was observed. Amongst 10 major cities, Bhopal showed highest nighttime cooling. The cooling effect in LST was evident in 80% of industrial units distinctly indicating cooling trend. Vegetation fires were analyzed in 10 fire-prone states of India. Compared to past four-years average number of occurrences, only 45% fire occurrences occurred during lockdown, indicating strong effect of lockdown. The study also revealed that, there is increase in gross primary production in forest ecosystem to the tune of maximum 38%, during this period. Though delay in rabi crop harvest date by 1–2 weeks in majority of north Indian states was observed rise in rabi crop productivity of the order of maximum 34% was observed which is attributed to favorable environmental conditions for net carbon uptake. About 18% reduction in volumetric agricultural water demand was estimated in Indo-Gangetic region, parts of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Apart from controlling the spread of the disease, the lockdown restrictions were thus also able to show positive effects on the environment and ecosystem which might influence to rethink on strategies for sustainable development. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","COVID; Lockdown; Positive impacts; Space-based observations; Terrestrial ecosystems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101412273

Parties to the Paris Agreement formulate Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which are documents that give details of their national policies and plans. They are free to formulate and present national policies as they choose, and as a result, there is substantial variation in the content and form of NDCs. This study presents a new framework for assessing and comparing the political meanings of these documents. The framework builds on two distinct ways in which NDCs can be understood. NDCs may be commitments to the international community and domestic actors. Alternatively, they may embody states’ negotiating positions in an ongoing process of national and international interactions. The framework consists of a set of thematic categories to which each sentence of these documents can be allocated. The application of this framework enables us to compare the political content of states’ NDCs systematically. The study demonstrates the validity of the framework by correlating its results with key characteristics of states. The findings also provide evidence for the two distinct perspectives on these documents. © 2020 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"climate change; governance approach; international agreement; negotiation process; political system",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100997988

If that CO2 could be converted into ethanol by carbon capture and utilization technologies it would be possible to increase ethanol production more than 37% without additional corn grain inputs. Gas fermentation processes use microbes to convert carbon-containing gases into ethanol and so have the potential to be used with the CO2 from biorefineries for this purpose. However, as CO2 utilization technologies for converting thermodynamically stable CO2 are typically energy intensive, it is necessary to evaluate the related life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (carbon intensities or CIs) to see whether there are actual emission reduction benefits. In this study, we evaluate the CIs of ethanol produced from high-purity CO2 in corn ethanol plants by gas fermentation plus electrochemical reduction. Our analysis shows that the sources of electricity and hydrogen are key drivers of CO2-based ethanol's GHG emissions. With wind electricity, the design cases show the potential of near-zero CI ethanol (1.1 g CO2e/MJ), but that can increase to up to 331–531 g CO2e/MJ when today's U.S. Midwest electricity mix is used. To avoid the renewable electricity intermittency issue, we considered a power purchase agreement option using wind electricity 40% of the time and using the regional mix for the rest, which provides a 42% GHG emission reduction from the CI of gasoline. © 2020 The Authors and UChicago Argonne, LLC, Operator of Argonne National Laboratory.

Previous studies proposed a framework of utility systems that operate under various conditions. However, few studies have addressed the optimization of utility systems during the operating life cycle. To fill in this gap, we propose a new methodology for the design and optimization of the utility systems in the offshore plants. The utility systems are designed and optimized in Aspen Utilities Planner, considering the full life cycle of the oil and gas wells. For this, we first developed steady-state models of the topside processes based on every feasible operating scenario throughout the full life cycle. Then the utility consumption data was extracted from the simulation results and analyzed. The power system was designed using Aspen Utilities Planner (AUP), and it was optimized to maximize the thermal efficiency of the utility system, satisfying power demand for all the scenarios. The optimized results illustrate the significant saving of the operating cost and reduction of CO2 emission rate.

This industry is one of the most energy- and emission-intensive industries in China. It is unsuspicious that energy conservation and emission reduction in this industry are crucial for China to fulfill its obligations of reducing greenhouse gas emission and mitigating global climate change. An appropriate allocation of CO2 emissions permit is the most important precondition for establishing an efficient and effective emissions trading system that had recently been launched in China's pilot regions. This paper proposes a new emissions permit allocation method based on a Nash equilibrium data envelopment analysis model. This method is more appropriate in emissions permit allocation for China's iron and steel firms in an imperfectly competitive market where the product price is endogenous. A noncooperative game is formulated and the mixed complementarity problem is utilized to identify a Nash equilibrium in the allocation of emissions permit (AEP). The most up-to-date AEP using a unique data set of China's major iron and steel enterprises in 2014 is provided in this paper. The results show that the AEP improves the desirable output generation by satisfying the reduction targets of the undesirable outputs. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Allocation of emissions permit (AEP); China; data envelopment analysis (DEA); iron and steel industry; Nash equilibrium","Climate change; Commerce; Data envelopment analysis; Emission control; Game theory; Greenhouse gases; Steelmaking; Competitive markets; Emissions trading system; Energy and emissions; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Global climate changes; Iron and steel enterprise; Mixed com-plementarity problems; Noncooperative game; Iron and steel industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101465615

The results of this study indicated that the impacts of wetting-drying cycles on the short-term C and N dynamics were highly variable among the three cast forms, but wetting-drying cycles significantly reduced the cumulative CO2 and N2O fluxes by 62%–83% and 57%–85%, respectively, when compared to the control without being subjected to any rainfall events. The C mineralization rates in different cast forms were affected by the amount of organic substrates and N content in casts, which were associated with the food preference and selection of earthworms. Meanwhile, the cumulative N2O fluxes did not differ among the three cast forms. Repeated wetting and drying of casts not only enhanced aggregate stability by promoting bonds between the cast particles, but also inhibited microbial survival and growth during the prolonged drying period, which together hindered decomposition and denitrification. Our findings demonstrated that the interactions between the structural forms, aggregate dynamics, and C and N cycling in the earthworm casts were highly complex. © 2021 Soil Science Society of China","aggregate stability; Cand N cycling; earthworm activity; earthworm casting; greenhouse gas flux; mineralization; organic matter; rainfall simulation","aggregate stability; decomposition analysis; denitrification; earthworm; food preference; growth; mineralization; soil nutrient; subtropical region; survival; wetting-drying cycle; Amynthas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098795615

Policy-makers emphasise that the required transformation begins with local action. Yet, there is a gap in understanding why local action can remain largely locked-in to maladaptive cycles, with variable on-ground evidence of transformative change. Using ‘the politics of scale,’ we interrogated ‘the local’ using ethnographic interviews. We found that although local actors are engaged in various ways, ‘doing’ environmental work at a very local scale, their practices are constrained, reinforced by cultural, political, and economic arguments. We conceptualise ‘hyper-localism’ and ‘temporal passivity’ as emergent conditions that mask connectivity to wider social and ecological networks leading to transformative possibilities. We argue that global climate change discourses reinforce these internal conditions by failing to acknowledge the complexity associated with the ‘politics of scale’. The local scale of change is not necessarily more manageable, or its actions likely to create a shared vision. Adaptation is reduced to performative tasks rather than connected processes, impacting the scope and effectiveness of change on-ground. Further, in this Australian case study, we see how local ‘doing’ is still subject to the cross-scale impacts of diminishing nation-state government resourcing reflecting the far-reaching consequences of small-government austerity models, and the foisting of responsibility for adaptation to the least powerful and least resourced sectors of civic society. We conclude with the idea that if local adaptation is to lead to transformative outcomes that connect to a global transcendence to affect climate direction, systems of governance need to be linked to strategic visions that deliberately engage with the ‘politics of scale’, and to affirm more complex processes in engaging with the fluidity of a purposeful global-local nexus. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Australia; Climate change; Local action; Transformation","adaptation; aquifer; Article; climate change; drought; environmental change; environmental policy; estuary; funding; global climate; government; grazing management; habitat quality; human; landscape; landscape ecology; local adaptation; migrant bird; nonhuman; platypus (mammal); politics; priority journal; river; social adaptation; water quality; wetland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100378483

In the past 10 years, the central government has implemented the Rural Regeneration Project (RRP) aimed at revitalization and sustainable development in rural Taiwan. During the project’s implementation, communities have faced several disasters as a result of climate change-induced extreme rainfall events. Perceptions and adaptation practices of climate change-induced extreme events are critical to community sustainability and resilience. The gap between perceived and actual risks that communities experience creates challenges for policy-makers in achieving sustainability goals. This study aims to evaluate the perceived climate change-induced flooding hazard perceptions compared to the scientific projection and actual hazard events in 287 rural communities implementing the RRP. This study revealed consistency in risk perception, in that communities facing high potential exposure to extreme rainfall showed higher awareness of various impacts of climate change. However, when comparing climate actions, communities exposed to low-potential hazard areas had a relatively higher degree of recognition of the benefits of adaptation to climate change. Moreover, 59 rural communities with low awareness and exposed to high potentials of extreme events were widely distributed among hills of western, southern, and northern Taiwan, where compound disasters such as mudslides can occur. This research suggests that there is a need to integrate climate change planning and work with communities to bridge the gap between perceived and actual climate risks. In particular, capacity training, counseling services, and implementation of adaptation practices should be integrated into institutional planning and management for providing assistance in disaster prevention, relief, and post-event restoration; also, encouraging climate actions can directly improve community resilience toward climate change. While investing in the sustainable development of rural communities is largely based on revitalizing economic development, this study revealed the link to ensure resilience and social-ecological sustainability in rural communities under climate change impacts. © 2021 by the authors.

Since many resources are attributed to these buildings, their design should consider a proper performance-based construction economy and environmental sustainable development. This research introduces a new concept for a bundled tall building founded on the use of a multi-core-outrigger system, which is additionally enriched with diagrid structures. The concept is inspired by the bamboo plant and follows the biomimetic design principles for the structural organization and performance-based criteria for optimizing the lateral stiffness and for shaping the cross section. Particularly, the incident wind speed is maximized to exploit Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs), which are located along the whole building height at the center of the bundled towers. The building morphogenesis is accomplished by a multistep methodology that is fully developed in a parametric environment and includes structural and computational fluid dynamic analyses. With the aim of validating the proposed concept, a case study of a 320-m-tall three-core building has been designed for the city of Pisa, Italy. The use of VAWTs results in an annual emissions reduction of about 10 kgCO2/m2. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","bamboo; biomimetics; concrete core; diagrid; genetic algorithm; optimization; outrigger; wind turbines","Biomimetics; Computational fluid dynamics; Emission control; Office buildings; Sustainable development; Tall buildings; Wind; Wind power; Wind turbines; Biomimetic design; Building height; Economy and environmental; Emissions reduction; Lateral stiffness; Performance based; Structural organization; Vertical axis wind turbines; Architectural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100490798

Given the limited financial resources of most municipalities, the main objective of this paper is to provide a less costly decision support model for the assessment of air pollutant concentrations, particularly SO2. In our article ""Using a statistic Approach: An Application for Assessing Concentration of Air Pollutants"" published in 2019, we used the Six Sigma approach, in its ""analysis"" section, for the evaluation of the daily average of SO2 concentrations measured during the one-year period. The application of statistical tests made it possible to evaluate the compliance of this pollutant with the limit value set by the standards for the protection of the environment.

The services that forests provide enable the forest-dependent people and communities to meet their livelihood needs and well-being. Nevertheless, the world’s forests face a twin environmental problem of deforestation and forest degradation (D&FD), resulting in ubiquitous depletion of forest biodiversity and ecosystem services and eventual loss of forest cover. Ghana, like any tropical forest developing country, is not immune to these human-caused D&FD. This paper reviews Ghana’s D&FD driven by a plethora of pressures, despite many forest policies and interventions to ensure sustainable management and forest use. The review is important as Ghana is experiencing an annual D&FD rate of 2%, equivalent to 135,000 hectares loss of forest cover. Although some studies have focused on the causes of D&FD on Ghana’ forests, they failed to show the chain of causal links of drivers that cause D&FD. This review fills the knowledge and practice gap by adopting the Driver-Pressures-State-Impacts-Responses (DPSIR) analytical framework to analyse the literature-based sources of causes D&FD in Ghana. Specifically, the analysis identified agriculture expansion, cocoa farming expansion, illegal logging, illegal mining, population growth and policy failures and lapses as the key drivers of Ghana’s D&FD. The study uses the DPSIR analytical framework to show the chain of causal links that lead to the country’s D&FD and highlights the numerous interventions required to reverse and halt the ubiquitous perpetual trend of D&FD in Ghana. Similar tropical forest countries experiencing D&FD will find the review most useful to curtail the menace. © 2021 by the authors.

The present study assessed air quality and its association with human mortality rates during the lockdown by estimating changes observed in air pollutants (CO, NO2, O3, SO2, PM10 and PM2.5) between the lockdown (April 1–May 31) and prelockdown (January 1–March 31) periods, as well as by comparing the air quality data of lockdown period with the same interval of previous 5 years (2015–2019). Concentrations of NO2 (− 29%), SO2 (− 55%) and PM10 (− 11%) declined and the contents of CO (+ 1.1%), PM2.5 (+ 19%) and O3 (+ 63%) increased during the lockdown compared to the prelockdown period. This study also estimated that NO2, SO2, CO, PM10 and PM2.5 reduced by 19–36%, and O3 enhanced by 14% compared to the average of 2015–2019. Reduction in traffic as well as less emission from vehicle exhausts led to remarkable decline in NO2, SO2 and PM10. The significant positive associations of PM2.5, CO and O3 with the numbers of COVID-19 infections and deaths, however, underscored the necessity to enforce air pollution regulations to protect human health in one of the important cities of the northern hemisphere.

In local scale climate change is expressed often as climate phenomenon such as El-Nino South Oscillation (ENSO), Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) and Dipole Mode Index (DMI). This condition caused many problems at the local scale especially in urban areas. Major hydrometeorological disasters such as floods and droughts impacted community daily life. Therefore, to deal with those hydrometeorological disasters, cities need to develop mitigation mechanisms based on data and information of future weather conditions.

The health burden of European CPP emission-induced PM2.5, estimated with the Global Exposure Mortality Model, amounts to at least 16 800 (CI95 14 800-18 700) excess deaths per year over the European domain. We identified an underestimation of the emissions magnitude and correcting for it doubles CPP-attributed annual excess mortality to 33 900 (CI95 33 000-37 600) per year. Due to the non-linearity of exposure-responses, especially at relatively low concentrations, these estimates represent lower limits of possible health benefits for the EU-28 states.

In addition to their industrial importance, FDHs also play a crucial role in the maintenance of a reducing environment to combat oxidative stress in plants. Therefore, it is important to investigate the response of NAD+-dependent FDH against both temperature and H2O2, to understand the defense mechanisms, and to increase its stability under oxidative stress conditions.

Results showed that the single mutant, M234L (0.72 s−1 mM−1), and the triple mutant, M225L/M234L/M243L (0.55 s−1 mM−1), have higher catalytic efficiency than the native enzyme. Substitution of methionine by leucine on the position of 243 increased the free energy gain by 670 J mol−1. The most remarkable results in chemical stability were seen for double and triple mutants, cumulatively. Double and triple substitution of Met to Leu (M225L/M243L and M225L/M243L/M234L) reduce the kefin by a factor of 2 (12.3×10−5 and 12.8×10−5 s−1, respectively. Key points • The closer the residue to NAD+, in which we substituted methionine to leucine, the lower the stability against H2O2we observed. • The significant gain in the Tmvalue for the M243L mutant was observed as +5°C. • Residue 234 occupies a critical position for oxidation defense mechanisms.

Importantly, they act as a natural sink for atmospheric CO2 and play a pivotal role to offset climate change and related environmental perturbations. Unfortunately, due to the mounting pressure of the increasing human population to sustain a livelihood for food, timber, medicine, tropical forests are subjected to land-use change, deforestation, and degradation by industrial activities, especially mining. In addition to this, global climate change (increasing CO2 concentration, temperature, drought, and fires might have a disproportional effect on carbon (C) flux in the tropical forests. The changes above should be considered in tropical dry forests (TDFs) research because these forests often neglected over rain forests despite having a sizeable geographical extent and significant pool of C in vegetation and soil. In the wake of the elevated concentration of atmospheric CO2, the net gain in net primary productivity (NPP) and forest growth rate is getting consideration for tropical forests today, meanwhile other factors like temperature, drought, and fire likely to negate the positive effect of increased CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Recent studies designate tropical forests overall as C neutral since the loss of carbon due to deforestation and degradation is compensated by regrowth and recovery of past disturbances. So, there is an immense potential in the tropical forests to curb elevated CO2 if policies and afforestation provisions and initiatives such as REDD+ if implemented effectively at the global level. In this chapter, we address the current state of knowledge on C stock and flux, and the magnitude of various disturbances (land-use change, deforestation), climatic perturbations (elevated CO2, increased temperature, drought, and fires) on carbon balance in the tropical forests. Furthermore, we also discuss various research gaps for sustaining its structure, function, and ecosystem services; and recent methodological advancements for the estimation of C stock in the tropical forests. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Carbon dynamics; Climate change; Degradation; Restoration; Tropical forests",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108247315

One major challenge is to achieve low emissions over the full operating map as required by Real Driving Emissions (RDE) legislation. Gasoline Compression Ignition (GCI), an advanced combustion concept, has shown potential to increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. GCI harnesses gasoline's low reactivity for longer ignition delay, thus promoting partially premixed air-fuel mixture for efficient combustion. To maintain low engine-out NOx over the load range, high Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) is required that consequently elevates boost pressure requirements. To meet the high boost and EGR demands, while minimizing pumping losses require air-system optimization. This work presents a detailed investigation of EGR system optimization for a prototype 2.6L, four-cylinder, Light-Duty (LD) Gasoline Compression Ignition (GCI) engine using RON92 gasoline at a geometric compression ratio (CR) of 17. Several alternative EGR configurations were evaluated, including conventional layouts such as high-pressure EGR (HP-EGR) loop, low-pressure EGR (LP-EGR) loop, dual-loop EGR (DL-EGR) and a novel EGR configuration. A GT-Power based 1-D engine model was used, to quantify and compared the EGR configurations candidates over both steady-state and transient engine operations. Time-to-torque (TTT) and EGR delivery time were compared. The HP-EGR alone configuration appeared unfit, by causing inefficient turbocharging, Whereas, the LP-EGR only improved complemented turbocharger performance at the expense of high pumping losses at high engine speeds. A dual-loop EGR system offered a more optimized engine system performance. A customized (novel) EGR configuration, demonstrated performance benefits equivalent to a dual-loop EGR system without the complexity and packaging issues of DL-EGR system. For steady-state engine operation, the system exhibited pumping benefit in the range of 20 to 90 kPa at engine speed over 2500 RPM. For idle to 2500 RPM full load transient engine condition, the novel EGR configuration enabled approximately two times faster EGR delivery, but, also caused a noticeable delay in TTT, compared to a conventional LP-EGR configuration. Using an integrated starter generator (ISG) assist, the load response lag fully disappeared and the engine system demonstrated almost instantaneous torque. The novel EGR system not only provided the best system performance benefits but also offered superior trade-offs for cost, complexity and integration. © 2021 SAE International.

Sweden, often seen as progressive in climate change issues, has struggled in adopting a sufficient local climate adaptation organization. This article aimed to describe and analyze the climate adaptation organization in 13 Swedish municipalities from five perspectives: Problem framing, administrative and political agency, administrative and political structures, measures and solutions, and the role of learning. The mapping of these perspectives provides an opportunity to analyze barriers to local climate adaptation. Key policy documents have been studied including climate adaptation plans, crisis management plans, and regulatory documents, as well as documents from private consultants. This study showed that few municipalities have a formal organization for climate adaptation, clear structures, political support, and specific climate adaptation plans. At the same time, many of the municipalities are planning for transformation, due to a push from the county board, a lead agency in climate adaptation. There are also ample networks providing opportunities for learning among municipalities and regions. This study concluded that one key barrier is the lack of focus and prioritization in a majority of the municipalities, leaving the administrators, often planners, in a more activist position. The need for organizational mainstreaming and resources is emphasized. © 2021 by the authors.

Using waste as raw materials allows the efficient production of multiple sustainable products. Existing processes operating with well-known technology can be adapted to use waste raw materials by using the key-component technique, which is based on the production of multiple products from wastes. The proposed technique is based on raw material circulation between plants and could provide improvements on three levels: • production of basic (methanol) products from waste • further product (formaldehyde) manufacturing from basic products and non-reacted components (N2, H2, CO, CO2) after separation, using pressure swing adsorption (PSA), for production of ammonia, urea and glycolic acid. • production of urea formaldehyde resin and hexamine from second level products.This study involves environmental protection topic related to the utilization of waste materials to generate multiple sustainable products. Methanol plants can replace natural gas with flue gas and municipal solid wastes. Different products including formaldehyde, ammonia, urea, glycolic acid, urea formaldehyde resin and hexamine can be manufactured during the synthesis of gas for methanol production and from by-product surplus.

Low thermal conductivity, low volumetric heat capacity thermal barrier coatings tend to reduce the gas-wall temperature difference, the driving potential for heat transfer from the gas to the combustion chamber surfaces. This paper presents a coupling between an analytical methodology for multi-layer coated wall surface temperature prediction with a fully calibrated production model in a commercial system-level simulation software package (GT-Power). The wall surface temperature at each time step was calculated efficiently by convolving the engine wall response function with the time-varying surface boundary condition, i. e., in-cylinder heat flux and coolant temperature. This tool allows the wall to be treated either as spatially uniform with one set of properties, or with independent head/piston/liner components. Steady state results are presented for five modern, engine-specific coating architectures selected from the literature. The coating performance, on a system-level basis, was found to be engine-condition dependent. The optimum material for one performance parameter may not provide any benefit to another. To comprehensively compare TBCs relative to the uncoated baseline, a full transient drive cycle simulation was performed for two coatings using the 20-minute certification Non-Road Transient Cycle (NRTC). Experimental boundary conditions along with ECU data were provided from production engine test cell data. A reduction of in-cylinder heat transfer and fuel consumption was found for both coatings, while exhaust enthalpy was increased by 0.5% in spite of the fuel mass saving. For a piston-coated scenario, a maximum of 1.5% reduction in fuel consumption and consequently a similar level of brake specific CO2 reduction was realized over the drive cycle, depending on the coating architecture. © 2021 SAE International.

The landforms in the central segment of Northern Hill Range (NHR), which marks the surface expression of Kachchh Mainland Fault (KMF), are investigated in this study to understand the role of climatic changes and tectonic activity during the time of aggradation and incision. Geomorphologically, the KMF is expressed by the presence of ∼80–150 m high E-W trending escarpment. The central segment of KMF preserves the alluvial fan surfaces which have been truncated at several places with anomalous incision. Conventional morphometric analyses indicate that the KMF is affected by tectonic activity in recent times. The optical chronology of oldest alluvial fan dated from back limb and forelimb of an anticline was around 28 ka (with gradual onset of aridity) and 25 ka (with peak aridity). This arid phase is correlated with enhanced tectonic uplift along the KMF, which is manifested in the form of strath terraces and incision of river valleys. The oldest activity pre-dated to 25 ka and continued till 14 ka and there was a tectonic stability between 14 and 8 ka. The younger activity began soon after 8 ka and continuous till today, which is most likely caused by the manifestation of the Early Holocene climatic optima that lead to severe erosional processes. The younger Middle Holocene (4.3 ka) event is correlated with enhanced uplift and was accountable for the down cutting of the ﬁll sediments and the Mesozoic bedrock. The study suggests that the deformation pattern close to KMF is the result of localized compressive stress generated between two fault segments. © 2020 The Authors","Active deformation; Geomorphic indices; Kachchh; Kachchh mainland fault (KMF); Optical dating",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102040202

The device consists of a rotating cylindrical cell with inner dimensions of 4.5 cm radius and 1 mm height, while it operates at 5000 and 8000 rpm. Various cases of the CO2/AC system are examined under a rotation field: in particular, (a) solid at vacuum, (b) gas without solid, (c) gas/solid at a non-equilibrium state of the adsorption process, and (d) gas/solid near an equilibrium state of the adsorption process. Micro-fragmentation of solid particles is observed at 8000 rpm but not at 5000 rpm; the latter is then chosen as the preferable speed for the rest of the experiments. During rotation of the gas, a well is noticed at the pressure curve, the size of which is in accordance with theoretical predictions of the behavior of a spinning gas. Rotation at an early stage of the adsorption process can suppress the filling time of a rotating storage reservoir to half of its value. Rotation near the equilibrium point reveals an enhanced adsorption capacity of the solid.

However, the rapid progress of incineration facilities construction raise questions such as will there be chances of cement kiln co-processing (CKC) to be utilized and promoted as an MSW complementary technology in China, and how will it develop in the future? This paper obtained numerous up-to-date data and information as support evidences to quantitatively evaluate the MSW treatment pressure and its temporal and spatial evolution in Chinese provinces, and estimate the CKC promotion and emission reduction potential for adapting to regional MSW demand. Results showed that CKC still has a great promotion potential. China's MSW treatment system was under long-term pressure and might have a shortage of 4.50 million tons in 2020. Provincial level analysis indicated that CKC could not only completely filled the treatment gap, but also replaced 78.05 million tons of landfill capacity. The resulting environmental benefits were significant, with a reduction of 2.55E+10 kg CO2 eq. and 4.47E+07 kg SO2 eq. from a life-cycle perspective for GWP and AP etc., respectively. Hence, CKC contributed to relieving the pressure on MSW management (MSWM) and improving environmental performance. By developing more precise regional planning, some of the issues that had hindered the spread of CKC could be addressed. The main findings of this paper might be influential in guiding the universalization of CKC in China and other regions. © 2020","Cement kiln co-processing; China; Emission reduction benefits; Municipal solid waste; Popularization potential; Regional disparities analysis","Artificial life; Cement industry; Cements; Emission control; Environmental management; Kilns; Life cycle; Regional planning; Sulfur dioxide; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Data and information; Emission reduction potentials; Environmental benefits; Environmental performance; Life cycle perspectives; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Temporal and spatial evolutions; Treatment capacity; Municipal solid waste; cement (construction material); emission control; incineration; municipal solid waste; quantitative analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; waste treatment; air pollution; Article; cement kiln co processing; China; consumer; environmental parameters; government; human; incineration; landfill; life cycle; measurement precision; municipal solid waste; pressure; quantitative analysis; rural area; urban area; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098937903

The long-term impact of atmospheric emissions from nonferrous metallurgy enterprises in Monchegorsk (Murmansk region) resulted in the formation of technogenic barrens with contaminated and highly degraded soils near the pollution source. During long-term monitoring, the current status and dynamics of soil properties have been assessed on permanent control plots on barrens and in birch and willow plantations after remediation performed in 2003–2008 by two methods: chemophytostabilization and covering of contaminated soils by an artificially created fertile layer. The research data of 2011, 2015, and 2018 indicate the continuing acidification of soils and their contamination by heavy metals. Despite the reduction in emissions, the concentrations of available heavy metals in the topsoil of barrens and chemophytostabilized plots do not decrease, and the constructed layers accumulate nickel, copper, cobalt, iron, cadmium, lead, and manganese. The nutrient supply of soils is steadily improved only when a fertile layer is applied. According to the results of the multivariate analysis, the soils of barrens and remediation plots are clearly separated in the space of the first two principal components as the soil properties are improved during remediation, and the positions of chemophytostabilization plots reflect the unstable improvements. Recommendations for the development of a strategy and diversification of methods for remediation of technogenic barrens should take into account different levels of soil pollution and degradation in the vicinity of nonferrous metallurgy enterprises and the need to comply with technological requirements and perform supporting measures. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","copper; heavy metals; nickel; nutrients; pollution; remediation; soil degradation","concentration (composition); copper; metallurgy; nickel; soil degradation; soil pollution; soil quality; strategic approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105197539

Many of these investment decisions are made at the territorial level, especially those related to the heating sector. When choosing the most suitable energy investments, decision makers need to consider several performance indicators—economic, social and environmental—simultaneously. In addition, decision makers face profound uncertainty concerning the future, as decisions on energy systems are always long-term investments. We aim to provide territorial decision makers with a simple decision-making framework that combines a robust decision-making method with multi-criteria analysis and allows the inclusion of territorial features. The main aim is to develope a simple tool that provides data to seek robust solutions which will perform well over a wide range of plausible futures. The method proposed is illustrated with a case study on renewable heating solutions based in France. Heat pumps or central biomass plants are robust in various future conditions, while current domestic natural gas based heating performs badly compared to the renewable technologies. © 2021 The Author(s)","Heating; Renewable energy; Robust decision-making; Territory; Vulnerability","Climate change; Decision making; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Natural gasoline plants; Climate change mitigation; Decision-making frameworks; Multi Criteria Analysis; Performance indicators; Renewable energy investments; Renewable energy technologies; Renewable technology; Social and environmental; Investments; alternative energy; climate change; decision analysis; greenhouse gas; international agreement; investment; mitigation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100446570

Remote sensing-based models are ideally suited to monitor ET over large areas, but ET partitioning estimates vary widely. The objective of this study was to evaluate the two-source energy balance (TSEB) model for seasonal ET partitioning using total, soil, and vine canopy energy balance fluxes measured over a vineyard in the Negev desert in Israel. Energy fluxes were evaluated with the original TSEB and three adapted versions using (1) measured soil heat flux, (2) optimized plant transpiration parameterization, and (3) measured soil and vine temperatures instead of composite surface temperature as model inputs. Optimization of plant transpiration parameters revealed a model tendency to underestimate transpiration due to underestimation of available energy and potential transpiration. Adaptations included, among others, accounting for higher leaf radiation absorption expected in dense clumped canopies, which increases available energy, and increasing the Priestley-Taylor coefficient from 1.26 to 2, which increases potential transpiration. While the original TSEB gave reasonable total energy fluxes, the vine energy fluxes were greatly underestimated. Both soil heat flux and plant transpiration adaptations improved modeled vine energy fluxes throughout the season under both well-watered and water-stressed conditions. However, the performance of the TSEB version using measured soil and vine temperatures was inferior to applying the standard TSEB with composite temperature. While daily energy fluxes could be estimated with reasonable accuracy, sub-daily fluxes proved to be more challenging and merit further research. Finally, changes in ET partitioning with canopy development and in response to water stress could be detected quite well albeit it with an underestimation of the transpiration fraction of ET, which, on average, amounted to 39% using standard TSEB and 6% with optimized plant transpiration parameters. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Evaporation; Evapotranspiration partitioning; Remote sensing; Row crop; Transpiration; TSEB","assessment method; energy balance; energy efficiency; energy flux; environmental modeling; evapotranspiration; flux measurement; forest canopy; numerical model; partitioning; performance assessment; remote sensing; soil water; vineyard; Israel; Negev; Southern District; Varanidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100058143

To reduce degradation risks, many archives adopt the use of archival boxes, among other means, to provide the necessary climate control and comply with strict legislation requirements regard-ing temperature and relative air humidity. A strict ambient indoor climate is assumed to provide adequate environmental conditions near objects. Guidelines and legislation provide requirements for ambient indoor climate parameters, but often do not consider other factors that influence the near-object environment, such as the use of archival boxes, airflow distribution and archival rack placement. This study aimed to provide more insight into the relation between the ambient indoor conditions in repositories and the hygrothermal conditions surrounding the collection. Comprehen-sive measurements were performed in a case study archive to collect ambient, local and near-object conditions. Both measurements and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling were used to research temperature/relative humidity gradients and airflow distribution with a changing rack ori-entation, climate control strategy and supply as well as exhaust set-up in a repository. The following conclusions are presented: (i) supplying air from one air handling unit to multiple repositories on different floors leads to small temperature differences between them. Differences in ambient and local climates are noticed; (ii) archival boxes mute and delay variations in ambient conditions as expected—however, thermal radiation from the building envelope may have a large influence on the climate conditions in a box; (iii) adopting night reduction for energy conservation results in an increased influence of the external climate, with adequate insulation, this effect should be mitigated; and (iv) the specific locations of the supply air and extraction of air resulted in a vertical gradient of temperature and insufficient mixing of air, and adequate ventilation strategies should enhance sufficient air mixing in combination with the insulation of external walls, and gradient forming should be reduced. © 2021 by the authors.

Emphasis on model output is made for the September–October–November 2017–2019 seasonal period. Part of the Central African region, five sub-regions, was identified. The simulated temperatures are compared to the daily climatology of near-surface temperature of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis fifth-generation and the National Center for Environmental Prediction datasets, while the simulated precipitations are compared to the precipitation of the Global Precipitation Climatology Project and Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations datasets. In most analyses, the Grell scheme with Arakawa–Schubert closure assumption tends to have the best index of agreement but its spatial distribution shows underestimation of rainfall. Generally, the Emanuel convection scheme is more suitable to represent rainfall and temperature over Central Africa. Compared to our previous study (Komkoua Mbienda et al., International Journal of Climatology, 2017, 37, 328–342), the present study shows that we have to pay attention to the choice of convective scheme when using any version of RegCM4 released for climate study over Central Africa. This choice is strictly related to the RegCM version released, the study years and the season. It is important to note, however, that the results presented are a preliminary study of the response to the selected convection schemes. The analysis uses a limited sample of climate model simulation (three model years for each convection scheme). Follow-up work, featuring longer duration climate simulations and a full assessment of statistical significance, is therefore required to confirm the robustness of the analysis presented. © 2021 The Authors.

The diversity of the energy transformation in the V4 countries was examined by using two qualitative methods, including literature analysis and comparative analysis. The timeframe of the study was set for the period from 2020 to 2030, as these years are crucial for the implementation of the European Green Deal Programme. Four diagnostic features were taken into account in the analysis: the share of RES in final energy consumption, reduction of CO2 emissions in the non-Emissions Trading System (ETS) sector, date of withdrawal of coal from the economy, and energy efficiency. The analysis shows that the V4 countries have different approaches and levels of energy transformation in their economies. Poland is in the most difficult situation, being the most dependent on the production of electricity from coal, as well as having the largest number of employees in the coal and around coal sector. The other countries of the group can base their transformation on nuclear energy, as each of them has at least four such power units. The increased use of biomass for energy and heat production is the most important stimulus for Renewable Energy Sources (RES) growth in the analysed countries. The ambivalent attitude of the political elite to unconventional sources in the four analysed countries significantly hinders the development of certain forms of green energy. However, it has been observed that an increasing proportion of the population, especially those living in regions of the country where there is no fossil fuel mining industry, has a positive attitude towards energy transformation. The study is the first that shows the state of involvement in the process of systemic change of the Visegrad Group countries. The results can serve as a starting point for understanding the reticence of this group of European countries towards the transformation phenomenon, as well as contributing to further research on the implementation of closed-circuit economies in the Visegrad Group countries. © 2021 by the author.

Recent studies suggest that increasing tree cover can make a substantial contribution to negative emissions, with the tropics being the most suitable region from a biogeophysical perspective. Yet these studies typically do not account for subsequent carbon cycle and climate responses to large-scale land-use change. Here we quantify the maximum potential temperature and CO2 benefits from pantropical forest restoration, including the Earth system response, using a fully coupled, emission-driven Earth system model (HadGEM2-ES). We perform an idealised experiment where all land use in the tropics is stopped and vegetation is allowed to recover, on top of an aggressive mitigation scenario (RCP2.6).We find that tropical restoration of 1529 Mha increases carbon stored in live biomass by 130 Pg C by 2100 CE. Whilst avoiding deforestation and tropical restoration in the tropics removes 42 Pg C compared to RCP2.6, the subsequent reduction in extratropical and ocean carbon uptake means that carbon in the atmosphere only reduces by 18 PgC by 2100. The resulting small CO2 (9 ppm) benefit does not translate to a detectable reduction in global surface air temperature compared to the control experiment. The greatest carbon benefit is achieved 30–50 years after restoration before the Earth system response adjusts to the new land-use regime and declining fossil fuel use. Comparing our results with previous modelling studies, we identify two model-independent key points: (i) in a world where emission reductions follow the Paris Agreement, restoration is best deployed immediately, and (ii) the global carbon cycle response to reduced emissions limits the efficacy of negative emissions technologies by more than half.

Developments and innovations in energy technologies play an essential role in achieving these goals. Therefore, any country should use energy R&D expenditures, which are the primary source of energy innovation, most optimally. This paper aims to investigate the environmental efficiency of R&D expenditures for energy efficiency, renewable energy, hydro and fuel cells, fossil energy, nuclear energy, and other power and storage technologies in OECD countries using data envelopment analysis (DEA) and bootstrap DEA. Estimation findings indicate that only the USA ensures the environmental efficiency in energy R&D expenditures among OECD countries. Although Japan, Canada, France, Germany, and Italy cannot provide environmental efficiency in energy R&D, their scores are very close to the efficiency frontier. Portugal, Hungary, and Slovak Republic are the countries with the lowest environmental efficiency in energy R&D expenditures. At the end of the investigation, this paper also provides an empirical estimation of the extent to which inefficient countries should change their R&D spending to achieve efficiency. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Bootstrap DEA; CO2 emissions; Energy R&D expenditures; Environmental efficiency; Sustainable environment","bootstrapping; data envelopment analysis; efficiency measurement; environmental assessment; expenditure; OECD; research and development; Canada; France; Germany; Hungary; Italy; Japan; Portugal; Slovakia; United States; Canada; economic development; France; Germany; health care cost; Hungary; Italy; Japan; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; Portugal; renewable energy; Slovakia; Canada; Economic Development; France; Germany; Health Expenditures; Hungary; Italy; Japan; Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development; Portugal; Renewable Energy; Slovakia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098790503

Partial coverage manifests itself by the presence of non-zero residual flux in the core of saturated H2 absorption lines. The residual flux can be observed either only at the bottom of absorption lines redshifted on top of quasar emission lines, in which case part of the broad line region (BLR) is not covered, or in all absorption lines, in case some continuum source is not covered. Among 35 H2 absorption clouds in 14 quasar spectra obtained with the VLT-UVES or Keck-HIRES spectrographs, we detect partial coverage of the BLR for 13 clouds. This result suggests that the probability of partial coverage of the QSO BLR by a distant H2 absorption cloud is about 40 per cent. For four systems towards Q 0013−0029, Q 0405−4418, Q 0812+3208, and J 2100−0641, partial coverage is detected for the first time. We determine the theoretical probability of partial coverage of the BLR by a distant H2 cloud as a function of the ratio between the cloud and the BLR sizes. Using this model, we obtain an estimate of the characteristic BLR radius of 50+−1923 light days. This is similar to the estimate of the BLR size obtained by reverberation-mapping analysis (-100 light days). © 2020 The Author(s)","Cosmology: observations; ISM: clouds; ISM: molecules; Quasars: absorption lines",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099661575

At a time when both risk assessment and particle effects on mortality were controversial, John's thoughtful analysis of the issues and data relevant to assessing long-term mortality risks from airborne particles provides a comprehensive primer that is still relevant today. The paper includes a critical literature review, a meta-analysis of published particle effect estimates, and a reanalysis of landmark cross-sectional mortality data set. EPA criteria documents and related literature had largely discounted the cross-sectional mortality findings on the basis of criticisms about exposure assessment and control for confounding. John's analysis reached a different conclusion, that is, “we are of the opinion that the cross-sectional studies reflect a causal relationship between exposure to airborne particles and premature mortality. From our point of view it is as likely that parameters have been underestimated … as that they are overestimated due to confounding.” The paper acknowledged the impossibility of precisely quantifying the long-term mortality effect of particle air pollution, and that there is a need for further research utilizing alternative approaches. These conclusions foreshadow the emergence, a decade later, of the influential particulate matter (PM) mortality findings from the Harvard Six Cities and American Cancer Society cohort studies. I conclude by suggesting that well designed cross-sectional studies could play a role in identifying exposure–response associations in resource-poor settings where there is a paucity of local evidence to support air pollution regulations. © 2021 Society for Risk Analysis","Chronic effects; cross-sectional mortality; particulate matter; sulfate","Air pollution; Pollution control; Air pollution risk assessments; American Cancer Society; Causal relationships; Cross-sectional study; Exposure assessment; Particulate Matter; Pollution regulation; Premature mortality; Risk assessment",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100310444

This phenomenon is shown to have undercut the effectiveness of the Kyoto Protocol. Considering the increasingly globalised nature of the world economy, carbon leakage may have an even greater potential under the Paris Agreement some 15 years later. Although a more global approach to combatting climate change, the Paris Agreement is susceptible to leakage because of its lack of policy harmonization and enforcement mechanisms. Here, we perform the first quantitative analysis of the potential for carbon leakage under Paris, using the GTAP-E general equilibrium model of the world economy with energy and carbon emissions to analyse leakage effects under six scenarios. Two of these scenarios analyse regions implementing climate policy in isolation, two greater participation, but still not harmonized, global Paris Agreement policy, and a further two analyse the effect of a US withdrawal from the agreement. Both cases are considered with and without the US withdrawal. Our analysis demonstrates that there is potential for significant carbon leakage effects, in line with the rates produced from studies on the Kyoto Protocol. Depending on model elasticities, we find medium carbon leakage in the range of 1–9% (with a central estimate of 3–4%) under co-ordinated Paris Agreement policy across countries, compared to high leakage of 8–31% when countries operate in isolation. However, scenarios where the USA withdraws from the agreement result in roughly doubling of leakage rates, in the range of 3–16% (central estimate 7%), which demonstrates the vulnerability of the Paris Agreement in its current form. To limit leakage effects, greater policy co-ordination to achieve consistent implicit carbon prices is needed across countries. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon leakage; Climate change mitigation; Paris Agreement","Climate change; Carbon emissions; Carbon leakage; Climate policy; Enforcement mechanisms; General equilibrium models; Global approaches; KYOTO protocol; Leakage effects; Carbon; carbon emission; environmental policy; policy implementation; pollution tax; vulnerability; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104561876

To increase the value-added chemical production, the oxidation state of active metals should be easily converted to oxidized or reduced states in order to adsorb or provide an oxygen atom efficiently into methane. Here, we firstly report that lithium incorporating molybdenum oxide with silica supports significantly enhances HCHO production in virtue of redox-driven restructuring of active molybdenum sites. In reduction conditions under CH4 flow, lithium ions are inserted into the molybdenum-oxide phase by forming lithium molybdenum oxide (LiyMoO3) nanoclusters and conversely extracted by O2 oxidation. Due to the redox migration of lithium ions and reconstruction of LiyMoO3 nanoclusters under the reaction process, the oxidation state of active molybdenum centers is effectively controlled to both oxidized and reduced states. These findings provide insight into the distinct role of lithium ions in various catalytic systems and suggest new strategies for developing active sites for selective oxidation area. © 2020","Formaldehyde; Lithium ions; Lithium molybdenum oxide nanocluster; Selective methane oxidation","Catalytic oxidation; Ions; Metals; Methane; Molybdenum oxide; Nanoclusters; Oxidation; Silica; Catalytic system; Lithium molybdenum oxides; Methane oxidation; Reaction process; Reduction conditions; Selective oxidation; Silica supports; Value-added chemicals; Lithium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097769135

With this in mind, the current paper uses multi-regional input-output analysis to investigate CO2 emissions and value-added embodied in China-Brazil trade. We propose the use of value-added exports, rather than gross exports, to more accurately estimate the economic benefits of trade. We find enormous increases in both CO2 emissions and value-added embodied in exports for China and Brazil between 2000 and 2014. During this period, China's position as a net CO2 emissions and net value-added exporter vis-à-vis Brazil deepens. Major sources of increasing embodied CO2 exports for China were the basic materials and electricity industries and for Brazil were the basic materials, agriculture and mining industries. Estimates of net carbon intensities reveal advantages for China in electronics and for Brazil in agriculture and mining. Structural decomposition analysis shows that the changing consumption in China and Brazil as well as the changing structure of intermediate exports from China to Brazil were important sources of increasing embodied CO2 emissions. This latter finding was possible due to the method proposed in this paper of decomposing the production structure into the domestic, export and import production structures. In line with the key findings, various implications and emission abatement policies are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Brazil; China; Embodied CO2 emissions; Multi-regional input–output; Structural decomposition analysis; Value-added exports","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Carbon; Commerce; Decomposition; Developing countries; Economic analysis; Carbon intensity; Changing structures; Economic benefits; Electricity industry; Emission abatement; Input output analysis; Production structures; Structural decomposition analysis; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100640319

The foreign contribution estimated with the CREATE 2015 to the annual mean PM2.5 in Jeonnam was lower than those to Incheon, Seoul, and Jeonbuk by 26%, 19%, and 5%, respectively, and higher than those to Ulsan and Busan by 29% and 28%. The difference from the relative foreign contribution averaged over the local authorities varied from -10% to +10% (-2~+2 μg/m3). The domestic and the provincial self-contributions, estimated with the Clean Air Policy Support System 2016 emissions inventory, to the annual PM2.5 concentrations in Jeonnam was 6.9 (3.6~13.2), and 3.7 (1.7~9.6) μg/m3, respectively. Note that those were relatively lowered over the coastal and island areas, especially for the local authorities in the west coast. It is, therefore, important to deliberate the air quality management plan in Jeonnam to improve PM2.5 concentrations including those blind spots. Inter-provincial PM2.5 contributions appeared to be as significant as the intra-provincial contributions for the local authorities. For example, local authorities located in northern Jeonnam encountered the annual mean contributions from Jeonbuk and Chungnam as high as 1.8 μg/m3 (Jangseong), and 1.4 μg/m3 (Yeonggwang), respectively. On the other hand, emissions from Gyeongnam increased the annual mean PM2.5 concentrations in Gwangyang by 1.2 μg/m3. The averaged PM2.5 self-contributions for the twenty-two local authorities was 1.5 μg/m3 which was lower than the contributions from the rest of Jeonnam (2.2 μg/m3). However, uncertainties in the emissions inventory used in this study have clearly led to the over-predictions of the contributions in some monitoring sites, which should be corrected to better understand the source-receptor relationship in Jeonnam. © 2021, Journal of Korean Society for Atmospheric Environment.

Generally, driving cars emit a considerable amount of particulate matter (PM), and this acts as a major source of PM in urban areas. While exhaust PM emissions are strictly regulated and controlled by the government, non-exhaust PM emissions from tire-wear and break-wear have been overlooked. Additionally, as CB is tightly bound in the rubber matrix of tire-wear particles (TWP), the possibility of nanoparticle exposure from TWP has also been ruled out. However, TWP could be fragmented through the weathering effect, continuous abrasion on the road, and resuspension. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the potential release of nano-CB from TWP through the weathering effect using a ball milling process. With increasing milling time, countless free-bound nanoparticles were detached from the parent TWP samples. Based on several analyses of elemental composition, morphological change, and crystallinity, it is possible to define the free-bound nanoparticles as nano-CB. Additionally, nanosized carbon-based materials were found in real-time field tests on highways. Therefore, it has been confirmed that nanosized carbon particles can be released from TWP or exhaust PM. © 2021 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry","Carbon black; Non-exhaust emissions; Particulate matter; Tire wear; Weathering","Ball milling; Crystallinity; Milling (machining); Nanoparticles; Particulate emissions; Tires; Wear of materials; Weathering; Ball milling process; Carbon based materials; Elemental compositions; Morphological changes; Nanoparticle exposures; Reinforcing materials; Tire wear particles; Weathering effects; Carbon black",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100613214

Two decades since the start of building energy policy enforcement, Korean experts believe that it is time to evaluate its impact. However, few studies have systematically and extensively examined the energy consumption characteristics of the non-residential building stock. In this study, a framework development is implemented for defining non-residential prototypical office buildings based on Korea’s first large-scale non-residential building survey result from the Korea Energy Economics Institute (KEEI). Then, a detailed building energy model of the defined prototypical building is constructed to verify the model’s energy estimation against observed energy consumption. As an application of the model, a case study for energy policy evaluation utilizing the constructed prototypical building model is presented. Every researcher and county may have their own circumstances when gathering definition data. However, by using the best available representative data, this suggested framework may result in informed decisions regarding energy policy development and evaluation. In addition, the mitigation of greenhouse gases from buildings may be expedited. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we analyzed the self- and inter-provincial contributions to the PM2.5 concentrations in Jeonbuk by applying the Comprehensive Air quality Model with eXtensions with Particulate Source Apportionment Technology (CAMx-PSAT). The foreign contributions to the annual PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 13.1 to 17.3 μg/m3 in the fourteen local authorities in Jeonbuk. The domestic contributions in the local authorities calculated by adding the self-contributions and neighboring provincial contributions ranged from 5.9 to 12.0 μg/m3. It implies that both the foreign and domestic emissions are important to alleviate the PM2.5 concentrations in Jeonbuk. On top of the selfcontributions of Jeonbuk, the contributions of Chungnam and Jeonnam in the vicinity played significant roles in determining the annual mean PM2.5 concentrations in Jeonbuk. Meanwhile, it was estimated that daily PM2.5 concentrations in Jeonbuk can be decreased by up to 15 μg/m3 by controlling the nationwide emissions, especially when the daily PM2.5 concentration is higher than 50 μg/m3. It is noticed that the portion of inorganic ions in the domestic contributions increased as high as 90% when the daily mean PM2.5 concentrations in Jeonbuk increased. Accordingly, reductions of the precursor emissions such as SO2, NOx, and NH3 would be effective to decrease the occurrences of high PM2.5 days (>50 μg/m3) in Jeonbuk. The site-by-site model performance evaluations show that there still exist uncertainties in the emissions used in this study. Therefore, prior to developing a comprehensive air quality improvement plan in Jeonbuk, the preparation of local emissions able to explain the details of local air quality is required. © 2021,Journal of Korean Society for Atmospheric Environment.

Recently, a heterogeneous cobalt catalyst supported on NH4OH-treated carbon (Co/N[sbnd]C) has gained attention. However, the structure of the active site, the identity of the active phase, the role of NH4OH treatment and the effect of thermal activation have remained elusive. Herein, in situ Raman spectroscopy showed the absence of crystalline cobalt oxide phases, such as CoO or Co3O4, in the working catalyst. An intense Raman band at 810 cm−1 was detected in the as-synthesized catalyst, which corresponds to μCo-peroxo species formed via auto-oxidation of the [Co(NH3)x]2+ sites during the drying step. UV–vis DRS absorbance bands at ∼286, 340 and 560 nm indicated that a mixture of octahedral Co3+ and Co2+ is present in the as-synthesized catalyst. During thermal treatment in inert atmosphere, the 265 and 810 cm−1 Raman bands diminished signifying the reduction of μCo-peroxo sites, with the oxidation of some NH3 ligands to N2O(g), indicated by an IR doublet at ∼2225 cm−1. UV–vis DRS during thermal treatment corroborated the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+, with Co2+ sites coordinated in a tetrahedral fashion, as indicated by a new absorbance band at ∼600−700 nm. The presence of the immobilized pseudo-tetrahedral [Co(NH3)x]2+ molecular complexes active for dimerization is proposed as an alternative to previous reports that attribute olefin dimerization activity to crystalline cobalt oxide phase in this catalyst. Steady-state catalytic test results at 1 bar, 80 °C, 5.0 % C2H4 at 10 sccm, 0.3 g catalyst show that model catalyst containing crystalline cobalt oxides (Co/C) exhibited similar initial butene productivity to the [Co(NH3)x]2+ containing Co/N[sbnd]C catalyst, but suffered sharper deactivation due to the irreversible olefin deposition on Co3+ sites. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cobalt; Dimerization; Ethylene; Heterogeneous; Immobilized molecular complex; NH4OH-modified carbon; [Co(NH3)4]2+","Activated carbon; Ammonia; Ammonium hydroxide; Butenes; Chemical activation; Cobalt compounds; Cobalt metallography; Dimerization; Ethylene; Heat treatment; Transition metals; Ethylene dimerization; Heterogeneous catalyst; Homogenous catalyst; In-situ Raman spectroscopy; Molecular complexes; Olefin dimerization; Thermal activation; Treated activated carbons; Catalyst supports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084698011

However, the main assumption of most of the existing advanced eco-driving approaches is that vehicles are maintained on a single-lane road that considers only the longitudinal motion of the vehicle. In multi-lane roads, controlling the lateral movement of the vehicle or the dynamic lane-changing along with the longitudinal movement can have a positive effect on traffic flow, travel time, fuel economy, and exhaust emission of the vehicle. This paper presents a bi-level model predictive control strategy for connected and automated hybrid electric vehicles (CAHEVs) to optimize inter-vehicle safety, energy-saving, and emission reduction while considering both the lateral and longitudinal motions of the vehicle. The proposed control strategy consists of two control levels: 1) the calculation and optimization of the power distribution between the internal combustion engine and an electric motor, which is referred to as the low-level control, and 2) the optimization of the vehicle speed profile, which is the high-level control. Both levels are used to control the longitudinal motion of the vehicle. Lateral motion or lane changing decision is controlled in another control layer based on the energy consumption prediction on each lane. The proposed control strategy is evaluated under different driving conditions in a realistic urban traffic simulation environment in SUMO. Simulation results show a 6.18 % reduction in the fuel economy while the state of charge of the battery maintained in the standard range and 5.94%, 5.01%, and 5.09% decrease in hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx) respectively compared to the bi-level MPC-based controller without lane-changing approach. © 2021 SAE International.

Based on empirical analyses, this research examines a set of fundamental questions around India's cooling transition. How is cooling conceptualised and what cooling strategies do households use? How, when and why are people purchasing and using their air conditioners (ACs)? Who is buying energy-efficient ACs? Is cooling consumption gendered? Using descriptive statistics, machine learning, and regression analysis to characterize AC usage, we examine a sample dataset (n = 2092) that is representative of areas in Delhi with above average AC penetration. We unpack perceptions of thermal comfort, and characterize the conditions under which households have greater AC use and make energy efficient purchase choices. AC usage is found to be a function of household habits (such as exposure to ACs in the workplace or schools), structural factors, and socio demographic features. While most ACs are in the middle energy-efficiency range, preferences, behaviours and awareness around energy efficiency are found to affect AC use as well as influence the purchase of more efficient ACs. Notable gender differences are observed, and women are found to be less involved in decision-making around cooling appliances and less aware of the technical know-how or energy-efficient schemes. Policy recommendations for a low-carbon cooling trajectory are discussed. © 2021 The Author(s).","Climate change mitigation; Cooling; Developing countries; Energy policy; India; Urban transitions","Air conditioning; Behavioral research; Decision making; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Purchasing; Sales; Technology transfer; Cooling energy consumption; Cooling transitions; Demographic features; Descriptive statistics; Empirical analysis; Gender differences; Policy recommendations; Technical know hows; Cooling; consumption behavior; cooling; cost analysis; decision making; empirical analysis; energy efficiency; energy intensity; energy planning; energy policy; household energy; Delhi; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103506860

This had led to an emergent approach within the sustainability transition research (STR): Accelerated policy-driven sustainability transitions (APDST). Literature on APDST asserts its significance in addressing pressing environmental and development challenges as regime actors like policymakers enact change. It also assumes support from other incumbent regime actors like the industries and businesses. In this study, we identify the reasons for which incumbent industry and business actors might support APDST and whether their support can suffice for implementation. We examine the actor strategies by drawing empirical data from the Indian national government policy of mandatory leapfrog in internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle emission control norms, known as Bharat Stage 4 to 6. This leapfrogging policy was introduced to speed up the reduction of air pollutants produced by the transport sector. A mixed-methods approach, combining multimodal discourse analysis and netnographic research, was deployed for data collection and analysis. The findings show that unlike the status quo assumption in STR, many incumbent industry and business actors aligned with the direction of the enacted policy due to the political landscape and expected gains. However, the degree of support varied throughout the transition timeline and was influenced by challenges during the transitioning process and the response of the government actors. The case suggests we pay more attention to the actors’ changing capacities and needs and consider internal and external influences in adapting the transition timelines. This study contributes to the ongoing discussion on the implementation of APDST, by examining the dynamism of actor strategies, and provides an overview of sustainability transitions in emerging economies. © 2021 by the authors.

In recently deglacierized forelands, processes of SOM accumulation, including those that control carbon and nitrogen sequestration rates and biogeochemical stability of newly sequestered carbon, remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the build-up of SOM during the initial stages (up to 410 years) of topsoil development in 10 glacier forelands distributed on four continents. We test whether the net accumulation of SOM on glacier forelands (i) depends on the time since deglacierization and local climatic conditions (temperature and precipitation); (ii) is accompanied by a decrease in its stability and (iii) is mostly due to an increasing contribution of organic matter from plant origin. We measured total SOM concentration (carbon, nitrogen), its relative hydrogen/oxygen enrichment, stable isotopic (13C, 15N) and carbon functional groups (C-H, C=O, C=C) compositions, and its distribution in carbon pools of different thermal stability. We show that SOM content increases with time and is faster on forelands experiencing warmer climates. The build-up of SOM pools shows consistent trends across the studied soil chronosequences. During the first decades of soil development, the low amount of SOM is dominated by a thermally stable carbon pool with a small and highly thermolabile pool. The stability of SOM decreases with soil age at all sites, indicating that SOM storage is dominated by the accumulation of labile SOM during the first centuries of soil development, and suggesting plant carbon inputs to soil (SOM depleted in nitrogen, enriched in hydrogen and in aromatic carbon). Our findings highlight the potential vulnerability of SOM stocks from proglacial areas to decomposition and suggest that their durability largely depends on the relative contribution of carbon inputs from plants. © 2020 The Authors.

The results will be favorable for illustrative the security of the valuable resources. This study adopts the extended stochastic model (STIRPAT) with Beta Decoupling Techniques (BDT). This modern technique merely employs the decoupling situation by the alpha and beta effects from 1989 to 2018 and calculates the % change in CO2 emissions by GDP growth and energy consumption. The estimated results represent negative and economic growth depends on coal and natural gas. First, CO2 emissions annually increasing cause of rapid growth, energy consumption, and electricity production, and the structural contradiction of energy remained static. Second, the Value-added industries estimated that CO2 emissions reduce by primary industries. Third, the decoupling states of CO2 emissions and population show an inverse relationship.

A potential option to reduce the cement production emissions is to use alternative fuels which can have also an impact on emissions from the waste management sector. This work investigates the change in global warming potential (GWP) of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) production and affected waste management systems when conventional fuels are partially replaced by solid recovered fuel (SRF) made from commercial and industrial waste (C&amp;IW). A life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted with a functional unit of 1 metric tonne of OPC production and treatment of 194 kg of C&amp;IW. Data from an existing cement plant have been used, where the share of SRF from total fuel energy demand increased from 0% to 53% between 2007 and 2016. Four scenarios were established with varying waste treatment methods and SRF share in the thermal energy mix of cement production. It was found that GHG emissions decreased by 20% from 1036 kg carbon dioxide (CO2), eq. (functional unit)-1 in Scenario 1 to 832 kg CO2, eq. (functional unit)-1 in Scenario 3. Furthermore, it is possible to reach a reduction of 30% to 725 kg CO2, eq. (functional unit)-1 in Scenario by increasing the share of SRF to 80%. In conclusion, significant GHG emissions reduction can be achieved by utilizing SRF in cement production. Especially in the middle-income and low-income countries where waste is dumped to the open landfills, emissions could be reduced without huge investments to waste incineration plants. © The Author(s) 2020.","alternative fuel; cement production; emission reduction; global warming potential; life cycle assessment; solid recovered fuel; Waste management","Alternative fuels; Artificial life; Carbon dioxide; Cement industry; Cement plants; Emission control; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Portland cement; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Conventional fuel; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Low income countries; Ordinary Portland cement; Solid recovered fuels; Waste incineration plants; Waste management systems; Life cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; cement; fossil fuel; sulfur dioxide; cement (construction material); developing world; emission control; global warming; greenhouse gas; incineration; life cycle analysis; waste facility; waste management; waste treatment; air pollution; air pollution control; Article; calcination temperature; carbon footprint; climate change; energy consumption; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; incineration; industrial waste; landfill; life cycle assessment; municipal solid waste; particulate matter; recycling; sensitivity analysis; solid waste management; thermogenesis; traffic and transport; waste management; animal; greenhouse effect; life cycle stage; solid waste; waste disposal; Animals; Global Warming; Greenhouse Effect; Incineration; Life Cycle Stages; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098058744

The rice planting period in Indonesia follows the climatic conditions generally divided into two planting seasons, namely the rainy season from October to March and the dry season from April to September. Almost every 3 to 5 years extreme climate changes occur namely El-Nino and La-Nina which have an impact on rice production. Nationally, the extreme climate phenomenon above showed the effect on rice production. El-Nino during the year 1970-2010 was reported to cause a decrease in rice production around-4.08%, while La-Nina in the same period caused an increase in production by about 1.78%. However, the two extreme climatic conditions had reduced rice productivity by-0.50% and-0.65%, respectively. Most of the tidal swamplands have long been cleared and used for the cultivation of lowland rice. In an effort to optimize tidal swampland as a source of rice production in the future, several strategic actions are needed. The purpose of this paper is to uncover the effects of extreme climate change (El-Nino and La-Nina) on rice production and productivity in tidal swamplands and strategic efforts to overcome the decline in rice production due to the extreme climate changes. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Productivity; Change conditions; Climatic conditions; Extreme climates; Planting period; Planting seasons; Rainy seasons; Rice production; Tropical climates; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104877567

Evaporation dominates post-fire ET, with canopy and sub-canopy removal restricting transpiration and increasing evaporation potential. Therefore, in order to project the hydrology and associated stability of peatlands to a diverse range of post-fire weather conditions and future climates the regulation of evaporation must be accurately parameterised in peatland ecohydrological models. To achieve this, we measure the surface resistance (rs) to evaporation over the growing season one year post-fire within four zones of a boreal peatland that burned to differing depths, relating rs to near surface soil tensions. We show that the magnitude and temporal variability in rs varies with burn severity. At the peatland scale, rs and near-surface tension correlates non-linearly. However, at the point scale no relationship was evident between temporal variations in rs and near-surface tension across all burn severities; in part due to the limited fluctuation in near-surface tensions and the precision of rs measurements. Where automated measurements enabled averaging of errors, the relationship between near-surface tension and rs switched between periods of strong and weak correlation within a burned peat hummock. This relationship, when strong, deviated from that obtained under steady state laboratory conditions; increases in rs were more sensitive to fluctuations in near-surface tension under dynamic field conditions. Calculating soil vapour densities directly from near-surface tensions is shown to require calibration between peat types and provides little if any benefit beyond the derivation of empirical relationships between rs and measured soil tension. Thus, we demonstrate important spatiotemporal fluctuations in post-fire rs that will be key to regulating post-fire peatland hydrology, but highlight the complex challenges in effectively parameterising this important underlying control of near-surface tensions within hydrological simulations. © 2021 The Authors.

These declines are associated with reduced commercial effort, shifting climate patterns, and disease outbreaks. For example, recent increases in the occurrence of gill melanization, also known as black gill, have led to the suggestion that this epidemic is a major contributor to reduced shrimp abundance in the region. The goal of this study was to assess long-term patterns and drivers of black gill, and its effects on white shrimp abundance, particularly during the fall, when most of the commercial harvest of white shrimp in this region has historically occurred. Data were compiled for fishery-independent (2002-2017) metrics of white shrimp abundance and black gill prevalence from seven estuaries along the South Carolina and Georgia coasts. Phenology of black gill was variable among years, but mean black gill prevalence was significantly related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and El Niño-Southern Oscillation climate indices. These analyses show that the prevalence of black gill is sensitive to large-scale fluctuations in climate patterns. © 2021 National Shellfisheries Association.

Gosnell School of Life Sciences, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, United States","Advances in electronic technologies have the potential to enable energy efficiency and climate mitigation but may also create climate impacts due to resource and energy use across the product life cycle. These tradeoffs revolve around the way electronics are designed, manufactured, purchased, used, and disposed and the ability to shift these systems toward resource efficiency. A promising strategy for consumer electronics is to facilitate adoption of lightweight, energy-efficient, multi-functional devices as replacements for the many single-function electronic products currently owned. However, consumer preferences and willingness to make this shift remain unclear. Here, a survey of 1,011 adults across the United States demonstrated theoretical potential for material efficiency gains, as respondents indicated willingness to accept a smaller number of multi-functional devices, such as smartphones, as replacements for specialized electronics, including digital cameras, camcorders, and MP3 players. However, when actually choosing electronics to be used for common functions, such as watching TV, getting directions, surfing the Internet, or writing an email, consumers indicated strong preferences for products with the highest perceived quality for those tasks. Multi-functional devices such as tablets were only reported to be used for a small number of the functions they can provide and were typically redundant complements to existing products, rather than substitutes. Findings suggest a limit to material intensity reductions via device convergence alone. Dematerialization of this sector will likely require coupled efforts to design multi-functional products for improved performance while also improving the material and climate footprint of products that consumers are unwilling to replace.

Herein, a novel Ga-based transition metal oxide, NiGa2O4, was synthesized via sol-gel self-ignition techniques to design an advanced electrode for supercapacitor and field emitter applications. Reitveld refinement of XRD, FTIR, and Raman spectra reveals a larger cubic parameter due to the incorporation of Ga over NiO, which promotes faster charge kinetics and various metal oxide (Ni-O and Ga-O) stretching vibrations in the molecular fingerprint. Reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) with an enlarged surface area has been utilized as a conductive substrate to prevent the aggregation of NiGa2O4 nanoparticles. The NiGa2O4 electrodes exhibit a specific capacitance of 415 F g-1 at a current density of 1.5 A g-1 with capacitance retention of 74.2% at a current density of 20 A g-1, in addition to outstanding cyclic performance over 3000 cycles (capacitance retention = 96.2%). R-GO-reinforced NiGa2O4 electrodes (10:1) possess a higher specific capacitance of 643 F g-1 at a current density of 1.5 A g-1 in comparison to pristine NiGa2O4 with 77.66% retentivity at a current density of 20 A g-1, together with upgraded cyclic stability of 99.1% retentivity over 3000 cycles. The NiGa2O4/rGO field emitter delivers a low turn-on field of 4.42 V/μm@1 μA/cm2 with a long field emission current stability of over 5 h in comparison to pristine NiGa2O4 (turn-on field of 6.56 V/μm@1 μA/cm2), which recommends it as a potential field emitter (FE) for vacuum micro- and nanoelectronics. Various FE parameters with field enhancement factor (β) are compared with those of other efficient field emitters. Experimental data were supported through theoretical insight from density functional theory (DFT) simulations. Enhanced quantum capacitance and increased density of states near the Fermi level contribute toward superior charge storage performance in r-GO-reinforced NiGa2O4 compared to pristine NiGa2O4. The interaction between NiGa2O4 and rGO involves charge transfer from NiGa2O4 to the C 2p orbital. In addition, the reduction in work function for the hybrid structure justifies its improved field emission properties. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Calculations; Capacitance; Charge transfer; Current density; Density functional theory; Design for testability; Digital storage; Electrodes; Field emission; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Graphene; Nickel metallography; Nickel oxide; Quantum theory; Reduced Graphene Oxide; Reinforcement; Sol-gels; Stretching; Supercapacitor; Transition metal oxides; Transition metals; Field emission currents; Field emission property; Field enhancement factor; Field-emission characteristics; First-principles calculation; Pseudocapacitive behavior; Stretching vibrations; Structural configurations; Gallium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104911014

Researchers have established systems for observing atmospheric greenhouse gases in urban areas with the aim of attributing greenhouse gas concentration enhancements (and thus emissions) to the region in question. However, to attribute enhancements to a particular region, one must isolate the component of the observed concentration attributable to fluxes inside the region by removing the background, which is the component due to fluxes outside. In this study, we demonstrate methods to construct several versions of a background for our carbon dioxide and methane observing network in the Washington, DC, and Baltimore, MD, metropolitan region. Some of these versions rely on transport and flux models, while others are based on observations upwind of the domain. First, we evaluate the backgrounds in a synthetic data framework, and then we evaluate against real observations from our urban network. We find that backgrounds based on upwind observations capture the variability better than model-based backgrounds, although care must be taken to avoid bias from biospheric carbon dioxide fluxes near background stations in summer. Model-based backgrounds also perform well when upwind fluxes can be modeled accurately. Our study evaluates different background methods and provides guidance in determining background methodology that can impact the design of urban monitoring networks.</p>. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

Specifically, some semiarid and arid areas of developing countries are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. To reduce vulnerability of these regions, realizing context-specific impediments of robust adaptation to climate change is necessary. Also, it is imperative to consider anticipated transformations of agricultural systems that are required to enhance resilience of agriculture in coping with climate change. Therefore, this study aims to investigate major adaptation barriers in agriculture sector of Fars province, Iran. It also attempts to identify if any transformation from productivist agricultural systems is needed. To achieve these objectives, the group analytic hierarchy process was conducted with representatives from local government, academic institutes and farmers. The results revealed that local stakeholders prioritized barriers to adaptation, differently, and they showed various levels of concern about the importance of some barriers. However, they identified the governance and policy-related issues as the most important barriers. The results also indicated that transformational adaptation of agriculture sector from productivist to multifunctional farming system is required in order to enhance its resilience under uncertain climatic conditions. Some recommendations are offered to eliminate barriers of agricultural adaptation to climate change and also facilitate transformational adaptation of agriculture, in the developing world. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptation barriers; Climate change; Developing countries; Governance; Multifunctional agriculture; Post-productivist agriculture; Productivist agriculture","adaptation; analytical hierarchy process; climate change; developing world; farming system; paradigm shift; stakeholder; uncertainty analysis; vulnerability; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086859918

Based on the fundamental principles of systemic energy research, systems theory and the theoretical framework of electrical engineering, among others, this methodology adopts a universal approach to describing climatic indicators by processing FM 12 Synop and METAR multi-year meteorological data sets. The paper gives a detailed description of the autonomous photovoltaic system, its basic elements and control algorithms. The universal storage battery model is treated separately. A comprehensive description is provided of an algorithm for calculating storage battery lifetime. The notions of partial cycle and local minimum state of battery charge are introduced. These indicators are necessary for the correct estimate of the number of battery cycles to failure. After identifying the number of cycles to failure and the average annual number of cycles, it is possible to calculate storage battery lifetime. Next, it becomes possible to consider storage battery lifetime when dealing with the structural optimization of photovoltaic power systems. Importantly, the results reveal a more than 10% increase in the LCOE indicator. Kurbulik, an autonomous energy system located in a protected area of Lake Baikal, is given as an example. The optimization results show that the combined use of renewable energy sources reduces diesel fuel consumption by 51%. Storage batteries are replaced three times every six years. The levelized cost of energy is 16.80 rubles/kW h (as compared to 34.82 rubles/kW h for diesel generation alone).

Accordingly, this must be taken into account when calculating the emissions of air pollutants. However, in the case of Korea, when calculating NH3 emissions, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emission factor is applied as it is to calculate emissions, and for petroleum power plants, the heavy oil emission factor proposed by EPA is used as it is to calculate emissions. In petroleum power plants, bio-oil is not mixed in a certain amount and used at a different ratio depending on the situation of the power plant. Therefore, in this study, the NH3 emission factor according to the mixing ratio of bio-heavy oil is calculated and the mixing ratio is calculated. As a result of the analysis, the emission factor according to bio-oil and the mixed ratio was found to be in the range of 0.010~0.033 kg NH3/kL, and it was lower than the heavy oil emission factor 0.096 kg NH3/kL of EPA currently used in Korea. This is because the amount of NH3 through the slip is also small since the use of NH3 for reduction is also low because the NOx emission from the use of bio-oil is low. Considering all of these points, we have statistically analyzed whether emission factors should be developed and applied. As a result of the confirmation, the difference according to the mixed consumption rate was not large. © 2021 by the authors.

On the basis of O3 isopleths from a series of air quality simulations under different levels of NOx and volatile organic compound (VOC) emission reductions, we found that such concerns are not necessary. As NOx emissions have been reduced in recent years for particulate matter control, future NOx reductions are generally favorable for summertime maximum daily average 8-h (MDA8) O3 reductions. Decreases in summertime O3 due to NOx reductions will also lead to lower atmospheric oxidation capacity, characterized by decreased OH and NO3 concentrations, resulting in further reduction of secondary inorganic aerosols (nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium ion, NSA) formation. VOC emission reductions help to further reduce MDA8 O3 and are needed to control HCHO and primary air toxics simultaneously, but they are ineffective in reducing NSA. This study indicates that a nationwide NOx emission reduction policy has great potential in controlling O3 and PM2.5 simultaneously. However, its effectiveness could be greatly reduced when applied on a limited spatial scale. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Air quality; Emission control; Ozone; Sulfur compounds; Volatile organic compounds; Air quality simulation; Atmospheric oxidation capacity; Emission reduction; Particulate matter control; Potential rise; Secondary inorganic aerosol; Summertime ozone; Volatile organic compound (VOC); Nitrogen oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104919525

Energy storage, particularly electrochemical storage, is poised to be a cornerstone in allowing those sectors to become more sustainable. This study presents the results of an integrated dynamic material flow analysis of the cumulative demand for lithium-ion battery metals (Li, Co, Ni and Mn) by the light duty vehicle and electricity generation sectors in the UK over the next three decades. Results have shown that recycling of end-of-life electric vehicle battery packs is very effective in “closing the loop”, and would enable driving the demand for all four metals back down to present levels by 2050, despite having achieved by then a complete shift to 100% electric vehicles. Additionally, repurposing end-of-life vehicle batteries for grid storage (with over 50 GWh of grid storage capacity expected to be in place by 2050) has been found to enable reducing purpose-built grid storage batteries to zero. Finally, an additional scenario analysis has indicated that a widespread behavioural shift from conventional vehicle ownership to shared mobility could even drive the demand for virgin battery metals into negative territory by 2040. © 2021","Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Lithium-ion batteries; Material flow analysis; Recycling; Shared mobility","Automotive batteries; Battery Pack; Climate change; Electric energy storage; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric vehicles; Electronic Waste; Emission control; Light weight vehicles; Metal analysis; Metals; Storage (materials); Vehicle-to-grid; Critical challenges; Electric vehicle batteries; Electricity generation sectors; Electrochemical storage; Emission reduction; End-of-life strategies; End-of-Life Vehicles; Light duty vehicles; Lithium-ion batteries; cobalt; lithium ion; manganese; nickel; car use; carbon emission; carbon storage; demand analysis; electric vehicle; lithium; material flow analysis; recycling; strategic approach; Article; dynamic material flow analysis; dynamics; electric current; electric vehicle; electricity; energy storage; flow measurement; grid storage; lifespan; lithium ion battery; motor vehicle; physical mobility; recycling; shared mobility; storage; United Kingdom; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100247045

Its commitment to carbon neutrality, as well as its unique Gross National Happiness (GNH) objectives, make Bhutan a fascinating laboratory for studying sustainable development strategies and how they can be specifically tailored to align with local contexts and values. This paper uses the framing of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) from the global climate change mitigation literature to develop a vision for a locally appropriate SSP for a sustainable Bhutan, encompassing energy supply, energy demand, and urban and regional planning. The approach outlined here demonstrates how research-based recommendations from the academic literature can be combined with knowledge of local considerations to develop place-based visions for sustainable societies. The proposed sustainable pathway for Bhutan (SSP1) outlines a future in which the nation continues to sequester more carbon than it emits while maintaining traditional cultural values, a strong sense of community, and a burgeoning economy. Outcomes of alternative scenarios are described according to the nine domains of GNH. Focusing on Bhutan as a real case study, this paper thus demonstrates how mitigation measures can be selected and implemented to align with unique cultural values and national aspirations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon neutrality; Climate change mitigation; Scenario analysis; Shared socioeconomic pathways; Sustainable development; Urbanization","climate change; scenario analysis; socioeconomic status; sustainable development; urban development; urban economy; urban planning; urbanization; Bhutan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094830741

River flooding is responsible for a large part of this displacement. Previous studies have shown that river flood risk is expected to change as a result of global warming and its effects on the hydrological cycle. At the same time, future scenarios of socio-economic development imply substantial population increases in many of the areas that presently experience disaster-induced displacement. Here we show that both global warming and population change are projected to lead to substantial increases in flood-induced displacement risk over the coming decades. We use a global climate-hydrology-inundation modelling chain, including multiple alternative climate and hydrological models, to quantify the effect of global warming on displacement risk assuming either current or projected future population distributions. Keeping population fixed at present levels, we find roughly a 50% increase in global displacement risk for every degree of global warming. Adding projected population changes further exacerbates these increases globally and in most world regions, with the relative global flood displacement risk is increasing by roughly 350% at the end of the 21st century, compared to an increase of 150% without the contribution of population change. While the resolution of the global models is limited, the effect of global warming is robust across greenhouse gas concentration scenarios, climate models and hydrological models. These findings indicate a need for rapid action on both climate mitigation and adaptation agendas in order to reduce future risks to vulnerable populations. © 2021 The Author(s).

The semi-distributed process-based Ecological Model for Applied Geophysics (ECOMAG) was applied to the Iya River basin. Successful model testing results were obtained for daily discharge, annual peak discharge, and discharges exceeding the critical water level threshold over the multiyear period of 1970–2019. Modeling of the high flow of the Iya River was carried out according to a Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.91, a percent bias (PBIAS) of −1%, and a ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR) of 0.41. The preflood coefficient of water-saturated soil and the runoff coefficient of flood-forming precipitation in the Iya River basin were calculated in 1980, 1984, 2006, and 2019. Possible changes in the characteristics of high flow over summers in the 21st century were calculated using the atmosphere–ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) and the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 2-Earth System (HadGEM2-ES) as the boundary conditions in the runoff generation model. Anomalies in values were estimated for the middle and end of the current century relative to the observed runoff over the period 1990–2019.

However, to clarify the microstructure and energy transfer mechanism of Pr3+-doped host crystals is a challenging topic. In this work, the stable structures of Pr3+-doped yttrium orthoaluminate (YAlO3) have been widely searched based on the CALYPSO method. A novel monoclinic structure with the Pm group symmetry is successfully identified. The Pr3+ impurity can precisely occupy the Y3+ position and get incorporated into the YAlO3 (YAP) host crystal with a Pr3+ concentration of 6.25%. The result of the electronic band structure reveals a 3.62 eV band gap, which suggests a semiconductor character of YAP:Pr. Using our developed well-established parametrization matrix diagonalization (WEPMD) method, we have systematically analyzed the energy level scheme and proposed a set of newly improved parameters. Additionally, the energy transfer mechanism of YAP:Pr is clarified by deciphering the numerical electric dipole and magnetic dipole transitions. The popular red emission at 653 nm is assigned to the transition 3P0 → 3F2, while the transition 3P0 → 3H4 with a large branching ratio is predicted to be a good laser channel. Many promising emission lines for laser actions are also obtained in the visible light region.

In the process of natural gas gathering and transportation, the problem of pipeline corrosion caused by CO2 is widespread, which often leads to serious local thinning, even perforation and fracture of the pipe body. Once it occurs, it will cause great economic losses and disastrous consequences to the actual production. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to study the mechanism of CO2 corrosion and analyze the influencing factors of CO2 corrosion in order to prevent the safety accidents and improve the efficiency of natural gas transportation.

Castellon Province is home to the largest ceramic production hub in Spain, with 94% of the country's total production. Agricultural soils in the vicinity of the ceramic hub were reported to contain potentially toxic elements (Pb, Cr, Ni and Cd) in 2008 and have since been subject to repeated amendment with biosolids (sewage sludge). The sample sites were revisited in 2019, and the chemical distribution of these metals reassessed. The distribution of heavy chemical forms was analysed using a sequential extraction protocol that fractionates these four heavy metals into five phases. The incorporation of biosolids for the past 10 years has changed the chemistry of the soil, leading to increased levels of some hazardous elements. The carbonate-sorbed, residual and reducible phases were dominant.

We present the initial results from a coordinated Intercomparison, CovidMIP, of Earth system model simulations which assess the impact on climate of these emissions reductions. 12 models performed multiple initial-condition ensembles to produce over 300 simulations spanning both initial condition and model structural uncertainty. We find model consensus on reduced aerosol amounts (particularly over southern and eastern Asia) and associated increases in surface shortwave radiation levels. However, any impact on near-surface temperature or rainfall during 2020–2024 is extremely small and is not detectable in this initial analysis. Regional analyses on a finer scale, and closer attention to extremes (especially linked to changes in atmospheric composition and air quality) are required to test the impact of COVID-19-related emission reductions on near-term climate. © 2021.

Understanding climate risks to freshwater ecosystems requires combining hydrological and ecological knowledge. While there have been significant advances in ecohydrological approaches when applied within the large array of methods available for undertaking impact assessments, the ecological and hydrological elements are often not well-integrated. This results in a mismatch in their ability to accommodate the inherent uncertainty in both impacts and responses. We examine published literature that assesses climate change impacts on freshwater ecosystems using both hydrological and ecological models to better understand method choices. We identify four fundamentally distinct modeling approaches used to assess climate change risk. We discuss which approaches are less useful for predicting ecological impacts under climate change, and highlight approaches of comparable complexity that can maximize the utility of dynamic, process-based modeling while capturing the effects of climate uncertainty and variability. Using an illustrative case study of riparian vegetation health under climate change, we show how the four alternate modeling approaches feature different degrees of information in their outcomes and inferences about future risk. Most current studies that examine climate change risks to freshwater ecosystems use simplified methods or inadequately combine key elements. However, unless the interactions between changing hydrologic variability and ecological responses are explicitly captured in scale-sensitive modeling methods, the risks of climate change to freshwater ecosystems will likely be substantially misrepresented, with negative consequences for effective management responses. Capturing these interactions requires combining ecological and hydrological methods of comparable complexity.

We investigated the biotic and abiotic filters to species establishment on opposite ends of a tidal marsh-forest ecotone that is moving inland in response to sea level rise. We transplanted four plant species common to the ecotone to the leading or trailing edge of the migrating ecotone, with and without caging to protect them from ungulate herbivores. We found that species exhibited an individualistic response to abiotic and biotic pressures in this ecotone; three species performed better at the leading edge of the ecotone in the coastal forest, whereas one performed better at the trailing edge in the marsh. Specifically, grass species Phragmites australis and Panicum virgatum grew more in the low light and low salinity conditions of the leading edge of the ecotone (forest), whereas the shrub Iva frutescens grew better in the high light, high salinity conditions of the trailing edge of the ecotone (marsh). Furthermore, of the four species, only P. australis was affected by the biotic pressure of herbivory by an introduced ungulate, Cervus nippon, which greatly reduced its biomass and survival at the leading edge (forest). P. australis is an aggressive invasive species and has been observed to dominate in the wake of migrating marsh-forest ecotones. Our findings detail the role of lower salinity stress to promote and herbivory pressure to inhibit the establishment of P. australis during shifts of this ecotone, and also highlight an interaction between two nonnative species, P. australis and C. nippon. Understanding migration of the marsh-forest ecotone and the factors controlling P. australis establishment are critical for marsh conservation in the face of sea level rise. More generally, our findings support the conclusion that the abiotic and biotic filters of a migrating ecotone shape the resulting community. © 2021 by the Ecological Society of America","Cervus nippon; community assembly; environmental change; global change; marsh migration; range shifts; sika deer","biomass; climate change; ecotone; herbivory; invasive species; plant community; succession; Cervus nippon; Iva frutescens; Panicum virgatum; Phragmites australis; Ungulata; animal; climate change; forest; Poaceae; salinity; wetland; Animals; Climate Change; Forests; Poaceae; Salinity; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102179569

Specifically, we build the first, theoretically derived argument for ‘splitting’. We do this by engaging a set of theoretical insights from the international relations literature, having to do with the relationship between problem structure and institutional design. Centrally, we apply some key elements of problem structure – which allows us to compare policy issues along variables such as geographic scope, costs, and actor number and asymmetries – to the cases of SRM and CDR. By analyzing their problem structures, we demonstrate that SRM and CDR are different in ways that are likely to yield different state preferences for institutional design, and thus policy proposals that split SRM and CDR are more likely to be adopted by states. In short, we construct a theoretical argument for ‘splitting’ SRM and CDR governance in global policy discussions. © 2020 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104932197

This study was performed to identify the species suitable for urban greening by examining the adsorption capacity of the evergreen species in urban areas in Korea, the adsorption points and the elemental composition of PM in the adsorbed tree. Leaf sampling was carried out four times (period of seven months from October 2017 to May 2018) and used after drying (period 28 to 37 days). Particulate matter (PM) was classified and measured according to size PM2.5 (0.2–2.5 µm), PM10 (2.5–10 µm), PM100 (10–100 µm). The total amount of PM adsorbed on the leaf surface was highest in Pinus densiflora (24.6 µg·cm−2 ), followed by Quercus salicina (47.4 µg·cm−2 ). The composition of PM adsorbed by P. densiflora is 4.0% PM2.5, 39.5% PM10 and 56.5% PM100, while those adsorbed by Q. salicina are evergreen at 25.7% PM2.5, 27.4% PM10 and 46.9% PM100. When the amount of PM adsorbed on the leaf was calculated by LAI, the species that adsorbed PM the most was P. densiflora, followed by Q. salicina, followed by Q. salicina in the wax layer, then P. densiflora. As a result of this study, the amount of PM adsorbed per unit area of leaves, and the amount of PM calculated by LAI, showed a simpler pattern. The hardwoods had a high adsorption rate of PM2.5 . The adsorption ratio of ultra-fine PM2.5 by evergreen broad-leaved trees was greater than that of coniferous trees. Therefore, broad-leaved evergreens such as Q. salicina are considered very suitable as species for adsorbing PM in the city. PM2.5 has been shown to be adsorbed through the pores and leaves of trees, indicating that the plant plays an important role in alleviating PM in the atmosphere. As a result of analyzing the elemental components of PM accumulated on leaf leaves by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/ energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) analysis, it was composed of O, C, Si, and N, and was found to be mainly generated by human activities around the road. The results of this study provide basic data regarding the selection of evergreen species that can effectively remove aerial PM. It also highlights the importance of evergreen plants for managing PM pollution during the winter and provides insights into planning additional green infrastructure to improve urban air quality. © 2021 by the authors.

Regional disparity, coal classification, and the development of clean coal technologies are specified in the model. Based on MESSAGEix, this model takes full consideration of coal mining, preparation, transformation, and transportation processes. Moreover, the effects of non-fossil energy development and carbon price are discussed. With the above framework, the future of China's coal supply system is optimized. Results indicate that: 1) China's national raw coal production will peak in 2030 under the business-as-usual scenario, while it has already peaked under the GREEN and carbon price scenarios, 2) The amount of coal used in final consumption and transformed into coke decreases, while coal transformed into liquids and SNG increases from 11 Mt in 2015 to 221 Mt in 2050 under the business-as-usual scenario, 3) both non-fossil fuel development and carbon price strategies have a positive effect on coal supply regulation and coal-related GHG emission reduction, 4) carbon price could facilitate the adoption of CCS technology and can effectively reduce coal-related GHG emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon price; Coal supply model; Multi-regional; Non-fossil energy development","Carbon; Coal; Coal transportation; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Planning; Sustainable development; Business-as-usual; CCS technologies; Clean coal technologies; Coal classification; Low-carbon development; Non-fossil energies; Regional disparities; Transportation process; Coal industry; coal production; coal supply; emission control; energy market; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; numerical model; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099029689

This study makes a quantitative analysis against the backdrop of China's transitional economic system. The results show that politically-connected enterprises significantly reduce environmental expenditure, but this only holds for state-owned enterprises; private enterprises with political connections spend significantly more. Analysis of the efficiency of environmental expenditure indicates that, for private enterprises, environmental spending is used as a way to maintain political connections, with rent-seeking as the likely motivation. Politically-connected private enterprises have not reduced their emissions to the same extent as state-owned enterprises, despite increased expenditure. Given the scale of environmental degradation in China during a period of massive economic and social upheaval, the results of this analysis provide a quantitative case for policy change: governments should shift focus to the results that environmental spending produces.

Most relevant studies have focused on nitrogen sites in porous carbons, however, the intrinsic topological defects of porous carbons have been usually ignored because of difficulties in controllable preparation, structural identification, and determining structure–property correlations. In this study, topological defect-enriched porous carbons are fabricated through pyridinic-N volatilization at a high temperature by using nitrogen-enriched 2,6-dicyanopyridine as the precursor. As-prepared porous carbons possess rich topological defects and ultrahigh specific surface area of up to 3123 m2 g−1. As electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, as-prepared porous carbons exhibit excellent activity for CO formation with a low onset potential of −283 mV, high CO Faradaic efficiency of up to 99.0% at −0.4 V, which is the state-of-the-art activity among all of reported porous carbons. Density functional theory calculations indicate that pentagonal structure cause the electronegativity of carbon skeletons and act as the main active sites for CO2 reduction.

However, research in this area have not been updated consider multiscale and spatial heterogeneities, thus providing insufficient or incomplete results and analyses. In this study, UF at different scales were extracted and calculated from remote sensing land-use/cover data, and panel data models were then applied to analyze the connections between UF and PM2.5 concentration at the city and provincial scales. Our comparison and evaluation results showed that the PM2.5 concentration could be affected by the UF designations, with the largest patch index (LPI) and landscape shape index (LSI) the most influential at the provincial and city scales, respectively. The number of patches (NP) has a strong negative influence (−0.033) on the PM2.5 concentration at the provincial scale, but it was not statisti-cally significant at the city scale. No significant impact of urban compactness on the PM2.5 concentration was found at the city scale. In terms of the eastern and central provinces, LPI imposed a weighty positive influence on PM2.5 concentration, but it did not exert a significant effect in the western provinces. In the western cities, if the urban layout were either irregular or scattered, exposure to high PM2.5 pollution levels would increase.

However, whether the decline trend of summer rainfall is anthropogenic or natural remains unknown. Here, we show evidences that the drying trend is dominated by anthropogenic change of the subtropical westerly jet (SWJ; referring exclusively to the active center located over Central Asia). Using 10 global climate models participating in the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP) under different forcings, we find that the observed changes in the SWJ are attributable to the combined contributions of greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosols. Enhanced emissions of greenhouse gases favor an equatorial shift of the SWJ, while increased Asian pollution and reduced European aerosol emissions weaken the SWJ. Both of these factors strengthen the descending motion and decrease the precipitation over NCA. © 2021.

The ECL biosensor was constructed through stepwise assemblies of CdS QDs and hairpin DNA (H-DNA) on a glassy carbon electrode, and subsequent introduction of T-DNA resulted in the development of G-quadruplex/hemin DNAzymes via the specific recognition of T-DNA and H-DNA in the presence of hemin and K+ ions. The formed DNAzymes not only prompted the catalytic oxidation of hydroquinone followed by deposition of insoluble oxidation oligomers on the electrode surface to attenuate the cathodic ECL emission of CdS QDs but also triggered the catalytic oxidation of luminol to enhance the anodic ECL emission. The label-free ratiometric ECL biosensor for the detection of T-DNA showed a wide response range from 1 to 10,000 fM (10−15 M) with a low detection limit of 0.2 fM and exhibited excellent selectivity against mismatched base sequences.

CH4, CO2, and N2O from landfills, were examined on a lab scale. Three simulated semi-aerobic bioreactor landfills (SABL1, SABL2, SABL3), with respective vent-pipe inner diameters (φ) of 25, 50, and 75 mm, were used to investigate their effect on the greenhouse effect (GHE) during the municipal solid waste (MSW) stabilization process. We found that the vent-pipe φ influenced both MSW degradation and GHG emissions, increasing the vent-pipe φ which improved the removal of carbon and nitrogen-based pollutants. The GHG emissions were 364, 356, and 309 kg CO2 equivalents per ton of MSW from the SABL2, SABL1, and SABL3, respectively, during the operation of 465 days. Of the three GHGs, CH4 influenced the GHE the most, contributing 72.53%, 79.17%, and 71.42% in SABL1, SABL2, and SABL3, respectively. In the same sequence, CO2 (14.87%, 14.06%, and 21.9%) and N2O (12.6%, 6.77%, and 6.69%) were the second and third contributors to the GHE, respectively. Considering the rapidly MSW stabilization and the mitigation of GHG emissions, a vent pipe with φ of 75 mm in the SABL column (φ of 800 mm) was suggested. Moreover, the GHG mitigation in the SABL should be implemented by prioritizing CH4 collection and oxidation. The results provided a technical guidance for GHG mitigation in MSW management. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Greenhouse gas emissions; Semi-aerobic bioreactor landfill; Stabilization process; Vent-pipe diameter","bioreactor; carbon dioxide; diameter; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; landfill; municipal solid waste; pipe; stabilization; waste management; carbon dioxide; methane; bioreactor; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; waste disposal; waste disposal facility; Bioreactors; Carbon Dioxide; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Refuse Disposal; Waste Disposal Facilities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098741048

To address that problem, the urgent challenge is to find out the most important factor for PM2.5 formation and therefore conduct more effective control. Herein, the characteristic and control strategy of PM2.5 pollution in China is investigated, aiming to provide new insights for global air pollution control. Spatial and chemical characteristics of PM2.5 in China are analyzed according to large amounts of air monitoring data. Charge analysis of PM2.5 is conducted based on the concentration of water-soluble inorganic ion. Achievement and shortage of recent PM2.5 control strategies are studied through policy analysis. PM2.5 pollution is highly related to local population and economic development. NH4+ represents the main cation in PM2.5 and plays a key role in particulate generation. Ammonia is found to be concentrated in North China Plain of China, which is consistent with PM2.5 spatial distribution. To further abate the PM2.5, ammonia emission from nitrogenous fertilization, livestock manures and industrial denitrification process should be controlled.

To improve the environment as well as road-carrying capacity, this study established a vehicle emission reduction management model using a system dynamics approach. An algorithm for the qualified verification of the degree of grey incidence based on system dynamics and grey model theory was also established to validate the model. Furthermore, in consideration of economic, environmental, social, and health benefits, the effects of the air pollution charging fee(APCF), penalties, and subsidies(collectively, the APS strategy) on air quality and traffic congestion were explored. The findings indicated that APCF and penalties help reduce missions and alleviate traffic congestion but increase the burden on public transport and reduce its supply level. Further, while the subsidy strategy's effects on reducing congestion and emissions are not obvious, the strategy will greatly increase the supply of public transport. In addition, the lagged and fading effects of the combined APS strategy were identified. The combined APS strategy has multiple benefits: it can not only increase public-transport supply and promote health (social and health benefits) but also decrease pollution and total energy consumption (economic and environmental benefits). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Combined strategy; Fading effect; Penalty policy; System dynamics","Air quality; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Health; System theory; Traffic congestion; Degree of grey incidence; Economic and environmental benefits; Grey model theories; Management strategies; Social and economic development; System dynamics approach; Total energy consumption; Vehicle emission; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100055272

Using air pollution caused by motor vehicle emissions (mainly by carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter) as an example, in this study, we applied an integrated algorithm comprising system dynamics, entropy weight method, and gray system theory to establish a weighted logic function. A vehicle pollutant control model (including the transport, health, and environmental subsystems) was established by VENSIM software. The medium- and long-term key variable analysis showed that the integrated algorithm, fully reflecting the advantages of system dynamics and gray system theory, more accurately described air pollution caused by vehicle emissions. Our research results also revealed that the combined strategy of penalties and air pollution charging fee had a threefold effect: reduced congestion and emissions, improved health impact index, and reduced number of illegal trips. Specifically, the degree of traffic congestion, number of illegal trips, and the degree of air pollution decreased by approximately 82.40%, 69.35%, and 68.91%, respectively, whereas the health impact index increased by about 279.03%.

However, currently, few scientists have analyzed the underlying impact of REC from a global geographic perspective. Thus, here, we divide the world into seven regions to study this impact during the period 1971-2016 using the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI). These regions were East Asia and the Pacific (EAP), Europe and Central Asia (ECA), Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), Middle East and North Africa (MENA), North America (NA), South Asia (SA), and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The results showed that ECA had the most obviously mitigating effect of -10.13%, followed by NA and MENA (-3.91% and -3.87%, respectively). Inversely, EAP had the largest driving effect of 4.12%, followed by SA (3.43%) and the others. Globally, REC had an overall mitigating contribution of -11.04% to total CO2 change. These results indicate that it is still important to exploit and utilize renewable energy, especially in presently developing or underdeveloped countries. Moreover, for some countries at a certain stage, their REC effects were negative, but, concurrently, their energy intensity effects were positive. These results show that some developing countries recently reduced carbon emissions only by extensively using renewable energy, not by enhancing energy-use efficiency. Finally, some policy implications for reducing CO2 in different countries are recommended. © 2021 by the authors.

NC cities are divided into low-, medium-, and high-emission groups by the ranking of their 4-year mean NO2. For each emission group, daily NO2 levels are used to divide the days into good-, medium-, and bad-meteorological conditions. Regardless of their emission levels, all cities reveal significant decreases (96%-172%) in daily PM2.5 levels from bad to good meteorological conditions. The largest difference in PM2.5 concentrations between the emissions groups is found under bad meteorological conditions, with 56% higher PM2.5 in high-emission cities than low-emission cities, indicating PM2.5 under bad meteorological conditions has the largest sensitivity to emissions. The high-emission, bad-meteorology group saw a 24% decrease in mean daily PM2.5 levels from 2017, a high-emission year, to 2019, a low-emission year. However, under good meteorological conditions, the high-emissions group shows an increase of 8.8 μg/m3 in mean daily PM2.5 from 2017 to 2019 with a 2.6% increase in the possibility of high PM2.5.

In 2019, Seoul, South Korea mandated filtered ventilation systems in newly constructed buildings to reduce PM2.5 levels. This study aimed to evaluate PM2.5 concentrations before and after the installation of a pre-filter and to analyze their behavior under different relative humidity conditions. The pre-filter system was installed in two selected houses (A and B) with the same ventilation system to evaluate indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentrations. To reduce indoor PM2.5 concentrations through the ventilation system, a high-performance filtering system (G4 + F8 + H13) was installed. The ventilation system was better at maintaining indoor air quality than an air cleaner. Furthermore, the pre-filter was more effective in reducing PM2.5 that was introduced from the outside rather than that generated indoors. The results revealed that after installation of the pre-filter system, the percentage of PM2.5 concentration below 10 μg/m3 increased for house A and B, respectively. In addition, when the pre-filter was not installed, the average I/O ratio was 1.4 ± 0.09 and 2.3 ± 0.09 for house A and B, respectively. However, after the pre-filter was installed, the average I/O ratio for house A was 0.4 ± 0.58 and that for house B was 2.1 ± 0.05. After pre-filter installation, the percentage of I/O ratio (range of 0–1) increased with an increase in the relative humidity, that is from 72.1% to 95.1% for house A and from 8.5% to 24.7% for house B. © 2021","I/O ratio; Indoor air quality; PM2.5; Pre-filter system; Relative humidity; Ventilation system","Air cleaners; Air quality; Houses; Indoor air pollution; Filter installation; Filtering systems; Humidity conditions; Indoor air quality; PM2.5 concentration; Seoul , South Korea; Urban environments; Ventilation systems; Ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100192456

High-resolution dynamically downscaled simulations of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model driven by the boundary conditions from the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) model (WRF-CCSM4) are compared with statistically downscaled simulations of NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP). Over PI, these downscaled simulations show low bias in mean NEM rainfall (≤ − 0.44 mm·day−1) and high pattern correlation coefficient (≥0.75), giving confidence in their future projections. Under future warming over PI, both downscaled simulations project future significant enhancement in NEM rainfall with WRF-CCSM4 projecting 1.98 mm·day−1 (83.78% change with respect to the present-day mean) whereas the multimodel ensemble (MME) of eight NEX-GDDP models project 0.67 ± 0.58 mm·day−1 (19.78%) by the midddle of the century and 1.42 ± 0.97 mm·day−1 (42.76%) by the end of the century. Analysis of extreme rainfall events shows that WRF-CCSM4 projects future enhancement (reduction) in extreme rainfall (R95p) days over 91.4% (8.6%) of grid-points over PI. In future, coastal areas of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh will likely experience increased extreme rainfall occurrence by more than 25 days and 15–20 days respectively. Projected future enhancement in the mean and extreme NEM rainfall is attributed to the increased precipitable water under a warming climate. Future projection of extreme temperature indices shows an increase in minimum and maximum temperatures over PI during the NEM season. Over PI, future winter nights and days are found to be warmer than those in the present day and the temperature change in future winter nights is found to be larger than that in winter days.

Restrictions on conventional vehicles entering the inner city are being introduced and the introduction of low-emission measures, including electric ones, is being promoted. This paper presents a method for scenario analysis applied to study the reduction of exhaust emissions by introducing electric vehicles in a selected city. The original scenario analyses relating to real problems faced by contemporary metropolitan areas are based on the VISUM tool (PTV Headquarters for Europe: PTV Planung Transport Verkehr AG, 76131 Karlsruhe, Germany). For the case study, the transport model of the city of Bielsko-Biala (Poland) was used to conduct experiments with different forms of participation of electric vehicles on the one hand and traffic restrictions for high emission vehicles on the other hand. Scenario analyses were conducted for various constraint options including inbound, outbound, and through traffic. Travel time for specific transport relations and the volume of harmful emissions were used as criteria for evaluating scenarios of limited accessibility to city zones for selected types of vehicles. The comparative analyses carried out showed that the introduction of electric vehicles in the inner city resulted in a significant reduction in the emission of harmful exhaust compounds and, consequently, in an increase in the area of clean air in the city. The case study and its results provide some valuable insights and may guide decision-makers in their actions to introduce both driving ban restrictions for high-emission vehicles and incentives for the use of electric vehicles for city residents. © 2021 by the authors.

This study investigates the (i) pattern and regional variation in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the livestock sector, (ii) climate change mitigation benefits of circular economy-based resource consumption from livestock waste-based renewable biogas use in the urban areas of Bangladesh, and (iii) policies and measures driving the renewable energy generation from livestock wastes. This research employed standard GHG emission quantification model, and scenario analysis. Between 1996 and 2016, the GHG emissions of Bangladesh's livestock sector increased from 20.54 to 26.55 million of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2eq). The business as usual (BAU) scenario exhibits 2.37 times growth from 26.55 Mt CO2eq in 2016 to 62.96 Mt CO2eq in 2050. In the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) substitution scenario, GHG emissions fall to 37.56 Mt CO2eq by 2050. A combination of all the renewable energy use measures can result in a drop of 37.5% GHG emissions compared to the BAU level. The study observed that promoting the biogas generation from livestock wastes through commercial biogas generation is currently absent in Bangladesh. Most of the existing financial schemes and subsidy programs are dedicated to the household level. The outcome is supportive to enhance renewable energy use in urban areas of Bangladesh and other countries alike thinking to promote the circular economy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-energy; Climate change mitigation; Green growth; Life Cycle Assessment; Urban metabolism","Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Developing countries; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Liquefied petroleum gas; Renewable energy resources; Climate change mitigation; Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); Policies and measures; Quantification model; Regional variation; Renewable energy generation; Renewable energy use; Resource consumption; Agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100146945

These dynamic techniques elucidate slope heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependency and solve the problem of unit root bias. It is found that the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis does not apply for this region. The findings demonstrate that military expenses increase carbon dioxide emissions; thus, the treadmill theory of destruction is valid for the panel of these countries, and it is also found that the consumption of sustainable energy decreases CO2 emissions. This suggests that a reduction in pollution can be achieved by increasing sustainable energies in the use of military vehicles to decrease emissions.

The analysis relies on two sets of simulations of AROPAj, a supply-side model of EU agriculture: (i) a carbon price affecting agricultural GHG emissions (from 0 to 200 EUR/tCO2eq), and (ii) a lower limit on the net quantity of food calories provided by EU agriculture (200 to 450 Mt soft wheat equivalent). The model is calibrated on six annual datasets 2007–2012. The results show that a moderate increase in the price of carbon would lead to an increase in total areas and outputs of crops. Animal production decreases over the explored range of carbon price. At 200 EUR/tCO2eq, the reduction in GHG emissions ranges from 25 to 35% depending on the year of calibration. The results also show that current net calorie production from food can be more than doubled, while simultaneously reducing GHG emissions by 10–15%. The compatibility between a reduction in GHG emissions and an increase in food calorie production relies on substantial changes in animal production and feed, which implies significant variations in grassland and fallow land.

This research aimed to perform an accurate model for forecasting and assessing CO2 emissions and the production of renewable electricity for the top two countries contributing to these emissions, the USA and China. In this study, we employed three novel advanced mathematical grey models: optimized discrete grey model (ODGM), nonhomogeneous discrete grey model (NDGM), and variable speed and adaptive structure grey model (VSSGM) to estimate the future trends of CO2 emissions and renewable electricity production. These breakthrough models added value in this field of research by reducing uncertainty surrounding ambiguity and numerical ranges and improving accuracy in assessments by using small samples and imperfect information. The findings showed that, by 2026, China’s electricity production based on renewable sources would be higher than that of the USA. We find CO2 emissions in a downward trend, with more significant reductions in the USA than in China by the year 2026. The contributions of this study are the application of novel VSSGM and the use of synthetic relative growth rate modeling for predicting the overall growth of CO2 emissions and the production of renewable electricity in analyzed countries. The originality of this study lies in proposing a novel synthetic doubling time model to compute how long it will take, for China and the USA, to reduce their CO2 emissions and doubling their increase in renewable electricity production. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions; Emission forecasting; Environmental sustainability; Grey models; Prediction; Renewable energy","alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; comparative study; electrical property; energy efficiency; prediction; sustainability; trend analysis; China; United States; carbon dioxide; China; electricity; forecasting; Carbon Dioxide; China; Electricity; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099019246

Change in the value of risk f (h, A, t, θ) was hypothesized to be sensitive to climate change and other environmental factors that exist at a river basin area. Therefore, it is quite important to control the flood disaster risk as a part of adaptation programs to the climate change impacts and to deal with the increasing pressure due to anthropogenic activities. Additionally, to support the action plan and to increase the understanding and awareness related to the flood disaster mitigation, spatial information on flood risk which having high resolution and precision is required. This study aimed to quantify the spatial information of flood hazard with high spatial resolution. Two Dimensional (2-D) flood-modelling system (e.g., rainfall-runoff-inundation) at the river basin scale has been used as the main method in quantifying the flood hazard dimension. Furthermore, this study was focused in the Batanghari River basin, Sumatra and 13 river catchments flow out through the Jakarta Capital City of Indonesia.

Six ruminally fistulated steers (657.7 kg ± 72.6) housed individually were used in a 6 × 6 Latin square design with 2 × 3 factorial treatment arrangement. Each of the 6 periods were 15 d with 14 d for diet adaptation and 1 d of rumen fluid collections. Dietary treatments were DRC without monensin sodium (DRC-C), SFC without monensin sodium (SFC-C), DRC with Rumensin 90 (DRC-R), DRC with Monovet 90 (DRC-MV), SFC with Rumensin 90 (SFC-R), and SFC with Monovet 90 (SFC-MV). Rumen contents and fluid were collected through the fistula of each animal at 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h on d 15 of each period. Rumen fluid collected at 6 h post-feeding each period was used for in vitro analyses. Steer was the experimental unit and the model included fixed effects of grain processing, additive, and grain processing × additive. Total gas produced was composited from each in vitro bottle into a gas collection bag for the 48-h determination of methane concentration. No differences were detected for DMI (P = 0.81). Ruminal pH did not differ for the control or additive treatments (P = 0.33). However, ruminal pH was lower (P < 0.01) with SFC compared to DRC. There was a significant difference in acetate to propionate ratio for grain type (P = 0.01) and a tendency for additive inclusion (P = 0.06). Additive inclusion reduced methane proportion of total gas compared to control treatments (P ≤ 0.01). Overall, monensin sodium reduced methane concentration though source had no effect on DMI or ruminal pH. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

In order to interpret the climate history reflected in the glacier moraine record, the influence of both sources of climate variability must therefore be considered. Here we study the last millennium of glacier-length variability across the globe using a simple dynamic glacier model, which we force with temperature and precipitation time series from a 13-member ensemble of simulations from a global climate model. The ensemble allows us to quantify the contributions to glacier-length variability from external forcing (given by the ensemble mean) and internal variability (given by the ensemble spread). Within this framework, we find that internal variability is the predominant source of length fluctuations for glaciers with a shorter response time (less than a few decades). However, for glaciers with longer response timescales (more than a few decades) external forcing has a greater influence than internal variability. We further find that external forcing also dominates when the response of glaciers from widely separated regions is averaged. Singleforcing simulations indicate that, for this climate model, most of the forced response over the last millennium, preanthropogenic warming, has been driven by global-scale temperature change associated with volcanic aerosols. © 2019 EDP Sciences.

In Pakistan, the power sector faces the challenge of exceptionally increasing electricity demand in metropolitan areas and the urgency of reliable power access in rural areas. In this paper, a regional power-generation system of GB is developed using the LEAP (Long-range Energy Alternative Planning) model from 2016 to 2050, to explore future clean pathways to understand the planning and operational implications of futuristic variable renewables (VRE) and best available technologies (BAT). The regional power system model is further expanded by using the end-user and econometric approaches to construct five scenarios which include Business-As-Usual (BAU), BAU-OPT (BAU-optimization), Demand Side Management (DSM), DSM-OPT, and National Energy Mix (NEM). The model estimates the electricity demand projection of 3.2 TWh in 2050, at an annual average growth rate of 3.19%, and suggests that hydropower is the most dominant variable renewable source in GB's electric power system. The adoption of the BAT would avoid 1.34 TWh or about 41% of the projected electricity consumption, which shows the maximum potential of energy efficiency measures in GB. Moreover, the results indicate that: i) home appliances and lighting account for nearly halved of the reduction potential; while lighting and cooking are the most cost effective measures in terms of energy saving at regional level; ii) least cost constraint displays the transition towards large scale renewable projects; iii) the penetration of small scale renewable project is nearly doubled under least cost constraint by the introduction of demand side measures; and iv) higher emission penalties aggressively shift energy mix toward renewables with the cost of annual environmental externalities reducing in long-term. Overall, these findings can provide a scientific basis for the sustainable development of regional power-generation systems, as well as co-benefits of penetration of VRE and BAT in low-carbon electric power regions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","100% renewable system; Best available technologies (BAT); Bottom-up energy modeling; LEAP; Pakistan; Regional power system","Carbon; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Demand side management; Domestic appliances; Electric power system planning; Electric power utilization; Electric utilities; Energy efficiency; Lighting; Sustainable development; Best available technologies; Cost-effective measures; Decentralized energy system; Electricity demands; Electricity-consumption; Power generation systems; Reduction potential; Regional power systems; Electric power system interconnection; carbon emission; competitiveness; cost analysis; energy efficiency; environmental economics; power generation; scenario analysis; sustainable development; Gilgit-Baltistan; Pakistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099835297

Understanding this is important for the management of the planted forest. The present study explored the dynamics of afforested forest carbon pool in a semiarid sandy ecosystem, northwest China. We studied afforested forests of pine (Pinus sylvestris) of five afforestation ages (20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 years since planting, and bare sand as control), the carbon storage and carbon sequestration rate of the forest aboveground biomass layer, surface litter layer, and soil layer (0–50 cm) were calculated, and the soil water content and soil organic carbon of 0–400 cm soil depth were measured. The results showed that the carbon sequestration rate was highest after 20–30 years, with 0.58 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 in the soil layer (0–50 cm). We found a rate of 0.13 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 in the surface litter layer, and a rate of 20.79 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 in the forest aboveground biomass layer. The carbon storage of the forest aboveground biomass layer was highest after 30–40 years, and the carbon storage of the surface litter increased with time. In the soil layer, the carbon storage at 0–10 cm depth was highest after 60 years, the carbon storage at 20–50 cm depth increased soon after afforestation and then decreased afterward with increasing afforestation ages with the maximum for 20-50 cm occurring after 30–40 years. The total carbon storage [the forest aboveground biomass layer, surface litter layer and soil layer (0-50 cm)] was higher when afforestation ages reached around 30 years, after that it decreased with increasing afforestation age.

The total response of rainfall to 4 × CO2 in coupled models is decomposed into components associated with uniform SST warming, SST pattern change, the direct radiative effect of increased CO2, and the plant physiological response. In general, the contributions of the individual responses of summer rainfall to different forcings are subject to a regional dependence. The uniform SST warming reduces rainfall in many land regions in East Asia, but increases rainfall over the northern East Asia. The spatial patterns of the rainfall change as the result of SST pattern change are nearly opposite to those of the uniform SST warming, which account for most inter-model uncertainty in the simulations. The direct radiative effect of increasing CO2 is largely responsible for an increase of rainfall across the East Asian continent, especially over the central China and southern Tibetan Plateau, and the plant physiological effect appears to increase rainfall over the eastern and southern China. Also discussed are the atmospheric circulation changes that are driven by the distinct aspects of CO2 forcing and directly tied to the summer rainfall changes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","CFMIP-3; Processes; Response; Summer rainfall change; Uncertainty","carbon dioxide; decomposition analysis; experimental study; rainfall; sea surface temperature; summer; uncertainty analysis; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099106068

To address these decision-making issues, while considering the word-of-mouth effect, our paper considers a local operator determining wholesale price and carbon reduction level of the tour package and a tour operator determining retail price of the tour package. According to different bargaining powers, we study three scenarios: the local operator leading Stackelberg (LL), the tour operator leading Stackelberg (TL), and the static Nash game (NG). We develop three theoretical models and present some insights. We find that tourist’s sensitivity to word-of-mouth has positive (negative) impacts on optimal wholesale price, carbon reduction level, retail price, demand, and profits if the impact of word-of-mouth is positive (negative), while the impact of word-of-mouth is always having positive impacts on optimal decisions, demand, and profits. Interestingly, the NG market structure contributes the most environmentally-friendly products but mostly hurts the environment. The local operator under LL can obtain the largest profit, which is even larger than the profit of the tour operator, while the tour operator under NG and TL can obtain more profit than the local operator. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper is focused on two aspects of this challenge, which are how NOx and PM emissions in real-world driving are controlled and the impacts of NOx and PM or soot controls have on fuel economy. The vehicle tested was a model year (MY) 2018 class-2 light-duty (LDT2) General Motors Diesel pickup truck. Real-time NOx and engine-out soot emissions, as well as engine control parameters, were measured over standard EPA certification test cycles and extensive urban and highway driving. Our study found that NOx emissions were well controlled during both real-world urban and highway driving and PM emissions were strongly linked to how NOx emissions were controlled, which is either via exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) or selective catalytic reduction (SCR) dominant during different driving conditions and how fast the air flow is controlled. Increased fuel injection mass with EGR dominant NOx control during frequent take-offs from stops and rapid accelerations under typical urban driving are the main reasons of higher soot emissions compared with soot emissions from highway driving. The study demonstrated that the Diesel particulate filter (DPF) regeneration frequency doubles from designed real-world urban driving compared to highway driving, indicating the associated fuel penalty also doubles. A 50-neuron neural network engine-out soot model requiring less than 1 kB random access memory (RAM) was developed and verified with the extensive real-world driving data.

Different from the pollution source control technology usually used for outdoor air pollution control, an air cleaning street lamp is designed in this work. A 3D steady numerical model with line source pollution is established to simulate the air flow and pollutant diffusion in street canyons and validated. Then, the distributions of pollutants in 90 scenarios of street canyons are numerically simulated. The results show that wind direction and wind speed have great influence on pollutants diffusion in street canyons. Air quality in street breathing zones is improved with the reduction of emission; however, the air quality inside the street canyon is still worse than that outside the street canyon. Scenario with air cleaning street lamps with four 45° downward air outlets is shown to work better in improving air quality. In most of the studied cases, air cleaning street lamps are found to be more effective than reducing emissions from automobiles. A better method to improve the air quality in street canyons is to combine emission reduction measures and air cleaning street lamps. For the high-pollution breathing zone under perpendicular, oblique and parallel approaching wind directions, by this better method the mean PM concentration decreases by 14.38%, 7.68% and 17.78%, respectively; the mean NOx concentration decreases by 24.92%, 21.33% and 29.03%, respectively; the mean CO concentration decreases by 12.77%, 7.45% and 15.05%, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air cleaning street lamp; CFD; Emission reduction; Street canyon","Air cleaners; Air quality; Automobiles; Emission control; Fiber optic sensors; Street lighting; Wind; Automobile exhaust; CO concentrations; Emission reduction; Outdoor air pollution; Pollutant diffusion; Reducing emissions; Reduction of emissions; Urban street canyon; Street cleaning; air quality; atmospheric pollution; automobile; computational fluid dynamics; emission control; exhaust emission; pollutant source; street canyon; urban pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100742001

This action was implemented to cut down all unnecessary human activities, including industry, agriculture and transportation. Reducing these activities to a very low level during these hard times meant that some unprecedented naturally occurring measures of controlling emissions were executed. Ironically, however, after these measures were implemented, ozone levels increased by 43.9%. Also worthy of note, PM2.5 decreased 31.7%, which was found by comparing the observation data in Wuhan during the epidemic from 8th Feb. to 8th Apr. in 2020 with the same periods in 2019. Utilizing CMAQ (The Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system), this article investigated the reason for these phenomena based on four sets of numerical simulations with different schemes of emission reduction. Comparing the four sets of simulations with observation, it was deduced that the emissions should decrease to approximately 20% from the typical industrial output, and 10% from agriculture and transportation sources, attributed to the COVID-19 lockdown in Wuhan. More importantly, through the CMAQ process analysis, this study quantitatively analyzed differences of the physical and chemical processes that were affected by the COVID-19 lockdown. It then examined the differences of the COVID-19 lockdown impact and determined the physical and chemical processes between when the pollution increased and decreased, determining the most affected period of the day. As a result, this paper found that (1) PM2.5 decreased mainly due to the reduction of emission and the contrary contribution of aerosol processes. The North-East wind was also in favor of the decreasing of PM2.5. (2) O3 increased mainly due to the slowing down of chemical consumption processes, which made the concentration change of O3 pollution higher at about 4 p.m.–7 p.m. of the day, while increasing the concentration of O3 at night during the COVID-19 lockdown in Wuhan. The higher O3 concentration in the North-East of the main urban area also contributed to the increasing of O3 with unfavorable wind direction. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CMAQ; COVID-19; PM2.5 and O3; Process analysis; Unexpected air pollution","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Air quality; Emission control; Air pollutant concentrations; Chemical consumption; Community multi-scale air quality models; Concentration change; Emission reduction; Formation mechanism; Naturally occurring; Reduction of emissions; Chemical analysis; ozone; aerosol; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; emission control; epidemic; formation mechanism; ozone; wind direction; aerosol; agriculture; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; budget; chemical phenomena; China; community multiscale air quality modeling system; comparative study; coronavirus disease 2019; day length; environmental impact; industrial area; lockdown; meteorological phenomena; night; nonbiological model; observational study; particulate matter 2.5; physical phenomena; priority journal; quantitative analysis; simulation; toxic concentration; traffic and transport; urban area; wind; China; Hubei; Wuhan; Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101598000

Important candidate genes were identified and a possible network of cold-stress responses in woody plants was proposed. Abstract: Local adaptation to low temperature is essential for woody plants to against changeable climate and safely survive the winter. To uncover the specific molecular mechanism of low temperature adaptation in woody plants, we sequenced 134 core individuals selected from 494 paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera), which naturally distributed in different climate zones and latitudes. The population structure analysis, PCA analysis and neighbor-joining tree analysis indicated that the individuals were classified into three clusters, which showed forceful geographic distribution patterns because of the adaptation to local climate. Using two overwintering phenotypic data collected at high latitudes of 40°N and one bioclimatic variable, genome–phenotype and genome–environment associations, and genome-wide scans were performed. We detected 75 selective regions which possibly undergone temperature selection and identified 14 trait-associated SNPs that corresponded to 16 candidate genes (including LRR-RLK, PP2A, BCS1, etc.). Meanwhile, low temperature adaptation was also supported by other three trait-associated SNPs which exhibiting significant differences in overwintering traits between alleles within three geographic groups. To sum up, a possible network of cold signal perception and responses in woody plants were proposed, including important genes that have been confirmed in previous studies while others could be key potential candidates of woody plants. Overall, our results highlighted the specific and complex molecular mechanism of low temperature adaptation and overwintering of woody plants. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Genome re-sequencing; Genome-wide association study; Low temperature adaptation; Overwintering traits; Woody plant","adaptation; allele; climate; cold; genetics; genome-wide association study; Morus; nucleotide sequence; phenotype; physiology; plant; plant physiology; single nucleotide polymorphism; temperature; Adaptation, Physiological; Alleles; Base Sequence; Climate; Cold Temperature; Genome-Wide Association Study; Morus; Phenotype; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Plants; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102050697

This study presents a multi-goal analytical framework based on an environmental input-output analysis, structural path analysis and correspondence analysis to identify the key sectors for energy, water and carbon footprints. Using Guangdong Province as a case study, the energy, water and carbon footprints are modelled from production-based, consumption-based and network (betweenness)-based perspectives. The results show that (1) the construction sector is a key sector for energy use/water use/carbon emissions from the three perspectives. The electricity and heat power production and supply sector emitted the most production-based CO2 (283.4 Mt), accounting for 52.3% of the total CO2 emissions. (2) The key sectors in terms of energy, water and carbon differ. The transport, storage and post sector is an important sector for energy consumption, and the agriculture sector and food and tobacco sector are important sectors for freshwater withdrawal. (3) The key sectors differ according to the three perspectives. For example, the energy production sector ranked first in production-based CO2 emissions (286.2 Mt), but heavy manufacturing ranked first in consumption-based CO2 emissions (146.3 Mt). This study recommends paying more attention to the abovementioned sectors, specifically concerning the transmission role of light manufacturing in freshwater withdrawal, and reducing energy consumption-intensive but low value-added exports (such as metal smelting and pressing). The findings highlight the need to consider multiple angles and elements to identify the key sectors and help decision makers better understand the relationships and flows among the industries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Energy-water-carbon; Guangdong; Input-output analysis; Structural path analysis; Urban sectors","Agricultural robots; Carbon dioxide; Construction industry; Decision making; Electric power generation; Emission control; Energy utilization; Food storage; Light transmission; Metal pressing; Regression analysis; Sustainable development; Water; Water conservation; Agriculture sectors; Carbon emissions; Construction sectors; Correspondence analysis; Energy production sector; Environmental input-output analysis; Guangdong Province; Reducing energy consumption; Carbon footprint; carbon dioxide; fresh water; analytical framework; carbon footprint; energy use; input-output analysis; path analysis; regional pattern; water footprint; water use; agricultural procedures; Article; carbon footprint; case study; chemical phenomena; China; conceptual framework; decision making; electricity; energy yield; environmental factor; food industry; heat; light; manufacturing; path analysis; priority journal; rural area; structure analysis; tobacco; urban area; water management; water supply; China; Guangdong; Nicotiana tabacum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093959021

Parametric insurance, which delivers payouts when specific physical indices (such as wind speed) cross predefined thresholds, was recently proposed by two of us as a compensation mechanism for SG with the potential to ease disagreements about the technology and to facilitate cooperative deployment; we refer to this proposal as reduced-rate climate risk insurance for solar geoengineering, or ‘RCG’. Here we probe the plausibility of RCG by exploring the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI), a sovereign risk pool providing parametric insurance coverage against tropical cyclones and earthquakes/tsunamis to Pacific island countries since 2013. Tracing the history of PCRAFI and considering regional views on insurance as compensation necessitates reconfiguring RCG in a way that shifts the focus away from bargaining between developed and developing countries toward bargaining among developed countries. This revised version of RCG is challenged by an assumption of broad developed country support for sovereign climate insurance in the developing world, but it also better reflects the underlying incentive structure and distribution of power. © 2020 Durham University and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092296375

State of health of the battery system in an electric vehicle is crucial to the safety of vehicle operation, charging station, and the environment. The existing techniques implemented in well-controlled experimental environments fail to learn unpredictable drivers’ driving behaviors and complex road/weather conditions during actual vehicular operation. This paper investigates a novel deep-learning-enabled method to perform accurate state of health estimation for battery systems on real-world electric vehicles. Eight potential evaluation schemes depending on the stable charging stages are recapped and discussed. By fitting the correlation between battery degeneration factors and various vehicle operation parameters such as ambient temperature and mileage, an approximate battery degeneration model oriented for the real application scenarios is obtained. The variable-length-input long short-term memory network is used to learn the variable battery degeneration factors acquired from different driving stages of a yearlong dataset. The test results show that the proposed method has a better performance than other estimation methods. More significantly, based on the acquisition advantages of big-data platforms, it can be used to full-state and full-climate vehicle applications unrestricted by complex actual environments. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Battery systems; Driving behavior; Long short-term memory; State of health; Variable-length-input","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Complex networks; Deep learning; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Energy conservation; Health; Online systems; Sustainable development; Actual environments; Energy saving and emission reductions; Environmental sustainability; Experimental environment; Potential evaluation; Safety of vehicles; Vehicle applications; Vehicle operations; Automotive batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101808443

Although renewable energy has not been inherently positive for Indigenous peoples, Indigenous communities in Canada have been participating in renewable energy production, which presents a potential pathway to reconciliation, climate change mitigation and a just energy transition. This study explores whether and to what extent community energy—defined by deep engagement in process, as well as local and collective benefits—relates to elements of participation associated with reconciliation, both conceptually and empirically. A conceptual framework based in community energy was developed to characterize and analyse 194 renewable energy projects associated with Indigenous communities. This framework considered ‘community’ as belonging to traditional land, places where Indigenous people live, and as local authority, such as the Indigenous political organization of a settlement or reserve. Projects were examined by legal form, project location, and control. The findings do not provide strong indications of reconciliation. We suggest that one pathway to reconciliation is equity ownership, which has risen over time, although most projects located on traditional territories and Indigenous communities generally have minority or no ownership. There were no projects associated with Métis communities, and only 6 associated with Inuit communities. Institutional change requires implementation of free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) and extensive policy supports. Further research with and by Indigenous communities should examine how to support equity ownership by examining the findings of the 41 projects controlled by Indigenous communities and increased attention to Métis and Inuit communities. © 2020 The Author(s)","Canada; Community energy; Energy justice; Indigenous people; Reconciliation; Renewable energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101944786

The Karoo has limited surface water resources, and groundwater resources are therefore targeted for water supply. MAR systems show unique potential to reduce water scarcity in this area and to mitigate the impacts of climate change. MAR systems have been supporting groundwater supply to the communities in the Karoo since 2014, when a crippling drought has hit this area. In this article, we describe how drought affects the groundwater resources in the Karoo. We also assess the effectiveness of the operations of the three MAR systems to determine if these systems can be implemented at other sites around the Karoo, by considering chemistry and water level monitoring data for these three MAR systems. Small-scale MAR schemes are critical to climate change resilience when properly planned and managed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Drought; Groundwater; Karoo; Managed aquifer recharge (MAR); South Africa","aquifer; drought; groundwater flow; groundwater resource; recharge; water management; water planning; water supply; Karoo; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096201113

Hence, the precise description of the fuel spray is required in order to predict these emissions more reliably. The characteristics of a spray is determined during the atomization process, especially during primary breakup in the vicinity of the atomizer nozzle. Currently, Euler-Lagrangian approaches are used to predict the droplet trajectories in combustor simulations along with reaction and pollutant formation models. To be able to reliably predict pollutant emissions in the future, well-defined starting conditions of the liquid fuel droplets close to the atomizer nozzle are necessary. In the present work, Euler-Lagrangian simulations of a generic airblast atomizer are presented. The starting conditions of the droplets are varied in the simulations by means of a primary breakup model, which takes into account the local gas velocity when predicting the droplet diameter. The objective of this work is to determine the optimal parameters of the probability density functions for the starting position and the starting velocity of the droplets. Spray properties observed in the simulations are used to qualitatively evaluate the major effects of the distribution parameters on the spray and the suitability of the primary breakup model being applied. Hence, the spatial distribution of an experimental spray can be reproduced using a statistical model for the droplet starting conditions. © 2021, The Author(s).","Airblast atomization; Droplet starting conditions; Euler-Lagrangian simulation; Fuel spray; Primary breakup","Aircraft engines; Atomizers; Drop breakup; Drop formation; Forecasting; Fuels; Lagrange multipliers; Pollution; Probability density function; Atomization process; Distribution parameters; Droplet trajectories; Lagrangian simulation; Liquid fuel droplets; Pollutant emission; Pollutant formation; Statistical modeling; Spray nozzles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101254638

Thus, an combustion process simulation needs a well working knock model to take this phenomenon into account. As knocking events result from auto-ignitions, the basis of a knock model is the accurate modeling of the latter. For this, the introduced 0D/1D knock model calculates the Livengood-Wu integral to estimate the state of the pre-reactions of the unburnt mixture and considers the two-stage auto-ignition of gasoline fuels, which occurs at specific boundary conditions. The model presented in this publication is validated against measurement data of a single cylinder engine. For this purpose, more than 12 000 knocking working cycles are investigated, covering extensively varied operating conditions for a wide-ranging validation. This enables to analyze the influence of different gasoline fuels, varying compression ratios, turbulence levels, injection strategies, EGR, wall temperatures as well as engine loads and speeds on the prediction of the auto-ignition onset. To specify the auto-ignition onsets of so many measured working cycles an automated and yet reliable method, analyzing the bandpass filtered indicated cylinder pressure, is used. The input of the knock model is gained via pressure trace analysis of the corresponding measurement data. The predicted auto-ignition onset is then compared to the one of the respective measured working cycles. It is shown that the introduced 0D/1D knock model can accurately predict the auto-ignition onset for all of the investigated knocking working cycles at extensively varied operating conditions with a standard deviation below 2 °CA. © 2021 SAE International.

In Brazil, sugarcane ethanol has been widely deployed at large scale and an oriented expansion of sugarcane is considered to be a key measure to ensure the expected positive outcomes from biofuels. In this study, more recent and accurate georeferenced information were combined with an enhanced land use classification system to update the original Sugarcane Agroecological Zoning (SAEZ). We also excluded environmentally relevant areas ( ERA) in our updated SAEZ to create a new set of reference maps for supporting future prioritization of areas for sugarcane ethanol expansion. We mapped 41.7 Mha as suitable land for sugarcane expansion in center-south region of Brazil, differently from the 50 Mha indicated in the original SAEZ. After excluding the ERA, 33.7 Mha was found to be suitable for sugarcane expansion, of which 20 Mha is currently occupied with pasture lands. About half of these areas were located in Mato Grosso do Sul and Minas Gerais states and an exploratory assessment of two microregions from these states demonstrated the importance of conducting regional assessments to prioritize the areas for a more sustainable sugarcane expansion to meet future bioenergy demands. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Ethanol; Land use; RenovaBio; Sugarcane agroecological zoning","Biofuels; Classification (of information); Ethanol; Land use; Climate mitigations; Ethanol production; Global transport; Landuse classifications; Microregions; Pasture lands; Prioritization; Reference map; Expansion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097476639

Farmers in the highlands of Magelang cultivate various types of vegetables. Since highland vegetable farming hugely depends on rainfall as a primary water source, climate change remarkably affects farming. Vegetable farmers often encounter problems due to climate changes in drought and highly intense rainfall, which caused crop damage. Since specific studies on vegetable farmers' adaptation strategies to cope with climate changes and their economic effects are still limited, this research aimed to study the phenomenon. The observation was performed by interviewing all members (20 farmers) of the Mutiara Organic farmers group in Sumberejo Village, Ngablak Sub-Regency, Magelang Regency, conducting field observation and soil analysis in September-November 2018. The results showed that farmers developed several adaptation strategies to deal with climate change, namely applying multiple cropping systems, developing organic agriculture, growing vegetables under plastic shelters, and expanding a vegetable nursery as an alternative source of income. Farmers cultivated extra crops in the wet season due to abundant water availability. Organic vegetable farming, which began in 2013, from the higher value of the benefit-cost ratio, was more profitable than non-organic farming. Besides, organic farming's land quality was also better based on organic carbon (C-organic), Nitrogen (N), Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), and other nutrients. Therefore this study recommended to develop organic vegetable farming on a broader scale and seriously support farmers' vegetable nursery business, since it was profitable, contributed significant income for farmers, and strategic for vegetable farming industries development. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agricultural robots; Cost benefit analysis; Crops; Cultivation; Organic carbon; Profitability; Rain; Vegetables; Adaptation strategies; Alternative source; Benefit cost ratios; Cation exchange capacities; Climate change adaptation; Multiple cropping systems; Organic agriculture; Vegetable productions; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104867327

This poses challenges especially to low-voltage electricity grids that are not designed for the volatile and unpredictable feed-in from renewable generation capacity. In addition to the expansion of renewable capacity, further measures, including the decarbonization of the transport, heating and industrial sectors are needed to achieve the environmental targets. Sector coupling refers to the electrification of end-user energy demand as well as the coupling of different energy infrastructures such as the electricity and gas networks through Power-to-Gas technology. In this paper, we address these issues by developing a methodology that enables distribution system operators to identify future grid constraints in advance and to address them using Power-to-Gas technology using geographical information systems. In further detail, we present a novel approach to identify sections of the distribution network that are likely to be congested in the future in order to locate congestion-induced potential sites for Power-to-Gas plants. We show the applicability of our approach in a case study for a municipality in the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg. We show the economic feasibility of a medium-sized Power-to-Gas plant that couples the gas and electricity distribution networks.

The increasing economic growth has a déterrent impact on deforestation and forest degradation with the rate increased by 1.29% per year (2010-2018). Meanwhile, economic growth in Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) reached 4.87% per year. This study aims to simulate carbon management from the forestry sector in West Papua into the long-term low-carbon sustainable development. This research uses a dynamic system method through Stock Flow Diagram (SDF) stage and model validation. The results showed that the forestry GRDP and emission based on the CM1 and CM2 scenarios calculated using emission reduction of 69.61% and 91.04% were determined by 0.28 and 0.09 times from BAU. The total GRDP and forestry GRDP decreased by 5.19% (CM1) and 6.59% (CM2) and 71.57% (CM1) and 90.93% (CM2). Under this scenario, West Papua could maintain a forest cover of more than 85%. The study concludes that the results of the BAU scenario predict forest cover of 70% in 2030. Simulations carried out with CM1 and CM2 reduction in emissions show that the achievement of forestry GRDP, total GRDP, and emissions is lower than BAU. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Biodiversity; Carbon; Deforestation; Economics; Emission control; Planning; Timber; Carbon management; Domestic product; Economic growths; Emission reduction; Forest degradation; Forestry sector; Model validation; Tropical forest; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104178934

The application of this approach in carbonates is limited, however. In this study, over 9000 PXRF analyses from nine drill cores are used to document cm-scale variations in the carbonate mudstones of the A-1 Carbonate (Silurian) in the Michigan Basin. High-resolution elemental data are integrated with petrographic and mineralogical observations to evaluate the extent to which: (i) basin-center mudstones in the A-1 Carbonate (A-1C) have spatially correlative elemental signatures (i.e. chemofacies), and (ii) elemental variations reflect temporal changes in relative sea-level and sedimentation. Spatially correlative variations in concentrations less than 5 wt% of Si, Al, K, and S are observed throughout the A-1C. Higher concentrations of Si, Al, and K are associated with more abundant siliciclastic minerals as determined petrographically and with x-ray diffraction, and are thus interpreted to reflect intensification of siliciclastic sedimentation caused by relative sea-level fall. Associated S increases reflect a higher abundance of anhydrite, which is interpreted as diagenetically altered gypsum deposited during periods of low relative sea-level. Chemofacies successions for siliciclastic and evaporite proxy elements indicate four transgressive-regressive cycles. Collectively, these data show that variations in the minor, non-carbonate sediment fraction within the A-1C are regionally correlative suggesting that siliciclastic and evaporite deposition responded in tandem to basin-wide controls on sedimentation. The observed relationship between siliciclastics and evaporites further exemplifies the broader utility of quantifying the elemental signatures and non-carbonate mineral compositions in carbonate-dominated strata to constrain sequence stratigraphic interpretations. These findings add to a growing body of work that demonstrates the utility of PXRF to generate reliable geochemical data sets and highlights the importance of integrating elemental and mineral data in sedimentological interpretations. © 2021","Carbonate; Evaporite; Geochemistry; Michigan Basin; Paleoenvironment; XRF","Aluminum metallography; Core drilling; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Sea level; Sedimentary rocks; Sedimentation; Silicon; Stratigraphy; Sulfate minerals; X ray spectrometers; Carbonate sediments; Chemostratigraphy; Elemental chemistries; Geochemical data; Mineral composition; Relative sea level; Sedimentological interpretations; Sequence-stratigraphic interpretation; Carbonation; carbonate; chemostratigraphy; evaporite; geochemistry; mudstone; paleoenvironment; Silurian; X-ray fluorescence; Michigan Basin; United States; Salina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100133757

Major global climate agreements, (i.e., the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, Paris Climate Agreement, and the Sustainable Development Goals) all emphasize the need to integrate disaster resilience and climate risks with continued sustainable development concerns. Current ways of assessing synergies and trade-offs across planning for disaster resilience and sustainability in investment projects that impact communities are limited. The driving research question in this paper is how researchers and practitioners may better express relative categories of co-benefits to meet this need. We draw upon the categorization of some co-benefits as contributing to the resilience dividend, which has helped communication across fields and created bridges from research to practical on-the-ground planning in recent years. Furthermore, we leverage the growing focus on the need to recognize the role of narratives in driving decisions about how and where to invest, which elucidates the inherent value of archetypes that resonate across stakeholders and disciplines to describe investments that may meet multiple objectives. We introduce the concept of a resilience windfall as an unexpected or sudden gain or advantage of resilience planning to be conceptualized alongside resilience dividends. We then assess the practicality of decerning resilience windfalls across various projects that have aspects of both resilience and sustainability. We recount five narrative vignettes that demonstrate disaster resilience interventions and associated resilience dividends and windfalls. This effort highlights the importance of considering resilience dividends and resilience windfalls during the planning, execution, and evaluation phases of disaster resilience projects. These typologies provide an important contribution to the integration agenda between disaster resilience, climate risks, and sustainable development. There are policy implications of framing incentives for interventions that address both disaster resilience and long-term sustainability objectives as well as encouraging robust tracking of both resilience dividends and windfalls. © 2021 by the authors.

We examine the consequences of integrating electric cars and buses into the city energy system (60% of private cars and 100% of public buses), using three different charging strategies in a modelling tool that considers local generation and storage of electricity and heat, electricity import to the city, and investments to achieve net-zero emissions from local electricity and heating in 2050. We find that up to 85% of the demand for the charging of electric cars is flexible and that smart charging strategies can facilitate 62% solar PV in the charging electricity mix, compared to 24% when cars are charged directly when parked. Electric buses are less flexible, but the timing of charging enables up to 32% to be supplied by solar PV. The benefit from smart charging to the city energy system can be exploited when charging is aligned with the local value of electricity in the city. Smart charging for cars reduces the need for investments in stationary batteries and peak units in the city electricity and heating sectors. Thus, our results point to the importance of sectoral coupling to exploit flexibility options in the city electricity, district heating and transport sectors. © 2021 The Author(s)","Electric buses; Electric vehicles; Energy system modeling; Sectoral coupling; Smart city; Vehicle-to-grid","Buses; Electric automobiles; Investments; Charging strategies; Climate targets; Electric vehicle charging; Electricity imports; Heating sectors; Modelling tools; Stationary batteries; Transport sectors; Charging (batteries); electric vehicle; electricity supply; energy planning; energy storage; global warming; heating; industrial emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101332649

From the perspective of egalitarianism, this study aims to investigate the Chinese provincial CEA allocation in 2030, as well as the equality of allocation results. For this purpose, a total of 11 allocation schemes based upon a composite indicator method are developed, which consider different combinations of four allocation criteria, namely, egalitarian, responsibility, capability and efficiency. Then, an environmental Gini coefficient derived from Lorenz curves of allocation results is proposed to examine the equality of the results. The main findings show that the egalitarian criterion plays a crucial role in constructing allocation schemes, and different schemes often give rise to diversified allocation results. Although all the 11 allocation schemes, with the environmental Gini coefficients ranging from 0.0642 to 0.4019, better ensure the equality of allocation results, the schemes considering egalitarian criterion present higher equality over the schemes without this criterion. Furthermore, the schemes are likely to present higher equality, when the efficiency criterion is measured by the reciprocal of emission intensity, rather than the indicator derived from a data envelopment analysis method. Emission intensity is a better proxy for efficiency criterion in improving the equality of allocation results. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CEA; Equality; Fractional programming; Gini coefficient; Information entropy","Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Global warming; Regional planning; Carbon dioxide emissions; Comparative analysis; Composite indicators; Efficiency criteria; Emission intensity; Gini coefficients; Lorenz curves; Regional development; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; efficiency measurement; emissions trading; environmental economics; regional development; article; carbon footprint; entropy; human; responsibility; China; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092610013

Along with the dramatic changes of water related disasters such as flood and drought, local society developed various strategies to cope with the water problems. This paper investigated the evolution of the Poyang Lake area, the flood and drought disasters, and the society resilience using statistical analysis, spatial analysis, and a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Historical data on climate, population, flood and drought, water engineering, and social economics were collected to support a detailed examination of the climate-hazard-society relationships. The results indicate that: (a) the lake area was mainly influenced by the warm and rainy climate and expanded significantly before the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368 AD). Since the large-scale southward population migration in the Yuan Dynasty, intensive reclamation of wetlands surrounding the lake plus the effects of a colder climate shrank the lake area sharply. (b) The frequency of water-related disasters was gradually increasing during the past 2000 years, especially since 12th century, as a result of climate change and population growth. (c) Despite significant change in climate and increasing flood and drought, local people in Poyang Lake area adopted various water engineering to prevent flood and coast training measures to protect farmland, which enabled the social surviving and continuous economic development. Social resilience in Poyang Lake was highly correlated with lake changes and associated water hazards. (d) Presently, more ecological strategies have been adopted to mitigate the risk of flood and drought at the Poyang Lake area. The study emphasizes the influences of climate and water environment and the coping activities of human society, and thus contributes to a specific understanding of resilient living with big lakes. © 2021 The Author(s).

The drivers of change include climate change, management regulations, demographic shifts, and market trends, and their intersectionality and, ultimately, impacts on commercial fishing communities are poorly understood. The research presented here explores connections between climate change and the increase in the average age of commercial fishermen, referred to as “graying of the fleet”. Ultimately, these connections inform our overall objective: to understand how cumulative impacts from these two ongoing phenomena affect the resilience and adaptive capacity of the fishing community. Parsing out the connections may help managers or policy makers more accurately conceptualize future scenarios of community change and simultaneously enables the location of specific target areas for intervention or opportunity. Oral history semi-structured interviews with members of Oregon's fishing community were analyzed and recent climate change projections from the literature were synthesized to parameterize a set of possible scenarios regarding impacts on the fishing community. Results indicate that climate change will likely intensify both the stressors contributing to and the impacts of the graying of the fleet in Oregon. Analysis of the cumulative impacts from climate change and graying of the fleet reveal a greater impact on resilient and adaptive capacities of Oregon's fishing community than analysis of the drivers individually indicates. Therefore, an important implication from this research is the need to evaluate cumulative impacts within these coupled social-ecological systems. Relying on the responsive adaptability of fishing community members alone may not be sufficient, as their resilience and capacity to do so could be limited in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change adaptation; Commercial fishing community; Community resilience; Cumulative impacts; Fisheries management","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; ecosystem resilience; fishery management; fishing community; Oregon; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100619562

Nitrogen oxide emissions is another area of concern. Efforts in using renewable biofuels and lower carbon gaseous fuels have not succeeded yet, due to biofuel’s currently higher prices, in contrary to hydrocarbon fuels, and the structural/size challenges of pressurized fuel gas tanks. Therefore, a compromise is proposed, by combusting Kerosene Jet A fuel with a small fraction of superheated steam injection. Practically, making the smaller superheated steam tanks covers longer distances in larger aircraft. The results have shown the following reductions based on injecting a 0.1 mass fraction of superheated; unburned fuel from 10.4 to 2.5 ppm, combustion temperature from 674.5 to 626.7 °C, soot from 33.6 to 7.91 ppm, NOx from 84 to 42.9 ppm, and CO2 from &lt; 36,206 to &lt; 32,323 ppm. However, this temperature drop has caused a small reduction on the engine work output (T3 − T4).

This raises a pressing question on the potential to further reduce road traffic emissions to improve air quality. Here, we analysed ~11 million real-world data to estimate the contribution of road traffic to roadside and urban concentrations for several major cities. Our results confirm that road traffic remains a dominant source of nitrogen dioxide and a significant source of primary coarse particulate matter in the European cities. However, it now represents a relatively small component of overall PM2.5 at urban background locations in cities with strong controls on traffic emissions (including European cities and Beijing) and many roadside sites will exceed the WHO guideline (10 μg m−3 annual mean) even when this source is eliminated. This suggests that further controls on traffic emissions, including the transition to a battery-electric fleet, are needed to reduce NO2 concentrations, but this will have limited benefit to reduce the concentration of fine particles, except in countries where the use of diesel particle filters is not mandatory. There are substantial differences between cities and the optimal solution will differ from one to another. © 2020 The Authors","Mitigation measures; Nitrogen dioxide; Particulate matter; PM2.5, PM10; Roadside increment; Traffic pollution","Air quality; Nitrogen oxides; Roadsides; Coarse particulate matter; Diesel particles; Nitrogen dioxides; Optimal solutions; Road traffic emissions; Traffic emissions; Urban air pollution; Urban background; Urban growth; diesel fuel; nitrogen dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); guideline; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; road traffic; traffic emission; urban atmosphere; urban pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; data analysis; Europe; exhaust gas; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; traffic pollution; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; city; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; particulate matter; prevention and control; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Europe; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100571803

Though restrictions on these emissions were established by an amendment to the Clean Air Act in 1990, reductions in stream acidification have not been observed in all regions of SHEN due to variations in the geological composition of SHEN watersheds. Before the implementation of these restrictions, fish assemblages were strongly controlled by a stream's acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), which is the ability of a watershed to buffer acid inputs. This study investigated changes in the relationship between fish assemblages and ANC within SHEN 21 years after implementation of more stringent restrictions on the emission of sulfur and nitrogen oxides in 1995. Results indicated that recovery trends in water chemistry were observed in some SHEN watersheds; however, fish species richness and total fish biomass continue to be influenced by the legacy of acid deposition in acid sensitive watersheds. Temporal trend analysis indicated little change in ANC within acid sensitive watersheds and minor decreases in stream sulfate concentrations. These findings indicate a persistent impact from previously deposited sulfur oxides and the continued influence of these compounds on fish assemblages within SHEN. Though no further loss of fish species, and in some cases, increases in species richness, suggest the early stages of recovery, many SHEN streams remain as susceptible to acidification as they were over two decades ago, highlighting the need for continued regulation of acidifying emissions and conservation efforts in headwater streams. © 2020","Acid deposition; Acid neutralizing capacity; Freshwater fish; Headwater streams; Shenandoah national park; Species diversity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099630589

An under-explored implication of this transition, however, is whether increasing the amount of net generation supplied by WPV negatively impacts power system reliability? In this paper, we empirically investigate the preceding question using an unbalanced panel dataset of utility-scale operations between 2013 and 2017. Disruptions in power system reliability are measured by the frequency and duration of power system disruptions experienced by end-consumers. Results suggest net generation from WPV, on average, has a significant positive impact on the length of power system disruptions experienced, but only at low levels of net generation from WPV. As net generation from WPV increases, the duration of power system disruptions decreases. To provide insight into the policy implications of these results, we forecast disruptions in power system reliability, assuming different renewable energy policy scenarios for states across the United States with active renewable support policies in place. We estimate the economic costs of forecasted disruptions using an open-source, interruption cost estimate calculator. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity reliability; Interruption costs estimates; Power system disruptions; Reliability metrics; Variable energy resources","Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Electric power sector; Electricity production; Interruption costs; Net generations; Policy implications; Power system reliability; Renewable energy policy; Solar photovoltaics; Reliability; alternative energy; electricity generation; energy policy; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; panel data; power generation; reliability analysis; renewable resource; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100688195

Because of its importance, different studies have examined the climatic factors responsible for the recent changes in monsoon strength. Here, using observations and climate model experiments we show that monsoon strength is driven by the variations of south Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperature (SASST). The mechanism by which SASST is modulating the monsoon could be explained through the classical Matsuno-Gill response, leading to changes in the characteristics of vertical wind shear in the Arabian Sea. The decline in the vertical wind shear to the warming of SASST is associated with anomalous lower (upper)-level easterlies (westerlies). This further leads to a strong increase in the frequency of the Arabian Sea cyclones; and also prohibits the transport of moisture to the Indian landmass, which eventually reduces the strength of monsoon. The conditions in the SASST which drove these responses are aggravated by greenhouse gas emission, revealing the prominent role played by anthropogenic warming. If, with proper mitigation, these emissions are not prevented, further increases in the SASST is expected to result in increased Arabian sea cyclones and reduced monsoon strength. © 2020, The Author(s).","Arabian Sea cyclones; Indian summer monsoon rainfall; South Atlantic Ocean","climate modeling; cyclone; monsoon; rainfall; sea surface temperature; summer; trend analysis; wind shear; Arabian Sea; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (South); India; Indian Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099518151

However, while innovative energy technologies are introduced in order to support global targets for sustainability and service-delivery while also directly benefiting low-income households (e.g. by reducing the monetary costs of energy), there is widespread evidence that low-income urban dwellers do not always readily accept these technologies. Typically, the urban poor are blamed for failing to adopt new technologies, with little consideration for underlying socio-cultural causes. Using examples drawn from qualitative research in low-income settlements in Mumbai and Cape Town, this paper demonstrates the role of socio-cultural attitudes and practices in affecting social acceptance of domestic solar energy interventions. Focusing specifically on perceptions of normality and practices of social capital, both of which are connected to collective social influence, the paper reveals how these concepts affect the socio-cultural acceptance of new energy technologies amongst low-income urban dwellers in the global South. Furthermore, we argue that adopting a socio-cultural perspective is a crucial, but often overlooked, aspect of scholarly and policy analyses of, and strategies for, energy transitions in the global South. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Attitudes and perceptions; Cape Town; Energy transitions; Mumbai; Normality; Social acceptance; Social capital; Socio-cultural; Technology diffusion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100719648

Many methods have been used by the Chinese government to solve this environmental dilemma, out of which environmental decentralization is one of the important measures. The transparency of environmental decentralization may be weakened by the existence of the corruption problem, resulting in further deterioration of the air pollution problem. To examine this problem, the provincial panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2005 to 2016 is selected and the spatial measurement method is used to study the relationship between environmental decentralization, government corruption, and air pollution. The results indicate that air pollution in different provinces of China is spatially dependent. Local environmental decentralization has a significant inhibitory effect on air pollution, while local air pollution is not inhibited by neighbor's environmental decentralization. However, air quality is significantly deteriorated by local or neighbor's corruption problem. After adding the interaction item of environmental decentralization and government corruption as the adjusting variable, it is found that the inhibitory effect of local environmental decentralization on air pollution is weakened by the problem of local government corruption, while the government corruption of neighbor does not have this effect. In addition, both local and neighbor's environmental decentralization have heterogeneous effects on air pollution from the spatial dynamic threshold regression results with regional corruption as the threshold variable. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Corruption; Environmental decentralization; Spatial dynamic threshold regression; Spatial econometric model","Air quality; Deterioration; Chinese Government; Heterogeneous effects; Inhibitory effect; Local air pollutions; Non-linear relationships; Pollution problems; Spatial measurements; Spillover effects; Crime; atmospheric pollution; corruption; decentralization; econometrics; nonlinearity; regression analysis; spatial analysis; spillover effect; air pollution; air quality; article; China; decentralization; deterioration; econometric model; government; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098232682

The avalanche hazard varies with snow avalanche type in different snow climate regions and at different times. The ability to understand the characteristics of avalanche activity and hazards of different snow avalanche types is a prerequisite for improving avalanche disaster management in the mid-altitude region of the Central Tianshan Mountains. In this study, we collected data related to avalanche, snowpack, and meteorology during four snow seasons (from 2015 to 2019), and analysed the characteristics and hazards of different types of avalanches. The snow climate of the mid-altitude region of the Central Tianshan Mountains was examined using a snow climate classification scheme, and the results showed that the mountain range has a continental snow climate. To quantify the hazards of different types of avalanches and describe their situation over time in the continental snow climate region, this study used the avalanche hazard degree to assess the hazards of four types of avalanches, i.e., full-depth dry snow avalanches, full-depth wet snow avalanches, surface-layer dry snow avalanches, and surface-layer wet snow avalanches. The results indicated that surface-layer dry snow avalanches were characterized by large sizes and high release frequencies, which made them having the highest avalanche hazard degree in the Central Tianshan Mountains with a continental snow climate. The overall avalanche hazard showed a single peak pattern over time during the snow season, and the greatest hazard occurred in the second half of February when the snowpack was deep and the temperature increased. This study can help the disaster and emergency management departments rationally arrange avalanche relief resources and develop avalanche prevention strategies. © 2021, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","avalanche hazard; continental snow climate; disaster management; full-depth snow avalanche; hazard assessment; surface-layer snow avalanche","climate classification; disaster management; hazard assessment; meteorology; regional climate; snow avalanche; snowpack; Tien Shan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105400423

The laser energy of the two laser pulses is both maintained at around 18 mJ (i.e. the total energy is 36 mJ). The inter-pulse delay is kept at 250 ns. Ten spot sizes changing from 947 to 543 μm are obtained by precisely adjusting the distance between the focusing lens and the target surface. The profile of laser beam output from fiber shows a distinct top-hat shape. When approaching the dual-pulse waist region, the self-absorption and self-reversal of matrix iron lines gradually become intense while the plasma emission is enhanced, but the signal-to-noise ratio of minor elements gradually decreases. Under a similar spot size, the emission intensity with the target surface behind the waist region is weaker than that in front of the waist region and also with greater jitters. The target surface position is optimized to deviate from the waist region by ~ 1.3–1.6 mm towards the focusing lens for improving SNR of minor elements, corresponding to the lens-to-sample distances of 11.8–12.1 mm. Plasma morphology has undergone a transformation from stream- to umbrella-like structure using the recorded Intensified Charge-Coupled Device (ICCD) images. The expansion distance of the plasma front is increased from 1.07 to 1.28 mm, and the plasma volume is increased from 0.59 to 1.60 mm3. Besides, by utilization of OES, the maximum variation of plasma temperature and line broadening width rise to 2702 K from 1630 and to 0.0492 from 0.0316 nm along the vertical direction.

Data was collected using a literature study, focus group discussions (FGD), and in-depth interviews. The results suggested that The Pekalongan City planning document had several adaptations and mitigation plans in response to climate change, supported by several regulations. The energy, waste, and agriculture sectors were the highest contributors to carbon emissions. This study also outlined the implementation of programs and strategies in the energy and waste sectors to reduce greenhouse gases and the obstacles they face, excluding the agriculture sector, because of limited data availability.

In this work, an inert gas-free method for synthesizing oxygen-rich activated carbon has been developed. The inert gas-free synthesis is conducted simply by mixing the carbon precursor with chemical activator into a sand covered vessel followed by elevated temperature treatment under ambient atmosphere. Owing to the blocking effect of sand mulch and the overflow of self-generated pyrolysis volatiles, an in-situ pressure difference is built up to prevent air penetration, forming a local air-isolated atmosphere. Lignite-based activated carbon derived from the ambient-air process exhibits hierarchical pores with specific surface area of 823 m2/g. The hydrogen storage density of this ambient-air synthesized activated carbon is determined to be up to 0.34 wt% under 35 bar at 303 K, which is mainly attributed to the enriched oxygen-containing surface groups. DFT calculations suggest the adsorption enhancement of hydrogen follows the order of cis-COOH functionalized ≥ trans-COOH &gt; OH functionalized activated carbon surfaces. This ambient-air strategy is potentially applicable all kind of precursors, and may open up a new avenue towards the low-cost synthesis of functional carbon materials. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Activated carbon; Ambient-air; Hydrogen storage; Oxygen-containing functional groups; Sand covering","Activated carbon; Inert gases; Oxygen; Ambient atmosphere; Carbon precursors; Chemical activators; DFT calculation; Elevated temperature; Hierarchical pores; Manufacturing protocol; Pressure differences; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099252656

Here, based on bismuth oxychloride nanosheets that show efficient photocarriers separation due to combining spontaneous polarization and layered semiconductor, we report a new carbon heterovalent doping strategy for efficient UC luminescence enhancement by suppressing the intermediate excited states of Er3+ ions. The first-principles calculations and photoelectrochemical characterizations provide evidences that the replacement of C ions for Cl strengthen the spontaneous polarization and inter electric field (IEF) of bismuth oxychloride nanosheets, which further improve the photocarriers separation efficiency. Under 808 or 980 nm excitation, the emission intensity of 4I13/2 energy level of Er3+ ions (1550 nm) increase slightly with C doping, but the its decay time and the visible UC emission are improved tremendously at the same time. We show that the recombination rate of intermediate excited state electrons of Er3+ ions with the ground state is inhibited by the enhanced IEF, which promotes the energy reabsorption transition to upper energy levels, thus enhancing the visible UC emission.

Electricity consuming technologies are becoming increasingly important in this context, due to the ongoing electrification of transport and heating services. To correctly evaluate these technologies, conversion factors are needed—namely CO2 intensities and primary energy factors (PEFs). However, this evaluation is hindered by the unavailability of a high-quality database of conversion factor values. Ideally, such a database has a broad geographical scope, a high temporal resolution and considers cross-country exchanges of electricity as well as future evolutions in the electricity mix. In this paper, a state-of-the-art unit commitment economic dispatch model of the European electricity system is developed and a flow-tracing technique is innovatively applied to future scenarios (2025–2040)—to generate such a database and make it publicly available. Important dynamics are revealed, including an overall decrease in conversion factor values as well as considerable temporal variability at both the seasonal and hourly level. Furthermore, the importance of taking into account imports and carefully considering the calculation methodology for PEFs are both confirmed. Future estimates of the CO2 emissions and primary energy use associated with individual electrical loads can be meaningfully improved by taking into account these dynamics. © 2021 by the authors.

The objective is to contribute evidence to the need for adequate climate change responses. Methods: Case data of infectious diseases with proven, potential and speculative climate sensitivity were compiled. Results: Five climate-sensitive diseases in the Torres Strait and Cape York region were identified as of concern: tuberculosis, dengue, Ross River virus, melioidosis and nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. The region constitutes 0.52% of Queensland's population but has a disproportionately high proportion of the state's cases: 20.4% of melioidosis, 2.4% of tuberculosis and 2.1% of dengue. Conclusions: The Indigenous Torres Strait Islander peoples intend to remain living on their traditional country long-term, yet climate change brings risks of both direct and indirect human health impacts. Implications for public health: Climate-sensitive infections pose a disproportionate burden and ongoing risk to Torres Strait Islander peoples. Addressing the causes of climate change is the responsibility of various agencies in parallel with direct action to minimise or prevent infections. All efforts should privilege Torres Strait Islander peoples’ voices to self-determine response actions. © 2021 The Authors","Australia; climate change; Indigenous health; infectious diseases; Torres Strait Islands","Australia; climate change; communicable disease; human; indigenous health care; island (geological); longitudinal study; Oceanic ancestry group; psychology; questionnaire; Australia; Climate Change; Communicable Diseases; Health Services, Indigenous; Humans; Islands; Longitudinal Studies; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100080034

The growing population with changing dietary patterns creates a higher demand for sustainable, coordinated agri-food networks, which consolidated the value chain of the agri-foods at both the farmers and the market side. In this paper, a strategic planning framework from a large-scale crop supply chain perspective is presented for National crop Growers’ Associations (NGAs). The proposed framework aims to better equip crop growers, in a complex decision situation in taking advantage of complementary climate and market opportunities, to plan: what, when, and how to produce crops by using water-sustainable cropping plans. The coverage of this framework is at the national level to be able to take advantage of climate diversity and complementary markets in provinces with various climatic conditions. Using a multi-stage model on a countrywide management level and crop evapotranspiration and water requirement estimates, during crop growth in the different geographical and climatic ranges, it provides advisedly estimation for the regional (counties) quantity of optimum cultivation, storage, and transportation at the minimum cost and optimum land and water usage as a reform plan for optimizing existing harvesting practices. Moreover, assurance of total local farmers' income, re-cultivation in the planning horizon, and perishability of crops are considered. These considerations allow the proposed comprehensive framework to support the successful high yield practices and more water productivity in susceptible regions and months by using the regional climatic advantages, including crop evapotranspiration, effective precipitation, and irrigation productivity. In order to illustrate the application of the framework, it was applied to 429 counties and 30 provinces of Iran for potato, onion, and tomato farming systems in 2020. Computational results guarantee small-scale farmers' income, stabilize food demand coverage, and save 397 million m3 of irrigation water yearly. © 2020","Agri-food supply chain; climate diversity; cropping plan; irrigation productivity; large-scale modeling; natural resources allocation","Commerce; Cultivation; Evapotranspiration; Food supply; Irrigation; Productivity; Supply chain management; Water supply; Agri-food supply chains; Complementary markets; Computational results; Crop evapotranspiration; Market opportunities; Multi stage modeling; Small scale farmers; Strategic frameworks; Crops",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098799955

ExoIII exonuclease and triple-helix DNA molecular switch are used in detecting a target in circulation. By combining HCR with AuNPs@DNA, a novel signal probe is built, which enables multiple signal amplification and the high-sensitive detection of transgenic rice BT63 DNA. The Fe3O4@Au solution is added to a magneto-controlled glassy carbon electrode, and sulfhydryl-modified capture DNA (CP) is immobilized on Fe3O4@Au through the Au–S bond. Mercaptoethanol is added to close sites and prevent the nonspecific adsorption of CP on the magnetron glassy carbon electrode. A target DNA is added to a constructed triple-helix DNA molecular centrifuge tube for reaction. Owing to base complementation and the reversible switching of the triple-helix DNA molecular state, the target DNA turns on the triple-helix DNA molecular switch and hybridizes with a long-strand recognition probe (RP) to form a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Exonuclease ExoIII is added to specifically recognize and cut the dsDNA and to release the target DNA. The target DNA strand then circulates back completely to open the multiple triple-helix DNA molecular switch, releasing a large number of signal transduction probes (STP). To hybridize with CP, a large amount of STP is added to the electrode. Finally, a AuNPs@DNA signal probe is added to hybridize with STP. H1 and H2 probes are added for the hybridization chain reaction and the indefinite extension of the primer strand on the probe. Then, tris-(bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) is added for ECL signal detection with PBS-tri-n-propylamine as the base solution. In the concentration range 1.0 × 10−16 to 1.0 × 10−8 mol/L of the target DNA, good linear relationship was achieved with the corresponding ECL signal. The detection limit is 3.6 × 10−17 mol/L.

Herein, a continuous flow gas diffusion electrode (GDE)-cell configuration has been studied to convert CO2 via electrochemical reduction under atmospheric conditions. To this purpose, Cu-based electrocatalysts immobilised on a porous and conductive GDE have been tested. Many system variables have been evaluated to find the most promising conditions able to lead to increased production of CO2 reduction liquid products, specifically: applied potentials, catalyst loading, Nafion content, KHCO3 electrolyte concentration, and the presence of metal oxides, like ZnO or/and Al2 O3. In particular, the CO productivity increased at the lowest Nafion content of 15%, leading to syngas with an H2 /CO ratio of ~1. Meanwhile, at the highest Nafion content (45%), C2+ products formation has been increased, and the CO selectivity has been decreased by 80%. The reported results revealed that the liquid crossover through the GDE highly impacts CO2 diffusion to the catalyst active sites, thus reducing the CO2 conversion efficiency. Through mathematical modelling, it has been confirmed that the increase of the local pH, coupled to the electrode-wetting, promotes the formation of bicarbonate species that deactivate the catalysts surface, hindering the mechanisms for the C2+ liquid products generation.

Using a case study focusing on the Ajuruteua peninsula in Northern Brazil and two ES, food provisioning (ES1) and global climate regulation (ES2), this paper proposes a new framework for quantifying and valuing mangrove ES and allow for their small-scale mapping. We modelled and spatialised the two ES from different perspectives, the demand (ES1) and the supply (ES2) side respectively. This was performed by combining worldwide databases related to the global human population (ES1) or mangrove distribution and canopy height (ES2) with locally derived parameters, such as crab catches (ES1) or species-specific allometric equations based on local estimates of tree structural parameters (ES2). Based on this approach, we could estimate that the area delivers the basic nutrition of about 1400 households, which equals 2.7 million USD, and that the mangrove biomass in the area contains 2.1 million Mg C, amounting to 50.9 million USD, if it were paid as certificates. In addition to those figures, we provide high-resolution maps showing which areas are more valuable for the two respective ES, information that could help inform management strategies in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

Thus, the study aims to determine the effect of air transportation on air pollution in the most polluted city in Turkey. Design/methodology/approach: The approach includes six stages: choosing the airport, accessing the flight information for the airport, classifying the aircraft that operated at the airport, determining the aircraft engines, calculating the emission amounts, calculating the landing and takeoff-based emissions. Findings: Rather than devoting the resources disproportionally to the aviation sector within the scope of economic globalization, as a policy recommendation, to realize its production potential, Igdir, which has a great agricultural production capacity, considering its microclimate, fertile soil and arable land, should be urgently integrated into neighboring markets and the national market via railways. Practical implications: It is inferred from the research that Turkey has to consider implementing the emissions tax policy, while the Turkish aviation sector is to realize new regulations for aircraft-engine matching to take public health and the impacts of the airports on their surroundings into consideration more seriously. Originality/value: This study is an original one, as it puts the increasing pollution caused by the aircraft into a historical and political-economic perspective.

However, the integration of these technologies into the power system creates challenges for the distribution grid infrastructure. It is therefore vital to analyse to which extent grid reinforcement is needed to enable decarbonization strategies while also studying alternative flexibility measures. In this GIS-based study, we model the impact of the deployment of PV, HP and EV on a low-voltage distribution grid network serving 170’000 households in Switzerland, and analyse scenarios for their penetration in the years 2035 and 2050. Using a detailed grid model in collaboration with a distribution system operator, we find that PV leads to 18.5% and 13.7% more voltage violation issues compared to HP and EV respectively, which on the other hand, cause slightly more line overloading, 0.5% and 2.5%, respectively. We also find that grid reinforcement costs markedly depend on the type of urban setting ranging between 51–213 CHF/kWp, 46–1’385 CHF/kW and 34–143 CHF/kW for PV, HP and EV, respectively, with the higher limit corresponding to rural areas. The total distribution grid reinforcement costs can amount up to 11 billion CHF until 2050 i.e. 2’900 CHF per household in Switzerland. Interestingly, we find that batteries, even with current costs, have the potential to defer grid reinforcement for up to 15% of the transformer stations with the highest specific grid reinforcement costs. Our study aims to inform various stakeholders about the required grid investments to enable the massive deployment of low carbon technologies. © 2021 The Authors","Decarbonization costs; Electric vehicles; Grid integration; Heat pumps; PV","Cost benefit analysis; Economics; Electric heating; Investments; Reinforcement; Voltage distribution measurement; Distribution systems; Flexibility measures; Grid reinforcement; Low-carbon technologies; Low-voltage distributions; Massive deployment; Solar photovoltaics; Transformer stations; Electric power transmission networks; detection method; electric vehicle; GIS; heating; photovoltaic system; spatial analysis; stakeholder; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100116778

There has been limited integrated assessment of the environmental footprints of deep decarbonization of electricity generation. This research develops an integrated approach to evaluate the GHG emission mitigation, water footprints, and marginal abatement costs of electricity generation decarbonization pathways. The decarbonization of Canada's electricity sector was used as a case study. A Long-range Energy Alternative Planning model of the electricity generation sector was developed to determine future regional electricity generation technology mixes. A Water Evaluation and Planning model was also developed for the sector considering 530 power plants, 156 electricity generation water demand sites, and 74 major rivers. The energy and water-use models were integrated, and two scenarios were evaluated for a planning horizon of 2019–2050 using this integrated framework. The first scenario was based on current policy trajectories and the second was developed with a deep electricity decarbonization target of 100%. In the current policy scenario, water consumption and GHG emissions increased 22% and decreased 49%, respectively, by 2050 from 2019. The fully decarbonized scenario resulted in water consumption savings and negative marginal GHG abatement costs. The results quantify the co-benefits of decarbonizing electricity systems and show that transitioning toward renewables can reduce GHG emissions, water consumption, and system costs. These results may be important for policy development at the regional and national levels as well as internationally for jurisdictions looking to transition to carbon-free electricity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Decarbonization; Electricity generation; Integrated assessment; LEAP-WEAP; Marginal GHG abatement cost; Water consumption","Decarbonization; Electric power plants; Electric power system interconnection; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Water supply; Carbon-free electricity; Electricity generation; Electricity generation sectors; Electricity-generation technology; Environmental footprints; Ghg emission mitigations; Integrated frameworks; Marginal abatement costs; Electric power generation; cost analysis; demand-side management; electricity generation; energy planning; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse gas; integrated approach; scenario analysis; water footprint; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101099437

Optimization of tillage, irrigation, and nitrogen (N) application within cropping systems are keys to reducing CE. We hypothesized that an integrated system could increase crop yields and improve water harvesting, while reducing CE and enhancing C sequestration potential from crop production. In 2016–2018, this hypothesis was tested under spring wheat of maize-wheat rotation in field experiments in the arid inland irrigation of China. This research evaluated how no tillage, reduced the supply levels of irrigation and N affect crop yield, water harvesting, and CE, C sequestration potential of following spring wheat after plastic-mulched maize. Across the three study years, tillage practice, irrigation level, and N level individually had a significant effect on grain yield, water harvesting, and CE characteristics of wheat in each year, but the interaction among the three factors was hardly significant. No tillage with previous residual plastic covering (NTP), reduced irrigation, and reduced N application increased grain yield, improved water harvesting of wheat, but decreased CE. On average, NTP practice combined with a reduction of 20 % in irrigation and N supply levels (i.e., the optimized system, NTPI2N2), increased grain yield, soil water storage between pre-sowing and post-harvesting (wheat harvesting), and the ratio of transpiration to evaporation (T/E) by 13.6, 150.0, and 79.7 % (P &lt; 0.05), respectively, compared to conventional tillage with local conventional high supply level in irrigation and N (i.e., the control, CTI2N3). The optimized system reduced CE and carbon emission intensity (CEI) by 31.3 % and 39.0 % (P &lt; 0.05) compared to the control treatment, respectively. However, the optimized system had 7.5, 12.6, 7.5, and 57.4 % (P &lt; 0.05) greater net primary production (NPP), net ecosystem production (NEP), carbon in harvested wheat (harvest-C), and the ratio of NPP/CE than the control. It indicates that the optimized system had greater potential for enhancing soil C sequestration. Therefore, no tillage with previous residual plastic covering from the previous maize combined with a 20 % reduction in both irrigation and N levels is a promising strategy to improve water harvesting, reduce CE, and enhance soil C sequestration potential of wheat production in dry regions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","C sequestration; No tillage with plastic covering; Soil CO2 emission; Water harvesting; Yield performance","Agricultural robots; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Cultivation; Harvesting; Irrigation; Plastics industry; Runoff; Soil moisture; Springs (components); Transpiration; Water conservation; Water supply; Carbon emission intensities; Control treatments; Conventional tillage; Integrated systems; Net ecosystem production; Net primary production; Soil water storage; Tillage practices; Grain (agricultural product); alternative agriculture; arid region; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; experimental study; irrigation system; mulching; primary production; soil carbon; sowing; water storage; wheat; zero tillage; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097648016

Development of accessible, safe, environment friendly, and affordable will improve service quality and profitability and can contribute to sustainable public transportation. In 2013, a survey among jeepney riders described the form of transportation as noisy, dirty, and dangerous. Passengers tend to suffer from loud noises from the surroundings, dirt from pollution, and danger from unsafe old jeepney units. In the efforts of conserving the environment, the Departments of Transportation and Energy launched the E-vehicle strategy to initiate more efficient use of energy and reduction of GHG emissions in the country. The study aims to: (1) evaluate the sustainability of e-Jeepney operations in Parañaque, Metro Manila; (2) identify significant factors that contribute to the sustainability of E-Jeepney operation based on LOS and QOS scores; (3) develop a sustainability model for E-Jeepney operation based on the identified significant factors in the study. The factors and indicators were gathered from E-Jeepney operators and different reviews of related literature associated with sustainable public transportation.

During a field campaign, fresh snow samples were collected from the surface of the Yala Glacier in May 2017, which were analysed for BC and water-insoluble organic carbon mass concentration in order to estimate the scavenging ratio and surface albedo reduction. The maximum BC mass concentration in the ambient atmosphere (0.73 μg m−3) was recorded in the pre-monsoon season. The BC and water-insoluble organic carbon analysed from the snow samples were in the range of 96–542 ng g−1 and 152–827 ng g−1, respectively. The source apportionment study using the absorption Ångström exponent from in situ observations indicated approximately 44% contribution of BC from biomass-burning sources and the remainder from fossil-fuel sources during the entire study period. The source contribution study, using model data sets, indicated ∼14% contribution of BC from open-burning and ∼77% from anthropogenic sources during the study period. Our analysis of regional contributions of BC indicated that the highest contribution was from both Nepal and India combined, followed by China, while the rest was distributed among the nearby countries. The surface snow albedo reduction, estimated by an online model – Snow, Ice, and Aerosol Radiation – was in the range of 0.8–3.8% during the pre-monsoon season. The glacier mass balance analysis suggested that BC contributed to approximately 39% of the total mass loss in the pre-monsoon season. © 2021 The Authors","Black carbon; Hindu Kush Himalaya; SNICAR; Source studies; WRF-CHEM simulations; Yala glacier","Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Bioassay; Fossil fuels; Snow; Solar radiation; Ambient atmosphere; Anthropogenic sources; Chemical transport models; Fossil fuel sources; Glacier mass balance; In-situ observations; Source apportionment; Source contributions; Organic carbon; black carbon; carbon; albedo; ambient air; atmospheric transport; black carbon; computer simulation; concentration (composition); glacier dynamics; glacier mass balance; mountain region; numerical model; organic carbon; Article; atmosphere; central Himalayas; computer simulation; deglaciation; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental temperature; filtration; geographic and geological phenomena; glacier; greenhouse effect; Nepal; particulate matter 2.5; precipitation; seasonal variation; simulation; solar radiation; surface property; aerosol; air pollutant; China; ice cover; India; Nepal; Himalayas; Hindu Kush; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Carbon; China; Environmental Monitoring; Ice Cover; India; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101416443

In this context, the main objective of this experimental investigation was to evaluate the effect of the use of inert ceramics foams (Silicon carbide) inside the combustion chamber of residential wood stoves on particulate matter emissions. The porous ceramics were disposed in three configurations (floor, walls, and roof) in a single-chamber, and biomass was burned. Preliminary wood stoves combustion test showed that porous ceramics increase firewood burning rates, exhaust gases and external surface temperatures, and carbon dioxide emissions. Final combustion test results showed that for all configurations the particulate matter emission factors decreased at least in 20%. Being the porous ceramics located at the combustion chamber walls the configuration with the highest improvement, achieving a 61% reduction. The positive effect, on biomass combustion, of adding porous ceramics inside the combustion chamber could be attributed to a higher rate of the volatile organic compounds being burned due to heat and mass transfer intensification. Thus, further studies are necessary to identify an optimal design for a combustion chamber incorporating porous ceramics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Emissions; Eucalyptus globulus; Inert porous media; Particulate matter; Residential wood combustion","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Combustion chambers; Emission control; Exhaust gases; Global warming; Housing; Mass transfer; Particulate emissions; Porous materials; Silicon carbide; Stoves; Volatile organic compounds; Wood; Biomass combustion; Carbon dioxide emissions; Combustion chamber walls; Eucalyptus globulus; Experimental investigations; Heat and mass transfer; Particulate Matter; Particulate matter emissions; Particles (particulate matter)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097479537

A partial equilibrium model of the agricultural sector is used to assess economic and environmental effects. The results show that the introduction of a climate tax corresponding to the existing Swedish CO2 tax of 115 euros per tonne carbon dioxide equivalent reduces total emissions from food consumption by 4.4% without any refunding of tax revenues. Refunding with payments for all ecosystems enhances the carbon sink by an amount equivalent to 57% of CO2e emissions from food consumption, and results in net benefits in the tax refund system for the agricultural sector as a whole, but is regressive where farmers in regions with relatively high incomes receive proportionally much of the net benefits. © 2020 The Authors","Climate tax; Food consumption; Partial equilibrium analysis; Sweden; Tax refunding","agricultural emission; biodiversity; carbon emission; climate change; environmental economics; food consumption; pollution tax; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100163136

Internalize the externalities, the logic goes, and polluters will change their behavior. The theory is elegant, but has carbon pricing worked in practice? Despite a voluminous literature on the topic, there are surprisingly few works that conduct an ex-post analysis, examining how carbon pricing has actually performed. This paper provides a meta-review of ex-post quantitative evaluations of carbon pricing policies around the world since 1990. Four findings stand out. First, though carbon pricing has dominated many political discussions of climate change, only 37 studies assess the actual effects of the policy on emissions reductions, and the vast majority of these are focused on Europe. Second, the majority of studies suggest that the aggregate reductions from carbon pricing on emissions are limited - generally between 0% and 2% per year. However, there is considerable variation across sectors. Third, in general, carbon taxes perform better than emissions trading schemes (ETSs). Finally, studies of the EU-ETS, the oldest ETS, indicate limited average annual reductions - ranging from 0% to 1.5% per annum. For comparison, the IPCC states that emissions must fall by 45% below 2010 levels by 2030 in order to limit warming to 1.5 C - the goal set by the Paris Agreement (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2018). Overall, the evidence indicates that carbon pricing has a limited impact on emissions. © 2021 The Author(s).

Climate is changing particularly fast in these high-latitude regions, but it is unclear how altered precipitation regimes will affect C dynamics in the bryosphere (i.e. the ground moss layer including senesced moss, litter and associated biota) and the closely associated upper humus layer, and how these effects will vary across contrasting environmental conditions. Here, we set up a greenhouse experiment in which mesocosms were assembled containing samples of the bryosphere, dominated by the feather moss Hylocomium splendens, and the upper humus layer, that were collected from across a boreal forest chronosequence in northern Sweden which varies strongly in nutrient availability, productivity and soil biota. We tested the effect of variation in precipitation volume and frequency on CO2 exchange and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export, and on moss growth. As expected, reduced precipitation volume and frequency lowered net CO2 efflux, DOC export and moss growth. However, by regulating moisture, the lower bryosphere and humus layers often mediated how precipitation volume and frequency interacted to drive C dynamics. For example, less frequent precipitation reduced moss growth only when precipitation volume was low. When volume was high, high moisture content of the humus layer helped avoid moss desiccation. Variation in precipitation regime affected C cycling consistently in samples collected across the chronosequence, despite large environmental variation along the sequence. This suggests that the bryosphere exerts a strong buffering effect on environmental variation at the forest floor, which leads to similar responses of C cycling to external perturbations across highly contrasting ecosystems. As such, our study indicates that projected increases in droughts and ground evapotranspiration in high-latitude regions resulting from climate change will consistently reduce C losses from moss-dominated ecosystems. © 2021 The Authors.

Presentation of case: A 57-year-old post-menopausal woman presented with screen-detected left-sided breast cancer. After undergoing all staging and pre-operative studies the patient was proposed for conservative breast surgery with tumor localization. During surgery, an experimental digital and non-invasive intra-operative localization method with augmented reality was compared with the standard pre-operative localization with carbon tattooing (institutional protocol). The breast surgeon wearing an augmented reality headset (Hololens) was able to visualize the tumor location projection inside the patient's left breast in the usual supine position. Discussion: This work describes, to our knowledge, the first experimental test with a digital non-invasive method for intra-operative breast cancer localization using augmented reality to guide breast conservative surgery. In this case, a successful overlap of the previous standard pre-operative marks with carbon tattooing and tumor visualization inside the patient's breast with augmented reality was obtained. Conclusion: Breast cancer conservative guided surgery with augmented reality can pave the way for a digital non-invasive method for intra-operative tumor localization. © 2021 The Author(s)","3D breast model; Augmented reality; Breast cancer; Breast conservative surgery","adult; Article; augmented reality; breast cancer; cancer grading; cancer staging; case report; clinical article; contrast enhancement; female; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative breast cancer; human tissue; image segmentation; intraductal carcinoma; intraoperative period; mammography; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; partial mastectomy; patient referral; physical examination; postmenopause; preoperative period; priority journal; prone position; sentinel lymph node biopsy; supine position; vacuum assisted biopsy; validation process; breast reconstruction; breast tumor; computer assisted surgery; diagnostic imaging; procedures; three-dimensional imaging; Augmented Reality; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mammaplasty; Middle Aged; Surgery, Computer-Assisted",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100273339

Although the effects of climate change on pollinators and pollination services are expected to be greater in the tropics than in other latitudes, these effects remain poorly documented. Herein, we assessed the spatial distribution of nine species (of five genera) of Colombian stingless bees used in meliponiculture under present and future climate scenarios. Stingless bees are major pollinators in tropical areas and their use in managed pollination, to produce high-value honey, and as recreation is increasingly popular worldwide. Our models indicate that most species of stingless bees exhibit restricted distributions to ecosystems within the continental natural regions of Colombia. Using intermediate (RCP 4.5) and high (RCP 8.5) greenhouse gas emission scenarios, our models predict that seven of the nine species would experience a significant reduction in their climatically suitable areas, and thus will likely influence agriculture and rural livelihoods. These results are critical to developing new conservation policies and climate adaptation strategies that include restrictions in the relocation of colonies, as well as monitoring programs that help beekeepers to shift to other species in areas where our models predicted a likely reduction or loss of habitat suitability. © 2021","Agriculture; Conservation; Meliponiculture; Stingless bees; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101881635

Yet how agricultural management shapes the diversity of microscopic organisms and their evolution in the soil, especially at large spatial scale, remains unknown. Here, we investigated how agricultural land-use affected the biodiversity and the underlying evolutionary events of soil nematodes by comparing their communities in natural and agricultural soils covering a latitudinal transect spanning 2500 km across China. In natural habitats, nematode phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity and species richness showed a hump-shaped relationship with latitudes and peaked at 30° N, while in agricultural habitats those community matrices did not change across the studied latitudinal spectrum. Meanwhile, agricultural management reduced both diversity and richness of nematodes with the effect being more pronounced in subtropical zones. However, evolutionary diversification rates were greater in agricultural than in natural habitats across the entire latitudinal range. This was associated with reductions of soil organic carbon and nitrogen as well as shifts of nematode community compositions towards rapidly evolving taxa (r–strategists) in agricultural habitats. Together, our results suggest that the relatively unfavorable environmental status induced by agricultural management could accelerate the community-level speciation rates of nematodes through enriching rapidly evolving taxon. These insights increase our understanding of the systematic impacts of agricultural activities on soil biodiversity that might facilitate conservation and restoration policies for the purpose of sustainable agriculture. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Evolutionary rates; Land use; Latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG); Phylogenetic diversity; Soil biodiversity; Soil food web","Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Forestry; Land use; Organic carbon; Soil conservation; Soils; Agricultural activities; Agricultural habitat; Agricultural land use; Agricultural management; Anthropogenic activity; Microscopic organisms; Soil organic carbon and nitrogen; Sustainable agriculture; Agricultural robots; agricultural management; agricultural soil; biodiversity; community structure; human activity; nematode; organic carbon; phylogenetics; soil organic matter; speciation (chemistry); subtropical region; China; Nematoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101087458

However, its potential nitrogen removal capacity has not been approached, especially when facing simultaneous phosphorus removal. Here, the nitrogen removal ability of PED was further investigated by treating municipal and high-nitrate wastewaters in a novel process combined with synchronous nitritation, denitrification and phosphorus removal (SNiDPR). After optimization, the anoxic specific nitrite (and nitrate) reduction rate was increased from 0.41 to 1.13 mgN gVSS−1 h−1, accompanied with PED efficiency raising from 16.8% to 80.9%. It ensured that, by utilizing the limited organic carbons in municipal wastewater, deep-level nutrient removal could still be achieved (total nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies were 93.1% and 99.9%, respectively). Nitrospira (0.1–0.4%) was outcompeted by Nitrosomonas (4.7–3.3%), which contributed to accumulation of nitrite in aerobic stage (99.6%) and dramatically reduced the carbons demand of following PED.

In addition, historical and territorial processes generate a complex mosaic of interactions of residents and nonresidents, with a wide diversity of livelihoods. This generates a series of social, environmental and political conflicts in the territory. These conflicts have triggered an accelerated process of degradation, overexploitation and pressure on the Lacustrine Zone of Xochimilco (LZX). Therefore, research on how people’s opinions and perceptions into decisions could help to generate a baseline for further collaboration. We documented the perceptions of nonresidents that are involved in decision making in the LZX in terms of degradation and climate change impacts and their opinions on the actions that could help strengthen the resilience of this area. According to our results, environment and culture were the most relevant features of the LZX, while social and institutional features were the most problematic ones. Additionally, nonresident actors emphasized the tendency of the LZX to collapse, which could become even more likely due to the impacts of climate change. To address these problems, restoring the “chinampa” type of production and implementing alternative tourism were the most frequently proposed actions, while training, involving stakeholders, and strengthening governance were the most frequently proposed strategies. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Chinampas; Climate change; Lacustrine Zone of Xochimilco; Land degradation; Wetland","climate change; decision making; ecosystem resilience; environmental degradation; land degradation; perception; stakeholder; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]; Xochimilco",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086175226

In this work, real driving emissions produced by two Euro VI-C buses, one fueled by diesel fuel and one fueled by compressed natural gas, were measured. Both vehicles with different engine technologies but with the same pollutant emission certification, were tested in Madrid (Spain), in order to compare their emissions under the same route. The buses were instrumented with a modular on-board Portable Emissions Measurement System, the OBS-ONE by Horiba. Regulated gaseous emissions and particle number were registered together with different vehicle parameters: speed, exhaust mass flow rate, air and fuel consumption, environmental conditions and global position coordinates during the route. THC emissions from CNG bus doubled those obtained with Diesel bus. Slightly higher NOx emissions from the Diesel bus, with selective catalytic reduction, were obtained during those parts of the circuits (mainly urban) where both the exhaust and the operation temperature of the after-treatment device were below the light-off temperature. However, the CNG bus emitted a greater number of particles, mainly on the rural sector of the circuit. Finally, NOx and particle number concentrations along the route showed that traffic is a determining factor in creating areas with high concentrations of pollutants. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Diesel; Euro VI; Heavy-duty vehicles; Natural gas; Pollutant emissions; Real Driving emission procedure","Air cleaners; Buses; Compressed natural gas; Diesel engines; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Selective catalytic reduction; After treatment devices; Air pollutant emission; Environmental conditions; Light-off temperatures; Operation temperature; Particle number concentration; Portable emissions measurement systems; Position coordinates; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097557884

The experiment was a completely randomized design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments and four replicates per treatment. A basal diet [10% barley silage, 87% dry-rolled barley grain, and 3% vitamin and mineral supplement, dry matter (DM) basis] and a DDGS diet (as per basal diet with 25% of wheat DDGS replacing an equal portion of barley grain) were supplemented with ROD extract at 0 and 1% (DM basis), respectively. The experimental period was 17 d, consisting 10 days of adaptation and 7 days of data and sample collection. The substitution of wheat DDGS for barley grain did not affect gas production; disappearances of DM, organic matter, and crude protein; total volatile fatty acid (VFA) production; and microbial protein production. However, replacing barley grain with wheat DDGS increased (P = 0.01) fermenter pH and molar proportion of branched-chain VFA, switched (P = 0.06) the fermentation pattern to higher acetate production due to increased (P = 0.01) disappearance of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and decreased (P = 0.08) methane (CH4) production. In the basal barley diet, the ROD extract increased the acetate to propionate (A:P) ratio (P = 0.08) and reduced the disappearance of starch (P = 0.06) with no effect on any other variables. No effects of ROD in the DDGS diet were observed. The number of operational taxonomic unit (OTUs) and the Shannon diversity index of the microbial community had little variation among treatments. Taxonomic analysis revealed no effect of adding the ROD extract on the relative abundance of bacteria at the phylum level with either the basal diet or DDGS diet, while at the genus level, the microbial community was affected by the addition of both DDGS and the ROD extract. Prevotella and Fibrobacter were the most abundant genera in the basal diet; however, Treponema became the most abundant genus with the addition of the ROD extract. These results indicated that the substitution of wheat DDGS for barley grain may mitigate enteric CH4 emissions. The trend of reduced starch fermentability and increased NDF disappearance with the addition of ROD extract suggests a reduced risk of rumen acidosis and an improvement in the utilization of fiber for cattle-fed high-grain diet. © Copyright © 2021 Gomaa, Saleem, Ran, Jin, Samir, McGeough, Ominski, Chen and Yang.","DDGS; fermentation pattern; high grain diet; red osier dogwood extract; RUSITEC","Cornus extract; methane; organic matter; starch; volatile fatty acid; Article; barley; distillation; dry matter intake; fermentation; Fibrobacter; grain; in vitro study; microbial activity; microbial community; mineral supplementation; nonhuman; pH; phylum; Prevotella; protein synthesis; rumen; taxonomy; Treponema; vitamin supplementation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104587807

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. Both field measurements (1452 measurements) and the long-term meterological data (between 1965 and 2009) were used in this research. After determining the appropriateness of correlation coefficients between these two types of data, only meteorological stations data were used to generalize the results to climatic regions. For this purpose, Arc/GIS 10.2 software was used. Results: The results showed three levels of comfort including safe, caution and stress regions by graphical maps. The results showed that the center and south of the country, especially at the middle and the end of the shift hours, experienced more thermal stress in summer months (ranging from 39.60±1.07 to 49.29±2.13°C for central areas and ranging from 47.76±2.59to 57.71±1.65°C for southern areas. In the northern regions, most of the measurements in different stations and time periods at spring were in caution condition and less than 1% of them experienced stress conditions. Conclusion: The dependence of this index on the minimum metrological parameters (temperature and humidity), which are easily measured and reported daily in meteorological stations, and its non-dependence on the globe temperature, which is an unusual parameter in the measured metrological parameters, can be used as advantages of the Humidex for assessment of the heat stress conditions in outdoor environments in different climates. © 2021 Shriaz University of Medical Sciences.

During this time, an institutional framework for sustainable development has been formed both at the interstate level and at the level of specific states. Reducing air pollution is one of the key tasks that need to be addressed to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals formulated by the United Nations. In Russia, despite the adoption of the Concept of Transition to Sustainable Development back in 1996, focusing on the environmental components took a long time. The development stages in Russia of the regulatory environment aimed at ensuring sustainable development and reducing the level of atmospheric air pollution are considered. It was revealed that a significant expansion of the regulatory framework in the specified field occurred only in 2017–2019. This is largely due to Russia’s orientation towards achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and adoption of Russia’s national development goals. Despite the use of such financial mechanisms as the state program of the Russian Federation “Environmental Protection” and the national project “Ecology” to achieve sustainability goals, it was found that the share of environmental protection expenditures in the total volume of federal budget expenditures in 2019 amounted to only 1.3%.

Observations from monitoring networks show a stronger decrease of organic aerosol directly emitted to the atmosphere relative to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) generated from oxidation processes. Here, the uptake of water-soluble gas-phase oxidation products is reported as a major SOA contribution to particulate pollution in Beijing, triggered by the increase of aerosol liquid water. In pollution episodes, this pathway is enough to explain the increase in SOA mass, with formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, glycolaldehyde, formic acid, and acetic acid alone explaining 15%–25% of the SOA increase. Future mitigation strategies to reduce non-methane volatile organic compound emissions should be considered to reduce organic particulate pollution in China. © 2021.

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are known precursors of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and photochemically produced ozone. Urban VOC emission sources, including on-road transportation emissions, have decreased significantly over the past few decades through successful regulatory measures. These drastic reductions in VOC emissions have led to a change in the distribution of urban emissions and noncombustion sources of VOCs such as those from volatile chemical products (VCPs), which now account for a higher fraction of the urban VOC burden. Given this shift in emission sources, it is essential to quantify the relative contribution of VCP and mobile source emissions to urban pollution. Herein, ground site and mobile laboratory measurements of VOCs were performed. Two ground site locations with different population densities, Boulder, CO, and New York City (NYC), NY, were chosen in order to evaluate the influence of VCPs in cities with varying mixtures of VCPs and mobile source emissions. Positive matrix factorization was used to attribute hundreds of compounds to mobile- and VCP-dominated sources. VCP-dominated emissions contributed to 42 and 78% of anthropogenic VOC emissions for Boulder and NYC, respectively, while mobile source emissions contributed 58 and 22%. Apportioned VOC emissions were compared to those estimated from the Fuel-based Inventory of Vehicle Emissions and VCPs and agreed to within 25% for the bulk comparison and within 30% for more than half of individual compounds. The evaluated inventory was extended to other U.S. cities and it suggests that 50 to 80% of emissions, reactivity, and the SOA-forming potential of urban anthropogenic VOCs are associated with VCP-dominated sources, demonstrating their important role in urban U.S. air quality. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Air quality; Factorization; Ozone; Petrochemicals; Population statistics; Quality control; Volatile organic compounds; Mobile laboratories; Mobile source emissions; Population densities; Positive Matrix Factorization; Relative contribution; Road transportation; Secondary organic aerosols; VOC emission sources; Urban transportation; fossil fuel; petrochemical agent; unclassified drug; volatile chemical product; volatile organic compound; ozone; volatile organic compound; air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; observational method; particulate matter; petrochemical industry; pollutant source; urban pollution; volatile organic compound; air pollution; Article; city; exhaust gas; New York; United States; air pollutant; city; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; particulate matter; Boulder; Colorado; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States; Air Pollutants; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; New York City; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103636727

In this review article, the current understanding of the influence of emission reductions on atmospheric pollutant concentrations and air quality is summarized for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), ammonia, sulfur dioxide, black carbon, volatile organic compounds, and carbon monoxide (CO). In the first 7 months following the onset of the pandemic, more than 200 papers were accepted by peer-reviewed journals utilizing observations from ground-based and satellite instruments. Only about one-third of this literature incorporates a specific method for meteorological correction or normalization for comparing data from the lockdown period with prior reference observations despite the importance of doing so on the interpretation of results. We use the government stringency index (SI) as an indicator for the severity of lockdown measures and show how key air pollutants change as the SI increases.The observed decrease of NO2 with increasing SI is in general agreement with emission inventories that account for the lockdown. Other compounds such as O3, PM2.5, and CO are also broadly covered. Due to the importance of atmospheric chemistry on O3 and PM2.5 concentrations, their responses may not be linear with respect to primary pollutants. At most sites, we found O3 increased, whereas PM2.5 decreased slightly, with increasing SI. Changes of other compounds are found to be understudied. We highlight future research needs for utilizing the emerging data sets as a preview of a future state of the atmosphere in a world with targeted permanent reductions of emissions. Finally, we emphasize the need to account for the effects of meteorology, emission trends, and atmospheric chemistry when determining the lockdown effects on pollutant concentrations.

Freight shipments in urban areas are increasing throughout the world as a result of globalization, rising incomes, and shifting patterns of production and consumption. Urban freight shipments are overwhelmingly made by trucks, which generate significant negative impacts on human health and contribute to GHG emissions. We examine the potential of zero emission heavy-duty trucks (ZEHDTs). We use simulation modeling and case studies to explore the impacts of using battery electric heavy-duty trucks (BEHDTs) and natural gas hybrid heavy-duty trucks (hybrid HDTs) in freight operations, taking into account differences in performance and refueling. We estimate impacts for 2020, 2025, and 2030. BEHDT applications are limited in the near term due to range and charging limitations, but as BEHDT performance improves and prices go down, they are viable for a larger segment of the market. Hybrid vehicles are the most cost-effective alternative for reducing air toxics, but BEHDTs reduce air toxics the most by 2025.

One of these novel techniques is colorless distributed combustion (CDC) or flameless combustion (FC). CDC has been examined under reacting conditions using ANSYS Fluent at 27 different operating cases for the aim of developing design equations and a 3D flameless combustion map that includes the effect of air diameter, confinement size and excess air ratio on recirculation ratio to allocate flameless combustion regions. A simple lab scale combustor with central air jet arrangement is employed for the analysis. Eddy dissipation concept (EDC) either global or with detailed mechanism (DRM19) fails to predict the effect of excess air ratio in flameless combustion. A numerical approach for calculating the recirculation ratio is presented. As the air jet diameter decrease 40% there is about 54% increase in the recirculation ratio and about 90% decrease in the NOx emissions. It is found that above a recirculation ratio of 3 there is an insignificant effect on NOx emissions. Reducing the combustor diameter by a constant value for a given air diameter is found to result in a decrease in the recirculation ratio and the percentage of decrease is higher at high thermal intensities combustors. Moreover, it is observed that as the combustor diameter decrease to half of its value at constant air jet diameter and constant excess air ratio, there is an 80–90% increase in the NOx emissions inside the combustor. Furthermore, design equation is obtained to predict the appropriate air diameter that if combined with the available combustor diameter achieves a minimum recirculation ratio suitable to sustain flameless combustion. © 2020 THE AUTHORS","Combustor design; Flameless combustion; NOx emissions; Recirculation ratio","Combustion; Gas emissions; Jets; Nitrogen oxides; Combustion technique; Eddy dissipation concept; Excess air ratios; Flameless combustion; Harmful emissions; Novel techniques; Numerical approaches; Recirculation ratio; Combustors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098949491

This paper describes the annual update of the time series of emissions with estimates through 2017; there is typically a 2-to 3-year time lag in the processing of the two primary datasets used for the estimation of CO<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">2</span> emissions. We provide details on two changes to the approach to calculating CO<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">2</span> emissions that have been implemented in the transition from CDIAC to CDIAC-FF: refinement in the treatment of changes in stocks at the global level and changes in the procedure to calculate CO<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">2</span> emissions from cement manufacture. We compare CDIAC-FF's estimates of CO<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">2</span> emissions with other global and national datasets and illustrate the trends in emissions (1990-2015) using a decomposition analysis of the Kaya identity. The decompositions for the top 10 emitting countries show that, although similarities exist, countries have unique factors driving their patterns of emissions, suggesting the need for diverse strategies to mitigate carbon emissions to meditate anthropogenic climate change.

The main issues in garbage truck routing are determining the optimal routes, minimizing time, decreasing the costs, and reducing the pollution’s emission. In the literature, the time spent at a waste collection point (WCP) is considered as the average time, or it is not included at all. Time spent at a WCP is determined by the processes of picking up, emptying, and putting down the waste containers and the factors specific for different WCPs. Those factors impact the time spent at WCP significantly. Excluding time spent at a WCP or taking the average of that in the planning approach may lead to the inaccurate estimation of total collection time. The aim of this article is to present the multiple regression model for estimating time spent at a WCP. We analyzed the impact of the WCP factors (i.e., building type and number of containers) on the time that a garbage truck spends at it. We initially considered seven chosen factors, five categorical and two numerical. Based on this, we developed the multiple regression model based on linear regression use. Later, the proposed model was validated based on data obtained from the municipal company operating in Wroclaw city, Poland. The study confirmed that the defined factors significantly affect garbage truck’s time spent at a WCP and should be taken into account during waste collection planning processes’ performance. © 2021 by the authors.

Four native fast growing fodder trees, namely, Ficus infectoria, Morus alba, Acacia nilotica and Leucaena leucocephala with combination of grasses viz., Cenchrus ciliaris, Chrysopogon fulvus and Panicum maximum were used as eco-restoration tool in Bundelkhand region. Total organic carbon (TOC), microbial biomass C (MBC), and activities of important soil enzymes were measured. After 9 years, land under Ficus, Morus, Acacia and Leucaena had ~63, 105, 87 and 81% greater TOC than fallow land in surface layer and Cenchrus, Panicum, and Chrysopogon increased TOC by 84, 91 and 77% at surface layers, respectively, over fallow land. MBC increased by 2–2.5 folds in both soil layers. All C fractions responded positively to eco-restoration. Ficus, Morus, Acacia and Leucaena boosted up carbon management index (CMI) by 51, 84, 71 and 65% at surface layers, respectively over fallow land. Similarly, grasses also improved CMI by >60%.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICCP) in reducing bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens) transport. To perform the MICCP process, air-dried sterile sand was poured into polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cylinders (4.8 × 14.92 cm) and incubated for 3 days in the presence of Sporosarcina pasteurii (~108 Cell g−1sand), urea and CaCl2 (1.5 M). A pulse (0.1 pore volume (PV)) of bacteria suspension (108 CFU mL−1) was added on top of the sand columns (MICCP treated and control) and leaching experiments were followed at steady-state, saturated flow condition. Culturable bacteria were determined in the leachate and the sand extracts (resident bacteria) by colony count method. The MICCP treatment reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) value 3.9 times compared to the control and thereby reduced bacteria leaching. Bioprecipitated calcium carbonate in MICCP columns increased bacteria straining compared to control columns especially in surface layer (0-3 cm). MICCP process increased filtration coefficient (λf), and relative adsorption index (SR), and decreased maximum depth of bacteria transport (Zmax). The average (Cav) and cumulative cell density (Ccum) of both bacteria passed from the MICCP column decreased around 3.9-fold compared to the control. Overall, the MICCP process has potential in bacteria filtration in the porous media reducing the risk of groundwater pollution. © 2021","Bacteria filtration; Hydraulic conductivity; MICCP; Sporosarcina pasteurii","bacterium; biogenic deposit; calcium carbonate; filtration; hydraulic conductivity; polymer; sand; saturation; steady-state equilibrium; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas fluorescens; Sporosarcina pasteurii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099679159

The study further determines the relative importance of key factors controlling dust emissions by applying 12 individual DM models. The integrated model is based on the individual models returning Nash Sutcliffe coefficient (NSC) values > 90% for the spatial modelling of land susceptibility to dust emissions and using the area under the curve (AUC) for validation. 13 key factors controlling dust emissions are mapped including soil characteristics, climatic variables, vegetation cover, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), geology and land use. Based on Spearman clustering analysis and multi-collinearity tests (tolerance coefficient -TC and variance inflation factor -VIF), the effective factors for dust emissions are classified into nine clusters and no multi-collinearity is found among the effective factors. DEM, NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), geology and calcium carbonate are identified as the most important factors controlling dust emissions. Seven individual models return NSC in the range of 90–98% and are used to generate the integrated model for the final mapping of land susceptibility to dust emissions. Among 851 pixels located in the dust sources, 30% (255 pixels) and 70% (596 pixels) are randomly selected as validation and training datasets, respectively for the new integrated model. Using this model, 9%, 17%, 7% and 67% of the study area correspond to low, moderate, high and very high susceptibility classes, while the validation results in AUC = 99.3%. Simulations with the RegCM4 model reveal high consistency regarding the spatial distribution of the most susceptible areas and dust emissions.

Ex Benth., have been highly popular all over the world throughout the time. Future climate change is believed to be one of the great threats to the range and resilience of these species. Therefore, recognizing the extensive spatial distribution and potential effects of global climate change on S. hydrangea in its major habitats (Chaharmahal Va Bakhtiari province: CVBP, Central Zagros Mountains: CZMs, Iran) is of considerable importance. We recorded the data concerning occurrence points data using the global positioning system (GPS). We also collected bioclimatic and topographic variables from the WorldClim-global climate dataset to model the current and future (under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 within two global circulation models HadGEM2-CC and MRI-CGCM3 for 2050 and 2070) habitat suitability for S. hydrangea employing an ensemble species distribution modeling (ESDM) on BIOMOD2 package. The visualization of an ensemble forecasting model of the true skill statistic (TSS) > 0.8 models revealed that the majority of suitable habitats for this species were situated in the east and southeast of this province. Generally, precipitation of coldest season, temperature annual range, and elevation variables were of great importance for our study model. Comparing the current and future habitat suitability distribution of S. hydrangea, it could be concluded that the plant distribution is migrating between different latitudes and altitudes. The results suggested that the scenarios of MIRI-CGCM3 probably create serious effects and implications on the future distribution of S. hydrangea habitats. The loss of habitat of this species in the southeast of this province was considerably more visible, indicating a significant diminution in the distribution area. However, the potential distribution of S. hydrangea in this province would face alarming conditions between 2050 and 2070. Consequently, S. hydrangea could be particularly in need of conservation plans, which is urgently needed in order to reduce climate change-associated impacts. © 2021 The Author(s)","BIOMOD2; Global climate change; Medicinal plants; Range shifts; Species distribution modeling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102866942

Historical rainfall and temperature data of forty years (1978–2017) obtained from Ethiopian Meteorological Agency and household questionnaire survey (n=150) were used to assess the climate trend of Jimma city. Descriptive statistics have been used to assess people’s perceptions towards climate change. Rainfall and temperature variability were analyzed using standard deviations, coefficient of variation (CV), rainfall anomaly index and standard precipitation index. The magnitude of the linear trends is estimated using the Sen’s slope estimator, and Mann–Kendall test to check the statistical significance of the trends. Findings revealed that average maximum and minimum temperature showed statistically significant trend. The magnitude of increasing trends of monthly maximum temperature varies between 0.033 and 0.045 °C/year in January and April, respectively. For minimum temperature the magnitude of trends vary between 0.081 °C/year in November and 0.025 °C/year in April. Annual rainfall variability is relatively stable with 11% CV, while monthly rainfall variability was found to be very high in December, January, and February with CV 115, 80, and 75, respectively. The result from household survey shows that 85% perceived the increasing trends of temperature. The community perceived that climate change is having an impact on vector-borne diseases. Our results indicate that climate-borne disease and pests, food insecurity, frequent drought and flooding appear to have a significant relationship with climate change with p value 0.000, 0.029, 0.010, and 0.047, respectively.

They are operated with gas mixture recirculation systems to reduce operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions since their gas mixture is based on C2H2F4, which has a high global warning potential. It is well known that the C2H2F4 molecule can break down under the effect of radiation and electric field. This leads to the creation of several impurities and free fluoride ions (F-), which could accumulate under gas recirculation and potentially attach to the RPC bakelite electrode inner surface. For these reasons, an extensive gas analysis campaign has been performed during LHC Run 2 for the CMS RPC system to verify gas mixture quality and possible accumulation of impurities. During the entire LHC Run 2 period, a gas chromatograph has been used to analyze the RPC gas mixture at different points of the gas system: quality of pure C2H2F4, fresh gas from the mixer, gas at the output of the detectors, and after the purifier module. Several impurities have been found and identified. Few impurities are already present in the C2H2F4 supply, as residuals of the industrial production. Nevertheless, it was found that some of these impurities, as well as others, are created inside the detector gas gap due to the fragmentation of the C2H2F4 molecule under the effects of electric field and radiation. During the 2018 LHC Run several gas analysis points were added to measure the fluoride ions production in different sectors of the RPC detector system. Indeed the products of the C2H2F4 fragmentation do not always recombine and F- species can stay free in the gas mixture. F- analyses were performed on the gas at the output of the detectors both for barrel and endcap regions, where radiation levels and operational conditions were different. In this way, it was possible to correlate the F- production with integrated charge, and gas mixture flow rate. In parallel, the RPC currents have been constantly monitored to look for possible correlations. Fluoride measurements have also been performed at GIF++ to better understand the correlation between F- production, radiation levels and gas volume exchanges. A comprehensive overview of the results obtained from the different types of gas analyses and possible correlation with RPC currents and LHC luminosity will be presented. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab.","Gas systems and purification; Gaseous detectors; Mass spectrometers; Resistive-plate chambers","Electric fields; Fluorine compounds; Gas chromatography; Gas emissions; Gas mixtures; Greenhouse gases; Molecules; Particle spectrometers; Phenolic resins; Polyols; Quality control; Radiation effects; Bakelite electrodes; Effects of electric fields; Global warning potential; Industrial production; Large Hadron collider LHC; Operational conditions; Recirculation systems; Resistive plate chambers; Air purification",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105436971

It also aims to identify a methodological approach that allows the socio-technical perspective to be integrated into management decision-making, alongside the more typical economic appraisal methodology. Design/methodology/approach: A case study and novel mixed-methodology approach is used, which applies the diffusion of innovations framework, innovation system (IS) framework and system dynamics modelling (SDM) alongside traditional economic modelling and appraisal techniques. This approach is used to assess the adoption potential of solar photovoltaic (PV) and diesel water pumping systems in the wildlife conservation sector and surrounding rural communities in Kenya. The case study approach tests the merits of the mixed-methodology approach. Findings: The life-cycle costs of solar PV water pumping systems are lower in nearly all financing and utilisation scenarios; offer additional social, technical and environmental benefits; and the conditions exist for greater adoption. The use of an integrated diffusion of innovations and IS framework generates significant qualitative data that can support management decision-making. The use of SDM techniques aid conceptualisation of the community economic, water and institutional systems into which water pumps may be diffused and provide a starting point for formal SDM simulation. The results suggest that these techniques capture the socio-technical perspective well and, when used alongside traditional project appraisal approaches, produce more complete information with which to support management decision-making.

We quantify the respective effects of the reductions in NOx and in volatile organic carbon (VOC) emissions, which, in most cases, affect oxidants in opposite ways. Using model simulations, we show that the level of NOx has been reduced by typically 40% in China during February 2020 and by similar amounts in many areas of Europe and North America in mid-March to mid-April 2020, in good agreement with space and surface observations. We show that, relative to a situation in which the emission reductions are ignored and despite the calculated increase in hydroxyl and peroxy radicals, the ozone concentration increased only in a few NOx-saturated regions (northern China, northern Europe, and the US) during the winter months of the pandemic when the titration of this molecule by NOx was reduced. In other regions, where ozone is NOx-controlled, the concentration of ozone decreased. SOA concentrations decrease in response to the concurrent reduction in the NOx and VOC emissions. The model also shows that atmospheric meteorological anomalies produced substantial variations in the concentrations of chemical species during the pandemic. In Europe, for example, a large fraction of the ozone increase in February 2020 was associated with meteorological anomalies, while in the North China Plain, enhanced ozone concentrations resulted primarily from reduced emissions of primary pollutants. © 2021.

The analysis starts from a qualitative general analysis on the stressful conditions leading to tree decline in the urban environment especially during extreme climate change phenomena. Subsequently, the effects of planting new types of trees are assessed using ENVI-met, a 3D prognostic non-hydrostatic model for the simulation of surface-plant-air interactions. Results, obtained by simulating three different scenarios in which the trees are first removed and then modified, show that a gradual renewal of the existing trees, based on priority criteria of maturity or senescence, vegetative and phytosanitary conditions, efficiency of ecosystem services and safety for citizens, has positive effects on thermal comfort. By integrating current results and scientific literature, the final aim of this work is to provide stakeholders with a strategic and systemic planning methodology, which, based on the innovative integrated use of tree management and modelling tools, may (i) enhance the benefits of greening in a scenario of climate change and (ii) lead to intervention strategies based on complementarity between conservation of existing trees and tree renewal. © 2021 by the authors.

In order to mitigate these issues, it has been proposed to operate the distribution system more flexibly. For instance, residential buildings are ideal candidates to offer energy flexibility locally and defer avoidable and expensive system expansions. Due to advances in smart meter technologies and trends towards digitalization, it becomes more and more common that electrical appliances in residential buildings are equipped with remote communication and control capabilities. This paper aims at quantifying a flexibility envelope of actively controlled flexible buildings and at analyzing the sensitivity of flexibility levels with respect to system configuration, control strategy and objective function settings. We consider rooftop photovoltaic units, air-sourced heat pumps for space heating and domestic hot water, thermal energy storage and electric vehicles. The results show that an optimal control aiming at minimizing energy costs while limiting peak power can lead to savings of up to 25% compared to the existing rule-based control. When carbon emissions are considered in the cost function, the optimized controller leads to an emission reduction of up to 21%. The time-dependent quantification of the flexibility envelope further reveals that high and low power levels can only be sustained for a limited period, whereas medium power levels can be sustained the longest. © 2021 The Authors","Building energy management system; Demand response; Flexibility envelope; Model predictive control; Self-report","Cost functions; Emission control; Heat storage; Renewable energy resources; Thermography (temperature measurement); Distribution systems; Electrical appliances; Objective functions; Optimized controllers; Remote communication; Residential building; Reverse Power flows; System configurations; Housing; alternative energy; building; communication network; distribution system; energy efficiency; energy management; energy planning; energy storage; prediction; residential energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101368668

Despite using the same heating program, the residual carbon contents varied from 22 to 67% to bovine liver digests and from 7 to 96% to rice flour digests. Quantitative recoveries were obtained for most analytes. Low recoveries were observed mainly for Ca and Fe.

However, DoD climate risk reduction is complicated by frequent leadership turnover among base commanders, which encourages focus on near-term challenges, and changing US government priorities that downplay climate risk. We used risk-based deliberation, through workshops, with climate scenario-based fire and flood impact modeling to evaluate risk and adaptation opportunities at bases in the southwestern United States. We found that success in working with Defense installations hinges on linking risks of increasing climate-related impacts to DoD's ability to achieve its mission objectives at installations. Workshop participants offered insights into barriers to adaptation, including access to decision-makers in a hierarchical organization, leadership focus on near-term challenges, insufficient training or capacity to integrate climate information into short and long-term decisions, and rapid turnover in leadership. We also found opportunities for mainstreaming climate risk management into DoD activities, including emphasizing risks to DoD's mission, opportunities to form symbiotic partnerships with external partners, and the potential for standardized procedures for considering physical climate risks that could be integrated across the DoD to achieve longer-term solutions to climate change challenges. © 2021 The Authors","Base management; Climate change adaptation; Complex organizations; Military operations; Risk management","adaptive management; armed forces; climate change; climate effect; decision making; defense industry; organization; risk assessment; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106310329

To promote local consumption of renewable energy sources, governments are supporting members of ECs with strong incentives on shared electricity. This policy encourages investments in the residential sector for building retrofit interventions and technical equipment reno-vations. In this paper, a general EC is modeled as an energy hub, which is deemed as a multi-energy system where different energy carriers are converted or stored to meet the building energy needs. Following the standardized matrix modeling approach, this paper introduces a novel methodology that aims at jointly identifying both optimal investments (planning) and optimal management strategies (operation) to supply the EC’s energy demand in the most convenient way under the current economic framework and policies. Optimal planning and operating results of five refurbishment cases for a real multi-family building are found and discussed, both in terms of overall cost and environmental impact. Simulation results verify that investing in building thermal efficiency leads to progressive electrification of end uses. It is demonstrated that the combination of improvements on building envelope thermal performances, photovoltaic (PV) generation, and heat pump results to be the most convenient refurbishment investment, allowing a 28% overall cost reduction compared to the benchmark scenario. Furthermore, incentives on shared electricity prove to stimulate higher renewable energy source (RES) penetration, reaching a significant reduction of emissions due to decreased net energy import. © 2021 by the authors.

The one-pot reaction features no metals as a building block or reagent, hence facilitating the structural purity and industrial scalability of the design. Through a single-crystal study on a model compound, the double Schiff base formation is found to follow syn addition, a kinetically favored product, suggesting that reactivity of the amine and carbonyls dictate the order and geometry of the framework building. The highly porous pyrazole polymer COP-214 is chemically resistant in reactive conditions for over two weeks and thermally stable up to 425 °C in air. COP-214 shows well-pronounced gas capture and selectivities, and a high CO2/N2 selectivity of 102. The strongly coordinating pyrazole sites show rapid uptake and quantitative selectivity of Pd (II) over several coordinating metals (especially Pt (II)) at all pH points that are tested, a remarkably rare feature that is best explained by detailed analysis as the size-selective strong coordination of Pd onto pyrazoles. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show energetically favorable Pd binding between the metal and N-sites of COP-214.

This study purchased large specimens of demersal fishes from an upwelling region: Warsaw grouper (Epinephelus nigritus), Dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus) and Namorado sandperch (Pseudopercis numida). The authors addressed the bioaccumulation and toxicokinetic of mercury in fish organs, and the toxicological risk for human consumption of this metal in the muscle tissues accessed. Additionally, the present study discussed the possible implications of shifts in key variables of the environment related to a climate-changing predicted scenario, to the mercury biomagnification in a tropical upwelling system. The muscle was the main stock of MeHg, although the highest THg concentrations have been found in liver tissue. Regarding the acceptable maximum level (ML = 1 mg kg−1), E. nigritus and E. marginatus showed 22% of the samples above this limit. Concerning P. numida, 77% were above 0.5 mg kg−1, but below the ML. The %MeHg in liver and muscle showed no significative correlations, which suggest independent biochemical pathways to the toxicokinetic of MeHg, and constrains the indirect assessment of the mercury contamination in the edible tissue by the liver analyses. The present study highlights the food web features of a tropical upwelling ecosystem that promote mercury biomagnification. Additionally, recent studies endorse the enhancement of upwelling phenomenon due to the climate global changes which boost the pumping of mercury enriched water to the oceanic upper layer. Therefore, the upwelling areas might be hot spots for MeHg monitoring in marine biota. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Food safety; Human exposure; Mercury; Methylmercury; Seafood","Bioaccumulation; Biochemistry; Chemical contamination; Ecology; Fish; Mercury (metal); Muscle; Tissue engineering; Tropics; Biochemical pathway; Climate change scenarios; Human consumption; Mercury biomagnification; Mercury contamination; Mercury in fishes; Monomethylmercury; Upwelling systems; Climate change; mercury; water; mercury; methylmercury derivative; biomonitoring; climate change; demersal fish; ecotoxicology; marine environment; mercury (element); perciform; pollution effect; upwelling; animal tissue; bioaccumulation; biological monitoring; Brazil; climate change; concentration (parameter); controlled study; demersal fish; Epinephelus; Epinephelus marginatus; Epinephelus nigritus; global climate; human; liver tissue; muscle tissue; nonhuman; Pseudopercis numida; toxicokinetics; animal; Atlantic Ocean; biological monitoring; climate change; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; fish; food chain; water pollutant; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Southeast); Brazil; Epinephelus marginatus; Epinephelus nigritus; Numida; Pisces; Pseudopercis numida; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Biological Monitoring; Brazil; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Fishes; Food Chain; Humans; Mercury; Methylmercury Compounds; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096134185

In this work the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was implemented for the 2006–2018 period in a rainfed catchment of central Chile (36°) to test the hypothesis that adaptive plantation strategies could mitigate the impacts of climate change and increase streamflow. We also hypothesize that afforestation with exotic tree plantations will reduce water availability in Mediterranean catchments, acting in synergy with climate change. Five LULCC scenarios are analyzed: i) current long-term national Forest Policy (FP), ii) extreme scenario (EX) with large afforestation surfaces, both including the replacement of native shrublands with Pinus radiata; iii) adaptive plantation management scenario (FM), with lower planting density, iv) forced land displacement scenario (FLD), where plantations at the headwaters are moved to lowland areas and replaced with native shrublands, and v) pristine scenario (PR), with only native vegetation. Each LULCC scenario was run with present climate and with projections of different CMIP5 climate models under the RCP 8.5 scenario for the period 2037–2050, and then compared against simulations based on the present land cover and climate. Simulations with the five LULCC scenarios (FP, EX, FM, FLD and PR) with present climate resulted in variations of −2.5, −17.3, 0, 2.3 and 10.9% on mean annual streamflow (Q), while simulations with the current land cover and CC projections produced a 32.1% decrease in mean annual Q. The joint impact of CC and LULCC leads to changes in mean annual Q ranging from −46.2% (EX) to –23.3% (PR). Afforestation with exotic pines will intensify the reduction in water yield, while conservative scenarios focused on native forests protection and restoration could partially mitigate the effect of CC. We make a strong call to rethink current and future land management strategies to cope with lower water availability in a drier future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Exotic plantations; Hydrological response; LULCC; Native shrubland; SDGs; SWAT","Catchments; Climate models; Conservation; Land use; Reforestation; Runoff; Stream flow; Land use and land cover change; Land-use strategies; Mediterranean catchment; Mediterranean ecosystem; Plantation managements; Protection and restoration; Soil and water assessment tool; Water availability; Climate change; afforestation; catchment; climate change; coniferous forest; coniferous tree; land cover; land use; land use change; shrubland; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; tree planting; Mediterranean Region; Pinus radiata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101127086

It requires to be constituted by a minimum and reliable number of measurement sites. Nevertheless, the AQMN efficiency should be assessed over time, as a consequence of the possible emergence of new emission sources of air pollutants, which could lead to variations on their spatial distribution within the target area. PM10 particles data monitored by the Community of Madrid's (Spain) AQMN between 2008 and 2017 were used to develop a methodology to optimize the AQMN performance. The annual spatial distribution of average PM10 levels over the studied period monitored by all current stations vs those more representative was provided by a geographic information system (GIS), and the percentage of similarity between both postulates was quantified using simple linear regression (&gt; 95%). As one innovative tool of this study, the practical application of the proposed methodology was validated using PM10 particles data measured by AQMN during 2007 and 2018, reaching a similitude degree higher than 95%. The influence of temporal variation on the proposed methodological framework was around 20%. The proposed methodology sets criteria for identifying non-redundant stations within AQMN, it is also able to appropriately assess the representativeness of fixed monitoring sites within an AQMN and it complements the guidelines set by European legislation on air pollutants monitoring at fixed stations, which could help to tackle efforts to improve the air quality management. © 2020","Air quality; Ambient air monitoring network; Environment management; Optimization; PM10 particles; Redundant stations","Air quality; Efficiency; Spatial distribution; Air quality monitoring networks; Environment management; European legislation; Measurement sites; Methodological frameworks; Similitude degree; Simple linear regression; Temporal variation; Quality management; air quality; ambient air; environmental management; GIS; legislation; monitoring system; optimization; particulate matter; pollutant source; spatiotemporal analysis; Madrid [Madrid (ADS/PRV)]; Madrid [Spain]; Spain; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091757430

Two consortia, dominated by Methylosinus spp., degraded both compounds with transient production of reduced NTO products, and non-stoichiometric production of reduced DNAN products. No release of inorganic nitrogen was observed with either compound, indicating that NTO and DNAN may be utilized as nitrogen sources by these consortia. The pure culture Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b also degraded both compounds. Degradation was observed in the presence of acetylene (a known inhibitor of methane monooxygenase; MMO) when methanol was supplied, indicating that MMO was not involved. Furthermore, studies with purified soluble MMO (sMMO) from OB3b indicated that neither compound was a substrate for sMMO. Degradation was inhibited by 2-iodosobenzoic acid, but not by dicoumarol, suggesting involvement of an oxygen- and dicoumarol-insensitive (nitro)reductase. These results indicate methanotrophs can aerobically degrade NTO and DNAN via one or more (nitro)reductases, with sMMO serving a supporting role deriving reducing equivalents from methane. This finding is important because methanotrophic bacteria are widely dispersed, and may represent a previously unrecognized route of NTO and DNAN biotransformation in aerobic environments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biotransformation; DNAN; Insensitive munition; Methane-oxidizing bacteria; NTO; Oxygen-insensitive (nitro)reductase","Bioconversion; Explosives; Methane; 2 ,4 ,6-trinitrotoluene; 2 ,4-dinitroanisole; 3 Nitro 1 ,2 ,4 triazol 5 ones (NTO); Aerobic environments; Insensitive munitions; Methane monooxygenase; Methanotrophic bacteria; Methylosinus trichosporium; Aerobic bacteria; 1,3,5 trinitro 1,3,5 triazine; 2 iodosobenzoic acid; 2,4 dinitroanisole; 3 nitro 1,2,4 triazol 5 one; 3 nitro 1,2,4 triazole derivative; acetylene; anisole derivative; cyclonite; dicoumarol; explosive; ground water; methane; methane monooxygenase; methanol; nitrogen; nitroreductase; oxygen; trinitrotoluene; 2,4-dinitroanisole; 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one; nitro derivative; triazole derivative; acetylene; biotransformation; explosive; inhibitor; inorganic nitrogen; methane; methanol; aerobic bacterium; aerobic cell culture; bacterial strain; bacterium culture; biodegradation; biotransformation; enzyme purification; methanotroph; methanotrophic bacterium; Methylocella palustris; Methylosinus; Methylosinus trichosporium; microbial community; microbial consortium; nonhuman; oxidation; solubility; biotransformation; oxidation reduction reaction; Methylosinus; Methylosinus trichosporium; Anisoles; Biotransformation; Methane; Nitro Compounds; Oxidation-Reduction; Triazoles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094930131

In this study, we use a compact Earth system model to quantify the global RF and attribute global RF to individual countries and regions. As our evaluation, the United States, the first 15 European Union members, and China are the top three contributors, accounting for 21.9 ± 3.1%, 13.7 ± 1.6%, and 8.6 ± 7.0% of global RF in 2014, respectively. We also find a contrast between developed countries where GHGs dominate the RF and developing countries where SLCFs including aerosols and ozone are more dominant. In developing countries, negative RF caused by aerosols largely masks the positive RF from GHGs. As developing countries take measures to improve the air quality, their negative contributions from aerosols will likely be reduced in the future, which will in turn enhance global warming. This underlines the importance of reducing GHG emissions in parallel to avoid any detrimental consequences from air quality policies. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

Timely management of rapidly changing marine ecosystems must be matched with methods to rapidly quantify and assess climate driven impacts to ecological communities. Here we create a species-specific, classification system for fish thermal affinities, using three quantifiable datasets and expert opinion. Multiple sources of information limit potential data bias and avoid misclassification. Using a temperate kelp forest fish community in California, USA as a test case for this new methodology, we found the majority of species had high classification agreement across all four data sources (n = 78) but also a number of low agreement species (2 sources disagree from the others, n = 47). For species with low agreement, use of just one dataset to classify species, as is commonly done, would lead to high risk of misclassification. Differences in species classification between individual datasets and our composite classification were apparent. Applying different thermal classifications, lead to different conclusions when quantifying ‘warm’ and ‘cool’ species density responses to a marine heatwave.

We examined the nursing climate in 4 units and its impact on implementing a novel self-proning protocol to treat COVID-19 patients outside the intensive care unit. Local Problem: Nursing units previously designated for medical/surgical populations had to adjust quickly to provide evidence-based care for COVID-19 patients attempting self-proning. Methods: Nurses from 4 nursing units were surveyed about the implementation process on the self-proning protocol. Their perception of unit implementation was assessed via the Implementation Climate Scale. Interventions: A new self-proning nursing protocol was implemented outside the intensive care unit. Results: Consistent education on the protocol, belief in the effectiveness of the intervention, and a strong unit-based climate of evidence-based practice contributed to greater implementation of the protocol. Conclusions: Implementation of a new nursing protocol is possible with strong unit-based support, even during a pandemic. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

In addition, Global Changes are modifying the estuarine physiography, leading to a re-structuration of marginal marine benthic communities. The aim of this study is to document, the modern assemblage composition and the species-environment relations of benthic foraminifera upstream the Elbe Estuary (southern North Sea) and to observe what has changed since the first survey in 1981. For this purpose, a surface sampling was carried out from 22 stations along the transitional area of the Elbe Estuary. Living (rose-Bengal stained) and dead foraminiferal assemblages were analysed as well as hydrological and sedimentological parameters (such as salinity, pH, grain-size, and organic matter). Living faunas are characterized by very low densities and largely dominated by Ammonia species. Dead assemblages are more diverse and dominated by Ammonia aomoriensis, Haynesina germanica, and Cribroelphidium selseyense. Salinity and grain-size seem to be the major factors influencing foraminiferal distributions in the transitional area. Under the ongoing climate changes, future strategies will be taken to foster the application of benthic foraminifera as biomonitoring tool in the Elbe Estuary, via this baseline investigation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Benthic ecology; Elbe estuary; Foraminifera; North sea; River; Transitional environments","benthic foraminifera; benthos; biomonitoring; climate change; environmental stress; estuarine environment; Atlantic Ocean; Elbe Estuary; Germany; North Sea; Foraminifera; Haynesina germanica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099981914

This requires a large-scale transformation of the global energy system based on the uptake of several technological options to reduce drastically emissions, including expansion of renewable energy, energy efficiency improvements, and fuel switch towards low-carbon energy carriers. The current study explores the role of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) as a mitigation option, which provides a dispatchable source for carbon-free production of electricity and can also be used to decarbonise industrial processes. In the last decade, limited technology progress and slow deployment of CCS technologies worldwide have increased the concerns about the feasibility and potential for massive scale-up of CCS required for deep decarbonisation. The current study uses the state-of-the-art PROMETHEUS global energy demand and supply system model to examine the role and impacts of CCS deployment in a global decarbonisation context. By developing contrasted decarbonisation scenarios, the analysis illustrates that CCS deployment might bring about various economic and climate benefits for developing economies, in the form of reduced emissions, lower mitigation costs, ensuring the cost efficient integration of renewables, limiting stranded fossil fuel assets, and alleviating the negative distributional impacts of cost-optimal policies for developing economies. © 2021 by the author.

This article provides complementary insights into the use of voluntary offset contracts in temperate forests. Background and objectives: The mitigation of greenhouse emissions has become a major global issue, leading to changes in forest management to increase the capacity of forests to store carbon. This can lead to conflicts of use with other forest ecosystem services such as timber production or biodiversity conservation. Our main goal is to describe collective actions to fund carbon-oriented forestry with subsidies from carbon offsetters and to analyze how their governance and functioning prevent conflicts pertaining to multi-functionality. Materials and methods: We assembled an interdisciplinary research team comprising two ecologists, a social scientist, and an economist. Drawing on a conceptual framework of ecosystem services, social interdependencies, and collective action, we based our qualitative analysis on semi-structured interviews from two French case studies. Results: Carbon-oriented intermediary forest organizations offer offset contracts to private firms and public bodies. Communication is geared toward the mitigation outcomes of the contracts as well as their beneficial side effects in providing the ecosystem services of interest to the offsetters. Subsidies then act as a financial lever to fund carbon-oriented forestry operations. Scientific committees and reporting methodologies serve as environmental, social, and economic safeguards. Conclusions: These new intermediary forest organizations use efficient forest operations and evaluation methodologies to improve forest carbon storage. Their main innovation lies in their collective governance rooted in regional forest social-ecological systems. Their consideration of multi-functionality and socioeconomic issues can be seen as an obstacle to rapid development, but they ensure sustainability and avoid conflicts between producers and beneficiaries of forest ecosystem services. Attention must be paid to interactions with broader spatial and temporal carbon policies. © 2021 by the authors.

This research examines whether adding an emphasis on environmental benefits can increase interest in these upgrades and explores whether political ideology moderates the effectiveness of different environmental benefits frames. In Study 1, we explore how homeowners rate the importance of financial and nonfinancial decision factors of weatherization, a large energy efficiency upgrade, including the financial, informational, environmental, material, and social benefits and costs. We find that social factors and environmental benefits explain the most variance of any decision factor in reported likelihood to upgrade. In Study 2, we examine whether adding a description of environmental benefits of upgrades to their financial benefits can increase upgrade likelihood across political ideologies. We find that adding environmental benefits framed as mitigation of climate change increases liberals’ likelihood to upgrade but has no effect on conservatives; however, adding benefits framed as an increase in environmental stewardship and energy independence increases both liberals and conservatives’ likelihood to upgrade. This research demonstrates that, contrary to existing practice, adding environmental messages after characterizing financial benefits may increase investment likelihood for energy efficiency upgrades across the political spectrum. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Energy behavior; Energy efficiency; Environmental benefits; Financial benefits; Political ideology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102294470

In this study, we measured N2O fluxes over a full year in Illinois corn plots with and without rye cover crop. We compared these year-round measurements to N2O emissions predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1 equation and the Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model. In addition, we measured potential denitrification and N2O production rates. The field measurements showed typical N2O peaks shortly after fertilizer application, as well as a significant late-winter peak. Cover cropping significantly reduced all peak N2O fluxes, with decreases ranging from 39 to 95%. Neither model was able to accurately predict annual N2O fluxes or the decrease in N2O emissions from cover-cropped fields. In contrast to field measurements, lab assays found that cover cropping significantly increased potential denitrification by 90–127% and potential N2O production by 54–106%. The rye cover-cropped plots had lower soil nitrate and higher soil carbon. When limiting nitrate and excess carbon were provided in lab assays, the proportion of N2O resulting from denitrification decreased. These results suggest that the discrepancy between the observed decrease in field N2O emissions and the increase in denitrification potential may be due to the difference in available nutrients between the field and laboratory measurements. Overall, these results suggest the importance of late-winter peaks in N2O emissions and the potential of rye cover cropping to reduce N2O emissions from agricultural fields. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Corn; Denitrifying enzyme activity; DNDC model; Nitrous oxide","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Climate models; Denitrification; Greenhouse gases; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Nutrients; Soils; Agricultural fields; Available nutrients; Denitrification decompositions (DNDC); Denitrification potential; Fertilizer applications; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Laboratory measurements; Potential denitrification; Gas emissions; carbon; fertilizer; nitrate; nitrous oxide; fertilizer; nitrous oxide; cover crop; denitrification; emission control; enzyme activity; fertilizer application; nitrous oxide; oxygen; agricultural procedures; Article; cover cropping; denitrification; gene function; Illinois; laboratory test; land use; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; nutrient; prediction; priority journal; quantitative analysis; rye; soil; winter; agriculture; Secale; Illinois; United States; Agriculture; Denitrification; Fertilizers; Illinois; Nitrous Oxide; Secale; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098617360

While these efforts are premised on the belief that citizen participation will lead to more effective climate responses, there remains limited empirical evidence of the relationship between local democracy and climate risk reduction. This paper asks: How, and through which processes, do local institutions emerge as more substantively democratic arenas to coordinate responses to climate risk and change? And how does the character of local democratic practice, in turn, influence the effectiveness of adaptive responses? To answer these questions, the paper analyzes the implementation of India's Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)—a substantial devolution of development resources to rural local governments in India—and its effects on climate risk reduction in the state of Himachal Pradesh. A primary dataset of 798 small-scale development projects in 35 villages shows that a majority of water-related interventions are helping to improve water access in the face of water stress, while benefits skew towards poorer and historically marginalized social groups. Drawing on intensive qualitative enquiry, the paper argues that these outcomes were made possible as the result of long-term political transformations in the region, which have paved the way for more inclusive — if often contested — participation in local decision-making processes. The analysis underscores the need to move beyond a narrow focus on institutional building to undertake longer-term investments in supporting more robust subnational democratic systems. The growing flow of resources dedicated to climate assistance has the potential to help drive such processes where the nascent conditions for democratic deepening are in place. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Community-based adaptation; Democratic decentralization; India; MGNREGA; South Asia","adaptive management; climate change; decentralization; decision making; democracy; development project; governance approach; local government; local participation; political development; Himachal Pradesh; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099178893

Environmental and social impacts due to this practice affect population health, increasing the spread of diseases and child mortality. The safe collection of waste is the first step for reducing these impacts. This research assesses households’ waste collection in a Bolivian developing city with the aim to find a solution to fostering waste safe disposal and recycling. The novelty of the study consists in implementing field analysis together with the use of geographic information systems and the life cycle assessment approach where the lack of data is challenging. Following the results of the research, the system optimization, compared to the current scenario, implies that: (1) collection distances increase by 8%, while the selective collection increases them by 27.8%; (2) the collection coverage increase from 51% to 94% and selective collection switch from zero to 6.7%; (3) about 75% of CO2-eq emissions are reduced, as well as the eutrophication potential (about 55%); (4) recycling reduces the human toxicity potential of 260% and depletion of abiotic resources of 30%; (5) finally, the cost per ton of waste collected reduces from 36.2USD t−1 to 26.5USD t−1, and rises to 39.7USD t−1 if the selective collection is applied. The research demonstrates how waste collection optimization can be implemented obtaining enormous benefits in developing cities.

The paper closes with a conclusion, some policy implications, and several promising research directions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Emission trading system; Green total factor productivity; Quasi-natural experiment; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatial spillover effect","Emission control; Environmental regulations; Productivity; Public policy; Difference-in-differences; Emission trading systems; Natural experiment; Policy implications; Propensity score; Spatial differences; Spatial heterogeneity; Total factor productivity; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101115308

Apart from anthropogenic forcing leading to the midlatitude warming, this study investigates the possible contribution of internal variability to Asian midlatitude warming and its role in East Asian circulation changes in boreal summer, using four reanalysis datasets in the past century and a set of 1800-yr preindustrial control simulations of the Community Earth System Model version 1 large ensemble (CESM-LE). The surface and tropospheric warming in the Asian midlatitudes is associated with a strong upper-level geopotential height rise north of the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Linear trends of 200-hPa geopotential height (Z200) confirm a dipole of an anomalous high north of the TP and an anomalous low over the Iranian Plateau in 1958-2017. The leading internal circulation mode bears a striking resemblance to the Z200 trend in the past 60 and 111 years, indicating that the long-term trend may be partially of internal origin. The Asian midlatitude warming is also found in preindustrial simulations of CESM-LE, further suggesting that internal variability explains at least part of the temperature change in theAsian midlatitudes, which is in a chain of wave trains along the NH midlatitudes. The Asian warming decreases the meridional gradient of geopotential height, resulting in the weakening of westerly winds over the TP and the TP thermal forcing. Thus, it is essential to consider the role of internal variability in shaping East Asian surface temperature and East Asian summer monsoon changes in the past decades. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.","Asia; Atmospheric circulation; Climate change; Climate models; Multidecadal variability","Large dataset; Anthropogenic forcing; East Asian summer monsoon; Geo-potential heights; Internal circulations; Internal variability; Meridional gradients; Surface temperatures; Tropospheric warming; Troposphere; atmospheric circulation; climate change; climate modeling; decadal variation; midlatitude environment; trend analysis; warming; westerly; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102968081

We investigated the mechanism behind the effects of soil moisture and temperature shifts on soil CH4 fluxes under laboratory conditions. Soils from the Huai River Basin in China, an area that experiences frequent hydrological shifts, were sampled from two consecutive depths (0–20 and 20–50 cm) and incubated for 2 weeks under different combinations of soil moisture and temperature. Soils from both depths showed an increase in soil moisture and temperature-dependent cumulative CH4 fluxes. CH4 production rates incubated in different moisture and temperature in surface soil ranged from 1.27 to 2.18 ng g−1 d−1, and that of subsurface soil ranged from 1.18 to 2.34 ng g−1 d−1 . The Q10 range for soil CH4 efflux rates was 1.04–1.37. For surface soils, the relative abundance and diversity of methanotrophs decreased with moisture increase when incubated at 5◦ C, while it increased with moisture increase when incubated at 15 and 30◦ C. For subsurface soils, the relative abundance and diversity of methanotrophs in all samples decreased with moisture increase. However, there was no significant difference in the diversity of methanogens between the two soil depths, while the relative abundance of methanogens in both depths soils increased with temperature increase when incubated at 150% water-filled pore space (WFPS). Microbial community composition exhibited large variations in post incubation samples except for one treatment based on the surface soils incubated at 15◦ C, which showed a decrease in the total and unique species number of methanotrophs with moisture increase. In contrast, the unique species number of methanogens in surface soils increased with moisture increase. The analysis of distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA) showed that soil pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), NO3−-N, and NH4+-N mainly performed a significant effect on methanotrophs community composition when incubated at 60% WFPS, while they performed a significant effect on methanogens community composition when incubated at 150% WFPS. Overall, our findings emphasized the vital function of soil hydrology in triggering CH4 efflux from subtropical plantation forest soils under future climate change. © 2021 by the authors.

Using spatially resolved historical data for solar and wind generation, fossil fuel-based generation, emissions and exports, we isolate the impacts of renewable integration for multiple regions spanning the United States. Here we show regional differences for the reduction of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions, with a wider range of outcomes for regional wind power. Given the heterogeneity in transmission infrastructure, some regions have limited capacity to increase electricity exports to neighbouring regions. For both solar and wind generation, we identify the regions that retain nearly all of the emissions reductions locally and those that increase net exports, reducing emissions in neighbouring regions. Our results show lower rates of emissions mitigation than previous studies that relied on less-contemporary data or utilized simulated renewable generation. These differences may reflect the longer-term trends in power-sector emissions reductions and the importance of utilizing observed renewable generation data. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Emission control; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Wind power; Emissions mitigation; Emissions reduction; Nitrogen oxides emission; Operational constraints; Regional differences; Regional disparities; Renewable generation; Renewable integration; Electric power system interconnection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104518038

Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) from the Gram-positive bacterial antioxidant thioredoxin system has emerged from multiple screening efforts as a potential target for auranofin, ebselen, shikonin, and allicin. Auranofin serves as the most encouraging proof of concept drug, demonstrating TrxR inhibition can result in bactericidal effects and inhibit Gram-positive bacteria in both planktonic and biofilm states. Minimal inhibitory concentrations are on par or lower than gold standard medications, even among drug resistant isolates. Importantly, existing drug resistance mechanisms that challenge treatment of infections like Staphylococcus aureus do not confer resistance to TrxR targeting compounds. The observed inhibition by multiple compounds and inability to generate a bacterial genetic mutant demonstrate TrxR appears to play an essential role in Gram-positive bacteria. These findings suggest TrxR can be exploited further for drug development. Examining the interaction between TrxR and these proof of concept compounds illustrates that compounds representing a new antimicrobial class can be developed to directly interact and inhibit the validated target. © Copyright © 2021 Felix, Mylonakis and Fuchs.","allicin; antimicrobial; auranofin; drug resistance; ebselen; shikonin; thioredoxin reductase; thioredoxin system","2 phenyl 1 2 benzisoselenazol 3 2H; acetylcysteine; alkyl hydroperoxide peroxidase; allicin; alpha 2 globulin; amoxicillin; antioxidant; auranofin; carbonyl reductase; cefazolin; cefoperazone; clarithromycin; cytokine; dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase; ebselen; garlic extract; glutaredoxin; glutathione; glutathione reductase; hexachlorophene; immunoglobulin G; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; lansoprazole; linezolid; lipoxygenase; mercuric ion reductase; meticillin; mismatch repair protein; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; oxacillin; oxidoreductase; oxygen; placebo; plant extract; protein; protein disulfide reductase (glutathione); protein kinase; protein kinase C; pyridine nucleotide disulfide oxidoreductase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase; ribonucleotide reductase; selenocysteine; selenoprotein; shikonin; thiol; Thiol peroxidase; thioredoxin; thioredoxin 1; thioredoxin 2; thioredoxin reductase; transcription factor; triton x 100; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; vancomycin; antimicrobial activity; antimicrobial therapy; arthritis; Article; Bacillus subtilis; bacterial strain; blood sampling; Caenorhabditis elegans; Clostridioides difficile; Clostridium difficile infection; colorimetry; crystallography; diarrhea; disulfide bond; DNA repair; DNA synthesis; drug development; drug safety; Entamoeba histolytica; Enterococcus faecalis; Enterococcus faecium; enzyme activity; Escherichia coli; gene mutation; Giardia intestinalis; Gram positive bacterium; Helicobacter pylori; Leishmania infantum; Lithospermum erythrorhizon; macrophage; medicinal plant; mesh infection; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; mouse mutant; muscle disease; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; peritonitis; plant root; protein homeostasis; protein synthesis; proteinuria; rash; rheumatoid arthritis; rhizosphere; Schistosoma mansoni; sepsis; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus epidermidis; Streptococcus agalactiae; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Streptococcus pyogenes; ulcer; wound healing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105330661

Two primary outputs, the solar air heating, and the recapture of transmission heat loss through the walls were analysed. The wall heat loss recapture can be considered as an important factor for energy saving in buildings, which has not been studied before. RETScreen and SWift are two building simulation tools available for the design and evaluation of transpired solar collectors. Another primary aim is to investigate the detailed mathematical approach that describes the heat transfer process of the physical model for each simulation tool. Results of the models were analysed to predict the performance of TSC in delivering heated air for ventilation applications, and the ability of the partial recapture the transmission heat loss from the warm building interior. Solar radiation, heating degree days, wall thermal transmittance, and air flowrate are the key parameters that influence the heat transfer process. The findings indicate a promising result of using TSC as a dynamic insulation solution for energy savings which can reach up to 55 [kWh/(m2·year)] at high air flowrate 180 [m3/(hm2)] for some climates besides the main duty which is the solar air heating. © 2020 The Author(s).","Building simulation; Energy-saving; Solar air collector; Thermal insulation; Wall heat transfer","Energy conservation; Heat losses; Heat transfer coefficients; Solar collectors; Transmissions; Walls (structural partitions); Building simulation; Design and evaluations; Energy - saving in buildings; Heat transfer process; Heating degree-days; Mathematical approach; Thermal transmittance; Ventilation applications; Solar buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100024691

This paper reviews current global iron and steel production and assesses available decarbonization technologies, including hydrogen injection, solid biomass substitution, zero-C electricity substitution, carbon capture and storage (CCS) retrofit, and combinations of these decarbonization approaches. Blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) dominates production (71%) and is particularly stubborn to any decarbonization technology. Direct reduced iron to electric arc furnace (DRI-EAF) production is 5% and growing, it appears to have better decarbonization potential to move toward net-zero. Secondary steel production using mainly steel scrap in electric arc furnace (EAF-scrap) is 24% of global production and has both the lowest energy consumption and is technically simplest to decarbonize through electrification but is limited in market share to recycled steel capacity. Of the options assessed, blue hydrogen, carbon neutral biomass, and CCS appear to have the lowest cost and highest technical maturity. However, no single approach today can deliver deep decarbonization to the iron and steel industry and all approaches lead to substantial production cost increase. No uniform ideal solution exists, and different geographies, infrastructure, and economies will determine the local optimum solution with viability and cost.

The calamus biomass is considered a potential carbon source for denitrification, integrating plant biomass into the carbon cycle in SFCWs. This study conducted experiments on the calamus biomass decomposition and evaluated its potential application for denitrification in an SFCW system. We showed that decomposition of the biomass could release a high ratio of total organic carbon (TOC) to total nitrogen (TN), reaching 26.9, 27.7, and 23.6 at biomass doses of 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 g L−1. A continuous-flow experiment on the SFCW system revealed that higher TN removal efficiency and load were obtained after the addition of biomass, approximately three times before the biomass addition. Microbial community analysis revealed an increase in heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria (i.e., Flavobacterium, Dechloromonas, and Bacillus) content throughout the period of biomass addition. This study demonstrated an excellent enhancement of the denitrification efficiency in the SFCW caused by the addition of calamus biomass, suggesting its potential application as an excellent plant carbon source for biological denitrification. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Calamus biomass; Carbon source; Decomposition; Denitrification; Surface-flow constructed wetland","Bacteria; Bacteriology; Biomass; Efficiency; Effluents; Organic carbon; Sewage treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Water treatment; Wetlands; Biological denitrification; Continuous-flow experiments; Denitrification efficiencies; Denitrifying bacteria; Microbial community analysis; Removal efficiencies; Surface flow constructed wetlands; Wastewater treatment plants; Denitrification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099522965

Appropriate hydrate-forming conditions exist along continental shelves or are associated with permafrost. Hydrates have garnered scientific interest via their potential as a source of natural gas and their role in the global carbon cycle. While methane hydrates have been collected in multiple diverse geographic settings, their quantities and distribution in sediments remain poorly constrained due to sparse relevant data. Using statistical and machine learning approaches, we have developed a workflow to probabilistically predict methane hydrate occurrence from local microbial methane sourcing. This approach utilizes machine-learned global maps produced by the Global Predictive Seabed Model (GPSM) as inputs for the statistical sampling software, Dakota, and multiphase reservoir simulation software, PFLOTRAN. Dakota performs Latin hypercube sampling of the GPSM-predicted values and uncertainties to generate unique sets of input parameters for 1-D PFLOTRAN simulations of gas hydrate and free gas formation resulting from methanogenesis to steady state. We ran 100 1-D simulations spanning a kilometer in depth at 5,297 locations near Blake Ridge. Masses of hydrate and free gas formed at each location were determined by integrating the predicted saturation profiles. Elevated hydrate formation is predicted to occur at depths >500 meters below sea level at this location, and is strongly associated with high seafloor total organic carbon values. We produce representative maps of expected hydrate occurrence for the study area based on multiple realizations that can be validated against geophysical observations. © 2021.

We estimate the costs and mortality benefits of retrofitting heavy-duty vehicles with particulate filters and oxidation catalysts. The feasibility and cost-effectiveness of controls differ by vehicle model-year and type. We evaluate 1985 to 2014 model-year vehicles from 10 vehicle classes and five model-year groups. Our analysis shows that retrofitting all vehicles with the control that maximizes expected net benefits for that vehicle type and model-year group has the potential to reduce emissions of primary fine particles (PM2.5) by 950 metric tons/year; cut the population-weighted annual mean concentration of PM2.5 in Mexico City by 0.90 µg/m3; reduce the annual number of deaths attributable to air pollution by over 80; and generate expected annual health benefits of close to 250 million US$. These benefits outweigh expected costs of 92 million US$ per year. Diesel retrofits are but one step that should viewed in the context of other efforts––such as development of an integrated public transportation system, promotion of the rational use of cars, reduction of emissions from industrial sources and fires, and redesign of the Mexico City Metropolitan Area to reduce urban sprawl––that must be analyzed and implemented to substantially control air pollution and protect public health. Even if considering other potential public health interventions, which would offer greater benefits at the same or lower costs, only by conducting, promoting, and publishing this sort of analyses, we can make strides to improve public health cost-effectively. © 2020 The Authors.

This valuation may in turn be used in cost–benefit analyses or to inform climate policies1–3. However, current SC-CH4 estimates have not included key scientific findings and observational constraints. Here we estimate the SC-CH4 by incorporating the recent upward revision of 25 per cent to calculations of the radiative forcing of methane4, combined with calibrated reduced-form global climate models and an ensemble of integrated assessment models (IAMs). Our multi-model mean estimate for the SC-CH4 is US$933 per tonne of CH4 (5–95 per cent range, US$471–1,570 per tonne of CH4) under a high-emissions scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5), a 22 per cent decrease compared to estimates based on the climate uncertainty framework used by the US federal government5. Our ninety-fifth percentile estimate is 51 per cent lower than the corresponding figure from the US framework. Under a low-emissions scenario (RCP 2.6), our multi-model mean decreases to US$710 per tonne of CH4. Tightened equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates paired with the effect of previously neglected relationships between uncertain parameters of the climate model lower these estimates. We also show that our SC-CH4 estimates are sensitive to model combinations; for example, within one IAM, different methane cycle sub-models can induce variations of approximately 20 per cent in the estimated SC-CH4. But switching IAMs can more than double the estimated SC-CH4. Extending our results to account for societal concerns about equity produces SC-CH4 estimates that differ by more than an order of magnitude between low- and high-income regions. Our central equity-weighted estimate for the USA increases to US$8,290 per tonne of CH4 whereas our estimate for sub-Saharan Africa decreases to US$134 per tonne of CH4. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"methane; carbon emission; climate modeling; cost analysis; equity; global climate; methane; radiative forcing; uncertainty analysis; Africa south of the Sahara; Article; calculation; calibration; carbon cycle; climate change; cost benefit analysis; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; population research; probability; sensitivity analysis; temperature; United States; warming; Sub-Saharan Africa; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104711148

Using a macroeconomic–climate framework, we coupled global agricultural and industrial economies to estimate these costs at a regional level. To be consistent with end-of-century temperature increases of 1.5–3 °C, we found that every 10-percentage-point increase in agricultural emissions required a compensating 1.5-percentage-point reduction in industrial emissions—the ‘emissions opportunity cost’ of animal-based foods. Alternatively, if agricultural emissions were not offset in the industrial sector, diets high in animal protein contributed US$72 per person per year in additional climate damage—approximately half of the annual climate damage produced by the average passenger vehicle in the United States. Our analysis revealed geographic heterogeneity in climate costs by diet and food type, suggesting opportunities for mitigation policies while recognizing food insecurity risks. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105844350

From this vantage, this paper seeks to determine priority locations for afforestation areas and carbon sinks by using socio-economic and ecological variables. Factor analysis is performed on degraded forest areas (DEGFRST), the ratio of non-forest areas to provincial general area (NFL), average of total monthly rainfall (ATMR), air pollution (PM10), the amount of migration (AMGR), annual average population density (AAPD), gross domestic product by industrial activity (I_GDP), socio-economic development index (SEDI) of provinces, export (EXP) and import (IMP) amount of provinces, average number of cars per one thousand people (ACNPT), and average electricity consumption per person (AECPP) variables for all provinces in Turkey (KMO = 0.802, Bartlett’s χ2 = 832.191, and p &lt; 0.0001). Principal component analysis is used as a factor extraction method. Based on the three components obtained (explaining 74.730% of the total variance), the factor scores of 81 provinces were analyzed geostatistically using the Kriging interpolation method. The final map of potential afforestation areas was created using three-factor maps and factor variances, according to weighted overlay analysis. As a result of this study, afforestation priority areas in Turkey were identified based on three components. In subsequent studies, by increasing the number of variables used in this study, strategies for increasing Turkey’s carbon sinks can be planned. Evaluating socio-economic and ecological factors together in afforestation studies can contribute to balancing human impact and conservation through alternative approaches. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Carbon sink; Decision-making method; Geostatistical method; Principal component analysis","Carbon; Ecology; Economics; Factor analysis; Interpolation; Population statistics; Reforestation; Ecological variables; Economic activities; Electricity-consumption; Gross domestic products; Industrial activities; Kriging interpolation methods; Population densities; Socio-economic development; Economic and social effects; rain; afforestation; anthropogenic effect; atmospheric pollution; carbon sink; decision making; geostatistics; principal component analysis; socioeconomic conditions; afforestation; air pollution; Article; carbon sink; ecology; economic development; electricity; energy consumption; environmental decision making; export; factor analysis; forest; geostatistical analysis; gross national product; import; industry; migration; particulate matter 10; population density; principal component analysis; socioeconomics; Turkey (republic); air pollution; carbon sequestration; China; environmental monitoring; human; turkey (bird); Turkey; Meleagris gallopavo; Air Pollution; Carbon Sequestration; China; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Humans; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103299962

We characterize the strategic behavior in emissions mitigation and agreement participation with a potential climate catastrophe happening at a temperature threshold. Players are heterogeneous in a conceptual and two numerical models. We confirm that thresholds can induce large, stable coalitions. The relationship between the location of the threshold and the potential for cooperation is non-linear, with the highest potential for cooperation at intermediate temperature thresholds located between 2.5 and 3 degrees of global warming. We find that some regions such as Europe, the USA and China are often pivotal to keeping the threshold because the rest of the world abandons ambitious mitigation and the threshold is crossed without their participation. As a result, their incentives to cooperate can be amplified at the threshold. This behavior critically depends on the characteristics of the threshold as well as the numerical model structure. Conversely, non-pivotal regions are more likely to free-ride as the threshold inverts the strategic response of the remaining coalition. Moreover, we find that our results depend on which equilibrium concepts is applied to analyze coalition formation as well as the introduction of uncertainty about the threshold. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; International environmental agreements; Tipping points",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078623202

Any additional generated energy would be made available to the community for other needs, such as lighting and cooking, to support health and food security and improve the general quality of life. The novelty of the study stems from the utilization of in situ social data, retrieved during fieldwork interviews conducted in the kebele of interest, to ascertain the actual needs and habits of the local people. Based on these combined efforts, we were able to formulate a realistic energy demand plan for climatic conditions typical of Sub-Saharan Africa agricultural communities and analyze four different scenarios of the microgrid’s potential functionality and capital cost, given different tolerance levels of scheduled outages. We demonstrated that the RE-based microgrid would be socially and environmentally beneficial and its capital cost sensitive to the incorporation of individual or communal machines and appliances. Ultimately, the social impact investigation revealed the design would be welcomed by the local community, whose members already implement tailor-made solutions to support their agricultural activities. Finally, we argue that extended educational programs and unambiguous policies should be in place before any implementation to ensure the venture’s sustainability and functionality. © 2021 by the authors.

These landfills frequently generate pollution plumes, the contours of which can be delineated by non-intrusive geophysical measurements, but in arid environments, the high soils resistivity is usually an obstacle, which results in the low number of studies that have been carried out there. In addition, such prospecting using geophysical techniques do not provide information on the intensity of the processes occurring in the water table. This study was carried out on an uncontrolled landfill in the arid Tadla plain, Morocco’s main agricultural region. A survey based on geo-referenced spontaneous potential measurements was combined with measurements of anoxic conditions (Eh-pH and O2 equilibrating partial pressure) in the groundwater and leachates, in order to highlight a pollution plume and its geometry. The range of spontaneous potential measurement is wide, reaching 155 mV. Ponds of leachate with high electrical conductivity (20 to 40 mS cm−1 ) form within the landfill, and present very reducing conditions down to sulphate reduction and methanisation. The plume is slowly but continuously supplied with these highly reducing and organic carbon-rich leachates from the landfill. Its direction is towards N-NW, stable throughout the season, and consistent with local knowledge of groundwater flow.

However, environmental and social impacts of producing lithium-ion batteries, particularly cathode materials, and concerns over material criticality are frequently highlighted as barriers to widespread electric vehicle adoption. Circular economy strategies, like reuse and recycling, can reduce impacts and secure regional supplies. To understand the potential for circularity, we undertake a dynamic global material flow analysis of pack-level materials that includes scenario analysis for changing battery cathode chemistries and electric vehicle demand. Results are produced regionwise and through the year 2040 to estimate the potential global and regional circularity of lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, iron, aluminum, copper, and graphite, although the analysis is focused on the cathode materials. Under idealized conditions, retired batteries could supply 60% of cobalt, 53% of lithium, 57% of manganese, and 53% of nickel globally in 2040. If the current mix of cathode chemistries evolves to a market dominated by NMC 811, a low cobalt chemistry, there is potential for 85% global circularity of cobalt in 2040. If the market steers away from cathodes containing cobalt, to an LFP-dominated market, cobalt, manganese, and nickel become less relevant and reach circularity before 2040. For each market to benefit from the recovery of secondary materials, recycling and manufacturing infrastructure must be developed in each region. ©",,"Automobile materials; Automotive batteries; Battery Pack; Cathode materials; Cathodes; Cobalt; Commerce; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Manganese; Recycling; Secondary recovery; Circular economy; Manufacturing infrastructure; Material flow analysis; Reuse and recycling; Road transportation; Scenario analysis; Secondary materials; Social impact; Lithium-ion batteries; aluminum; cobalt; copper; graphite; iron; lithium; lithium ion; manganese; nickel; ion; lithium; Article; controlled study; electricity; flow measurement; geography; life cycle assessment; electrode; power supply; recycling; Cobalt; Electric Power Supplies; Electrodes; Ions; Lithium; Recycling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104919569

A global agricultural simulation model assesses changes in production, commodity prices, and trade resulting from a U.S. carbon tax. In addition, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land-use change are quantified to evaluate the possible unintended consequence of increasing emissions in the rest of the world. Three U.S. carbon tax scenarios are evaluated ranging from $15–$144 per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (t−1 CO2-e) and covering a 10-year projection period. The results show that the production cost for corn and soybeans increase by a maximum of 32.6% and 22.4%, respectively at a carbon tax of $144 t−1 CO2-e. The production cost increase is compensated in part by an increase in commodity prices. Hence, the decrease in net returns for corn, soybeans, and wheat is 11.4%, 8.7%, and 11.0%, respectively, in the scenario with the highest carbon price. U.S. exports decrease for major commodities such as corn (24.9%), sorghum (20.5%), and wheat (8.7%). Barley, soybeans, and sunflower see an increase in exports of 1.2–8.8%. These changes in trade patterns also result in a re-allocation of land-use in the rest of the world leading to a slight increase in global GHG emissions from land-use change representing 1.8% of total U.S. emissions in 2017. The increase in emissions is small compared to the overall projected reduction from the carbon tax. Policy makers need to be cognizant of leakage in terms of land-use change and that measures must be taken to avoid expansion into carbon rich native vegetation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural production; Carbon leakage; Climate change policy; Global trade; International trade","agricultural market; agricultural production; carbon emission; climate change; environmental economics; environmental policy; global trade; international trade; land use change; leakage; pollution tax; United States; Glycine max; Helianthus; Hordeum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100389817

Ratios of electron flux between the Van Allen Probes (in near-equatorial orbit in the radiation belts) and FIREBIRD II (in polar low Earth orbit) during spacecraft conjunctions (2015–2017) allow an estimate of precipitation into the atmosphere. Total Radiation Belt Electron Content, calculated from Van Allen Probes RBSP-ECT MagEIS data, identifies a sustained 10-day electron loss event in March 2013 that serves as an initial case study. Atmospheric ionization profiles, calculated by integrating monoenergetic ionization rates across the precipitating electron flux spectrum, provide input to the NCAR Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model in order to quantify enhancements of atmospheric HOx and NOx and subsequent destruction of O3 in the middle atmosphere.

A growing body of evidence shows that optimizing photosynthate distribution is important for increasing rice yields and mitigating CH4 emissions. Therefore, the molecular rice breeding with a barley HvSUSIBA2 gene that confers elevated photosynthate flux to grains, is predicted to enhance rice yield and mitigate CH4 emissions in paddies. Here, in a series of field experiments with differences in growing season and rice variety, we show that SUSIBA2 rice reduced CH4 emissions from paddies. SUSIBA2 rice grown in the early rice season and late rice season showed similar mitigation effects, with reduction rates of 50.98% for early rice and 50.97% for late rice. The reduction rate of SUSIBA2 rice during the winter rice season was significantly lower (22.26%) than those of other rice seasons. The reduction rates also varied between rice varieties, and SUSIBA2 japonica rice showed a more significant CH4 mitigation effect than SUSIBA2 indica rice. Further yield-scaled CH4 emission analyses indicated that the SUSIBA2 effect did not mitigate CH4 emissions at the expense of yield. Compared with the wild type, SUSIBA2 rice significantly reduced soil organic carbon properties and the abundance of CH4-related microbes, and altered methanogenic and methanotrophic communities, indicating that SUSIBA2 rice released less carbon to the soil, which reduced CH4 production. Furthermore, a comparison of microbial communities between SUSIBA2 japonica and indica rice revealed different responses of methanogenic and methanotrophic communities, which may partly explain their differences in growth performance and CH4 mitigation effect. Thus, our results show that SUSIBA2 rice substantially reduces CH4 emissions and that SUSIBA2 can potentially mitigate the CH4 emissions of japonica and indica rice under distinct cultivation conditions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CH4 emission; Methanogen; Methanotroph; Microbial biomass carbon; SUSIBA2 rice","Carbohydrates; Climate change; Cultivation; Methane; Microorganisms; Soils; Comprehensive analysis; Cultivation conditions; Emission analysis; Global climate changes; Growth performance; Microbial communities; Mitigation effects; Rice cultivation; Organic carbon; methane; organic carbon; carbon; methane; nitrous oxide; crop yield; methane; methanogenic bacterium; methanotrophy; photosynthesis; rice; soil carbon; soil microorganism; Article; biomass; carbon footprint; controlled study; field experiment; genetic analysis; genetic trait; Indica rice; Japonica rice; methanogen; methanotroph; microbial biomass carbon; nonhuman; performance; plant gene; plant growth; priority journal; rice; seasonal variation; soil microflora; soil property; strain difference; SUSIBA2 gene; wild type; winter; agriculture; microflora; Oryza; soil; Hordeum; Japonica; Agriculture; Carbon; Methane; Microbiota; Nitrous Oxide; Oryza; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098659258

Amidst such diversity, Brazilian coffee producers have obtained various standards of qualities and aromas, between the arabica and robusta species, which each present a wide variety of lineages. However, temperatures in coffee producing municipalities in Brazil have increased by about 0.25◦ C per decade and annual precipitation has decreased. Therefore, the agricultural sector may face serious challenges in the upcoming decades due to crop sensitivity to water shortages and thermal stress. Furthermore, higher temperatures may reduce the quality of the culture and increase pressure from pests and diseases, reducing worldwide agricultural production. The impacts of climate change directly affect the coffee microbiota. Within the climate change scenario, aflatoxins, which are more toxic than OTA, may become dominant, promoting greater food insecurity surrounding coffee production. Thus, closer attention on the part of authorities is fundamental to stimulate replacement of areas that are apt for coffee production, in line with changes in climate zoning, in order to avoid scarcity of coffee in the world market. © 2021 by the authors.

The examples from the water domain differ in terms of their primary beneficiaries and the extent to which they are prone to collective action problems.

We used shotgun metagenomics to assess changes in microbial community structures, as well as changes in microbial C- and N-cycling potential and stress response genes and we linked these data with changes in soil C and N pools and temperature-dependent measurements of bacterial growth rates. We did so by incubating high-elevation soil from the Swiss Alps at 4°C, 15°C, 25°C, or 35°C for 1 month. We found no shift with increasing temperature in the C-substrate-degrader community towards taxa more capable of degrading recalcitrant organic matter. Conversely, at 35°C, we found an increase in genes associated with the degradation and modification of microbial cell walls, together with high bacterial growth rates. Together, these findings suggest that the rapidly growing high-temperature community is fueled by necromass from heat-sensitive taxa. This interpretation was further supported by a shift in the microbial N-cycling potential towards N mineralization and assimilation under higher temperatures, along with reduced potential for conversions among inorganic N forms. Microbial stress-response genes reacted inconsistently to increasing temperature, suggesting that the high-temperature community was not severely stressed by these conditions. Rather, soil microbes were able to acclimate by changing the thermal properties of membranes and cell walls as indicated by an increase in genes involved in membrane and cell wall modifications as well as a shift in the optimum temperature for bacterial growth towards the treatment temperature. Overall, our results suggest that high temperatures, as they may occur with heat waves under global warming, promote a highly active microbial community capable of rapid mineralization of microbial necromass, which may transiently amplify warming effects. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","bacterial growth; C and N cycling; climate change; high-mountain soil; metagenomes; necromass; stress response","carbon cycle; climate change; community structure; high temperature; microbial activity; new taxon; nitrogen cycle; soil microorganism; Bacteria (microorganisms); heat; microbial genetics; microbiology; soil; temperature; Genetics, Microbial; Hot Temperature; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099285334

The enhancement of carbonate aquifers through this interplay creates hydrogeologically complex subsurface drainage networks and highly variable surface topographies. This article reports on the sediment fill and fossil pollen record from a large enclosed negative karst landform at Coolough, near Galway City in the west of Ireland. The landform was discovered during the preliminary site investigation for the proposed N6 Galway City Ring Road. Major joint sets developed in the Carboniferous (Mississippian) Limestone bedrock govern the local hydrogeology and structural evidence suggests that a local fault has controlled the east–west propagation of the deep enclosed depression. Fluvial and lacustrine palaeoenvironments are interpreted from the sediments infilling the enclosed depression, within which three discrete diamicts are identified, potentially representing distinct phases of glaciation. Pollen assemblages, which reflect palaeoenvironments of open woods and grasslands, have been correlated with other deposits in Ireland and Europe and suggest a minimum date of the Early Pleistocene for the oldest of the diamicts, and thus an upper age limit on the development of the karst depression. Fluvial disturbance to the deposit is evident and is likely to be responsible for the chronological discrepancy between the Early Pleistocene and Middle Pleistocene sediments both recorded from the deposit infill. The findings of this multidisciplinary study contribute to an understanding of Quaternary landscape evolution in western Ireland. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","carbonate geology; Carboniferous; deposit; Galway; Ireland; karst; palynology; Pleistocene; pollen; sedimentology","aquifer; bedrock; carbonate system; Carboniferous; fluvial deposit; karst; lacustrine deposit; landscape evolution; paleoenvironment; palynology; Pleistocene; sedimentology; Connacht; Galway [(CNT) Connacht]; Ireland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096802304

In this study, we used a coupled climate model (MPI-ESM) with a very idealized setup to investigate the efficacy and risks of CE at a local scale in space and time (regional radiation management, RRM) assuming that cloud modification is technically possible. RM is implemented in the climate model by the brightening of low-level clouds (solar radiation management, SRM) and thinning of cirrus (terrestrial radiation management, TRM). The region chosen is North America, and we simulated a period of 30 years. The implemented sustained RM resulted in a net local radiative forcing of −9.8 Wm−2 and a local cooling of −0.8 K. Surface temperature (SAT) extremes (90th and 10th percentiles) show negative anomalies in the target region. However, substantial climate impacts were also simulated outside the target area, with warming in the Arctic and pronounced precipitation change in the eastern Pacific. As a variant of RRM, a targeted intervention to suppress heat waves (HW) was investigated in further simulations by implementing intermittent cloud modification locally, prior to the simulated HW situations. In most cases, the intermittent RRM results in a successful reduction of temperatures locally, with substantially smaller impacts outside the target area compared to the sustained RRM. © 2021 by the authors.

That is particularly true for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), which together with the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) exert changes in the local OH− and H2O activity that in turn can possibly affect activity, stability, and selectivity of the CO2RR. We determine the local OH− and H2O activity in close proximity to a CO2-converting Ag-based gas diffusion electrode (GDE) with product analysis using gas chromatography. A Pt nanosensor is positioned in the vicinity of the working GDE using shear-force-based scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) approach curves, which allows monitoring changes invoked by reactions proceeding within an otherwise inaccessible porous GDE by potentiodynamic measurements at the Pt-tip nanosensor. We show that high turnover HER/CO2RR at a GDE lead to modulations of the alkalinity of the local electrolyte, that resemble a 16 m KOH solution, variations that are in turn linked to the reaction selectivity. © 2021 The Authors.

Ambitious tree-planting initiatives, many already underway, aim to sequester enormous quantities of carbon to partly compensate for anthropogenic CO2 emissions, which are a major cause of rising global temperatures. However, tree planting that is poorly planned and executed could actually increase CO2 emissions and have long-term, deleterious impacts on biodiversity, landscapes and livelihoods. Here, we highlight the main environmental risks of large-scale tree planting and propose 10 golden rules, based on some of the most recent ecological research, to implement forest ecosystem restoration that maximizes rates of both carbon sequestration and biodiversity recovery while improving livelihoods. These are as follows: (1) Protect existing forest first; (2) Work together (involving all stakeholders); (3) Aim to maximize biodiversity recovery to meet multiple goals; (4) Select appropriate areas for restoration; (5) Use natural regeneration wherever possible; (6) Select species to maximize biodiversity; (7) Use resilient plant material (with appropriate genetic variability and provenance); (8) Plan ahead for infrastructure, capacity and seed supply; (9) Learn by doing (using an adaptive management approach); and (10) Make it pay (ensuring the economic sustainability of the project). We focus on the design of long-term strategies to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises and support livelihood needs. We emphasize the role of local communities as sources of indigenous knowledge, and the benefits they could derive from successful reforestation that restores ecosystem functioning and delivers a diverse range of forest products and services. While there is no simple and universal recipe for forest restoration, it is crucial to build upon the currently growing public and private interest in this topic, to ensure interventions provide effective, long-term carbon sinks and maximize benefits for biodiversity and people. © 2021 Royal Botanic Garden, Kew.

The actual tax rate can be controlled by local governments through factors such as the intensity of tax implementation and supervision. We argue that the distorted implementation of an environmental regulation policy caused by tax competition is an important factor affecting the effectiveness of environmental regulation, which is the main cause of uncertainty in the relationship between environmental regulation and low-carbon technology innovation through changing the strategies of local governments and enterprises under the restriction of environmental regulation. Considering the impact of tax competition, this study builds a differential game model that consists of a local government and an enterprise to investigate the equilibrium solutions under different decision-making modes and analyse the roles of income tax and a low-carbon technology innovation reward. The following key insights are obtained. (i) In addition to the direct effects of tax competition on green technology innovation through influencing the enterprise's low-carbon technology innovation effort, it has indirect effects on green technology innovation by influencing the local government's environmental governance effort under the constraint of environmental regulation. Through the effective control of income taxes and low-carbon technology innovation rewards, tax competition can help improve the strategies of local governments and enterprises. (ii) The decision-making mode with cost sharing is a kind of Pareto improvement for the regional low-carbon technology stock if the cost sharing coefficient is effectively controlled. (iii) The enterprise can be motivated by the cost sharing contract to increase its low-carbon technology innovation effort, which is conducive to improving its optimal profit. (iv) The local government cannot be motivated by the cost sharing contract, and its optimal profit can be improved only if the cost sharing coefficient is below the threshold. © 2021","Differential game; Environmental regulation; Low-carbon technology innovation; Tax competition","Carbon; Competition; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Environmental regulations; Environmental technology; Game theory; Profitability; Taxation; Cost sharing contracts; Differential game models; Differential games; Environmental governances; Equilibrium solutions; Improvement strategies; Low-carbon technologies; Pareto improvements; Engineering research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100174813

Although ships provide the convenient transportation, they exhaust a large number of hazardous pollutants, especially nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur oxides (SOx), which have a significant side effect on environment and human health. To alleviate the impact of global shipping on the environment, international maritime organization established the more stringent emission regulations from Tier I to Tier III in order to reduce emissions from ships. As a result, various emission reduction technologies need to be developed in order to meet more stringent regulations in the future and reduce the pollutant emissions. Under this background, it is indispensable to examine the existing emission reduction technologies when exploring another possible method to reduce the pollutant emissions. Based on a significant number of related literatures, it is general to utilize the marine alternative fuels to reduce the pollutant emissions. Especially, liquid natural gas (LNG) is considered to be one of the most promising marine alternative fuels due to its economy and environmentally friendly features. This review thus aims to summarize the different emission reduction technologies of marine diesel engines through three reduction paths of fuel optimization, pre-combustion control and exhaust after-treatment. Furthermore, the utilization of LNG in the marine diesel engines are evaluated comprehensively from three aspects of environmental protection, energy structure and economic benefits.

Although some ski areas are still profitable under current climate and socioeconomic conditions, they will become difficult to operate in the face of rising winter temperatures, which will result in further economic losses, resource waste and environmental damage. This study projects variability in the suitability of ski area development across China in the coming decades. Natural suitability under three representative concentration pathway emission scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), socioeconomic suitability under four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP1, SSP2, SSP3, and SSP5) and integrated suitability under four climatic-socioeconomic scenarios (RCP2.6-SSP1, RCP4.5-SSP2, RCP8.5-SSP3, and RCP8.5-SSP5) are reported. Furthermore, the suitability of 731 existing ski areas in China is assessed. The results show a substantial decline in integrated suitability for most regions of China except for some very cold areas, where higher air temperatures will make visitors feel more comfortable and the relatively poor socioeconomic conditions will improve in the 2030s, 2050s and 2090s. The average higher integrated suitability area (integrated suitability values greater than 0.5) under four climatic-socioeconomic scenarios decreases from the current 29.9%–14.4%, 5.0% and 4.5% by the 2030s, 2050s and 2090s, respectively. Under RCP2.6-SSP1, the higher integrated suitability area is projected to decrease from the current 28.0%–5.2% by the 2050s and then increase to 5.3% by the 2090s. Under RCP4.5-SSP2, RCP8.5-SSP3, and RCP8.5-SSP5, the higher integrated suitability area is projected to continuously decrease from 30.3%, 30.6% and 30.6% in the 2010s to 4.1%, 4.4% and 4.4% in the 2090s, respectively. By the 2090s, 41, 138 and 277 existing ski areas are projected to be closed under RCP2.6-SSP1, RCP4.5-SSP2, and RCP8.5-SSP3/RCP8.5-SSP5, respectively. It is clear that emission pathways and climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies will greatly shape the development of China's regional ski tourism. © 2021 The Authors","China; Climate change; Ski tourism; Socioeconomic development; Suitability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104452968

Thus, this study examines farmers’ perception of climatic change, related risks, and adaptation practices that farmers have adopted to address the adverse pressures on livelihoods and resources in different agro-ecological communities of Gurage zone, Southern Ethiopia. A research approach involving both quantitative and qualitative methods was used. 357 household surveys were conducted with representative households. Statistical differences in selecting adaptation strategies between the agro-ecological communities were measured by employing a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A Post-Hoc analysis was also performed to identify the location of the variance. The study revealed, the majority of the respondents interviewed in different agro-ecological communities had perceived declining precipitation and increased temperature. Similarly, respondents reported that the frequency of extreme events like drought, flood, frost, and storm had increased. A significant difference was found between agro-ecological communities in farm management practices. A Tukey post hoc test revealed that farm management practices were mostly practiced by the lowland and highland (p < 0.005) agro-ecological communities. Therefore, since climate stress coupled with socio-economic and institutional stress has serious implications for farmer's livelihood sources, a holistic climate change adaptation strategy considering agro-ecological variation is required to sustain farm household livelihood. © 2021 The Author(s)","Adaptation; Agro-ecologies; Ethiopia; Gurage; Perception","adaptive management; agricultural management; agroecology; climate change; climate variation; management practice; perception; risk assessment; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107128655

In this context, sustainable agronomic management is a requisite to increase the soil carbon content, making the artichoke cultivation system more resilient to climate change. A 10-year experiment was considered to forecast the influence on soil C dynamic of three globe artichoke managements: monoculture with dry crop residues incorporation (conventional monoculture), monoculture with the inclusion of a cover crop (alternative monoculture), and rotation with cauliflower plus cover crop (biannual rotation). During the 2006–2016 period, total soil organic carbon content and plant C inputs to soil were measured. RothC model was used to predict the effect on the soil C stock and C sequestration potential in 20 years of the three managements tested in the field, plus a hypothetical conventional scenario with no residues’ incorporation (no residues). Plant C inputs increased according to the number of crops in rotation in each system, resulting 25% lower in conventional monoculture with respect to biannual rotation, whereas the C stock change was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.01) in conventional and alternative monoculture (+ 7.57 and 7.14 t C ha-1) compared to biannual rotation (-1.03 t C ha-1). In the 20-year predictions, all the systems had a positive C balance. The soil organic carbon change (t C ha-1) for the future climate was + 7.2 for alternative monoculture and + 0.6 for monoculture with residues removals. For the first time, in this study, we clearly shown in the long term and in a climate change perspective that an improper crop residues management might lead to a loss of soil fertility in intensively cultivated horticultural soils under Mediterranean climate. The adoption of biannual rotation with cauliflower needs to be evaluated carefully because it proved to be less efficient in terms of C sequestration potential. © 2021, INRAE and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Crop modeling; Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus; Soil carbon content; Sustainable horticulture","carbon sequestration; cover crop; crop residue; cropping practice; horticulture; Mediterranean environment; monoculture; organic carbon; soil fertility; soil organic matter; Brassica oleracea var. botrytis; Cynara scolymus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102189664

People widely believed that the air quality in Bangkok would improve during the lockdown. This study aims to understand the effects of the traffic on Bangkok PM2.5 and gas concentrations, by comparing the air quality before and during the lockdown. Some pollutant concentrations in pre-lockdown period were higher, but the differences were not significant, except for O3. When results in the full lockdown month, April 2020, were compared to the same period in 2019, the average PM2.5 concentrations at the road sites decreased by 11.1%. On the other hand, it increased by 16.7% at the business area sites. No clear relation of the PM2.5 change to the reduction of traffic and diesel fuel consumption was observed. The reduction of NO2 was clear, caused by the significant drop in traffic and fuel consumption: in turn, it contributed to an increase of O3. The increment of PM2.5 levels during the lockdown was an external effect, even though significant change of local sources occurred. The values of OC/EC ratios in fine particles and the backward trajectory simulation confirmed that the peaks of PM2.5 levels were affected by both transboundary and local aerosol transport from open biomass burning. Hence, it is clear that road traffic, as well as industries or other human activities, were not the most influential factors on high PM2.5 levels in Bangkok in normal conditions. Possible solutions to reduce sources of Bangkok air pollutants include introduction of small-scale machinery for sugarcane harvesting to reduce biomass burning, adoption of higher standards to control diesel engine emission, and mutual agreement and action among ASEAN members in transboundary haze reduction. © 2021, AAGR Aerosol and Air Quality Research.

Reactors consist of annular packed-beds (subsections) and annular cooling-chambers. This configuration creates radial flows for reacting and synthesis gases and results in a negligible pressure drop along the beds. Each subsection is in contact with two cooling-chambers from top and bottom that offers an excellent heat transfer area and contributes to a noteworthy reduction in reaction phase temperature. Besides, hydrogen permeation through Pd-Ag membrane layer in upper and lower walls of RF-GCMR cooling-chambers shifts the reaction toward more products. Simultaneous effects of pressure, temperature, and H2 permeation increases CO2 removal and methanol production rates by 592% and 6.84%, respectively in RF-GCMR compared to Conventional Gas-Cooled Reactor (CGCR). Afterward, a two-objective optimization of RF-GCMR is implemented using Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) to maximize methanol production rate and selectivity. Final Pareto-optimal solution is found by TOPSIS, LINMAP, and Shannon's Entropy decision-making methods.

The largest share of the power consumption is required by the hydraulic system during idling operations, and, consequently, the current literature focuses on energy saving strategies for the hydraulic system rather than making the vehicle traction more efficient. This study presents the preliminary realization of an electric-powered hydraulic pump system (e-HPS) that drives the lifting of the dumpster and the garbage compaction in a waste compactor truck, rather than traditional ICE-driven hydraulic pump systems (ICE-HPSs). The different components of the e-HPS are described and the battery pack was modelled using the kinetic battery model. The end-of-life of the battery pack was determined to assess the economic feasibility of the proposed e-HPS for the truck lifespan, using numerical simulations. The aim was twofold: To provide an implementation method to retrofit the e-HPS to a conventional waste compactor truck and to assess its economic feasibility, investigating fuel savings during the use phase and the consequent reduction of CO2 emissions. Results show that the total lifespan cost saving achieved a value of 65,000. Furthermore, total CO2 emissions for the e-HPS were about 80% lower than those of the ICE-HPS, highlighting that the e-HPS can provide significant environmental benefits in an urban context. © 2021 by the authors.","Electric-powered hydraulic pump system; Energy savings; Green logistics; Kinetic battery model; Waste compactor truck",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103674342

Thus, our aim was to calibrate agrometeorological models for soybean yield forecast and identify the weather variables that most influence soybean yield. This study used historical series of climate and soybean yield data from soybean-producing locations in the Mato Grosso do Sul state, Brazil. The historical climate series was 20 years (2000–2019). The soybean production, yield, and planted area data of the localities were in the period from 2009–2018. Multiple linear regression analysis was the statistical tool used for data modeling. The models from the north and central regions forecast of anticipation of 2 months since the final data necessary to apply the model were EXCJANc and PJANc, respectively. The models calibrated for the southern region reported anticipation of one month since the final data necessary to apply the model was EXCFEVc. The calibrated models used to forecast soybean yield as a function of climatic conditions have a high degree of significance (p &lt; 0.05), high accuracy and errors lower. The models for the northern and central regions show a prevision of anticipation of 2 months before soybean harvest, a period that is essential for producers to be able to conduct pre- and post-harvest planning.

This observation has motivated researchers to understand the causes of the elevated temperatures and to develop predictive models of landfill temperature. The objective of this research was to characterize the methanogenic activity of microbial communities that were derived from landfill samples excavated from a section of a landfill exhibiting gas well temperatures above 55 °C. Specific objectives were to: (1) determine the upper temperature limit for methane production; (2) evaluate the kinetics of methane generation when landfill-derived microcosms are incubated above and below their excavation temperature and derive a temperature inhibition function; and (3) evaluate microbial community shifts in response to temperature perturbations. Landfill microcosms were derived from 57 excavated landfill samples and incubated within ±2.5 °C of their excavation temperature between 42.5 °C and 87.5 °C. Results showed an optimum temperature for methane generation of ~57 °C and a 95% reduction in methane yield at ~72 °C. When select cultures were perturbed between 5 °C below and 15 °C above their in-situ temperature, both the rate and maximum methane production decreased as incubation temperature increased. Microbial community characterization using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing suggests that thermophilic methanogenic activity can be attributed to methanogens of the genus Methanothermobacter.

One solution is a paradigm shift of the transportation policies from personal vehicles to public transportation system using electric buses. Using electric bus fleets for public transportation is not straightforward in Indian cities for two reasons, viz., weak electricity grid and predominantly coal-based power generation. In this work, a novel transportation system, that uses solar PV generation and large capacity batteries, is analyzed for its impact on air pollution and environmental sustainability. A detailed well to wheel analysis of the system, for various power generation scenarios, is presented and also compared with the existing ones. The analysis done in this work answers the question: “Can the electric bus-based public transportation contribute towards emission reduction in transportation?” The results also elaborate that to reach the target under the Paris Protocol, India has to take drastic majors like phasing out of coal by 2030.

In this paper, we present a progress in the development of scalable electron beam irradiation platform to obtain innovative materials for technological and industrial applications, since one of the problems to be solved in this research area is the scalability of these new nanomaterials induced by electron beam irradiation (EBI). In particular, we focus on carbon structures due to its excellent and exciting properties applied in the technological area in the last years, where we show for the first time a new strategy for carbon allotropic transformation through the portable EBI. This new platform is particularly effective, fast, versatile, clean and easy-to-use, facilitating the preparation of many types of nanomaterials that cannot be obtained by conventional chemical and physical methods. The EBI on flat graphite pellets resulted in a covering of it surface with rod-like particles composed of different allotropic forms of carbon. Furthermore, the developed system allowed the implantation of the Fe as a catalytic material through steel sputtering of the high voltage acceleration anode during the EBI process. It was observed by HRTEM analyses that the rod-like particles are preferentially composed of highly oriented graphite in its bottom, polycrystalline graphite in its middle and magnetite nanoparticles in its top. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Allotropic carbon; Electron beam; Solid-state materials","Electron beams; Graphite; Industrial research; Irradiation; Magnetite; Magnetite nanoparticles; Nanostructured materials; Allotropic transformations; Catalytic materials; Electron beam irradiation; Highly oriented graphite; Innovative materials; Materials chemistry; Rod-like particles; Solid-state materials; Electrons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099396442

Populations spreading across a broad latitudinal gradient offer opportunities to investigate if essential traits vary with heterogenous environmental conditions, such as in savanna ecosystems. This information can help us predict plant responses to climate change. Here, we evaluated if epicormic bud protection traits varied among populations of three focal savanna species (Miconia albicans, Solanum lycocarpum, and Zeyheria montana) that have a wide distribution and grow under variable climatic conditions. We randomly sampled 225 individuals over five spatially independent sites (7°, 10°, 15°, 18°, and 24° S) in Brazil, totaling 15 individuals per species per area. We analyzed anatomical transverse sections of five buds per species per area to assess the relative area occupied by crystal and phenolic idioblasts, the thickness of the trichome boundary layer, and to test if these traits were associated with climatic conditions. The buds were protected by cataphylls and composed of a variable number of undeveloped leaves enveloping the shoot apex. For M. albicans, we found an association between maximum temperature and both phenolic idioblasts and trichome boundary layer, but no association with crystal idioblasts. In S. lycocarpum, only the trichome boundary layer was associated with maximum temperature plus high radiation. Z. montana showed no variation. Combination of two or more traits can lead to the development of adaptative strategies to different climatic conditions. We present for the first time an analysis of epicormic bud traits in plant populations occurring in an extensive latitudinal gradient and shed light on how maximum temperature is associated with these traits, contributing to a better understanding of plant resprouting capabilities in widespread savanna plant species. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bud traits; Climate; Crystal idioblasts; Latitudinal gradient; Phenolic idioblasts; Savanna plant species; Trichome boundary layer","bud; latitudinal gradient; Neotropical Region; savanna; shoot growth; trichome; woody plant; Brazil; Miconia albicans; Solanum lycocarpum; anatomy and histology; angiosperm; Brazil; grassland; Melastomataceae; physiology; Solanum; temperature; tropic climate; Brazil; Grassland; Magnoliopsida; Melastomataceae; Solanum; Temperature; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103231481

This approach has been applied to South American tropical moist forests, but not to the highly threatened seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF), despite the acknowledgement of their unique evolutionary history. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the legacy of evolutionary processes on vital ecological characteristics among SDTF trees: regional dominance, tree size and soil preference. We used tree community data on 313 plots of SDTF (12.52 ha) and locally collected soil data in central-eastern Brazil. For each assessed trait (three for regional dominance, three for tree size and nine for soil preference), we investigated the legacy of evolution using two different approaches: calculating the extent of phylogenetic signal and comparing the fit of four different models of evolution. Above-ground woody biomass and tree size showed strong phylogenetic signal. Most of the SDTF biomass stock was concentrated on a few large-sized and closely related tree genera. Among the soil preference variables, only phosphorus displayed significant, albeit weak, phylogenetic signal. Synthesis. Our study is the first to show that evolutionary constraints related to tree size significantly determine regional biomass stocks of seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF) in a few closely related tree lineages. This suggests that even isolated SDTF fragments with low taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity can play an important role in the global carbon cycle, storing disproportionally large amounts of carbon in trees that belong to high-biomass lineages. Whether these lineages also share climate change-induced mortality risk deserves future investigation, as they are largely responsible for the maintenance of regional SDTF biomass stocks. © 2021 British Ecological Society","biomass stock; Caatinga; ecological dominance; evolutionary model; niche preference; phylogenetic signal; species abundance","aboveground biomass; carbon cycle; climate change; dominance; dry forest; ecosystem function; mortality; phylogenetics; plant community; tropical forest; woody plant; Brazil; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099842294

The Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) could play an important role in this transformation of today's energy systems. The ORC is able to convert low-temperature heat sources into electrical power by utilizing refrigerants as working fluids. Many of these refrigerants have a significant global warming potential (GWP) and recent legislations therefore increasingly limit their use. In recent years a new generation of refrigerants has been developed. These refrigerants are characterized by low global warming potentials and are considered as replacements for the old high-GWP refrigerants. In this paper R1224yd(Z), R1233zd(E) and R1336mzz(Z) are investigated as possible replacements for the state of the art high-GWP refrigerant R245fa. These novel fluids have quite similar thermophysical properties and can thus potentially be used as drop-in replacements for R245fa. For the application as drop-in replacement and the correct interpretation of measurement data, the interaction of the refrigerant with the used lubricant is important. Therefore, the interaction of all four refrigerants with a typical lubricant oil is experimentally investigated first. A novel model based on Raoult's law is introduced and validated with experimental data. The model allows the computation of the liquid and vapor phase composition of refrigerant/oil-mixtures using pressure and temperature measurements. In the next step, the performance of the four investigated refrigerants is evaluated experimentally in an ORC test rig. Therefore, the same experimental program was repeated for every refrigerant in order to ensure a fair comparison. To conclude the evaluation of the refrigerants, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is conducted for a theoretical geothermal power plant operated with the four considered refrigerants. The experimental results show, that R1224yd(Z) as well as R1233zd(E) are very suitable low-GWP alternatives for R245fa and could be used as drop-in replacements. R1336mzz(Z) on the other hand shows significantly lower system efficiencies and power outputs compared to the other refrigerants. The highest power output and system efficiency is however still achieved by the state of the art refrigerant R245fa, but these quantities are only slightly lower for R1233zd(E) and R1224yd(Z). The LCA based on the experimental results for a hypothetical large-scale geothermal ORC application reveals, that despite the slight performance decrease, the application of low-GWP fluids decreases the CO2-equivalent of the system significantly. The usage of R1233zd(E) could decrease the CO2-equivalent by 67% compared to R245fa. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Experimental; Fourth generation refrigerants; LCA; Low-GWP working fluid; Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC); Refrigerant-oil interaction","Artificial life; Carbon dioxide; Drops; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Geothermal energy; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Lubricants; Rankine cycle; Refrigerants; Temperature; Temperature measurement; Experimental program; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Liquid- and vapor phase; Low temperature heat sources; Organic Rankine Cycle(ORC); Pressure and temperature; System efficiency; Geothermal power plants; computational fluid dynamics; cooling; electrical power; electronic equipment; environmental impact assessment; geothermal power; global warming; greenhouse gas; lubricant; power plant; thermodynamics; transformation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101535365

This parameter is still not regulated for these plants and little is known about the emissions that these plants have put into the atmosphere with the technologies available today. In this study, emission data from 47 Italian production plants were collected and analyzed to assess which values could describe the current situation in Italy. The results of the analysis showed that emissions are very variable, with odor concentration values between 200 to 37,000 ouE/m3, but data have a normal distribution. The mean value of the stack odor concentration was found to be 2424 ouE/m3. It was also possible to calculate emission factors of the plants, such as odor emission rate (OER), which represents the quantity of odor emitted per unit of time, and is expressed in odor units per second (ouE·s−1) and odor emission factor (OEF) per ton of product, expressed in ouE/t. The values obtained were 7.1 × 104 ouE/s and 1.4 × 106 ouE/t. respectively. These data could provide a starting point for the definition of shared values among various stakeholders for the definition of regional guidelines for the emissions of these plants, in order to adjust available technologies towards emission parameters that are protective of the surrounding environment. © 2021 by the authors.

Daily ambient particulate matter ≤10 μm in diameter (PM10), particulate matter ≤2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5), NO, NO2, and O3 concentrations in Delhi and Kolkata from 1 March to 3 May in both 2019 and 2020 were collected from different monitoring stations along with meteorological data to study the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on ambient pollutant concentrations. In 2020, average ambient concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 were significantly decreased (Delhi: 59 and 43%, respectively; Kolkata: 49 and 50%, respectively) during the lockdown period compared with the same period during 2019 in both cities. Average ambient O3 concentration in Delhi was significantly lower in 2020 (38.5 μg m–3) compared with 2019 (44.7 μg m–3) during the study period. However, average ambient O3 concentration was significantly higher during 2020 (46.9 μg m–3) compared with 2019 (31.4 μg m–3) in Kolkata. Effect size analysis of different predictive variables reveals that the lockdown period explains maximum variation in ambient concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 during 2020 in both cities. However, maximum variation in ambient O3 concentrations in both cities was explained primarily by spatial variation rather than by the lockdown period.

Over recent decades, mango (Mangifera indica L.) parklands have expanded in Burkina Faso, due to the species’ fast growth and its compatibility with local agricultural crops. However, the contribution of mango parklands to reducing atmospheric CO2 remains unknown, due to the lack of local tools for aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation. The aim of this study was to develop accurate allometric equations for estimating the AGB and carbon (C) stocks of mango parklands. A field survey was carried out to select mango parklands according to their age. These parklands were then classified into six groups age (0≦y&lt;5, 5≦y&lt;10, 10≦y&lt;15, 15≦y&lt;20, 20≦y&lt;25, y≧25) and dendrometric measurements were taken within 72 plots of 2500m² each. Inventoried mango trees were grouped into 5 diameter at breast eight (DBH) classes and the number of trees sampled per DBH class was a function of the class homogeneity. Twenty-five (25) mango trees were destructively sampled to estimate tree AGB. The belowground biomass was calculated based on existing mango root-to-shoot ratio data. The C content in tree aboveground components was evaluated using the ash method. Power and linear models were tested and fitted to the total AGB. The validated equations showed a good fit and performance with high explained variance (R² = 95%). The power model was the best model with DBH alone being the best predictor. The obtained means (±Standard deviation) AGB, belowground and total biomass were 326.64±279.1; 84.93±72.58 and 411.56±351.75 kg tree−1 respectively. The C content of the leaves, branches and trunk were 53.79, 54.78 and 55.79% respectively, whereas the mean C stock for aboveground, belowground and total C were 179.90; 42.46 and 222.36 kg tree−1 respectively. For a density of 152.30 ± 36.83ind ha−1, the mean aboveground and belowground biomass was 62.67 t ha−1, giving a total C stock of 33.85 t C ha−1for the studied mango parklands. © 2021","Aboveground biomass; Agroforestry parklands; Allometric equation; Carbon faming; Mangifera indica L.; West Africa",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112530815

Here, we show strong responses of the terrestrial carbon cycle to CP ENSO, exceeding even those to canonical eastern Pacific (EP) ENSO. Annual GPP of both global tropical forests and semiarid ecosystems were reduced by ∼0.3–0.5 Pg C yr−1 K−1 increase in CP sea surface temperatures (SSTs), which also reduced net ecosystem production of key tropical and semiarid regions like the Amazon and Australia, but with smaller (and generally not significant) responses to EP SSTs. Given these large negative responses of ecosystem production to CP SSTs, our results suggest that a recent shift toward CP-dominated ENSO events could further alter Earth's terrestrial carbon cycle, especially when coupled with possible increases in ENSO amplitude with continued warming. © 2021.

This study aimed to estimate above-ground biomass and carbon stocks from five villages; Tlogopakis, Tlogohendro, Kayupuring, Yosorejo and Kasimpar. Non-destructive samples of 30 plots were conducted by designing plots with 0.04 ha and stand inventory involving diameter at breast height, height and number of trees. The result showed that the total estimated biomass from five villages was 3,006.10 Mg ha-1 and carbon stocks were 1,442.93 Mg C ha-1. The averages of biomass and carbon stocks were 601.22 Mg Ha-1 and 288.59 Mg C ha-1. This indicates that 2,943 ha area of Petungkriyono mixed forest has carbon stocks capacity up to 1,769,390.46 Mg C. The highest above-ground biomass contribution 59% tree compared with 41% poles. The significantly higher above-ground biomass describes higher carbon stocks long term storage of CO2 to either mitigate or defer global warming. Climate change mitigation from carbon stocks can be obtained from CO2 equivalents if well managed.

In the literature, the impact of flexibility has been mainly studied for the optimization of the control logic, assuming that the photovoltaic system and the electric storage have already been installed. Conversely, in this work, we adopt a different perspective that analyses the system from the designer point of view. Different scenarios with a variable degree of flexibility have been created and tested in a residential district considering various demand profiles (i.e., home appliances, heat pumps, and electric vehicles consumption). The profiles have been then used as input for an optimization tool that can design the optimal system according to a specific target function. Firstly, the system has been optimized according to economic indicators. However, results suggested that adopting only an economic perspective in the design phase could lead to results that are not in line with the European environmental targets. Thus, the system has been optimized also considering energy indicators to design a system that could give a relevant contribution to the energy transition of the residential sector. Results suggest that demand flexibility coupled with storage can boost the installation of photovoltaic systems due to the improved economic profitability and at the same time guarantee a relevant contribution to the decarbonization of the sector. © 2021 by the authors.

The government mandates are based on the prediction of catastrophic global temperatures unless CO2 emissions from vehicles are reduced to zero. This prediction is based on theoretical climate computer models, which have been shown to use invalid data and thus model results are invalid [1]. Compelling evidence from valid temperature data over the millennia confirms that global warming comes from natural variations in sun irradiance. Mankind has experienced warming, as well as cooling, over the centuries and survived. Automotive engineers use valid data to design and build autos to improve the product and meet the needs of a demanding customer base. Valid climate data should inform the automotive engineers of the truth about global warming and claimed climate effects. Ice was observed to increase in the Polar Regions, starting around 1960 and global temperatures fell, so that by the late 1970s scientists discussed a possible ice age. Scientists were concerned about a ""human volcano of aerosols""from industry. This included global cooling by automotive exhaust soot, from leaded gasoline. This cooling issue vanished when GM invented the catalytic converter using unleaded gas, which produced no soot. When warming resumed in the 1980s, greenhouse gases were revived as the cause of the warming. The advances of computer modeling opened up new ways to investigate global warming, employing many analysts and their theoretical models predicted catastrophic warming. In addition the modelers made twelve major catastrophic weather claims [2], including hurricanes, sea level, polar ice, etc. This paper provides the analysis and valid data to show these twelve modeler claims are not valid. Today's satellite temperature data with global coverage should be used as the standard to understand global climate trends. Accurate data is superior to flawed theoretical climate computer models manipulated to provide a catastrophic view of climate. It appears modelers were incentivized to help support the demise of the fossil fuel industry, which has provided affordable products for mankind, millions of jobs and multi trillion dollars of economic wealth worldwide. The auto industry should be allowed to design and build vehicles to meet the needs of the customer rather than having to meet government mandates based on false temperature data and invalid models. © 2021 SAE International.

To save energy in cooling of automobiles and buildings, transparent passive-cooling films with 90-nm-diameter zinc oxide (ZnO) particles dispersed in low density polyethylene were manufactured. These films filter out the high-energy region of visible light (Vis), block ultraviolet (UV) light, and allow infrared light to pass through by utilizing light scattering due to nanoparticles (NPs) and refraction from lamellar crystals in the film. Transmissivities of the films decrease as NP concentration, film thickness, and crystallinity increase. Passive-cooling performance tests show that the films have a temperature reduction (ΔT) of up to 14.95 °C around midday, which is substantially better than that reported for similar films. The volume involved in the passive-cooling test is found to be critically important. ΔT initially declines exponentially and then levels-off as the enclosed volume to window area ratio, or specific volume (SV), increases. An empirical model is proposed for the relationship between ΔT and SV for more appropriate measurements of passive-cooling performance.

However, to date, our understanding of how artificial gradients of N fertilization indirectly affect phosphorus (P) availability by altering the rates and interrelationships of multiple structural and functional attributes of terrestrial ecosystems is still limited. Here, we conducted a 3-year field experiment to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of multiple level of N addition on a wide range of ecosystem structural and functional attributes associated with >20 plant, soil and microbial variables in a semi-arid grassland. We found that N fertilization can have multiple cascading effects on ecosystem structures and functions. These cascading events ultimately result in the activation of multiple biologically driven mechanisms to promote P availability (e.g. increased soil organic P mineralization, plant phosphorus resorption, enzymatic and genetic processes of phosphatase). The increasing phosphatase production and its functional gene expression, and decreasing plant and microbial biomass might imply important shifts in the carbon-use strategies of plants and microbes allocating more resources to high-C consuming enzymatic and genetic processes and less in plant and microbial biomass. Nitrogen addition decreases fungal community biomass which suggests the decoupling of key symbiotic plant–fungal relationships for nutrient acquirement. Overall, our study advances our understanding of how and why N fertilization simultaneously influences multiple structural and functional attributes, ultimately accelerating phosphorus cycle in terrestrial ecosystems. © 2021 British Ecological Society","cascading effect; ecosystem structure and function; enzymatic and genetic process of phosphatase; nitrogen fertilization; phosphorus cycle","biomineralization; enzyme activity; grassland; grazing management; livestock farming; manure; nutrient cycling; phosphatase; phosphorus cycle; semiarid region; soil microorganism; soil-vegetation interaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101916464

In Mexico, it is one of the main insect pests of soft-skinned fruits such as blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, plums, and guava. Previous studies have shown that D. suzukii uses visual and chemical cues during host plant searching. This knowledge has been used to develop traps and attractants for monitoring D. suzukii. In this study, five trap designs were evaluated to monitor D. suzukii under field conditions. Traps were baited with SuzukiiTrap®, Z-Kinol, an attractant based on acetoin and methionol, or apple cider vinegar (ACV) enriched with 10% ethanol (EtOH) with the synergistic action of carbon dioxide (CO2). Our results suggested that the attractant was the determining factor in capturing D. suzukii, while trap design seemed to play a modest role. We found that traps baited with Z-Kinol captured the highest number of D. suzukii compared to that caught by traps baited with SuzukiiTrap®, or ACV + EtOH + CO2. The highest catch numbers occurred in blackberry, followed by strawberry, raspberry, and blueberry. Traps captured more females than males. The results obtained may be useful for monitoring D. suzukii populations in Mexico and elsewhere, particularly in states where soft fruit crops are a component of agricultural activities.

Opportunities for future work in floral systems include identifying specific microbial semiochemicals that underlie insect behavioral responses and examining if insect species vary in their responses to microbial volatiles.

Federal policies may focus on climate change adaptation-actions taken to avoid the consequences or capture the benefits of climate change-or climate change mitigation-interventions to reduce the sources or increase the sinks of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Policies focused on adaptation can reduce risks associated with climate change at federal agencies (including risks to infrastructure, operations, and mission delivery), including at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Given that agriculture and forestry are already experiencing the impacts of climate change, adaptation policies are particularly important for these sectors. Agriculture and forestry are sensitive to climate change, due to relationships between environmental conditions and the health and growth of plants and animals. Policy choices about practices, technologies, and programs can help determine how effectively the agriculture and forestry sectors adapt to climate change. While farmers, ranchers, and land managers continuously adapt to changing conditions, responses to climate change may require new management practices and technologies. Many policies, programs, and activities at USDA address climate adaptation issues specific to agriculture and forestry. USDA provides federal programs and services related to forestry, farming, ranching, rural development, food, and other areas through its agencies and staff offices. Many USDA agencies and offices conduct programs and activities that address climate change adaptation with respect to their unique missions. At the department level, the Climate Change Program Office (CCPO) coordinates USDA's response to climate change, and the USDA Climate Hubs work to connect climate adaptation research and practice. CCPO, a component of the Office of the Chief Economist, coordinates within USDA and with other federal agencies and international organizations. As such, it oversees USDA climate change adaptation planning, chairs the USDA-wide Global Change Task Force, oversees departmental GHG accounting, represents USDA to the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), and directs international climate change initiatives. The USDA Climate Hubs are a departmental initiative involving several USDA agencies. The 10 regional hubs provide technical support to agricultural producers and landowners, assess and monitor production risks, conduct research, and engage with stakeholders regarding the effects of climate change on agriculture and forests. USDA agencies that engage on climate change adaptation include those focused on natural resources and conservation (the U.S. Forest Service [FS] and the Natural Resources Conservation Agency [NRCS]); research (the Agricultural Research Service [ARS], the National Institute of Food and Agriculture [NIFA], the Economic Research Service [ERS], and the National Agricultural Statistics Service [NASS]); and production, marketing, and regulatory activities (the Farm Service Agency [FSA], the Risk Management Agency [RMA], and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service [APHIS]). Other USDA agencies may address climate change adaptation in more limited ways. FS and NRCS play an outsized role in climate change adaptation activities at USDA. Together, their mandates cover approximately 1.5 billion acres of land, including national forests, national grasslands, and privately owned agricultural land. FS manages the National Forest System, conducts forestry research, and provides technical and financial assistance to state, private, and international forestry agencies. These responsibilities increase its presence in climate change activities beyond those of most other agencies at USDA. NRCS develops and delivers voluntary conservation technical assistance and financial support programs. USDA strategies for climate change adaptation rely heavily on these NRCS activities. Considerations for Congress may include the funding of USDA agencies and programs, the voluntary nature of programs that address climate change adaptation, opportunities to incentivize adaptive decisions, USDA staffing levels and leadership positions, concerns about the independence of climate science at USDA, and the design of USDA risk management programs. Congress may choose to address these issues through exercising its appropriations and oversight responsibilities or through new authorizations or directives. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111454136

This is a major problem for sustainable waste management systems mainly due to the lack of economic resources. The clean development mechanism (CDM) appears as a possibility to facilitate sustainable financing. Implementing a methane oxidation layer (MOL) emerges as a feasible technical option for this kind of small landfills since landfill gas extraction is usually not viable. This paper presents a techno-economic and environmental assessment of MOL implementation in the Providence landfill (Seychelles) as a small-scale CDM measure. Results show that the MOL measure could avoid by 2030 between 94 and 20 kt CO2 eq. Concerning profitability, results clearly show that it depends on the existence of stabilized biomass material within the island. Thus, the MOL measure starts to be profitable in some scenarios for certified emission reductions (CER) prices higher than 26 €/t CO2 eq. that seem possible depending on the emissions’ market development. When not profitable under CDM, the MOL measure might be used to reduce CO2 emissions from the domestic climate effort under the Paris Agreement since the unitary abatement costs is between 10 and 423 €/t CO2 eq. Moreover, the MOL measure contributes to the sustainable development goals (SDG) achievement – mainly SDG8, SDG13, and SDG14. Finally, results call for a prompt action in Seychelles since the sooner the MOL is implemented after the landfill is closed, the more profitable. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biocover; Clean development mechanism; Climate change mitigation; Methane oxidation layer; Profitability; Small-scale","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Profitability; Sustainable development; Biomass materials; Certified emission reductions; Clean Development Mechanism; Economic resources; Landfill gas extraction; Market development; Small island developing state; Sustainable waste management; Land fill; carbon dioxide; methane; methane; clean development mechanism; climate change; environmental assessment; methane; mitigation; oxidation; profitability; waste management; waste treatment; Article; biomass; case study; climate change; concentration (parameter); controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; economic development; environmental monitoring; feasibility study; geographic distribution; landfill; oxidation; pollution control; public expenditure; sustainable development; sustainable growth; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; France; Seychelles; waste disposal; waste disposal facility; Seychelles; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Methane; Paris; Refuse Disposal; Seychelles; Waste Disposal Facilities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101411514

While there are calls to store carbon by increasing the forest stock, other actors oppose this, arguing that carbon stored in processed timber is more adequate. Applying an adapted version of the policy network analysis (PNA) framework, we uncover both the actors' policy preferences regarding the goal conflict between carbon storage in the forest versus in timber products as well as the actors' perceived importance and information sharing in the forest policy network in a Swiss region (canton Lucerne) via an online stakeholder survey. We find that an increase of carbon storage in the forest does not stand a chance in the Lucerne forest policy network, being rejected by nearly two-thirds of the actors. A majority views increased harvesting for wood products as a superior climate change mitigation measure than harvesting less for carbon storage. We also find that these proponents of wood are more central actors within the policy networks than those in favour of carbon storage in the forest. These findings are relevant for a context where the majority of the forest is privately owned and where interests in timber harvesting might dominate those on carbon storage. The analysis reflects the challenging situation within the timber market, where measures for increased wood harvesting might provide a more acceptable policy option than carbon sequestration for private forest owners. © 2021 The Author(s)","Carbon storage; Forest policy; Goal conflict; Social network analysis (SNA); Switzerland","Harvesting; Logging (forestry); Timber; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Information sharing; Online stakeholders; Private forest owners; Timber harvesting; Timber products; Wood harvesting; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099523868

However, these shifts vary tremendously in rate, extent and direction. The reasons for this variation are yet poorly understood. A process potentially important for mountain plant re-distribution is a competition between colonizing species and the resident vegetation. Here, we focus on the impact of this process using the recent elevational shift of the sedge Carex humilis in the northern Italian Alps as a model system. We repeated and extended historical sampling (conducted in 1976) of the species in the study region. We used the historical distribution data and historical climatic maps to parameterize a species distribution model (SDM) and projected the potential distribution of the species under current conditions. We compared the historical and the current re-survey for the species in terms of the cover of important potential competitor species as well as in terms of the productivity of the resident vegetation indicated by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We found that Carex humilis has shifted its leading range margin upward rapidly (51.2 m per decade) but left many sites that have become climatically suitable since 1976 according to the SDM uncolonized. These suitable but uncolonized sites show significantly higher coverage of all dwarf shrub species and higher NDVI than the sites occupied by the sedge. These results suggest that resistance of the resident vegetation against colonization of migrating species can indeed play an important role in controlling the re-distribution of mountain plants under climate change. © 2020, The Author(s).","Alpine vegetation; Climate change; Competition; NDVI; Range dynamics; Remapping","climate change; colonization; dicotyledon; ecological modeling; global warming; mountain region; NDVI; sedge; shrub; vegetation type; Alps; Carex humilis; Carex scopulorum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095584712

CO2 partial pressures (PCO2) from 0.2 to 1 atm were studied during linear sweep voltammetry and chronoamperometry at −0.7, −0.9, and −1.1 VRHE. At a given applied overpotential the total current density increased with increasing PCO2 in both the dark and the light, but there were significant differences in the Tafel behavior between dark and illuminated conditions. The reduction of CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO) was found to have first-order behavior with respect to PCO2 at all applied potentials in both the dark and the light, likely indicating no change in the rate-determining step upon illumination. Activity for the hydrogen (H2) evolution reaction decreased with increasing PCO2 at slightly different rates in the dark and the light at each applied potential, making it unclear if light is influencing CO or H2 intermediate adsorbate coverage. Both formate and methanol production showed no dependence on PCO2 under any conditions, but the true reaction orders may be masked by the much higher activity for CO and H2 at the silver cathode. The investigation of product distribution with temperature at 14, 22, and 32∘C at −0.7, −0.9, and −1.1 VRHE in both the dark and the light demonstrated that the selectivity changes observed upon illumination are not caused by local heating of the cathode surface. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide partial pressure; Carbon dioxide reduction; Plasmon-enhanced electrocatalysis; Reaction order; Silver film","Carbon monoxide; Cathodes; Chronoamperometry; Plasmonics; Pollution control; Reaction intermediates; Reaction rates; Reduction; Silver; Carbon dioxide reduction; Electrochemical conversion; Evolution reactions; Linear sweep voltammetry; Methanol production; Pressure and temperature; Product distributions; Rate determining step; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101175804

In Sri Lanka, the agricultural sector is comprised largely of smallholder farmers where rain-fed rice is often a staple. Yet climate change projections indicate rice yields could drop by 40%, affecting the majority of farmers, and poverty levels could increase from 17% to 33%. At the same time, fertilisers are highly subsidized, without which farmers in this import-dependent island state would be exposed to future price fluctuations like the 800% phosphate price spike in 2008. Collaborative research between Sri Lankan and Australian researchers investigated the capacity of smallholder farmers, policy-makers and other food system stakeholders in Sri Lanka to adapt to these twin challenges via a participatory rapid integrated vulnerability assessment framework. We find that while Sri Lanka is vulnerable, there are many adaptive strategies already in place or planned. Although these strategies are not driven by climate change adaptation or phosphorus scarcity, they could be strengthened to support phosphorus and climate smart agriculture (PACSA). Sri Lanka’s food production is in the midst of a major transformation, largely driven by the President’s push for organic agriculture and organic fertilisers, waste-to-energy systems implemented through public-private partnerships, and the National Adaptation Plan for Climate Change. There are many ‘win-win’ PACSA opportunities both on- and off-farm, such as developing crop varieties that are drought-tolerant and need less phosphorus fertiliser and improved cold storage in the food value chain to reduce food losses. © 2021, International Society for Plant Pathology and Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change; Food systems; Phosphorus scarcity; Sri Lanka; Vulnerability assessment","adaptive management; climate change; fertilizer application; food production; food security; island state; price dynamics; rainfed agriculture; rice; soil nutrient; spatiotemporal analysis; Sri Lanka",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101264891

Dual fuel engines, running on both gaseous and liquid fuels, represent a viable way toward the reduction of emissions at the cost of additional complexity in monitoring activities. Motivation: Data-driven methods represent the frontier in research and in maritime industrial applications, and they usually require a large amount of labelled data, i.e., sensor measurements plus the associated engine status usually annotated by human operators, which are costly and seldomly available in the wild. Unlabelled samples, instead, are commonly, cheaply, and readily available. Hypothesis: The enabling technology for data-driven methods is the availability of a network of sensors and an automation system able to capture and store the associated stream of data. Methods: In this paper, we design and propose multiple alternatives toward the weakly supervised marine dual fuel engines data-driven monitoring. To this aim, we will rely on a Digital Twin of the dual fuel engine or on novelty detection algorithms and we will compare them against state-of-the-art fully supervised approaches. Results: Results on data generated from a real-data validated simulator of a marine dual fuel engine demonstrate that the proposed weakly supervised monitoring approaches lead to a negligible loss in accuracy compared to costly and often unfeasible fully supervised ones supporting the validity of the proposal for its application in the wild. Conclusion: The main outcome is a guideline for selecting the best data-driven dual fuel engine monitoring method according to the available data. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anomaly detection; Digital Twin; Dual fuel engine; Fully supervised; Maritime transport; Monitoring; Weakly supervised","Automation; Data Analytics; Data streams; Digital twin; Fuels; Industrial research; Marine engines; Waterway transportation; Data-driven methods; Enabling technologies; Environmental footprints; Maritime transportation; Monitoring activities; Monitoring approach; Reduction of emissions; Sensor measurements; Dual fuel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101171663

The majority of the total air pollution disease burden is from fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure, with smaller contributions from ozone (O3) exposure. Recent emission reductions have reduced PM2.5 exposure. However, levels of exposure and the associated risk remain high, some pollutant emissions have increased, and some sectors lack effective emission control measures. We quantified the potential impacts of relevant policy scenarios on ambient air quality and public health across China. We show that PM2.5 exposure inside the Greater Bay Area (GBA) is strongly controlled by emissions outside the GBA. We find that reductions in residential solid fuel use and agricultural fertilizer emissions result in the greatest reductions in PM2.5 exposure and the largest health benefits. A 50% transition from residential solid fuel use to liquefied petroleum gas outside the GBA reduced PM2.5 exposure by 15% in China and 3% within the GBA, and avoided 191,400 premature deaths each year across China. Reducing agricultural fertilizer emissions of ammonia by 30% outside the GBA reduced PM2.5 exposure by 4% in China and 3% in the GBA, avoiding 56,500 annual premature deaths across China. Our simulations suggest that reducing residential solid fuel or industrial emissions will reduce both PM2.5 and O3 exposure, whereas other policies may increase O3 exposure. Improving particulate air quality inside the GBA will require consideration of residential solid fuel and agricultural sectors, which currently lack targeted policies, and regional cooperation both inside and outside the GBA. © 2021.

The goal of this work was to evaluate the effect of an urban compost amendment on metal allocation in two evergreen tree species (Pinus halepensis and Tetraclinis articulata) growing in a metal-enriched polluted substrate. A comprehensive characterisation of edaphic parameters and metal speciation was carried out. Plant analyses included metal concentrations in different tree compartments: roots, stems, branches and leaves. The amendment caused a significant increase in plant biomass for both trees, although T. articulata produced 2.5 times more biomass than P. halepensis. The amendment alleviated P deficiency in P. halepensis. This did not occur for the N deficiency detected in T. articulata. The latter showed no effect of the amendment in the allocation of metals, being most of them restricted at the root compartment (> 50%). For P. halepensis, similar behaviour occurred for Cu, Pb and Zn. However, for Cd, the amendment caused its redistribution into pine shoots, probably due to its transport associated with the increased transpiration. Results indicated that T. articulata may be a promising tree species to be used in phytomanagement programs under semiarid climates due to its low metal translocation into shoots and remarkable biomass production under amendment conditions. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Metal allocation; Mine tailings; Phytostabilisation; Semiarid climate; Tree species","concentration (composition); metal; mining; phytoremediation; soil amendment; soil organic matter; soil pollution; soil stabilization; tailings; transpiration; Pinus halepensis; Tetraclinis articulata; carbon; Carbon-13; metal; oxygen; Oxygen-18; biomass; bioremediation; chemistry; climate; metabolism; mining; pharmacokinetics; pine; plant leaf; plant root; plant stem; soil; soil pollutant; Spain; tissue distribution; tree; vascular plant; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biomass; Carbon Isotopes; Climate; Metals; Mining; Oxygen Isotopes; Pinus; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Plant Stems; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Spain; Tissue Distribution; Tracheophyta; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076232062

Climate change will further exacerbate this situation over the coming decades unless effective interventions are implemented. Evaluating the efficacy of alternative interventions in a complex system experiencing major cumulative impacts can only be achieved through a systems modelling approach. We have evaluated combinations of interventions using a coral reef meta-community model. The model consisted of a dynamic network of 3753 reefs supporting communities of corals and CoTS connected through ocean larval dispersal, and exposed to changing regimes of tropical cyclones, flood plumes, marine heatwaves and ocean acidification. Interventions included reducing flood plume impacts, expanding control of CoTS populations, stabilizing coral rubble, managing solar radiation and introducing heat-tolerant coral strains. Without intervention, all climate scenarios resulted in precipitous declines in GBR coral cover over the next 50 years. The most effective strategies in delaying decline were combinations that protected coral from both predation (CoTS control) and thermal stress (solar radiation management) deployed at large scale. Successful implementation could expand opportunities for climate action, natural adaptation and socioeconomic adjustment by at least one to two decades. © 2021 The Authors.","climate adaptation; climate impacts; coral bleaching; coral reef; Great Barrier Reef; meta-community model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106737538

These single-atom photocatalysts were successfully prepared with Ni2+, Pt2+ or Ru3+ by cation exchange, using poly(heptazine imides) (PHI) as the 2D layered platform. Differences in photocatalytic performance for these metals were assessed using rhodamine-B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO) as model compounds for degradation. We have demonstrated that single atoms may either improve or impair the degradation of RhB and MO, depending on the proper matching of the net charge of these molecules and the surface potential of the catalyst, which in turn is responsive to the metal incorporated into the PHI nanostructures. Computer simulations demonstrated that even one transition metal cation caused dramatic changes in the electronic structure of PHI, especially regarding light absorption, which was extended all along the visible up to the near IR region. Besides introducing new quantum states, the metal atoms strongly polarized the molecular orbitals across the PHI and electrostatic fields arising from the electronic transitions became at least tenfold stronger. This simple proof of concept demonstrates that these new materials hold promise as tools for many important photocatalytic reactions that are strongly dependent on our ability to control surface charge and its polarization under illumination, such as H2 evolution, CO2 reduction and photooxidation in general. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Amines; Atoms; Azo dyes; Electronic structure; Graphitic Carbon Nitride; Light absorption; Molecular orbitals; Photocatalysis; Photooxidation; Positive ions; Quantum theory; Rhodamine B; Transition metals; Cation exchanges; Electronic transition; Model compound; Near-IR regions; Photocatalytic performance; Photocatalytic reactions; Proof of concept; Transition metal cations; Rhodium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089903601

This work investigates the degradation of gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) in a flowing, alkaline CO2 electrolyzer via the formation of carbonate deposits on the GDE surface. These carbonate deposits were found to impede electrode performance after only 6 h of operation at current densities ranging from -50 to -200 mA cm-2. The rate of carbonate deposit formation on the GDE surface was determined to increase with increasing electrolyte molarity and became more prevalent in K+-containing as opposed to Cs+-containing electrolytes. Electrolyte composition and concentration also had significant effects on the morphology, distribution, and surface coverage of the carbonate deposits. For example, carbonates formed in K+-containing electrolytes formed concentrated deposit regions of varying morphology on the GDE surface, while those formed in Cs+-containing electrolytes appeared as small crystals, well dispersed across the electrode surface. Both deposits occluding the catalyst layer surface and those found within the microporous layer and carbon fiber substrate of the electrode were found to diminish performance in ECO2R, leading to rapid loss of CO production after ∼50% of the catalyst layer surface was occluded. Additionally, carbonate deposits reduced GDE hydrophobicity, leading to increased flooding and internal deposits within the GDE substrate. Electrolyte engineering-based solutions are suggested for improved GDE durability in future work. ©","carbonate formation; CO2electroreduction; degradation mechanisms; durability; flow cell","Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Catalysts; Degradation; Deposits; Diffusion in gases; Durability; Electrolytes; Electrolytic reduction; Graphite fibers; Morphology; Substrates; Carbon neutral fuel; Carbonate formations; Electrochemical reductions; Electrode degradation; Electrode performance; Electrolyte compositions; Gas diffusion electrodes; Long term durability; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104047350

The components of weather include low temperature (°C), high temperature (°C), temperature average (°C), humidity (%), and amount of rainfall (mm). Pearson-rank correlation test showed that high temperature (r=.643; p<.001), low temperature (r=.640; p<.001) and humidity (r=.248; p<.005) were significantly correlated with deaths caused by Covid-19 pandemic used for data analysis. Social isolation rate (β = -.254; p<.001) and daily record of new cases (β =.332; p<.001), with adjusted R-squared of.623, were the predictors of deaths acummuled by Covid-19. The finding serves as an input to reduce the incidence rate of Covid-19 in Brazil. Statistical results show evidence of the relationship between climate elements and COVID-19 indicators, such as the number of deaths, spread of contamination and social isolation rate. The study of dimensions of climate as a seasonal pattern and its relationship to COVID-19 benefits epidemiological surveillance. The more geographic spaces are known, more will help to understand the differences in disease behavior in different places. The results of this research showed that environmental conditions influence the contagion and speed of transmission of Covid-19. Policies that contribute to benefits to health and sustainability need to be planned. The contribution of climate and other factors, such as air pollution, for example, require additional studies. Environmental changes, such as climate change and biodiversity, must also be investigated for their impact on human health. Acting in prevention, including the promotion of socially acceptable behaviors on the part of the population, seems to be the best way to deal with Covid-19. © 2021 Instituto de Geografia.

The commercialized processes based on the biorefinery concept are increasing in chemicals and biofuels production, which can be integrated into the conventional manufacturing processes. These processes generated dilute aqueous streams with numerous side products and waste streams. The biorefinery schemes on an industrial scale require the process design and technical and economic assessment to establish its viability and to elucidate its potential socioeconomic effect at local and regional levels. The reviewed literature shows the obtaining of several marketable industrial interest products with high yields of the final product. The most significant variables and parameters should be established and enhanced to attain efficient and profitable processes. The diverse schemes of biorefinery can be assessed based on the process design, the mass, and energy integration, economic assessment, and risk and sensibility analysis. This work presents a framework for the design, analysis, and assessment of biorefinery schemes. They could be integrated into agricultural and forestry waste production chains for their valorization. Sections 1–5 define the steps to follow for the design, analysis, and assessment of biorefinery schemes. A case study to demonstrate the application of the proposed scheme is shown in Section 6.

As part of students' Exploration stage elective course choices, the School of Engineering and Sciences offered, during the Fall 2020 term, a 5-week course on the topic of Causes, Consequences and Solutions to Climate Change (DS1002B), aimed at students 1) with no previous background or stated interest on the subject and 2) registered in a different school. The objective of this work was to assess the understanding and attitude of non-engineering, second-year undergraduate students toward the climate change crisis after taking the course DS1002B, in which students learn about the basic science of climate change science and acquire the following skills: 1) calculation of greenhouse gases emission inventories, 2) decision making of climate change mitigation and/or adaptation actions, and 3) reflect about the importance of creating awareness about climate change and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the course was implemented online with the participation of270 students divided in 4 groups: 2 Regular-small-local (RSL) groups and 2 Elite- massive-national (EMN) groups, which differed in the number of attending professors, number of students, students' location, and language of instruction. The learning process was assessed in terms of attitude, confidence and source credibility. One of the main findings was that the number of students and language had no impact on learning motivation and attitude towards climate change. Also, a better understanding of the target audience will allow for increased engagement, perception and motivation, leading to more well-rounded future decision makers. © 2021 IEEE.","Climate change; Climate change communication; Educational innovation; Higher education; Massive courses","Curricula; Decision making; Education computing; Engineering education; Greenhouse gases; Learning systems; Motivation; Students; Climate change mitigation; Educational models; Greenhouse gases emissions; Learning motivation; Learning process; School of engineering; Source credibilities; Undergraduate students; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112481630

Paleo-reconstructions of oceanic 13C from sediment cores provide key insights into past as changes in these three drivers. As a step toward full inclusion of 13C in the next generation of Earth system models, we implemented 13C-cycling in a 1° lateral resolution ocean-ice-biogeochemistry Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) model driven by Common Ocean Reference Experiment perpetual year forcing. The model improved the mean of modern δ13CDIC over coarser resolution GFDL-model implementations, capturing the Southern Ocean decline in surface δ13CDIC that propagates to the deep sea via deep water formation. Controls on δ13CDIC of the deep-sea are quantified using both observations and model output. The biological control is estimated from the relationship between deep-sea Pacific δ13CDIC and phosphate (PO4). The δ13CDIC:PO4 slope from observations is revised to a value of 1.01 ± 0.02‰ (μmol kg−1)−1, consistent with a carbon to phosphate ratio of organic matter (C:Porg) of 124 ± 10. Model output yields a lower δ13CDIC:PO4 than observed due to too low C:Porg. The ocean circulation impacts deep modern δ13CDIC in two ways, via the relative proportion of Southern Ocean and North Atlantic deep water masses, and via the preindustrial δ13CDIC of these water mass endmembers. The δ13CDIC of the endmembers ventilating the deep sea are shown to be highly sensitive to the wind speed dependence of air-sea CO2 gas exchange.

The Mediterranean basin is considered a hot spot in terms of climate vulnerability and risk. The expected impacts of those events are exacerbated by land-use change and, in particular, by urban growth which increases soil sealing and, hence, water runoff. The ultimate consequence would be an increase of fatalities and injuries, but also of economic losses in urban areas, commercial and productive sites, infrastructures and agriculture. Flood damages have different magnitudes depending on the economic value of the exposed assets and on level of physical contact with the hazard. This work aims at proposing a methodology, easily customizable by experts’ elicitation, able to quantify and map the social component of vulnerability through the integration of earth observation (EO) and census data with the aim of allowing for a multi-temporal spatial assessment. Firstly, data on employment, properties and education are used for assessing the adaptive capacity of the society to increase resilience to adverse events, whereas, secondly, coping capacity, i.e. the capacities to deal with events during their manifestation, is mapped by aggregating demographic and socio-economic data, urban growth analysis and memory on past events. Thirdly, the physical dimension of exposed assets (susceptibility) is assessed by combining building properties acquired by census data and land-surface characteristics derived from EO data. Finally, the three components (i.e. adaptive and coping capacity and susceptibility) are aggregated for calculating the dynamic flood vulnerability index (FVI). The approach has been applied to Northeast Italy, a region frequently hit by floods, which has experienced a significant urban and economic development in the past decades, thus making the dynamic study of FVI particularly relevant. The analysis has been carried out from 1991 to 2016 at a 5-year steps, showing how the integration of different data sources allows to produce a dynamic assessment of vulnerability, which can be very relevant for planning in support of climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. © 2021, The Author(s).","Census data; Earth observation; Flood; Memory effect; Multi-criteria analysis; Vulnerability index","census; flood; mapping; multicriteria analysis; quantitative analysis; temporal analysis; vulnerability; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100480075

A statistically significant increase in mean annual water temperature was recorded for four observation stations, ranging from 0.17 to 0.39◦C dec−1 . At the seasonal scale, for the winter half-year, water temperature increase varied from 0.17 to 0.26◦C dec−1, and for the summer half-year from 0.17 to 0.50◦C dec−1 . In three cases (Odra-Brzeg, Odra-Słubice, Niemen-Grodno), the recorded changes referred to the scale of changes in air temperature. For the fourth station on Neman (Smalininkai), an increase in water temperature in the river was considerably slower than air temperature increase. It should be associated with the substantial role of local conditions (non-climatic) affecting the thermal regime in that profile.

A country’s PM2.5 can be affected not only by country factors but also by the neighboring country’s air quality factors. Therefore, forecasting PM2.5 requires collecting data from outside the country as well as from within which is necessary for policies and plans. The data set of many variables with a relatively small number of observations can cause a dimensionality problem and limit the performance of the deep learning model. This study used daily data for five years in predicting PM2.5 concentrations in eight Korean cities through deep learning models. PM2.5 data of China were collected and used as input variables to solve the dimensionality problem using principal components analysis (PCA). The deep learning models used were a recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM). The performance of the models with and without PCA was compared using root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). As a result, the application of PCA in LSTM and BiLSTM, excluding the RNN, showed better performance: decreases of up to 16.6% and 33.3% in RMSE and MAE values. The results indicated that applying PCA in deep learning time series prediction can contribute to practical performance improvements, even with a small number of observations. It also provides a more accurate basis for the establishment of PM2.5 reduction policy in the country. © 2021 by the authors.","Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM); Deep learning; Long short-term memory (LSTM); PM2.5; Principal components analysis (PCA); Recurrent neural network RNN)","air quality; atmospheric pollution; environmental factor; particulate matter; performance assessment; pollution policy; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103293885

Air pollutants and meteorological data were acquired from Korea’s national monitoring station near a residential development area in the target district and background site. Seasonal emissions of PM2.5, including CPM, were estimated using the California puff (CALPUFF) model, based on Korea’s national emissions inventory. These results were compared with the traditional environmental impact assessment results. For the residential development area, the seasonal PM2.5 concentration was predicted by considering FPM and CPM emissions in the target area as well as the surrounding areas. In winter and spring, air quality standards were not breached because only FPM was considered. However, when CPM was included in the analysis, the results exceeded the air quality standards. Furthermore, it was predicted that air quality standards would not be breached in summer and autumn, even when CPM is included. In other words, conducting an environmental impact assessment on air pollution including CPM affects the final environmental decision. Therefore, it is concluded that PM2.5 should include CPM for greater accuracy of the CALPUFF model for environmental impact assessment. © 2021 by the authors.

Nevertheless, N not taken up by cassava roots is subjected to microbial transformation resulting in nitrous oxide (N2O) production, a potent greenhouse gas. The temporal dynamics of soil N is partially influenced by the N source (i.e., organic or inorganic fertilizer) and the synchrony between N supply and demand. This study, which was conducted in Colombia on soils with high organic carbon and phosphorus contents, aimed at monitoring N2O emissions from cassava plots fertilized with organic (49.8 kg N ha-1 year-1) or inorganic fertilizers (22.7 kg N ha-1 year-1). Although the organic fertilizer (vermicompost) contained more than double the amount of N, cumulative N2O emissions from organic cassava production (1.28 kg N2O-N ha-1) were lower than those from inorganic fertilizer-based cassava production (1.74 kg N2O-N ha-1) system. This finding indicates that, if crop yields can be maintained, there is potential to reduce cassava production's environmental impact through organic fertilization on highly fertile soils. However, a transition to organic fertilization depends on the availability of sufficient amounts of organic fertilizers at the farm level. The N2O emissions in this study were higher than those predicted using the default IPCC emission factor, which confirmed the relevance of using country or regional specific emissions factors. © 2021 British Society of Soil Science","agroecology; climate change mitigation; N2O emission factor; sustainable tropical agriculture","cassava; environmental impact; fertilizer application; greenhouse gas; nitrous oxide; Colombia; Manihot esculenta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100139022

A global pandemic has shifted health concerns from air pollution effects to novel coronavirus disease, similarly to those in Bangkok. Although Bangkokians have experienced severe PM2.5 conditions since the last quarter of 2017, the related agencies have failed to elucidate the crisis. This has been because the fundamental air quality management is focused on controlling emissions. The Thai government has sluggishly determined the situations that lead to the inability to clean up its air. How are air pollution and disease linked? This article points to the importance of source management. The lockdown measures revealed reduced traffic rate and PM2.5 concentrations. Such a close relationship has shed insights of the consequences of working from home (WFH). The link between disease and air pollution includes (i) WFH regulation is one specific way to prevent the transmission of disease, (ii) this guideline decreases traffic congestion in an urban city which is one path of diminished pollution discharge and (iii) then noticeably followed by PM2.5 reductions. Again, the magnitude of source control is crucial. Reducing pollutions from traffic by means of WFH has illustrated this accomplishment. In the midst of this crisis, moving to a new normal role supports remaining protected from both air pollution and the pandemic. Nevertheless, the sustainability of transportation control in an overcrowded city like Bangkok should be considered as a vital pathway to tackle air pollution. Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

The impacts of climate change on animal-specific interaction remain inadequately reported. For the assessment of mountain biological systems, environmental models assume a significant job in recognizing and monitoring critical habitat under the potential future climatic conditions. Our paper, utilizing the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs-2050), the future global warming climatic scenarios, explores the trend of range shifts of Himalayan pheasants in the Eastern Himalayas based on an ensemble technique. The prediction model demonstrated that the core zone habitat of the Himalayan pheasants would have shifted towards higher altitude and latitude gradients with the greenhouse gaseous intensification. Under the extreme future climatic scenario, the species may reach towards Sky Island of the Himalayan regions. Therefore, a legitimate policy is essential to implement on time for the mitigation of the greenhouse gaseous emission. The outcome of this article illuminated that the present protected areas (PAs) of the Eastern Himalayas appeared to be inadequate regarding conservation measures of Himalayan Pheasants due to the current range may go rapidly beyond the protected zones. The shifting of the range of the Himalayan pheasants under future climatic scenarios will offer an indication for conservation directives to formulate appropriate strategies for habitat management of the threatened animals of the Himalayan ecosystem before the door of annihilation. © 2021 The Authors","Climate; Conservation; Eastern Himalaya; Endemic species; Himalayan Pheasant; Hotspot","Animals; Biological systems; Conservation; Global warming; Predictive analytics; Climate change impact; Climatic conditions; Conservation measures; Ensemble techniques; Environmental change; Environmental model; Mountain ecosystems; Specific interaction; Ecosystems; climate change; climate conditions; conservation management; conservation status; ecological modeling; endangered species; global warming; latitudinal gradient; policy implementation; strategic approach; Himalayas; Phasianidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099679174

The observed and simulated aerosol optical depths (AODs) exhibit similar horizontal distributions with large values over eastern and central China, and sulfate aerosols contribute the main differences between the AODs simulated by NICAM and BCC_AGCM. The simulated sulfate and dust surface concentrations are more consistent with observations compared with the simulated carbonaceous surface concentrations, and both models can reproduce the decreasing tendency of the sulfate surface concentration from urban sites to rural sites. However, the dust emission and deposition levels in China simulated by BCC_AGCM are three times as high as those simulated by NICAM, and the major sink processes of the anthropogenic sulfate, black carbon (BC), and organic carbon (OC) aerosols over China are very different between the two models. The emission and deposition results, which are closely related to the model-assumed aerosol particle size distribution, indicate that the current aerosol size distribution used in the two models should be further improved. The differences in dust emission parameterizations also lead significant discrepancies in aerosol cycles and the dust emission scheme is an important factor determining the magnitudes of global and regional dust emission fluxes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aerosol budget; Aerosol optical properties; BCC_AGCM_CAM; China; Model comparison; NICAM_SPRINTARS","Aerosols; Budget control; Climate models; Deposition; Dust; Optical properties; Organic carbon; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Size distribution; Sulfur compounds; Urban growth; Aerosol characteristics; Aerosol optical depths; Aerosol optical property; Aerosol particle size distribution; Aerosol size distributions; Atmospheric general circulation models; Canadian aerosol modules; Horizontal distribution; Atmospheric movements; black carbon; organic carbon; sulfate; aerosol; atmospheric modeling; comparative study; computer simulation; concentration (composition); dust; numerical model; optical depth; sulfate; aerosol; Article; China; comparative study; computer simulation; controlled study; dry deposition; life cycle assessment; optical depth; particle size; priority journal; surface property; urban area; wet deposition; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095822843

The potential link between N2O reduction and CH4 oxidation in anoxic wetland sediments would be a sink for both gases, which has attracted broad attention. To explore the simultaneous N2O and CH4 biotransformation, wetland sediments were used to inoculate an enrichment reactor, continuously fed with CH4 and N2O for 500 days. After enrichment, the CH4 oxidation rate reached 2.8 μmol·g-1dw·d-1, which was 800-fold higher than the rate of the wetland sediments used as inoculum. Moreover, stable isotopic tracing proved CH4 oxidation was driven by N2O consumption under anoxic conditions. Genomic sequencing showed that the microbial community was dominated by methanotrophs. Species of Methylocaldum genus, belonging to γ-Proteobacteria class, were significantly enriched, and became the predominant methanotrophs. Quantitative analysis indicated methane monooxygenase and nitrous oxide reductase increased by 38- and 8-fold compared to the inoculum. As to the potential mechanisms, we propose that N2O-driven CH4 oxidation was mediated by aerobic methanotrophs solely or along with denitrifying bacteria under hypoxia. Electrons and energy are generated and transferred in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. Our findings expand the range of electron acceptors associated with CH4 oxidation as well as elucidate the significant role of methanotrophs relative to both carbon and nitrogen cycles. © 2021","Denitrification; Methane oxidation; Methanotrophs; Nitrous oxide; Wetland sediments","Aerobic bacteria; Denitrification; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Wetlands; Carbon and nitrogen; Denitrifying bacteria; Genomic sequencing; Methane monooxygenase; Microbial communities; Oxidative phosphorylation; Potential mechanism; Stable isotopic tracing; Anoxic sediments; carbon; methane; methane monooxygenase; nitrate; nitrite; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; nitrous oxide reductase; RNA 16S; tracer; methane; nitrous oxide; anoxic conditions; bacterium; methane; methanotroph; microbial community; nitrous oxide; oxidation; wetland; anoxia; Article; biotransformation; carbon cycle; chemical analysis; denitrifying bacterium; DNA extraction; electron transport; gas chromatography; illumina sequencing; inoculation; isotope tracing; methanotroph; Methylocaldum; nitrogen cycle; nonhuman; oxidation; oxidative phosphorylation; priority journal; Proteobacteria; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; sampling; sediment; sequence analysis; thermal conductivity; wetland; greenhouse gas; human; hypoxia; wetland; Gammaproteobacteria; Methylocaldum; Greenhouse Gases; Humans; Hypoxia; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101669463

While many studies have attempted to investigate the societal impacts of BEV adoption, there is still a limited understanding of the extent to which widespread adoption of BEVs may affect both environmental and economic variables simultaneously. This study intends to address this research gap by conducting a comprehensive impact assessment of BEV adoption. Using demand estimates derived from a discrete choice experiment, the impact of various scenarios is evaluated using a computable general equilibrium model. Three drivers of BEV total cost of ownership are considered, namely, subsidy levels, cash incentives by manufacturers, and fuel costs. Furthermore, in light of current trends, improvements in BEV battery manufacturing productivity are considered. This research shows that changes in fuel price and incentives by manufacturers have relatively low impacts on GDP growth, but that the effect of subsidies on GDP and on BEV adoption is considerable, due to a stimulus effect on both household expenditures and on vehicle-manufacturing-related sectors. Productivity shocks moderately impact GDP but only affect BEV adoption in competitive markets. Conversely, the environmental impact is more nuanced. Although BEV adoption leads to decreases in tailpipe emissions, increased manufacturing activity as a result of productivity increases or subsidies can lead to growth in non-tailpipe emissions that cancels out some or all of the tailpipe emissions savings. This demonstrates that in order to achieve desired emissions reductions, policies to promote BEV adoption with subsidies should be accompanied by green manufacturing and green power generation initiatives. © 2021 The Author(s).

Both temporal evolution and total source strength are analyzed and compared in three different ELM mitigation schemes including natural ELMs, resonant magnetic perturbations (RMP) and 2.45 GHz lower hybrid wave (LHW). The mitigation of W source caused by single ELM impact at the divertor target is mainly attributed to the reduction of the W source production in the ELM decay phase. However, with the increase of ELM frequency, the time-averaged intra-ELM W source during an ELM cycle rises and dominates the evolution of the total W source with increasing fraction, which exhibits strong correlation with the core W level in the RMP scheme. In the natural ELM scheme, the pedestal electron temperature is found not only to control the effective W sputtering yield at target during ELMs, thus influencing the intra-ELM W source, but also to be related to the delay time between the divertor ELM WI emission and the core extreme ultraviolet bolometer (XUV) signal which can scale with the parallel ion transit time. Furthermore, the delay time is found to have more consistent dependence on the pedestal plasma collisionality. The rise time of intra-ELM WI emission increases when RMP or LHW is applied, revealing a different ELM mitigation mechanism in comparison with the natural ELM scheme. The temporal profiles of the intra-ELM WI emission in different ELM mitigation schemes are compared and the potential mechanism is discussed. Besides, the ELM mitigation effects with RMP are found to be asymmetric at the outer and inner divertor targets, which is characterized by the different variations of the intra-ELM W source strength and the rise time of WI emission with the ramp-up of RMP coil current. Divertor partial detachment is achieved simultaneously with strong ELM mitigation under a suitable RMP phase difference without additional gas puff. © 2021 IAEA, Vienna.","EAST; ELM; erosion; LHW; RMP; tungsten","Fusion reactor divertors; Plasma theory; Tungsten; Tungsten metallography; Edgelocalized modes; Extreme Ultraviolet; Lower Hybrid waves; Mitigation effects; Plasma collisionality; Potential mechanism; Resonant magnetic perturbations; Strong correlation; Optical emission spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103200524

To achieve the reclamation and reuse of the effluent containing an excessively high amount of nutrients (N, P and K) and a certain extent of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), an original CO2-enhanced natural treatment system was put forward, which was composed of trickling filter and soil-plant units installed inside an elaborate greenhouse with an elevated CO2 concentration. On the basis of previous feasibility studies, an investigation on the system's limitations and potential were carried out for further optimisation, in which red ball earth-Kentucky bluegrass column tests were conducted at the recommended CO2 concentration of 1,400 ppm for two specific scenarios, i.e. high BOD concentration and increasing hydraulic and nutrient loading rates. N is the most critical factor determining the effect and efficiency of the system, and results confirmed that, to establish a satisfactory nitrification function in the soil for N removal, adequate BOD reduction prior to land application was indispensable. Optimal operational strategies and parameters, as well as design information for scale-up, are also discussed. By means of nutrient balance approximation, the system's significant capabilities of removing and recovering waterborne nutrients are further presented, specifically complete removal of both N and P, and 8%, 18% and 18% recovery rates for N, P and K, respectively. Meanwhile, carbon balance analysis reveals its potential for substantially reducing greenhouse gas emission, as 9% of the input waterborne C is sequestrated for establishing plant biomass and maintaining greenhouse CO2 concentration at the designated level. More importantly, the above are realised in a highly profitable manner, as the value of the high-quality turf product can be an order of magnitude higher than the cost for system operation and maintenance.

The LLBJ was accompanied by a major dust event. Numerical simulations conducted with the Weather Research and Forecasting dust (WRF-dust) model show that the formation of the LLBJ was primarily due to mid-level, southeastward descent of high momentum air, which impinged on the north slope of the Tibetan Plateau, resulting in ageostrophic flow acceleration under geostrophic adjustment. The LLBJ was reinforced by the Bernoulli effect, where the physical barrier associated with the Tibetan Plateau to the southwest and the virtual barrier associated with sloped, packed isentropic surfaces to the northeast combined to constrict the air flow, thus augmenting the acceleration of the air as it entered the Hexi Corridor. The simulations show that the LLBJ, which stayed close to the western entrance of the Hexi Corridor, gradually descended during the daytime until early evening. During this period, the core of the LLBJ stayed directly above the 302-K isentropic surface. The LLBJ, which was located to the south of the main dust plume, was modulated by dust radiative heating and cooling. Over the main dust plume, as well as in the LLBJ region, radiative heating of the dust warmed the upper part of the boundary layer and cooled it below, which stabilized the boundary layer, decreased the boundary layer depth, and reduced the vertical mixing, causing the surface winds to weaken. As a consequence of the feedback between the circulation and the dust radiative forcing, the total dust emission was reduced by ∼9.7–11% and peaked 1–2 hr earlier than without dust radiative effects, while the LLBJ's intensity, which was 1–2 m·s−1 stronger, was better maintained within the boundary layer during the daytime until early evening. © 2021 Royal Meteorological Society","Bernoulli effect; downslope wind; dust radiative forcing; Hexi Corridor; low-level barrier jet; mid-level ridge; Tibetan Plateau; WRF-dust model","Atmospheric radiation; Boundary layers; Radiant heating; Weather forecasting; Boundary layer depth; Geostrophic adjustment; Isentropic surfaces; Physical barriers; Radiative effects; Radiative forcings; Radiative heating; Weather research and forecasting; Dust; ageostrophic flow; airflow; boundary layer; computer simulation; dust; formation mechanism; jet flow; numerical model; radiative forcing; wind field; China; Gansu; Hexi Corridor; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101800673

However, the nontransparency of the Earth's ionosphere, ionospheric distortion and artificial radio frequency interference (RFI) have made it difficult to detect the VLF celestial radio emission with ground-based instruments. A straightforward solution to overcome these problems is a space-based VLF radio telescope, just like the VLF radio instruments onboard the Chang'E-4 spacecraft. But building such a space telescope would be inevitably costly and technically challenging. The alternative approach would be then a ground-based VLF radio telescope. Particularly, in the period of post 2020 when the solar and terrestrial ionospheric activities are expected to be in a 'calm' state, it will provide us a good chance to perform VLF ground-based radio observations. Anticipating such an opportunity, we built an agile VLF radio spectrum explorer co-located with the currently operationalMingantu Spectra Radio Heliograph (MUSER). The instrument includes four antennas operating in the VLF frequency range 1-70 MHz. Along with them, we employ an eight-channel analog and digital receivers to amplify, digitize and process the radio signals received by the antennas. We present in the paper this VLF radio spectrum explorer and the instrument will be useful for celestial studies of VLF radio emissions. © 2021 National Astronomical Observatories, CAS and IOP Publishing Ltd..","instrumentation: polarimeters; methods: data analysis; very low frequency",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107767594

However, most studies have relied on econometric models and only show the raw relationship between different socioeconomic drivers and PM2.5 pollution, ignoring the regional, sectoral and temporal heterogeneity. Hence, this study adopts the index decomposition method to analyze the determinants of the changes in PM2.5 emissions in different regions and sectors in China, between 2005 and 2015. By deriving an extended chain and nested refined Laspeyres index decomposition analysis method, the effects of determinants could be analyzed and compared annually. The results show: (1) the emission intensity and energy intensity in the Industry sector significantly reduced PM2.5 emissions, whereas other industrial sectors failed to do so; (2) the improvement in residential income contributed to increasing PM2.5 emissions rather than facilitating reductions at the present stage; (3) the rural per capita income and urban-rural income gap are two key factors stimulating PM2.5 emissions and the effects observed largely due to coal consumption. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Chain and nested decomposition; China; PM2.5 emissions; Refined laspeyres index analysis","Coal industry; Commerce; Economic analysis; Pollution; Air pollution in chinas; Decomposition methods; Econometric model; Emission intensity; Index decomposition analysis; Industrial sector; Per capita income; Temporal heterogeneities; Industrial emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100719341

Our aim in this study was to estimate carbon assimilation and clarify the impact of environmental factors on the photosynthesis of Zelkova serrata (Thunb.) Makino, an important plantation species that is extensively planted in low altitude regions of East Asia. We measured monthly gas exchange parameters and leaf area index to estimate carbon assimilation. The results showed that gas exchange was significantly affected by vapor pressure deficit and temperature, especially in the dry season, and both photosynthetic rate and carbon assimilation decreased. Lower daytime assimilation and higher nighttime respiration during the dry season, which caused a 43% decrease in carbon assimilation in Z. serrata plantations. Z. serrata exhibited lower photosynthetic rate and lower carbon assimilation following planting in a tropical monsoon climate area. Therefore, the effects of extreme weather such as high temperature and vapor pressure deficit on Z. serrata forest carbon budget could be stronger in the future. Leaf area showed seasonal variation, and severe defoliation was caused by a typhoon in the summer. The annual carbon assimilation was estimated at 3.50 Mg C ha−1 year−1 in the study area. © 2021 by the authors.

There is practical significance in understanding the formation mechanisms and sources of these particles. In this study, we conducted real-time measurements on the composition of non-refractory submicron aerosols (NR-PM1) in Guangzhou from 20 October to 1 December, 2016, using a quadripole aerosol chemical speciation monitor (Q-ACSM). Overall, the composition of NR-PM1 was dominated by organics (48.2%), followed by nitrate (NO3−, 20.3%), sulfate (SO42−, 17.4%), ammonium (NH4+, 11.4%), and chloride (Cl−, 2.7%). The high contribution of NO3− and NO3−/SO42− mass ratios were observed in high-PM episodes, suggesting that NOx emission control should be a priority in mitigating PM-pollution in South China. Primary organic aerosols (POA) accounted for 51% of organics as the campaign average, and POA contribution increased with PM concentrations especially during high PM episodes, indicating that local emissions played a very important role in high-PM pollution. The conversion of SO2 to SO42− and aqueous, heterogeneous production may not be the dominant source of SO42− in NR-PM1, while regional transport is likely to be the main source during high-sulfate episodes. The formation of NO3− in this study was related to gas-phase reactions of NO2 (photochemical reaction) during daytime, and heterogeneous reactions (hydrolysis reaction of N2O5) during the nighttime. Gas-phase reactions would be less important for nitrate formation during severe polluted events. Particle acidity analyses showed that particles were generally acidic and the NH4+ was not enough to fully neutralise the NO3− and SO42−, the existing forms of SO42− could be (NH4)2SO4, NH4HSO4 or (NH4)3H(SO4)2. Controlling the emissions of NH3 to reduce the NH4+ concentration can probably be a feasible direction in the future in Guangzhou if the problem of agriculture and aerosol acidity can be solved. Wind rose plots and back-trajectory analyses also demonstrated that local emission was more important to the formation of NO3− and regional transport was more conducive to the increase of SO42− concentration. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,"Aerosols; Agricultural robots; Air quality; Ammonia; Chemical speciation; Chlorine compounds; Climate change; Emission control; Gases; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Particle size; Phase interfaces; Photochemical reactions; Refractory materials; Sulfur dioxide; Back trajectory analysis; Feasible directions; Formation mechanism; Gas-phase reactions; Heterogeneous reactions; Hydrolysis reaction; Real time measurements; Regional transport; Particle size analysis; ammonia; nitrate; sulfate; aerosol; ammonium; climate change; concentration (composition); emission control; nitrate; photochemistry; reaction kinetics; speciation (chemistry); sulfate; aerosol; air pollution control; Article; chemical composition; China; circadian rhythm; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; gas; humidity; hydrolysis; meteorology; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; temperature; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou; Varanidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101377077

The diagnostic consists of a pinhole camera fielded with the PILATUS3 photon-counting Si-based detector (≲100 kpixel). The detector has sensitivity in the range 1.6-30 keV and enables energy discrimination, providing a higher energy resolution than conventional systems with metal foils and diodes with adequate space and time resolution (≲1 cm and 2 ms). The lower-absorption cut-off energy is set independently on each one of the ∼100 kpixels, providing a unique opportunity to measure simultaneously the plasma emissivity in multiple energy ranges and deduce a variety of plasma parameters (e.g., Te, nZ, and ΔZeff). The energy dependence of each pixel is calibrated here over the range 3-22 keV. The detector is exposed to a variety of monochromatic sources - fluorescence emission from metallic targets - and for each pixel, the lower energy threshold is scanned to calibrate the energy dependence. The data are fit to a responsivity curve (""S-curve"") that determines the mapping between the possible detector settings and the energy response for each pixel. Here, the calibration is performed for three energy ranges: low (2.3-6 keV), medium (4.5-13.5 keV), and high (5.4-21 keV). We determine the achievable energy resolutions for the low, medium, and high energy ranges as 330 eV, 640 eV, and 950 eV, respectively.

The country has the most renewable electrical matrix in the world. Besides, it has one of largest installed capacities for harnessing energy from hydraulic power. This work aims to present a perspective of electric power generation in Brazil, pointing to the expected development of electricity generation in the regions, the cost of operation, CO2 emissions and the energy exchange between those regions for the extreme demand situations expected to occur in 2022 and 2031. The results for the future scenarios were obtained through simulation using the ANAREDE program. Operating cost and CO2 emissions were calculated based on referenced average indexes. The results indicate that for 2031 the active electric power generation tends to grow from 20.7 % to 25.9 %, whereas the active load will grow an average 24.7 %. The share of renewable energy in the generation of electricity tends to increase in 2022, between 86.6 % and 94.3 %, while for 2031, the trend is for stability, around 82.6 % and 84.7 %. The operating cost per MWh in the National Interconnected System (SIN) tends to decrease in the years studied. The CO2 emission rates obtained ranged from 82.6 Kg CO2 MWh-1 to 92 Kg CO2 MWh-1. The exchange of electricity between regions was similar to that found in recent years, except between the Southeast/Midwest and the Northeast. © 2003-2012 IEEE.","brazilian energy scenario; electricity; electricity sector; emissions; operating cost","Carbon dioxide; Hydroelectric power plants; Operating costs; Cost of operations; Electric energies; Electricity generation; Energy exchanges; Hydraulic power; Hydroelectric plant; Installed capacity; Renewable energies; Electric power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111053528

The present study aims to examine the effects of ocean acidification and warming on the shell morphological properties of two intertidal gastropod species, Nassarius nitidus and Columbella rustica. The experimental treatments lasted for 3 months and combined a temperature increase of 3°C and a pH reduction of 0.3 units. The selected treatments reflected the high emissions (RCP 8.5) “business as usual” scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change models for eastern Mediterranean. The morphological and architectural properties of the shell, such as density, thickness and porosity were examined using 3D micro-computed tomography, which is a technique giving the advantage of calculating values for the total shell (not only at specific points) and at the same time leaving the shells intact. Nassarius nitidus had a lower shell density and thickness and a higher porosity when the pH was reduced at ambient temperature, but the combination of reduced pH and increased temperature did not have a noticeable effect in comparison to the control. The shell of Columbella rustica was less dense, thinner and more porous under acidic and warm conditions, but when the temperature was increased under ambient pH the shells were thicker and denser than the control. Under low pH and ambient temperature, shells showed no differences compared to the control. The vulnerability of calcareous shells to ocean acidification and warming appears to be variable among species. Plasticity of shell building organisms as an acclimation action toward a continuously changing marine environment needs to be further investigated focusing on species or shell region specific adaptation mechanisms. © Copyright © 2021 Chatzinikolaou, Keklikoglou and Grigoriou.","climate change; gastropod; micro-CT; ocean acidification; shell density; shell porosity; shell thickness",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105972261

These forests are distributed over an extensive geographical range, spanning large areas of Africa, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific. TDFs occur in severe and extremely variable climate characterized by low annual rainfall and 5-6 months of the dry period within the annual cycle, and nutrient-poor soil. Due to extreme drought conditions, TDFs exhibit deciduousness and various other adaptative features (viz., fire resistance, desiccation tolerance, herbivore defence, high root:shoot ratio, longer seed viability) to establish in the severe environmental conditions, which makes these forests exceptionally critical. These forests are one of the most productive with high biodiversity, but unfortunately, due to persistent anthropogenic pressures in terms of burning, mining, indiscriminate forest cutting, lopping, and increased extraction of non-wood forest products, these forest communities have become one of the most endangered ecosystems. Disturbances in TDFs have resulted in fragmentation and ecosystem conversion, and therefore, these forests exhibit changes in their biomass and productivity. Anthropogenic pressure is rapidly becoming a growing concern globally due to its negative impacts on the structure and composition of the vegetation. In addition, due to their higher net primary productivity, these forests have a considerable effect on the global carbon cycle. Uncontrolled harvesting for gaining temporal benefits is a major cause of forest destruction and deforestation which may lead to major loss. Deforestation and clearing of forests have resulted in soil erosion, soil degradation and loss of biodiversity, socio-economic damages to food components, water and health, as well as the loss of people's cultural ethnicity. In order to assess the conservation status of TDFs, information is required on its distribution pattern, climate, structural and functional traits of the vegetation, phenology, strategies against drought, nutrient deficiency, and disturbances. This book discusses various issues, obstacles and opportunities for protection, regeneration and management of TDFs worldwide, as well as information gaps in the areas referred to above, which may be of critical significance in adapting and mitigating responses to the current climate change scenario. The book is intended to help in collection of detailed knowledge and to address the concerns from environmental scientists, forestry experts, planners, policymakers and the general public. Starting with a description of plant composition of worldwide TDFs, the book evaluates plant diversity, biomass dynamics, carbon storage, late history and current status of anthropogenic disturbances, distribution pattern of lichen communities, relevance of tree crown architecture, effects of forestry management practices, degradation and traditional land-use practices, impact of changing environment on carbon dynamics, estimating ecosystem services using a geospatial approach, productivity and carbon accumulation, habitat heterogeneity and its impact on organic matter, nutrient pool and nitrogen mineralization, phosphorus and litter decomposability traits. For re-development of TDFs, the book describes improved low-input tree establishment methods, impact of drought and plant mechanisms to mitigate drought stress, importance of serotiny related to delayed seed dispersal, and foraging efficiency of fine roots in relation to carbon dynamics in a changing environment. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Here we describe the identification and characterization of low CO2-responsive mutant 1 (lcr1) isolated from an N-nitroso-N-methylurea-(NMU) treated Setaria viridis mutant population. Forward genetic investigation revealed that the mutated gene Sevir.5G247800 of lcr1 possessed a single nucleotide transition from cytosine to thymine in a β-CA gene causing an amino acid change from leucine to phenylalanine. This resulted in severe reduction in growth and photosynthesis in the mutant. Both the CO2 compensation point and carbon isotope discrimination values of the mutant were significantly increased. Growth of the mutants was stunted when grown under ambient pCO2 but recovered at elevated pCO2. Further bioinformatics analyses revealed that the mutation has led to functional changes in one of the conserved residues of the protein, situated near the catalytic site. CA transcript accumulation in the mutant was 80% lower, CA protein accumulation 30% lower, and CA activity ∼98% lower compared with the wild type. Changes in the abundance of other primary C4 pathway enzymes were observed; accumulation of PEPC protein was significantly increased and accumulation of malate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme decreased. The reduction of CA protein activity and abundance in lcr1 restricts the supply of bicarbonate to PEPC, limiting C4 photosynthesis and growth. This study establishes Sevir.5G247800 as the major CA allele in Setaria for C4 photosynthesis and provides important insights into the function of CA in C4 photosynthesis that would be required to generate a rice plant with a functional C4 biochemical pathway. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

We considered assisted species migration (ASM) and hybridization as methods to conserve cold-adapted species (or the genes thereof) and to minimize the potential perturbation of ecosystems due to climate change. Assisted species migration is the deliberate movement of individuals from their current location to where the species’ ecological requirements will be matched under climate projections. Hybridization refers to crossbreeding of closely related species, where for arctic and alpine plants, 1 parent is the threatened cold-adapted and the other its reproductively compatible, warm-adapted sibling. Traditionally, hybridization is viewed as negative and leading to a loss of biodiversity, even though hybridization has increased biodiversity over geological times. Furthermore, the incorporation of warm-adapted genes into a hybrid may be the only means for the persistence of increasingly more maladapted, cold-adapted species. If approached with thorough consideration of fitness-related parameters of the source population and acknowledgement of the important role hybridization has played in shaping current biodiversity, ASM and hybridization could help save partial or whole genomes of key cold-adapted species at risk due to climate change with minimal negative effects on ecosystem functioning. © 2020 Society for Conservation Biology","alpine; alpino; altitud elevada; Arctic; calentamiento global; elevación alta; global warming; high altitude; high elevation; high latitude; latitud alta; tundra; tundra; Ártico","biodiversity; climate change; extinction risk; fitness; genome; hybridization; movement; persistence; risk assessment; Arctic; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; human; hybridization; Arctic Regions; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; Hybridization, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089855706

Here, we examined how dam properties control different facets of flow alteration across the coterminous United States (CONUS), and compared alteration trends between dam-affected and reference stream gages. We quantified departures from the natural flow regime using 730 stations with long-term daily discharge data. Dam size and purpose explained high variation in flow alteration, and alteration was particularly severe in water-stressed regions. Importantly, regulation of river flows by dams often dampened climate-driven alteration (48% of the flow metrics), particularly in watersheds with positive flow trends; while worsening climatic impacts in other cases (44%), or even having dual effects (8%). Our results show that dam and climate impacts on streamflow need to be assessed jointly, and based on a diverse range of flow regime facets (e.g., event magnitude and duration, frequency, and timing) instead of mean annual flows only. By pairing the USGS streamflow records available from upstream and downstream of 209 dams across the CONUS, we advance the notion that dams amplify flow alteration, but also ameliorate some flow alteration metrics. Understanding such potential and limitations is important in light of climate non-stationarity and a new wave of damming in developing economies, and will be key to further advancing environmental flow science into the future. © 2021.

That entails establishing new urban planning tools, especially at the local urban scale. At the root of harmful Climate Change, cities must exploit their full potential to set up mitigation strategies. The interest of Industrial Symbioses in optimizing the industrial metabolism led us to explore such a potential for the operational urban planning needs focused on reducing CO2 emissions. This article aims to study the performances of a Low Carbon Urban Symbiosis (LC-UrS) at Algiers local scale. Based on a systemic approach, the study defines, firstly, the concerned urban system. Secondly, it explores its perimeter's symbiotic potential to build a database allowing develop the possible symbiotic scenarios and quantify their performance in energy optimization and CO2 emissions reduction. The gains are then estimated for each scenario. An urban design strategy for the considered optimal scenario is proposed under an action plan for LC-UrS. The results bring interesting answers for energy optimization and CO2 emissions reduction, with estimated rates of 30.5% and 13.27% per year, in Algerian's capital city case. This optimizing potential will be even more significant for other cities in the world, particularly with the increase in urban waste.

In this context, from a hydrocarbon-contaminated soil, a newly bacterium designated LGMS7 was screened and identified, belonged to the Pseudomonas genus, and was closely related to Pseudomonas mucidolens, with a 16S rRNA sequence similarity of 99.05%. This strain was found to use different hydrocarbons and oils as a sole carbon and energy source for growth. It showed a stable emulsification index E24 (%) of 66.66% ± 3.46 when growing in mineral salts medium (MSM) supplemented with 2% (v/v) glycerol after incubation for 6 days at 30 °C. Interestingly, it was also able to reduce the surface tension of the cell-free supernatant to around 30 ± 0.65 mN m−1 with a critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 800 mg l−1. It was found to be able to produce around 1260 ± 0.57 mg l−1 as the yield of rhamnolipid production.

Until the beginning of 2020 we have lived in the belief that this urban model protected us. However, there were already many indications that the city was not capable of giving a satisfactory answer to the parameters of the 21st century, such as pollution, the heat island effect and the excessive consumption of energy and resources. Now, the coronavirus COVID-19, has put a stop to the city movement and with it, to the pollution it involves, revealing the level of contamination to which we were exposed. Therefore, it has become a priority to minimize energy consumption, energy dependence and pollution to improve the health and quality of life of its citizens. As answers to these demands, buildings with living organisms, such as microalgae, make the city a sustainable and Self-Sufficient environment.

This study evaluated CH4 emissions and surpluses of crude protein, using five simulated scenarios of supplementation in small-scale dairy systems (SSDS). In addition, two pasture managements (cut-and-carry versus grazing) and two varieties of legumes (red clover vs. white clover) were considered. The diets were tested considering similar milk yield and chemical composition; CH4 emission was estimated using Tier-2 methodology from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the data were analyzed in a completely randomized 5 × 2 × 2 factorial design. Differences (p &lt; 0.05) were found in predicted CH4 emissions per kg of milk produced (g kg−1 FCM 3.5%). The lowest predicted CH4 emissions were found for S3 and S4 as well as for pastures containing white clover. Lower dietary surpluses of CP (p &lt; 0.05) were observed for the control diet (1320 g CP/d), followed by S5 (1793 g CP/d), compared with S2 (2175 g CP/d), as well as in cut-and-carry management with red clover. A significant correlation (p &lt; 0.001) was observed between dry matter intake and CH4 emissions (g−1 and per kg of milk produced). It is concluded that the environmental impact of formulating diets from local inputs (S3 and S4) can be reduced by making them more efficient in terms of methane kg−1 of milk in SSDS. © 2021 by the authors.

In a microcosm experiment, the relative contribution of bacteria and fungi to N2O and carbon dioxide (CO2) production by four contrasting soils representing different land uses after KNO3 addition was studied. The soils were daily wetted to 80% water-filled pore space (WFPS) and kept under greenhouse conditions for 10 days. The fungicide cycloheximide and the bactericide streptomycin were used to determine the possible microbial origin of the N2O and CO2 emissions. Non-target effects of the antibiotics on the emission of N2O and CO2 were evaluated using the inhibitor additivity ratio (IAR). The abundance of the bacterial and fungal communities was estimated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, respectively. The gene copy number of bacterial denitrifiers was calculated after quantification of the nirK, nirS, norB, nosZI and nosZII genes. After 10 d, regardless of the soil type, the cumulative N2O emission from the soils treated with cycloheximide or streptomycin were similar. In all the four soils, N2O fluxes were greater (on average 1.8 ± 0.3 times) in soils amended with the fungicide than with the bactericide during incubation for the first 48–96 h. Greater N2O emissions (on average 1.7 ± 0.2 times) were detected in soils where bacteria were inhibited in comparison to those treated with the fungicide from 96 to 240 h. On average, 68.5% of the total CO2 emitted during the 10-d incubation period was produced in soils treated with the fungicide and 31.5% in those treated with the bactericide. The greater contribution of bacteria to the production of N2O than fungi during the first 48–96 h was possibly due to a faster used of nitrate. Variations in the abundance of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, the ITS region, and the nirK, nirS, norB and nosZI bacterial denitrification genes indicated that the antibiotics used to prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi were effective during incubation. These results suggest that both bacteria and fungi should be considered when designing and applying greenhouse gas mitigation strategies in soils and that their relative contribution to produce N2O and CO2 can vary with time and nitrate availability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Antibiotics; Bacteria; Fungi; Nitrogen fertilisation; Nitrous oxide; qPCR","Antibiotics; Bacteria; Bactericides; Carbon dioxide; Denitrification; Fungi; Fungicides; Genes; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Polymerase chain reaction; Potash; Potassium Nitrate; RNA; Greenhouse conditions; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Growth of bacteria; Internal transcribed spacers; Microcosm experiments; Nitrous oxide emissions; Relative contribution; Water-filled pore space; Soils; bacterium; denitrification; fungus; land use; nitrate; nitrous oxide; soil chemistry; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101919255

Here, Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer models were used to evaluate climatic change effects and mitigation strategies on maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] yields in soils of the subtropical and semi-arid region of Chaco. Simulations were performed for the DK747 and A8000 genotypes, calibrated for the CERES-Maize model in a previous report and for the CROPGRO-Soybean model in the present study, respectively. Both crops markedly differ in their response to climatic change and putative levels of atmospheric CO2 concentration. The observed significant reductions in maize yields in future climate scenarios (5–42% compared with the baseline, 1986–2010) were more associated with increased temperatures that shortened the crop cycle than with water stress. Delaying the sowing date is a feasible strategy to mitigate this effect. Projected temperature increases are expected to play a secondary role in determining soybean yields. Instead, water stress will continue to be an important constraint to soybean yield in the context of global warming, but this effect is strongly affected by rainfall regimes. Responses to raising CO2 levels were more pronounced in soybean (+10–40%) than in maize (+2–4%). Soil degradation exacerbated the negative effects of global warming on crop yields, especially on maize, which highlights the importance of soil conservation practices. The observed high interannual climatic variability and the different sensitivities of maize and soybean to climatic variables indicate that crop diversification would be the key to improve the resilience of the agrosystems under the future scenarios. © 2020 The Authors.

Spectral NDVI data not only capture the environmental impact on vegetation directly, but also can expose it spread all over a region at the same time. As support of an early warning system and decision-making for agriculture, the impact of ENSO on corn and soybean yields anomaly (YA) was analyzed between 2000 and 2017, by using different indicators: SOI, MEI and ONI over the 12 major production departments of Córdoba. Also, NDVI-MODIS data was assessed all over Río Segundo (RS) territory in the center of Córdoba as a vegetation proxy to depict the agricultural activity in a broad sense. To check signal persistency, the relationship was assessed first using the indicators from July to October prior to the sowing date; and then once the growing season has finished, to show the effective ENSO impact on crops productivity. Persistence of ENSO signal was verified, so that the ENSO influence during the growing season quantified remains or intensifies when is compared to information in advance to the start of crop season. While for SOIGS and MEIGS the correlation with corn yield is significant (p &lt; 0.05) in all Córdoba departments, it is always a little lower for ONIGS. Instead, for soybean only 4 departments show significant relationships when using ONIGS, 5 in the case of MEIGS and it increases to 6 when using SOIGS. The particular response of NDVI anomaly (AND) to ENSO was located and quantified for different indices and periods during the crop season. A consistent relationship was found between ENSO and the NDVI as an indicator of agricultural activity in RS territory but, in any case, the area fraction with a significant condition is quite small. The relationship with NDVI is stronger for SOI particularly when a more extended period is considered that include NDVI data of April and May, at the end of the rainy season. While before the beginning of the growing season SOIA-S and SOIS-O reach a significant relationship with the NDVI accumulated since November to May in 11% and 10% of Río Segundo territory, respectively, the percentage increases to 19% when SOIGS is used. Finally, all this information was integrated in an unsupervised cartographic scheme that recognizes different responses of crops yield and NDVI to ENSO in the RS territory. Multiple regression models for corn and soybean yield prediction were developed from NDVI and ENSO indicators for each one of the identified productive sectors. Crops yield can be estimated before harvest with good accuracy, making use of the maximum NDVI value and SOI, both before (SOIA-S) and during the growing season (SOIA-S-O-N-D). As NDVI data capture the ENSO influence on agriculture as well as over crop productivity, its incorporation into a climate monitoring protocol must conforms the basis of an early warning system for a sustainable agriculture in the region. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Corn; MEI; ONI; SOI; Soybean",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101315518

However, the association between building morphology and urban environments across different scales and seasons remains understudied. This study investigated the effect of 2D/3D building morphology on seasonal urban climate and air quality in the residential areas (with radii of ≤200 m), blocks (= 500 m), and communities (= 1000 m) around the observation stations in Beijing, using correlation and regression analysis. Results showed that the associations between building morphology and urban environments were highly scale- and season-dependent, with the 3D indicators showing stronger associations with urban environments than the 2D indicators. The correlation between building morphology and air temperature was significant at all seasons, and became stronger as the scales increased. Significant correlation was mainly found on 500- and 1000-m scales for wind velocity, and the degree was the weakest in summer. Relative humidity was largely affected by building morphology in autumn and winter, especially on small scales. Building volume density had the greatest impact on air temperature, and could explain more than 60% of its variance; building height density exerted the strongest influence on wind speed, and a 10% increase in it reduced wind speed by 1.8 m/s. Building height range and density were closely related to PM2.5 concentrations in spring and autumn due to local air pollutants emissions from buildings. To reduce building density with increased height and restrict building height range should be considered for urban planning in Beijing. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Building morphology; Microclimate; Multiple scales; Seasonality; Urban planning","Air quality; Atmospheric temperature; Morphology; Quality control; Urban planning; Wind; Building densities; Building morphology; Correlation and regression analysis; Metropolitan regions; Multi scale analysis; PM2.5 concentration; Residential areas; Urban environments; Buildings; air quality; air temperature; microclimate; relative humidity; seasonality; urban area; urban planning; wind velocity; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099859571

In particular, for the species of the Diagonal of Open Formations (DOF), the compartmentalization of the Central Brazilian Plateau (CBP) during the Tertiary and climatic oscillations during the Quaternary have often been invoked to explain the origin and current patterns of biodiversity. We investigated how landscape changes and climatic oscillations shaped the distribution and diversification history of a widespread South American treefrog. Location: South American Diagonal of Open Formations (DOF) including Caatinga, Cerrado, and Chaco biomes. Taxon: Treefrog Boana raniceps. Methods: We used a multi-locus dataset from 288 individual frogs collected at 115 localities throughout most of the species’ distribution. We used population assignment analysis, species distribution models, historical demography models, approximate Bayesian computation and landscape genetic analyses to test alternative hypotheses of diversification. Results: We found two genetic lineages that diverged during the mid-Pleistocene with continued gene flow. Approximate Bayesian computation supported a scenario of isolation with migration until the Last Glacial Maximum, followed by more recent population expansion in north-eastern Brazil and stability at the southwest in South America. Isolation by environment was the best predictor of genetic distance between populations, which is in accordance with their different environmental niches. As Boana raniceps is a lowland species, steep slopes in the CBP likely restrained gene flow enough to sustain population divergence. We found evidence for major range contraction during the Last Glacial Maximum, raising the possibility of synergic action of climate change and the CBP compartmentalization in regulating migration. Main conclusions: Our findings highlight how landscape and climatic changes can shape the diversification of DOF biota. Past climatic fluctuations and environmental resistance due to topography acted in concert, forming a semipermeable barrier to gene flow, promoting intraspecific differentiation in a continentally distributed species. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Anura; approximate Bayesian computation; Boana raniceps; isolation by environment; landscape genetics; lowland species; Quaternary climatic fluctuation; riverine effects; South America; topography","climate change; demography; divergence; evolutionary biology; frog; gene flow; genetic differentiation; intraspecific variation; landscape change; Last Glacial; Last Glacial Maximum; Neotropical Region; Quaternary; Tertiary; Brazil; Chaco; Plateau [Nigeria]; Raniceps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097548766

Conservation strategies to reverse these trends are imperative, especially in tropical developing countries, which almost invariably allocate insufficient levels of investment for environmental protection. Here, we compared the effectiveness of sustainable-use Protected Areas (PAs) and Community-based Conservation (CBC) arrangements for the conservation of migratory waterbirds that breed on seasonal riverine sandy beaches in Brazilian Amazonia. We modeled local population responses of four migratory waterbird species on 155 beaches along a ~1,600 km section of a major tributary of the Amazon, as a function of community enforcement, official protection status, human pressure and landscape features. We show that 21 community-protected beaches within the study area host more than 80% of all sampled birds. Black Skimmers showed the most dramatic response, with breeding numbers 135-fold larger in CBC arrangements compared to beaches with no official protection status. The same pattern was observed for nesting Large-Billed and Yellow-Billed Terns. For the Near Threatened Orinoco Goose, PA status was the strongest predictor of local population size. These dramatic results demonstrate the value of protected refugia, achieved through the concerted action of participating local communities, to support breeding populations of key waterbird species. This highlyeffective and low-cost conservation model can potentially be replicated in other regions of the developing world experiencing increasingly intensive exploitation of riverine natural resources.

However, we still lack: (i) robust quantifications of long-term growth changes during aridification processes, (ii) links between growth decline, changes in forest cover, stand structure and soil conditions, and (iii) forecasts of growth variability to projected climate warming. We investigated tree-ring records over the past 400–700 years, quantified changes in grazing area and forest cover during the 20th century, sampled current stand structure, and analyzed soil organic carbon δ13C and total nitrogen δ15N of Atlas cedar (Cedrus atlantica (Endl.) Manetti ex Carrière) Moroccan forests to characterize their dieback. Atlas cedar forests experienced massive dieback after the 1970s, particularly in the xeric High Atlas region. Forest cover increased in the less xeric regions (Middle Atlas and Rif) by almost 20%, while it decreased about 18% in the High Atlas, where soil δ13C and δ15N showed evidences of grazing. Growth declined and became more variable in response to recent droughts. The relative growth reduction (54%) was higher in the Middle Atlas than elsewhere (Rif, 32%; High Atlas, 36%). Growth synchrony between forests located within the Middle and High Atlas regions increased after the 1970s. Simulations based on a worst-case emission scenario and rapid warming forecast a stronger limitation of growth by low soil moisture in all regions, but particularly in the Middle Atlas and after the mid-21st century. Climate warming is expected to strengthen growth synchronization preceding dieback of conifer forests in xeric regions. The likelihood of similar dieback episodes is further exacerbated by historical degradation of these forests. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cedrus atlantica; Dendroecology; Early-warning signals; Forest dieback; Growth synchrony; Process-based model","Climate change; Drought; Forestry; Land use; Organic carbon; Soil moisture; Conifer forests; Emission scenario; Growth reduction; Long-term growths; Soil conditions; Soil organic carbon; Stand structures; Tree ring records; Forecasting; nitrogen; nitrogen 13; organic carbon; carbon; climate change; coniferous forest; dendroecology; dieback; drought; early warning system; grazing; growth response; tree ring; Article; Cedrus; Cedrus atlantica; climate warming; degradation; dendrochronology; dieback disease; drought; forecasting; forest; growth; land use; nonhuman; priority journal; animal; climate change; goat; soil; tree; Atlas Mountains; High Atlas; Middle Atlas; Morocco; Cedrus atlantica; Coniferophyta; Animals; Carbon; Climate Change; Droughts; Forests; Goats; Soil; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092772328

Integrating TEK with scientific knowledge has become particularly important in sectors such as agriculture, which both contributes to and is affected by climate change. While there is a general recognition that integrating TEK will contribute to climate change adaptation, agricultural interventions have made little progress in achieving this due to the assumption of a clear divide between TEK and scientific knowledge. This paper considers that knowledge integration is already occurring, but in contexts of economic, sociocultural, and political inequalities. We elaborate on the case of traditional weather forecasting methods used by Mayan indigenous farmers in Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula to propose a social justice perspective for knowledge integration in climate change interventions. Using information from three studies conducted between 2016 and 2019, we first explain the importance of weather and traditional weather forecast methods for indigenous Mayan farmers. Later we describe in detail both these methods and their links with Mayan cosmology. Findings show how weather phenomena such as drought and hurricanes are main concerns for milpa farming. They illustrate the diversity of traditional short, medium, and long-term weather forecast methods based on observations from nature and the sky. Farmers also perform rituals that are related to their Mayan gods and goddess. As TEK not only defines agricultural calendars but also reproduces Mayan culture, we discuss what is needed for its integration into actions combating climate change. We use a rights-based approach that considers the economic, cultural, and political scales of justice to equally allocate resources and benefits for traditional knowledge systems, recognize indigenous values and worldviews avoiding cultural harms, and accomplish indigenous self-determination through equal representation. As a result, we hope to incentivize development actors engaged in agricultural interventions on climate change to critically reflect and examine power dynamics and relations when working with indigenous communities. © Copyright © 2021 Camacho-Villa, Martinez-Cruz, Ramírez-López, Hoil-Tzuc and Terán-Contreras.","climate change; Mayan rain cosmology; milpa; social justice; traditional ecological knowledge; traditional weather forecasting; Yucatán Peninsula",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104632776

In healthy individuals with no underlying co-morbid conditions, there is an efficient heat regulation system which enables the body to effectively handle thermal stress. However, in vulnerable groups, especially in elderly over the age of 65 years, infants and individuals with co-morbid cardiovascular and/or respiratory conditions, there is a deficiency in thermoregulation. When temperatures exceed a certain limit, being cold winter spells or heat waves, there is an increase in the number of deaths. In particular, it has been shown that at temperatures above 27 °C, the daily mortality rate increases more rapidly per degree rise compared to when it drops below 27 °C. This is especially of relevance with the current emergency of global warming. Besides the direct effect of temperature rises on human health, global warming will have a negative impact on primary producers and livestock, leading to malnutrition, which will in turn lead to a myriad of health related issues. This is further exacerbated by environmental pollution. Public health measures that countries should follow should include not only health-related information strategies aiming to reduce the exposure to heat for vulnerable individuals and the community, but improved urban planning and reduction in energy consumption, among many others. This will reduce the carbon footprint and help avert global warming, thus reducing mortality. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,"Article; carbon footprint; city planning; comorbidity; demography; energy consumption; environmental temperature; greenhouse effect; heat wave; human; malnutrition; mortality; mortality rate; pollution; temperature stress; thermoregulation; practice guideline",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093672356

This paper focuses on creating comprehensive decarbonization scenarios for the island systems, using EnergyPLAN software. The island of Sardinia, Italy, was selected as a case study. The presented method uses scenario approach and seeks to push the boundary of the island energy system and use the locally available resources to partially supply the maritime transport connecting the island to the mainland. The reference model was validated using the data provided by EDGAR and IEA for 2017. The Business as Usual Scenario and High Renewable Scenario by 2030 and 2050 were modelled. The latter considers the conversion of the Sardinia energy system into a smart, highly efficient and integrated system. For the power system, improvements are made by the installation of small decentralized renewable systems, mainly including photovoltaic and wind technologies, and increase of storage technologies use. Thermal demand is reduced by building energy refurbishment actions, including the envelope insulation and use of heat pumps. For the transport sector, raise of the share of electrical vehicles is expected, as well as the possibility to introduce biofuels in both maritime and road transport sectors. Results clearly show that carbon neutrality by 2050 is a reasonable target in different decarbonization scenarios. The study also provides useful suggestions to be implemented in order to achieve this goal. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Decarbonization; RES integration; Smart islands; Sustainable islands","Digital storage; Thermal insulation; Decarbonisation; Energy; Energy systems; Government IS; Maritime transport; RES integration; Sardinia; Smart island; Sustainable island; System boundary; Decarbonization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102123464

Climate change can affect hydropower generation through changes in the timing and magnitude of precipitation, rising temperatures, and glacier mass changes. Evaluating climate impacts on hydropower generally requires detailed local input data and hydrological models, which may not be available in many developing nations. Nevertheless, the need to understand the impacts is essential for the developing world. Here we present a modeling framework that relies on remotely sensed and global gridded datasets forced by an ensemble of 21 general circulation models (GCMs) under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) to evaluate climate-induced impacts on hydropower through the 21st century. We include 134 hydropower plants (>100 MW), representing 42% of hydropower installed capacity in South America, across five regions of Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. Our results suggest the median monthly usable capacity would increase for Colombia (+2.6% to +8.4% for RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively) and Peru (+6.7% to +9.3% for RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively) by 2100 relative to the late 20th century. For Brazil, we observe a mix of reductions and increases in usable capacity. While our results suggest potential reductions for the dry season usable capacity in the Parana, Paraguay, and Southeast Atlantic regions of Brazil, we also observe slight increases in usable capacity during the rainy months for all its regions. These results can help inform future planning decisions and potential interconnections between the three countries. Additionally, the proposed framework can contribute to an increased capability to evaluate climate-induced risks to power systems in developing countries, where data and computation resources can be limited. © 2021 The Authors","Climate change; Emerging economies; Hydropower; Vulnerability; Water availability","Climate models; Developing countries; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Computation resources; Developing nations; General circulation model; Hydro-power generation; Hydrological models; Installed capacity; Potential reduction; Rising temperatures; Climate change; climate change; economic development; hydroelectric power; power generation; power plant; vulnerability; water availability; Brazil; Colombia; Peru",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102401483

Here, using 10 years (2008–2017) of farm data from 558 farmers distributed across the major robusta coffee-producing provinces in Vietnam, we analysed coffee farmers’ perceptions on drought and its impacts; we then quantified the impacts of drought on yield and farm profit, and finally, assessed the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. While drought reduced robusta coffee yield by 6.5% on average across all provinces, the impacts on gross margins were noticeable, with an average 22% decline from levels achieved in average-rainfall-condition years. Yield reductions from drought were consistent with farmers’ perceptions, being on average − 9.6%. With irrigation being typical in coffee farming in Vietnam, the majority of surveyed farmers (58%) adopted mulching in drought years and had a 10.2% increase in economic benefits compared to their counterparts who did not. Furthermore, the chances of adopting mulching as an adaptation strategy decreased generally for every one unit increase in perceived drought impact or when shifting from surface water to groundwater in drought years. Although coffee farming remained profitable in drought years, our findings have potential relevance for the design of policies to address drought risks and encourage more resilient adaptation strategies for Vietnam and other coffee-producing countries experiencing similar climatic conditions. © 2021 The Author(s)","Coffee; Drought adaptation strategy; Irrigation; Sustainable agriculture; Weather extremes","alternative agriculture; climate change; climate effect; coffee; crop yield; drought; extreme event; irrigation; perception; profitability; Viet Nam; Coffea canephora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105743509

Here, we propose a climatic definition for this limit, the ‘grassline’, in analogy to the treeline, which is based on the growing season length and the soil temperature. Eighty-seven mountain summits across ten European mountain ranges, covering three biomes (boreal, temperate, Mediterranean), were inventoried as part of the GLORIA project. Vascular plant cover was estimated visually in 326 plots of 1 × 1 m. Soil temperatures were measured in situ for 2–7 years, from which the length of the growing season and mean temperature were derived. The climatic conditions corresponding to 40% plant cover were defined as the thresholds for alpine grassland. Closed vegetation was present in locations with a mean growing season soil temperature warmer than 4.9 °C, or a minimal growing season length of 85 days, with the growing season defined as encompassing days with daily mean ≥ 1 °C. Hence, the upper limit of closed grasslands was associated with a mean soil temperature close to that previously observed at the treeline, and in accordance with physiological thresholds to growth in vascular plants. In contrast to trees, whose canopy temperature is coupled with air temperature, small-stature alpine plants benefit from the soil warmed by solar radiation and consequently, they can grow at higher elevations. Since substrate stability is necessary for grasslands to occur at their climatic limit, the grassline rarely appears as a distinct linear feature. © 2021, The Author(s).","Alpine life zone; GLORIA; Growing season; Plant–Climate interactions; Soil temperature; Vascular plants","alpine environment; climate conditions; grassland; grassland soil; growing season; mountain environment; mountain region; soil temperature; threshold; vascular plant; Europe; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102188761

The Amazon rainforest accounts for approximately a quarter of global emissions from land use change, due in part to its' immense size, carbon storage, and recent history of land use change. Large area estimates of carbon exchange in forests are highly uncertain, however, which reflects the pervasive challenges in estimating carbon flux parameters, such as disturbance area and forest carbon pools. In this study, we use a new dataset with characterized uncertainty on deforestation, degradation, and natural disturbances in the Amazon Ecoregion to estimate carbon loss from disturbance and removals from regeneration at biennial intervals from 1996 to 2017. Using the gain-loss approach to estimating carbon flux in a Monte Carlo analysis we found that carbon loss from degradation and deforestation averaged 0.23 (±0.09) Pg C biennium−1 and 0.34 (±0.16) Pg C biennium−1, respectively. While deforestation contributed the most to carbon loss overall, there were two biennial periods in which degradation and natural disturbance resulted in more carbon loss. Regeneration partially offset these emissions, but our results show that loss is occurring much more rapidly than removal, resulting in a total net carbon loss of 4.86 to 5.32 Pg C over the study period. With the compounding effect of drought and fires in addition to continued deforestation it appears certain that forest disturbance in the Amazon will continue to be a significant factor in the terrestrial carbon cycle. © 2020","Amazon; Carbon cycle; Deforestation; Forest degradation; Tropical ecology","Deforestation; Land use; Uncertainty analysis; Amazon rain forest; Forest carbon fluxes; Forest degradation; Forest disturbances; Monte carlo analysis; Natural disturbance; Photosynthetic activity; Terrestrial carbon cycle; Reforestation; carbon dioxide; carbon; carbon flux; carbon storage; deforestation; environmental disturbance; forest ecosystem; land use change; rainforest; regeneration; tropical forest; Article; biodegradation; biomass; carbon cycle; carbon loss; carbon storage; controlled study; deforestation; ecosystem regeneration; Monte Carlo method; photosynthesis; priority journal; probability; probability density function; uncertainty; United States; carbon cycle; environmental protection; forest; rain forest; Amazonia; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forests; Rainforest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094866646

Data from experimental anaerobic digestion (AD) of vinasse were applied to support the analysis. Based on previous experiments, this assessment assumed that vinasse production could reach 2.38 × 107 m3/year generating around 66,585 MWh/year of electric energy from biogas burning in the Administrative Region of Campinas (ARC). This amount of energy could supply more than 103,000 inhabitants and avoid 35,892 tCO2eq/year (from electric energy replacement). The biodigested vinasse might also reduce the total N, P, and K mineral fertilizers demand per hectare of sugarcane crop in 30%, 1%, and 46%, respectively, avoiding additional greenhouse gas emissions of 111,877 tCO2eq/year. There is no biodigested vinasse surplus for a moderate fertigation rate of 100 m3/ha, complying with local environmental laws related to nutrients excess side effects in areas destined to sugarcane crop. Notwithstanding, a Geographic Information System analysis for a small adjacent area to ARC indicated nine different fertigation rates, ranging from 50 to 100 m3/ha. Even though the general analysis for ARC shows high NPK replacement levels, the fertigation practices should be subsidized for robust soil analysis and adequate to safe environmental levels. A management tool can be designed using the results here presented to subsidize investments for AD widespread adoption by the sugarcane industry to catch a reasonable practice from the economic and environmental perspectives. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biofertilizer; Biogas; Environmental conservation; GHG mitigation; Renewable energy","Crops; Environmental regulations; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Electric energies; Environmental law; Environmental levels; Management tool; Mineral fertilizers; Replacement level; Spatially explicit assessments; Sugarcane crops; Anaerobic digestion; biogas; nitrogen; organic fertilizer; phosphorus; potassium; biofuel; fertilizer; alternative energy; biofertilizer; biogas; conservation; crop residue; electricity generation; GIS; greenhouse gas; spatial analysis; sugar cane; anaerobic digestion; Article; carbon footprint; energy resource; fertigation; fertilizer application; financial management; nonhuman; priority journal; soil analysis; soil management; sugarcane; vinasse; soil; sugarcane; Brazil; Campinas; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Biofuels; Fertilizers; Saccharum; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092782007

As these grasslands have been used as rangelands for centuries, human management (grazing; fire regimes) is one of their main ecological and evolutionary drivers, along with the Mediterranean climate. Despite EU conservation policy, damage to such grasslands still occurs and efficient ecological restoration is needed. This article reviews restoration constraints, effective techniques, and research perspectives for restoring them in the light of their ecological characteristics. Major restoration constraints specifically include (1) a poor contribution of the internal (seed bank) and external (seed rain) species pools, and (2) low establishment of some perennial species. The latter may be the result of the low seed quantity or quality of perennial species, stochastic or extended droughts, high soil nutrient content that may lead to competition (e.g. between weed and target species), inappropriate grazing management or fire regimes leading to shrub encroachment, or the death of target species seedlings in early stages of restoration. Successful restoration techniques include seeding, transplanting, hay transfer, and timely soil transfer, all of which have to be adapted to regional plant phenology and to local Mediterranean climate. They must be combined with appropriate grazing or fire management. Their success may depend on years with particular rainfall amounts or patterns or on particular target plant species. We discuss research perspectives contributing to a better understanding of seed dispersal, seedling recruitment, and soil processes and suggest the benefits of using ecosystem engineer species. © 2020 Society for Ecological Restoration","drought; grazing and fire management; local adaptation; Natura 2000 habitat #6220; rangeland; seed bank; seedling recruitment; species pool","climate effect; conservation management; drought; European Union; fire management; grassland; grazing management; human activity; local adaptation; rangeland; recruitment (population dynamics); seed bank; species conservation; species pool; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea (Northwest)",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092769707

Herein, we developed a time-dependent continuum model of pulsed CO2 electrolysis on Cu in 0.1 M CsHCO3 that faithfully represents the experimentally observed effects of pulsed electrolysis. This work shows that pulsing results in dynamic changes in the pH and CO2 concentration near the Cu surface, which lead to an enhanced C2+ FE as a consequence of repeatedly accessing a transient state of heightened pH and CO2 concentration at high cathodic overpotential.

The aim of this study was to determine the expression and localization of key enzymes of the different pathways leading to synthesis of prostaglandin E2 and F2α in the equine conceptus during the mobility phase. Enzyme expression was analyzed via quantitative RT‐PCR in total RNA samples of equine conceptuses collected on days 10 (n = 5), 12 (n = 12), 14 (n = 5) and 16 (n = 7) from healthy mares. Relative abundance of cyclooxygenase (COX)‐2 mRNA was higher (p < 0.05) than of COX‐1 irrespective of conceptus age and for phospholipase A2 on day 16 in comparison to all other days (p < 0.01). Abundance of mRNA of cytosolic and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (PGES) and of carbonyl reductase (CBR) 1 was not influenced by conceptus age. Immunohistochemically, COX‐1, COX‐2, as well as cytosolic and microsomal PGES were present in both the ectodermal and endodermal layer of the yolk sac wall. CBR‐1 was restricted to periembryonic disc area. The localisation of the key enzymes explains the mechanism of embryo mobility. In vitro incubation of primary trophoblast cell cultures with oxytocin had no effect on key enzyme synthesis. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we estimate that organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were buried at rates averaging 21 (6), 1.7 (0:3) and 1.4 (0:3) gm2 yr1, respectively, during the previous century in three contrasting HTF systems, one in Brazil (eutrophic) and two in Australia (oligotrophic). Although these rates are lower than those from nearby mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass systems, the importance of HTFs as sinks for OC, TN and TP may be significant given their extensive coverage. Despite the measured short-Term variability between net air saltpan CO2 influx and emission estimates found during the dry and wet season in the Brazilian HTF, the only site with seasonal CO2 flux measurements, the OC sedimentary profiles over several decades suggest efficient OC burial at all sites. Indeed, the stable isotopes of OC and TN (13C and 15N) along with C V N ratios show that microphytobenthos are the major source of the buried OC in these HTFs. Our findings highlight a previously unquantified carbon as well as a nutrient sink and suggest that coastal HTF ecosystems could be included in the emerging blue carbon framework. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

In order to make reasoned decisions to adapt to climate change managers require knowledge of the role of temperature and precipitation in SWE development and data to distinguish the relative retention response of snowpack regions to expected temperature and precipitation regime shifts at the watershed scale. Using the Daymet interpolated 1 km2 dataset, effects of elevation, temperature (Tmax, Tmin and Tavg) and precipitation on April 1 SWE in the Crown of the Continent were tested by linear regression and Kendall correlation. Changes in Daymet estimated snow water equivalent (SWE) in response to increased temperatures and changes in precipitation were estimated in two ways: 1) comparing April 1SWE in the 11 warmest (mean Tmax February) and driest (mean precipitation January to March) years with the 22 cooler/wetter years 1981- 2013 and 2) SWE retention from April 1 to June 1 over the period 1980 to 2013 across 120 watersheds in a major continental headwater region, the Crown of the Continent of North America. Historical analysis of period warm year April 1 SWE was assumed to indicate the recent impact of warmer winter temperatures. Changes in snowpack April 1 to June 1 reflected likely effects on peak runoff and were, therefore, also relevant for future climate change adaptation considerations. Winter (JFM) precipitation proved more influential than temperature in shaping April 1 SWE response at the regional scale. Of the three factors, elevation was most positively associated with April 1 SWE at the watershed scale. Temperature and precipitation influenced SWE accumulation and persistence at the watershed scale, but higher precipitation was more closely associated with higher April 1 SWE retention. Ranking of watershed snowpack retention in warm and dry years, combined with spring snowpack retention offers data to assist identification of watersheds with greatest snowpack persistence in the face of anticipated climate change effects. © 2021 Len Broberg.

Yet its net effects on mobility-related CO2 emissions are complex and under-researched. Here we collected travel activity data in seven European cities and derived life cycle CO2 emissions across modes and purposes. Daily mobility-related life cycle CO2 emissions were 3.2 kgCO2 per person, with car travel contributing 70% and cycling 1%. Cyclists had 84% lower life cycle CO2 emissions than non-cyclists. Life cycle CO2 emissions decreased by −14% per additional cycling trip and decreased by −62% for each avoided car trip.

Paul Valéry, Montpellier, France","Questions: Studies in functional biogeography have mostly focused on unmanaged ecosystems, and neglected testing how management intensity affects community-level response of plant traits to bioclimatic gradients. We hypothesize that trait–climate relationships for arable weeds spontaneously establishing in croplands subject to intensive management should differ from the relationships characterizing less intensively managed grassland ecosystems. Location: France. Methods: We computed community-weighted means (CWM) and variances (CWV) of 954 and 5,619 cropland and grassland plant assemblages, respectively, for three fundamental leaf traits (specific leaf area, SLA; leaf dry matter content, LDMC; leaf nitrogen content, LNC). Based on growing season length accounting for both temperature and soil water limitations (GSLtw), we compared trait–climate relationships between herbicide-free croplands and grasslands, and between herbicide-free and herbicide-sprayed cropland assemblages. The contribution of beta-diversity to the trait–climate relationships was then evaluated using multiple regression on distance matrices. Results: Distinct trait–climate relationships characterized herbicide-free cropland and grassland plant assemblages. CWM of all traits showed weaker relations with GSLtw in cropland relative to grassland assemblages. CWV of LDMC and LNC responded more sharply in croplands. Furthermore, no herbicide effect on trait–climate relationships was detected within cropland assemblages. These results seem to be explained by a greater taxonomic beta-diversity along the GSLtw gradient for grasslands. Conclusions: Specific trait–environment relationships characterize croplands, underlining that management intensity greatly affects trait–climate relationships for plant assemblages. Deciphering the interplay between land use intensification and climate is critical to accurately forecast functional vegetation changes in response to global changes, and hence to foster actions enhancing ecosystem resilience. © 2021 International Association for Vegetation Science","Agroecosystems; arable weeds; croplands; environmental filtering; functional biogeography; grasslands; leaf traits; management intensification; plant assemblages; trait-environment relationships","anthropogenic effect; bioclimatology; biogeography; environmental management; global change; land use change; seaweed culture; soil water; weed; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105093309

Yet, these assumptions are violated for most broadly distributed species. Here, we incorporate genetic data from the widespread riparian tree species narrowleaf cottonwood (Populus angustifolia) to examine whether including intraspecific genetic variation can alter model performance and predictions of climate change impacts. We found that (1) P. angustifolia is differentiated into six genetic groups across its range from México to Canada and (2) different populations occupy distinct climate niches representing unique ecotypes. Comparing model discriminatory power, (3) all genetically informed ecological niche models (gENMs) outperformed the standard species-level ENM (3–14% increase in AUC; 1–23% increase in pROC). Furthermore, (4) gENMs predicted large differences among ecotypes in both the direction and magnitude of responses to climate change and (5) revealed evidence of niche divergence, particularly for the Eastern Rocky Mountain ecotype. (6) Models also predicted progressively increasing fragmentation and decreasing overlap between ecotypes. Contact zones are often hotspots of diversity that are critical for supporting species' capacity to respond to present and future climate change, thus predicted reductions in connectivity among ecotypes is of conservation concern. We further examined the generality of our findings by comparing our model developed for a higher elevation Rocky Mountain species with a related desert riparian cottonwood, P. fremontii. Together our results suggest that incorporating intraspecific genetic information can improve model performance by addressing this important source of variance. gENMs bring an evolutionary perspective to niche modeling and provide a truly “adaptive management” approach to support conservation genetic management of species facing global change. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America","climate change; ecological niche modeling; evolutionarily significant units; landscape genetics; narrowleaf cottonwood; niche conservatism; niche divergence; Populus angustifolia; species distribution modeling","climate change; forecasting method; genetic variation; global change; intraspecific interaction; niche; numerical model; Canada; Populus angustifolia; adaptation; Canada; climate change; ecosystem; human; Mexico; Adaptation, Physiological; Canada; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Humans; Mexico",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100090556

Together, they cover approximately 16% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Although more than two‐thirds of global GHG emissions are related to household consumption, approaches that directly target households, such as personal carbon trading (PCT), do not play a role in the fight against climate change. This is especially puzzling as measures taken so far are not sufficient to reach the 2 °C target. One clue to solving this puzzle comes from political science in the form of the multiple streams approach, which defines criteria that a policy proposal must meet to become part of the political agenda. Based on these criteria, this article conducts a systematic review on PCT to clarify why PCT does not play a role in the reduction of GHG emissions. The results show that there are three main problems with the PCT proposal. First, scholars often criticize the set‐up costs as well as the running costs of such a system. Second, there is no clear consensus within the research community on public acceptance of PCT. Third, it is still unclear whether politicians are receptive to PCT or not. © 2021 by the author.

It crops out extensively in Southern Italy, across Neogene basins located on the Tyrrhenian and Ionian margins of northern Calabria, where it was studied through a detailed facies and stratigraphic analysis that revealed the presence of a continental/shallow-marine to slope system, active during the onset of the Messinian Salinity Crisis. During the Calcare di Base deposition, an arid climate regime with intermittent humid phases occurred with a precession forced cyclicity, facing an overall generally cold climatic period. During arid periods, stressed environmental conditions permitted the establishment of widespread microbial-mediated carbonate production, frequently associated with evaporitic (gypsum-dominated) deposition, along a sabkha-type environment with extensive salinas and hypersaline coastal lagoons grading seaward into a carbonate/evaporite shallow-marine shelf. This is testified to by microbial boundstones and dissolution breccias commonly associated with nodular gypsum and arenites affected by desiccation, typically forming metre-scale shallowing-upward peritidal cycles. Seaward, gravity flow deposits are interpreted as re-sedimented shelf limestones, defining a slope apron. Mixed carbonate/evaporite megabreccias and disorganized floatbreccias were deposited along the upper slope, whereas soft deformation with slides, slumps and channelized turbidites further developed along the lower slope to basin. During the humid climate episodes, that affected the platform system with a precession-forced cyclicity, the carbonate production was reduced together with the evaporitic deposition, leading to the widespread deposition of marlstones and fine to coarse siliciclastic deposits. © 2020 The Authors.

Digitization of energy companies allows them to reduce operating costs and increases efficiency. With digital advances, the useful life of an energy plant can be increased up to 30%. Advanced technologies, blockchain, and the use of intelligent networks enables the activation of prosumers in the electricity market.

Together with estimated investments costs this can be used to produce a cost benefit analysis. An electric road is characterized by high economies of scale (high investment cost and low marginal cost) and considerable economies of scope (the benefit per kilometre electric road depends on the size of the network), implying that the market will produce a smaller network of electric roads, or charge higher prices for its use, than what is welfare optimal. For this reason, it is relevant for governments to consider investing in electric roads, making the cost-benefit analysis a key decision support. We model the behaviour of the carriers using the Swedish national freight model system, SAMGODS, determining the optimal shipment sizes and optimal transport chains, including mode and vehicle type. We find that if the user charge is set as to optimize social welfare, the revenue will not fully cover the investment cost of the electric road. If they are instead set to optimize profit, we find that the revenue will cover the costs if the electric road network is large enough. Electric roads appear to provide a cost-effective means to significantly reduce carbon emissions from heavy trucks. In a scenario where the expansion connects the three biggest cities in Sweden, emissions will be cut by one-third of the overall emissions from heavy trucks in Sweden. The main argument against a commitment to electric roads is that investment and maintenance costs are uncertain and that, in the long run, battery development or hydrogen fuel cells can reduce the benefit of such roads. © 2021 The Author(s)","Carbon emissions; Cost-benefit analysis; E-motorways; Electric road; Freight transport; Pricing and economic analysis","Automobiles; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Decision support systems; Electric network parameters; Fuel cells; Investments; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Trucks; Battery development; Carbon emissions; Cost-effective means; Decision supports; Economies of scale; Economies of scope; Highway networks; Optimal transport; Cost benefit analysis; carbon emission; cost-benefit analysis; electric vehicle; freight transport; investment; motorway; pricing policy; transportation economics; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101401949

Mentorship has been proposed as one way to improve the retention and experiences of URiM physicians and trainees. The objective of this systematic review was to identify and describe mentoring programs for URiM physicians in academic medicine and to describe important themes from existing literature that can aid in the development of URiM mentorship programs. Methods: The authors searched PubMed, PsycINFO, ERIC, and Cochrane databases, and included original publications that described a US mentorship program involving academic medical doctors at the faculty or trainee level and were created for physicians who are URiM or provided results stratified by race/ethnicity. Results: Our search yielded 4,548 unique citations and 31 publications met our inclusion criteria. Frequently cited objectives of these programs were to improve research skills, to diversify representation in specific fields, and to recruit and retain URiM participants. Subjective outcomes were primarily participant satisfaction with the program and/or work climate. The dyad model of mentoring was the most common, though several novel models were also described. Program evaluations were primarily subjective and reported high satisfaction, although some reported objective outcomes including publications, retention, and promotion. All showed satisfactory outcomes for the mentorship programs. Discussion: This review describes a range of successful mentoring programs for URiM physicians. Our recommendations based on our review include the importance of institutional support for diversity, tailoring programs to local needs and resources, training mentors, and utilizing URiM and non-URiM mentors. © 2021, Society of General Internal Medicine.","mentorship; underrepresented in medicine","adult; Cochrane Library; ethnicity; female; human; male; Medline; mentor; mentoring; outcome assessment; physician; program evaluation; PsycINFO; race; review; satisfaction; skill; systematic review; work environment; medical school; mentor; mentoring; university; Faculty; Faculty, Medical; Humans; Mentoring; Mentors; Physicians; Program Evaluation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100410886

Global management strategies have sought to maximize carbon drawdown by wetlands by manipulating wetland hydrology to inhibit bacterially-mediated emissions. However, it has recently been hypothesized within wetlands that viruses have the potential to dictate the magnitude and direction of GHG emissions by attacking prokaryotes involved in the carbon cycle. Here we tested this hypothesis in a whole-ecosystem manipulation by hydrologically-restoring a degraded wetland (‘rewetting’) and investigated the changes in GHG emissions, prokaryotes, viruses, and virus-host interactions. We found that hydrological restoration significantly increased prokaryotic diversity, methanogenic Methanomicrobia, as well as putative iron/sulfate-cyclers (Geobacteraceae), nitrogen-cyclers (Nitrosomonadaceae), and fermentative bacteria (Koribacteraceae). These results provide insights into successional microbial community shifts during rehabilitation. Additionally, in response to watering, viral-induced prokaryotic mortality declined by 77%, resulting in limited carbon released by viral shunt that was significantly correlated with the 2.8-fold reduction in wetland carbon emissions. Our findings highlight, for the first time, the potential implications of viral infections in soil prokaryotes on wetland greenhouse gas dynamics and confirm the importance of wetland rehabilitation as a tool to offset carbon emissions. © 2021","Carbon cycle; environmental watering; greenhouse gases; rehabilitation; viral infection; wetland","Carbon; Ecosystems; Gas dynamics; Gas emissions; Hydrology; Iron compounds; Viruses; Wetlands; Carbon emissions; Carbon sequestration; Fermentative bacteria; Global management; Host interactions; Microbial communities; Wetland hydrology; Wetland rehabilitations; Greenhouse gases; carbon; carbon dioxide; methane; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; bacterium; carbon sequestration; emission; greenhouse gas; management practice; microbial community; mortality; prokaryote; virus; wetland; Article; bacterium; carbon footprint; controlled study; dewatering; ecosystem; ecosystem restoration; Geobacteraceae; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; hydrology; Koribacteraceae; Methanomicrobia; microbial community; microbial diversity; Nitrosomonadaceae; nonhuman; priority journal; prokaryote; soil microflora; virus; virus cell interaction; wetland; greenhouse gas; soil; wetland; Geobacteraceae; Methanomicrobia; Nitrosomonadaceae; Prokaryota; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Soil; Viruses; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100413888

This research explores persuasive design to implement a novel interface of energy-converting cardio equipment to motivate the energy conversion, while raising environmental awareness and engender a feeling of positive ecological impact during the training. Two interface prototypes were developed and tested using different types of persuasive strategies based on non-authoritative instruction styles, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and cooperative social feedback. The interfaces differed along one main variable: One of the interfaces showed the individual performance with the energy converting equipment (Individual View), while the second displayed not only the converted energy generated by single individuals during their cardio training, but also the energy generated by the other people training in the gym simultaneously (Community View). Both the interfaces were tested in their pragmatic and hedonic dimensions, their attractiveness, and the effectiveness of the persuasive strategies in stimulating a responsible behaviour in increasing green awareness. The outcomes of the study reveal that persuasive design can provide means to stimulate awareness on sustainable behaviours. In particular, cooperative social eco-feedback seems to stimulate the individual motivation towards training aimed at energy conversion. © 2021 ACM.","Clean energy; Experience design; Persuasive technology; Physical Training; User Interface Design","Carbon footprint; Cognitive systems; Energy conversion; Ergonomics; Exercise equipment; Motivation; Recreational facilities; Sustainable development; Converting equipment; Ecological impacts; Environmental awareness; Environmental sustainability; Extrinsic motivation; Individual performance; Interface prototype; Sustainable behaviours; Environmental impact",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104958684

The associated environmental impacts are potentially considerable but will depend on how the agricultural sector develops. Currently, there are contrasting regional developments in agriculture; expansion and/or intensification in some regions and abandonment in others, as well as changes in the type of farming. However, the environmental consequences of changes in farm type are not well understood. Objective: We have evaluated the impacts of farm type on food production and three key environmental variables—landscape openness, grassland biodiversity and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions—in three marginal agricultural regions in Sweden. Methods: We do this by first dividing the population of farms in each region into types, based on their land-use and livestock holdings using an innovative clustering method. Thereafter we analysed changes in production activities for farm types over time and evaluated the environmental and food-production impacts, where landscape openness is quantified using a novel indicator. Results and conclusion: Our results show that there is not one single farm type that would simultaneously maximize food production, grassland biodiversity, and landscape openness, whilst minimizing GHG emissions. However, there exists considerable potential to manage the trade-offs between food production and these environmental variables. For example, by reducing land use for dairying and instead increasing both cropping for food production and extensive livestock grazing to maintain landscape openness and biodiversity-rich semi-natural pastures, it would keep food production at similar levels. Significance: Our farm typology allows us to assess the multifunctionality of farming, by relating contrasting production activities to multiple ecosystem services, grassland biodiversity and GHG emissions for informing policy towards more sustainable agriculture. We have demonstrated this with examples under Swedish conditions, but it should to a large extent also be applicable for other countries. © 2021 The Authors","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Ecosystem services; Farm typology; Food production; Landscape openness","agricultural intensification; alternative agriculture; biodiversity; environmental factor; environmental impact; food production; greenhouse gas; regional development; Sweden; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100052121

We investigate the case for carbon tariffs. For our assessment, we combine multi-region input–output and computable general equilibrium analyses based on data from the World Input–Output Database for the period 2000–2014. The multi-region input–output analysis confirms that carbon embodied in trade has increased during this period, but trade flows from Non-OECD to OECD countries became less important in relative terms since the 2007–2008 financial crisis. The computable general equilibrium analysis suggests that carbon tariffs’ efficacy in combating leakage increases in periods when trade in carbon increases. However, its potential to improve the global-cost effectiveness of unilateral emission pricing remains modest. On the other hand, we find that the potential of carbon tariffs to shift the economic burden of CO2 emission reduction from abating developed regions to non-abating developing regions increases sharply between 2000 and 2007, but declines after the financial crisis. © 2021, The Author(s).","Carbon tariffs; Computable general equilibrium; Embodied carbon; Unilateral climate policy","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Emission control; CO2 emission reduction; Computable general equilibrium; Developed regions; Developing regions; Economic burden; Financial crisis; Output analysis; Policy measures; Costs; carbon dioxide; computable general equilibrium analysis; emission control; emissions trading; global perspective; OECD; pollution tax",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102805096

Regulations including EU Directive 2016/2284 require European Union member states to reduce emissions. Dairy farming has one of the highest levels of ammonia emissions. Most dairy barns in Germany are naturally ventilated to meet higher animal welfare standards. However, these housing systems allow an uncontrolled direct release of emissions into the atmosphere. A novel mitigation method could be the use of a urease inhibitor. Although previous studies have noted the reduction potential of the inhibitor type K, the chronological course of the reduction is still unknown. This study investigates the inhibitory reaction by dividing the experiment into time slots to examine the chronological reduction in emissions. The inhibitor was found to reduce ammonia emissions by up to 37% at the 12-h time slot. This supports the assumption that the reduction potential of the inhibitor evolves over time. © 2021 IAgrE","ammonia reduction; dairy cows; respiration chambers; urease inhibitor","Animals; Dairies; Farm buildings; Ammonia emissions; Emissions into the atmosphere; Environmental health; European union; Housing systems; Mitigation methods; Reduction potential; Urease inhibitors; Ammonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100427210

By adding Pt nanoparticles, the selectivity can be tuned toward CO, reaching a value of 92% and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 96 µmol·gcat−1·h−1, nearly an order of magnitude higher in comparison with P25. By adding Pd nanoparticles the selectivity can be shifted from CO (70% for a bare Ti-Beta zeolite), toward CH4 as the prevalent species (60%). In this way, the selectivity toward CO or CH4 can be tuned by either using Pt or Pd. The TOF values obtained in this work outperform reported state-of-the-art values in similar research. The improved activity by adding the nanoparticles was attributed to an improved charge separation efficiency, together with a plasmonic contribution of the metal nanoparticles under the applied experimental conditions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","FEM modeling; Nanoparticles; Photocatalytic CO2 reduction; Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR); Zeolite Ti-beta","Carbon dioxide; Metal nanoparticles; Palladium; Plasmonic nanoparticles; Titanium compounds; Zeolites; Charge recombinations; Charge separations; Experimental conditions; Improved activities; PD nano particle; Platinum and palladiums; State of the art; Turnover frequency; Platinum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099225360

The main cause of its occurrence is emissions associated with individual heating of buildings. The reduction of the primary energy demand in a building is influenced by its proper thermal modernization, including in particular insulating. In view of the above, this article presents the results of studies on the possible environmental benefits of thermal modernization of single-family houses for the area of Southern Poland. The analysis was limited to determining the impact of measures to reduce air pollution emissions by insulating the building envelope of single-family houses. The research was conducted for two voivodeships: Ślaskie˛ and Małopolskie. Its aim is to identify the financial costs and achievable ecological effects of the thermal modernization of single-family buildings. The geographical selection of the research area was based on the fact that it covers the most polluted region in Poland. This region is characterized by many features that influence poor air quality. Among these features, the most important are: diversified building structure, a diverse topography, and very high population density. To limit multiple variables, we have selected a scenario method that has already been used in similar research. Four scenarios were established to show the relationship between the value of emission reductions and the level of funding for thermal modernization. The analysis allows a comparison of the effectiveness of individual variants and the transposition of their results into the possibilities of action in the region. This research will help to supplement the knowledge of the impact of insulating building envelopes on reducing pollutant emissions by reducing the energy demand of a building. They also identify a possible link between the level of this reduction and the grant amount for thermal modernization. As a result, it was found that a high share of external funding—stimulating the tendency of the inhabitants of the analyzed voivodeships to effective thermal modernization, and thus reducing the buildings’ energy consumption—has a significant impact on the improvement of air quality. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aims to report N2O, N2, N2/N2O, 15N-N2O, wheat-maize annual grain yields, and yield-scaled N2O and N2O plus N2 emissions on the responses to different nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates in a winter wheat-summer maize cropping system. Furthermore, this study also seeks to determine controlling factors for N2O, N2, and N2/N2O emissions and significantly investigate the relationship between the soil-climate measured factors and 15N-N2O. Materials and method: Three N inputs and control treatments, 0, CK; 200, LN; 400, MN; and 600, HN kg N ha−1 year−1 were set since 1998. Direct measurement method has been used to quantify N2O and N2 emissions. Results: Our results indicated that the effects of long-term N fertilization significantly increased N2O and N2 and also reduced N2/N2O emission ratios as described by exponential functions. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), NH4+, WFPS, NO3-, and DOC were revealed to be main controlling factors for N2O, while N2 by DOC, NO3-, WFPS, and temperature finally N2/N2O was positively related to temperature. Furthermore, the 15N-N2O was positively related to N2/N2O ratios, indicating that denitrification is the dominant process at the study site. The yield-scaled N2O emissions followed the order HM&gt;MN&gt;LN&gt;CK, and they were 1.56, 1.47, and 1.07 times greater than CK, respectively. Total yield-scaled N2O plus N2 were in the order of CK&gt;HN&gt;MN&gt;LN. Conclusion: N fertilization has shown strong impact not only on N2O, N2, and N2/N2O emissions but also on yield-scaled N2O and N2O plus N2 emissions. High agronomic nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), low yield-scaled N2O emissions, and low cumulative N2O plus N2 emissions were observed at 200-LN treatment, suggesting this rate to be an optimum and sustainable agricultural management practice with no significant crop yield reduction as compared to the current farmers’ practice of 400 kg N ha−1 year−1. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","15N in soil-emitted N2O; Controlling factors; N2O and N2 emissions; Nitrogen fertilization; Wheat-maize grain yields; Yield-scaled N2O and N2O + N2 emissions","agricultural ecosystem; crop yield; fertilizer application; long-term change; maize; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; numerical model; semiarid region; spatiotemporal analysis; temperate environment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101828463

Recent research underscores the values of large tracts of secondary old-growth (referred to in this paper as ""older""forests), including carbon sequestration, forest resiliency, mitigation of climate change impacts, and conservation of biological diversity. Due to historical management, many portions of Indiana state forests are maturing, and yet the ""older""successional stage is underrepresented. One of these maturing forests, the site of our study, is in south-central Indiana within the Back Country Area (BCA) of the Morgan-Monroe/Yellowwood State Forest (two state forests, herein called a complex, including parcels in three counties with the largest block of forests spanning Brown and Monroe counties). Our study of the forest structure of the BCA addresses the following questions: (a) Is this mature forest developing ecological attributes of old-growth forests, thus making it a good candidate for an older forest reserve? (b) Does this forest support the plant community characteristic of natural areas of Indiana? We analyzed forest stand metrics, coarse woody debris and snags, age of the largest live trees, and the floristic quality of the herbaceous layer. We then compared these data with published accounts from Indiana nature preserves. Metrics such as tree basal area, number of large-diameter trees, and number of snags are within the range of those measured in existing old-growth forests of Indiana. Analysis of tree cores and log cross-sections shows that 78% of the sample trees were over 100 yr old, with 24% over 130 yr, which is also comparable to old-growth forest nature preserves in the state. The metrics of the Floristic Quality Assessment of the broader plant community of the BCA are comparable to or higher than the metrics from published assessments of Indiana nature preserves. Collectively, the attributes measured indicate that the BCA supports a maturing secondary forest with old-growth characteristics. In the absence of further timber harvest, the BCA as a reserve could reach older forest status within 50 yr. Our study demonstrates that the BCA forest is a prime candidate for an older forest reserve. This study of the BCA could also serve as a model for future assessments of potential older forest reserves in other state forests. Reserves of older forests free from harvest are not incompatible with other management goals and can be a valuable part of a broader-scale management plan. These forest reserves should be promoted across the state to increase the representation within Indiana's state forest system of late-successional secondary forest exhibiting ecological attributes of old-growth forests, thereby enhancing the role of state forests in biodiversity protection and climate mitigation. © 2021 by The Torrey Botanical Society.","deciduous forest; dendrochronology; floristic quality assessment; old-growth attributes; secondary forest","biodiversity; climate change; climate classification; coarse woody debris; forest management; nature reserve; old-growth forest; plant community; secondary forest; Indiana; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109101268

AEMFCs are an attractive alternative to proton-exchange membrane fuel cells. They can run under alkaline conditions, allowing the use of platinum group metal (PGM)-free electrocatalysts. Yet, the same alkaline conditions incur an overpotential loss in ORR and also slow the HOR. This can be solved by using PGM electrodes, but then the original advantage disappears. In contrast, the fuel cell is free of both PGMs and critical raw materials (CRMs). Electrochemical studies confirmed that the catalysts are highly active in both HOR and ORR in an alkaline electrolyte. The morphology, composition, and chemical states of the electrocatalysts are characterized by different techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Then, the electrocatalysts’ performance is tested in a fuel cell device. The cell gives a maximum power density of 56 mW cm−2 and a limiting current density of 220 mA cm−2.

Bangladesh is already extremely vulnerable to tropical cyclones, and its infrastructure is frequently damaged by such events. However, climate change is expected to make the infrastructure itself, more vulnerable to cyclonic events in the future. This paper assesses the risk to coastal infrastructure in Bangladesh under climate change, from a multi-hazard perspective. A novel risk assessment matrix is proposed, examining the likely future risk to the country's key infrastructure elements from six prioritised hazards. The hazards stem from changes to baseline climate, and from predictions of stronger cyclones as a result of climate change. We show that Bangladeshi infrastructure is extremely at risk, suggesting rapid action and mitigation measures are needed. Climate change will increase the vulnerability of infrastructure on its own, but higher storm surges related to intensified cyclones pose the greatest risk, with catastrophic impacts on all types of infrastructure. A number of recommendations to improve the infrastructure are made. Due to the severity of the risks, alternative measures to protect Bangladesh and its population should be considered. These may be natural defences, efficient evacuation procedures, integration of communities to the design and construction process, or relocation of populations. These measures may be more sustainable in the long term in a place with geophysical, geographical, social and financial contexts such as those found in Bangladesh. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Extreme weather; Multi-hazards; Risk assessment; Storm surges; Vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102338747

The alarming exponential increase in the transmission and fatality rates related to this disease has brought the world to a halt so as to cope up with its stern consequences. This has led to the imposition of lockdown across the globe to prevent the further spread of this disease. This lock down brought about drastic impacts at social and economic fronts. However, it also posed some positive impacts on environment as well particularly in the context of air quality due to reduction in concentrations of particulate matter (PM), NO2 and CO across the major cities of the globe as indicated by several research organizations. In China, Italy, France and Spain, there were about 20–30% reduction in NO2 emission while in USA 30% reduction in NO2 emission were observed. Compared to previous year, there was 11.4% improvement in the air quality in China. Drastic reductions in NO (−77.3%), NO2 (−54.3%) and CO (−64.8%) (negative sign indicating a decline) concentrations were observed in Brazil during partial lockdown compared to the five year monthly mean. In India there were about −51.84, −53.11, −17.97, −52.68, −30.35, 0.78 and −12.33% reduction in the concentration of PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, O3 and NH3 respectively. This article highlights the impact of lockdown on the environment and also discusses the pre and post lockdown air pollution scenario across major cities of the world. Several aspect of environment such as air, water, noise pollution and waste management during, pre and post lockdown scenario were studied and evaluated comprehensively. This research would therefore serve as a guide to environmentalist, administrators and frontline warriors for fighting our the way to beat this deadly disease and minimize its long term implications on health and environment. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Air quality index; Climate change; Environmental impacts; Global pandemic; Outbreak; Waste management and Covid-19","ammonia; carbon monoxide; nitrogen oxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air quality; climate change; concentration (composition); COVID-19; disease spread; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; public health; spatiotemporal analysis; viral disease; air pollution; air quality; Article; Brazil; China; climate change; concentration (parameter); coronavirus disease 2019; environmental change; France; health hazard; India; Italy; lockdown; noise pollution; pandemic; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; recycling; reduction (chemistry); Spain; United States; waste management; water pollution; air pollutant; city; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; human; particulate matter; China; France; Italy; Spain; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Brazil; China; Cities; Climate Change; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; France; Humans; India; Italy; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100792285

Intersecting these two cycles, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) directs one-carbon units from the folate to methionine cycle, to be exclusively used for methionine and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) synthesis. MTHFR deficiency and upregulation result in diverse disease states, rendering it an attractive drug target. The activity of MTHFR is inhibited by the binding of AdoMet to an allosteric regulatory domain distal to the enzyme's active site, which we have previously identified to constitute a novel fold with a druggable pocket. Here, we screened 162 AdoMet mimetics using differential scanning fluorimetry, and identified 4 compounds that stabilized this regulatory domain. Three compounds were sinefungin analogues, closely related to AdoMet and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy). The strongest thermal stabilisation was provided by (S)-SKI-72, a potent inhibitor originally developed for protein arginine methyltransferase 4 (PRMT4). Using surface plasmon resonance, we confirmed that (S)-SKI-72 binds MTHFR via its allosteric domain with nanomolar affinity. Assay of MTHFR activity in the presence of (S)-SKI-72 demonstrates inhibition of purified enzyme with sub-micromolar potency and endogenous MTHFR from HEK293 cell lysate in the low micromolar range, both of which are lower than AdoMet. Nevertheless, unlike AdoMet, (S)-SKI-72 is unable to completely abolish MTHFR activity, even at very high concentrations. Combining binding assays, kinetic characterization and compound docking, this work indicates the regulatory domain of MTHFR can be targeted by small molecules and presents (S)-SKI-72 as an excellent candidate for development of MTHFR inhibitors. © 2021 The Authors","5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; Drug-development; Enzymatic inhibition; One-carbon metabolism; Small molecules","5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (FADH2); ademetionine; methyltransferase inhibitor; oxidoreductase inhibitor; s adenosylhomocysteine; sinefungin; ski 72; ademetionine; enzyme inhibitor; methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (NADPH2); MTHFR protein, human; allosterism; Article; binding assay; carboxy terminal sequence; computer model; controlled study; drug binding; drug potency; drug targeting; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; HEK293 cell line; human; molecular docking; surface plasmon resonance; thermostability; allosterism; chemistry; protein domain; Allosteric Regulation; Enzyme Inhibitors; Humans; Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2); Protein Domains; S-Adenosylmethionine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100084217

The use of diesel electric power plant (PLTD) may harmed the environment, the hybrid system with storage energy can be an alternative solution to substitute PLTD. Hence, there is an opportunity to design and implement a hybrid geothermal and solar power plant for Flores Island. Based on existing geothermal fluid characteristics in Flores Island, a hybrid power plant is designed to comprising of a single flash geothermal power generation, a solar collector system with parabolic trough collectors (PTC) either in an East-West (E-W) or a North-South (N-S) alignment, and a thermal energy storage (TES) system with synthetic oil for heat transfer fluid (HTF) and a mixture of salts for storing thermal energy. The hybrid power plant's operation is designed based on the result of the electricity load study for Flores Island. Solar energy potential for Flores Island is predicted by combining clear sky model empirical formulas and 2017-2019 sunshine duration data from local wheather station. Steady mass and energy balance analyses via Aspen HYSYS were performed to obtain electric power generation capacity for each standalone geothermal power plant and hybrid power plant. Besides, a comparison of carbon dioxide emission from the same capacity of a diesel-electric power plant, a standalone geothermal power plant, and a hybrid power plant is presented. The hybrid power plant is designed to have a solar collector system with a N-S alignment PTC system in which daily average solar irradiation is predicted to be 5.5 kWh/m2/day and a TES volume of 3,000 m3. The land area to be cleared for the solar collector system is estimated as 3.0 hectares (7.5 acres). For a steam turbine inlet pressure of 10 bar, a condenser pressure of 0.08 bar, and 1,215 operation hours per year, the hybrid power plant can produce 5,450 MWh/year of electric energy. The carbon dioxide emission reduction for standalone operation and a hybrid operation are 86% and 93%, respectively, compared to that of a PLTD. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Alignment; Carbon dioxide; Diesel engines; Diesel power plants; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Electric power plants; Electric power systems; Emission control; Geothermal energy; Global warming; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Hybrid systems; Landforms; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Steam power plants; Thermal energy; Alternative solutions; Carbon dioxide emissions; Design and implements; Geothermal power generation; Mass and energy balance; Parabolic trough collectors; Stand-alone operation; Turbine inlet pressure; Geothermal power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104961670

To tackle such a key issue, a vast body of research has focused on ancient societies because of the limited complexity of their economies and their unparalleled experience with environmental and institutional change. Notably, the ""collapse archaeology"" literature has reported countless correlations consistent with the mantra that severe droughts are bound to trigger institutional crises. This conclusion, however, has been recently challenged by a stream of papers that, building on more detailed data on Bronze Age Mesopotamia and a more credible theory-based empirical strategy, have yielded the following two results. First, severe droughts pushed the elites to grant strong political and property rights to the nonelites to convince them that a sufficient part of the returns on joint investments would be shared via public good provision and, thus, to cooperate and accumulate a culture of cooperation. Second, a more favorable climate allowed the elites to elicit cooperation under less inclusive political regimes as well as a weaker culture of cooperation and, possibly, incomplete property rights. These patterns emphasize the importance of considering the asymmetric effect of droughts and, more generally, combining natural and social sciences for the evaluation of climate-related policies. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

The economic production of such hybrid components on the other hand represents a major challenge. The new tailored forming process chain, which is developed within the collaborative research center (CRC 1153) represents a possible solution to produce hybrid components. This is made possible by the use of pre-joined hybrid semi-finished products made from two different steel alloys, which are subsequently formed. The semi-finished products can be manufactured for example by means of deposition welding. Due to a thermal mechanical treatment, an overall higher component strength of the joining zone can be achieved. The deposition welding processes can be used to generate a cladding on a base material. During the welding, one of the most difficult tasks is to reduce the amount and size of pores in the joining zone. These pores can reduce the strength in the joining zone of the welded parts. However, additional pores can occur in the intermediate zone between the substrate and the cladding. In the presented study, the influence of the forming process on the closing of pores in the cladding and in the intermediate zone was investigated. Therefore, cylindrical specimen were extracted in longitudinal direction of the welding track by wire-cut eroding. These welding tracks are manufactured by plasma-transferred arc welding of AISI 52100 on a base plate made of AISI 1015. Further, specimens were prepared transversely, so that the base material, the intermediate layer, and the welded material are axially arranged in the specimen. The prepared specimen were checked for pores by means of scanning acoustic microscopy. Subsequently, an uniaxial compression test was carried out with various degrees of deformation and the two specimen designs were examined again for pores. A microstructure analysis was carried out after each step. The investigations show that there is a need for a minimum degree of deformation to reduce pores in the welded material. However, this required plastic strain cannot be achieved in the welded material of the hybrid specimen, which is a result of the homogeneous temperature distribution in the specimen. The homogeneous temperature distribution leads to different flow properties in the specimen, which means that the main plastic deformation is taking place in the base material. © 2021, The Author(s).","AISI 52100; Plasma transferred arc welding; Pore reduction; Scanning acoustic microscopy; Tailored forming","Carbon; Compression testing; Electric welding; Hard facing; Joining; Plasma welding; Plastic deformation; Temperature distribution; Turing machines; Collaborative research; Degree of deformations; Longitudinal direction; Microstructure analysis; Plasma transferred arc welding; Scanning Acoustic Microscopy; Thermal mechanical treatments; Uni-axial compression tests; Alloy steel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101013728

Development strategies focusing simultaneously on adaptive farming, productivity, and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-known as climate-smart agriculture (CSA) strategies-are key to responding to these challenges. For almost a decade, within the framework of Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), World Agroforestry (ICRAF), and its partners have been using Participatory Action Research (PAR) to fully engage key stakeholders in co-creating such CSA development strategies. This includes the testing of Agricultural Research for Development (AR4D) CSA scalability options. The multidisciplinary teams include the National Research and Extension Systems (NARES), national meteorological services (NMS), non-profit organizations (NGOs), and local radio programs, among others. The CCAFS-West Africa Program, World Agroforestry-West and Central Africa (ICRAF-WCA), International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), University of Reading, and Centre Régional de Formation et d'Application en Agro-météorologie et Hydrologie Opérationnelle (AGRHYMET) provide technical backstopping to the national teams. Climate information (CI) was used as an entry point to inform the development of CSA technologies and practices within Climate-Smart Villages (CSV). This groundwork has led to a greater understanding of three critical factors for successful CSV implementation: (1) Building strong partnerships to co-design and develop agricultural systems that improve ecosystem and population resilience, (2) Key stakeholders (researchers, farmers, development agents, and students) capacity strengthening through vocational and academic training, and (3) Using CI for livelihood planning at all scales. These three factors support more effective identification and testing of agricultural technologies and practices addressing climate variability and change at plot, community, and landscape levels. This paper discusses the PAR-CSA methodology and parameters for evaluation, including biophysical and social change. Keys to success, including communication, knowledge sharing tools, and scalability are also discussed. Finally, future opportunities for improvement are presented, including knowledge product development, CSA policy and investment planning, capacity building, further engagement of the private sector, and additional research on existing practices and tools. © Copyright © 2021 Bayala, Ky-Dembele, Dayamba, Somda, Ouédraogo, Diakite, Chabi, Alhassane, Bationo, Buah, Sanogo, Tougiani, Traore, Zougmoré and Rosenstock.","adaptation; ecosystem; farming system; livelihood; mitigation; resilience",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106014717

The charge air is heated by the EGR and the compression in the turbocharger to such an extent that high NOx emissions and a reduction in engine performance occurs. For this reason, the charge air cooler cools down the charge air before it enters the air intake manifold. In case of low pressure EGR, the charge air possesses a high moisture content and under certain operating conditions an accumulation of condensate takes place within the charge air cooler. During demanding engine loads, the condensate is entrained from the charge air cooler into the combustion chamber, resulting in misfiring or severe engine damage. In order to be able to take appropriate countermeasures, it is necessary to investigate the basic physical mechanisms under which condensation occurs and to simulate them using an appropriate condensation model. This paper presents a simulation method for calculating the accumulated condensate and the condensate mass flow inside charge air coolers using a numerical approach based on the boundary layer theory for the case of heat and mass transfer analogy over a flat plate with surface suction. The solution routine is embedded as a user code in the simulation software Star-CCM+ and one single duct of the charge air cooler is modeled applying the porous media model. Different operating states are simulated, and the numerical results are compared to own experimental results. The results show good agreement between experiments and simulations and the relevant quantities such as accumulated condensate and condensate mass flow are matching well. © 2021 SAE International.

Concurrently, the need for storage is also increasing to maintain a continuous power supply. Hence, this paper presents a MILP-based model to optimize the size of thermal storage required to satisfy the annual DH demand of a community solely by P2H conversion employing renewable energy. The DH is supplied by the optimal operation of a novel 2-km deep well heat pump system (DWHP) equipped with thermal storage. To avoid computational intractability, representative time steps with varying time duration are chosen by employing hierarchical agglomerative clustering that aggregates adjacent hours chronologically. The value of demand response and the effect of interannual weather variability are also analyzed. Numerical results from a Finnish case study show that P2H conversion utilizing small thermal storage in tandem with the DWHP is able to cover the annual DH demand, thus leading to a carbon-neutral DH system and, at the same time, mitigating the curtailment of excessive wind generation. Compared with the annual DH demand, an average thermal storage size of 29.17 MWh (2.58%) and 13.99 MWh (1.24%) are required in the business-as-usual and the demand response cases, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

It will be one of the challenging issues, particularly for the tea plantations of Assam, India. Based on a questionnaire survey carried out in four major tea-growing regions of Assam, viz., Upper Assam, South Bank, North Bank and Cachar, the study analyses tea growers’ awareness of climate change, its impact on tea, adaptive approaches undertaken and future strategies. Majority of respondents were aware of climate change and its effect on tea production. Tea growers attributed prolong drought, excessive precipitation within a short period, temperature extremes, increase in insect and disease infestation, the emergence of new insect pest species, increased weed infestation and wind velocity as underlying effects of climate change. Results also specified that tea growers had a positive approach towards adaptive management strategies to mitigate climate change. Adaptive measures executed to combat climate change included rainwater harvesting, irrigation, afforestation, biodiversity conservation, soil mulching and creation of wind barriers. As future management strategies, tea growers have opted to gradually replace synthetic fertilisers with organic manures and pesticides, construct anti-erosion measures along riversides and embankments, generate awareness programs among the workers and other residents on conserving biodiversity, generate clean energy for tea production and cultivate climate tolerant/resistant cultivars. The present study will be helpful to make more informed future strategies regarding best practices for tea cultivation under a changing climate for tea-growing regions all over the world. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.","Awareness; Drought; Global warming; Mitigation; Policy; Temperature","Biodiversity; Cultivation; Fertilizers; Human resource management; Reforestation; Soil conservation; Surveys; Tea; Adaptation strategies; Adaptive Management; Biodiversity conservation; Disease infestation; Management strategies; Questionnaire surveys; Rain water harvesting; Temperature extremes; Climate change; cultivation; drought; environmental policy; global warming; perception; strategic approach; tea; temperature effect; adaptation; afforestation; Article; awareness; climate change; conservation biology; crop production; environmental impact; environmental temperature; harvesting; human; India; infestation; irrigation (agriculture); nonhuman; perception; plantation; questionnaire; tea; weed; wind speed; animal; environmental monitoring; perception; tea; Assam; India; Hexapoda; Animals; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; India; Perception; Tea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102176916

We estimate energy and CO2 emission penalties of extracted brine management on a per tonne of CO2 stored basis by spatially integrating CO2 emissions from U.S. coal-fired electric generating units, CO2 storage reservoirs, and brine salinity data sets under several carbon and water management scenarios. We estimate a median energy penalty of 4.4-35 kWh/tonne CO2 stored, suggesting that brine management will be the largest post capture and compression energy sink in the carbon storage process.

Overstory trees and understory grasses within semiarid savannas vary in their structure and sensitivity to environmental pressures, underscoring the need to examine the ecohydrological implications of this climatic variability. Whereas precipitation has long been recognized as a key driver of landscape ecohydrology, understanding a site's hydraulic redistribution regime (the balance in downward and upward movement of water and the seasonality of these bidirectional flows) may be equally important to understanding moisture availability to vegetation in these dryland ecosystems. As a result, we linked measures of ecosystem-scale carbon exchange, overstory tree sap flux and leaf-level gas exchange to understory whole-plot and leaf-level carbon and water exchange within intact and trenched plots (isolating trees from grasses) in a riparian savanna ecosystem. We maintained measurements across 2 years with distinct precipitation regimes. We found that interannual precipitation variability yielded a categorical shift in the directionality and magnitude of the hydraulic redistribution regime—even within this single site. Additionally, we found that connectivity between overstory trees and understory grasses through hydraulic redistribution created a short period of competition within an average rain year but that facilitation of understory function by overstory trees was much greater and lasted longer during drier years. Together, these findings suggest that hydraulic redistribution can serve as a hydrologic buffer against interannual precipitation variability. Given current climate projections of more variable precipitation within and across years, understanding how hydraulic redistribution regimes vary through time will greatly enhance our capacity to anticipate future ecohydrological function. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","drylands; hydraulic lift; interannual variability; leaf gas exchange; mesquite (Prosopis velutina); photosynthesis; sap flow; woody plant encroachment","Carbon; Ecosystems; Precipitation (meteorology); Bi-directional flows; Climate projection; Climate variability; Climatic variability; Environmental pressures; Functional integrities; Precipitation regimes; Precipitation variability; Forestry; annual variation; ecohydrology; gas exchange; photosynthesis; precipitation (climatology); riparian zone; sap flow; semiarid region; transpiration; Poaceae; Prosopis; Prosopis velutina; Xanthorrhoea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099387713

Furthermore, exposure to air pollution can increase human sensitivity to respiratory pathogens via damage to the respiratory tract or via airborne transmission on the surface of particulate matter, and might be an additional factor influencing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates. The aim of this study was to examine the association between populations' exposure to air pollution and the morbidity and mortality rates from COVID-19. Methods: We examined the association between population-weighted long-term exposure to PM2.5 and NOx, and the morbidity and mortality over time following the detection of the first COVID-19 positive case in 36 OECD countries. Pearson and Spearman correlations between daily COVID-19 morbidity and mortality (Jan–Jun 2020) on the 10th, 20th, 40th, 60th and 80th days since first confirmed case in the country, and demographic, health, economic, and environmental data were calculated. Multivariate linear regression were used to examine the associations between demographic, health, economic and air pollution features and the rate of confirmed cases and deaths on the 60th and 80th days following the first confirmed case. Results: PM2.5 concentrations in 2015–2017 were positively correlated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality on the 10th, 20th, 40th and 60th days since the first confirmed case in all countries. NOx concentrations in 2015–2017 and country's density (population/Km2) were positively correlated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality on the 60th day. All multivariate linear regressions consisting PM2.5 concentrations models were statistically significant. Our models also emphasize the importance of the relative number of hospital beds in decreasing the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. Conclusions: The adverse health outcomes stemming from long-term exposure to various air pollutants has long been known to the scientific community. According to our results and previously published studies, it appears that long-term exposure to air pollutants concentrations exceeding WHO guidelines, such as PM2.5 and NOx, might exacerbate morbidity and mortality rates from COVID-19. These results should raise a red flag globally among decision makers about the urgent need to reduce air pollution and its harmful effects. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; Chronic environmental exposure; COVID-19; Morbidity and mortality; NOx; PM2.5","nitrogen dioxide; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; demography; morbidity; multivariate analysis; nitrous oxide; particulate matter; regression analysis; air pollutant; ambient air; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental exposure; human; long term exposure; major clinical study; morbidity; mortality rate; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; particulate matter 2.5; PM2.5 exposure; population research; priority journal; adverse event; air pollution; analysis; environmental exposure; morbidity; particulate matter; toxicity; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; COVID-19; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Morbidity; Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100386942

Decoding these strata provides insight regarding past sediment transport processes, bedform kinematics, depositional landscape, and the prevailing climate. Deciphering these signatures requires a detailed analysis of sedimentary architecture to reconstruct dune morphology, motion, and the conditions that enabled their formation. Here, we show that a distinct sandstone unit exposed in the foothills of Mount Sharp, Gale crater, Mars, records the preserved expression of compound aeolian bedforms that accumulated in a large dune field. Analysis of Mastcam images of the Stimson formation shows that it consists of cross-stratified sandstone beds separated by a hierarchy of erosive bounding surfaces formed during dune migration. The presence of two orders of surfaces with distinct geometrical relations reveals that the Stimson-era landscape consisted of large dunes (draas) with smaller, superimposed dunes migrating across their lee slopes. Analysis of cross-lamination and subset bounding surface geometries indicate a complex wind regime that transported sediment toward the north, constructing oblique dunes. This dune field was a direct product of the regional climate and the surface processes active in Gale crater during the fraction of the Hesperian Period recorded by the Stimson formation. The environment was arid, supporting a large aeolian dune field; this setting contrasts with earlier humid depositional episodes, recorded by the lacustrine sediments of the Murray formation (also Hesperian). Such fine-scale reconstruction of landscapes on the ancient surface of Mars is important to understanding the planet’s past climate and habitability. © 2021.

The catchments are covered by three different forest types, namely native forest (2), pine plantations of different ages (6) and eucalypt plantations (2). All of these catchments share similar metamorphic geology. A 90° V notch weir was built at each catchment outlet and data collected at 5 min interval using a pressure transducer that was calibrated monthly. The dataset is part of a research programme aiming to improve our understanding about the role of forest plantations on water balance at a stand and catchment level. It also includes the rainfall data from these catchments estimated using a combination of local rain gauges and data from the longer term records of the Chilean Directorate of Water.

However, most of the presently known catalyst systems are used at temperatures over 220 °C, which limits the theoretical yield of methanol production due to the exothermic nature of this transformation. In this review, we summarize state-of-the-art catalysts, focusing on the rationales behind, for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol at temperatures lower than 170 °C. Both hydrogenation with homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts is covered. Typically, additives (alcohols, amines or aminoalcohols) are used to transform CO2 into intermediates, which can further be reduced into methanol. In the first part, molecular catalysts are discussed, organized into: (1) monofunctional, (2) M/NH bifunctional, and (3) aromatization-dearomatization bifunctional molecular catalysts. In the second part, heterogeneous catalysts are elaborated, organized into: (1) metal/metal or metal/support, (2) active-site/N or active-site/OH bifunctional heterogeneous catalysts, and (3) cooperation of catalysts and additives in a tandem process via crucial intermediates. Although many insights have been gained in this transformation, in particular for molecular catalysts, the mechanisms in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts remain descriptive and insights unclear.

However, solid fluorescent CDs are rarely reported due to the notorious aggregation caused quenching (ACQ) effects. Here, we proposed a simple synthesis strategy to prepare CDs via hydrogen bonding self-assembly (HB-CDs). Most important of all, the FL emission of HB-CDs can be easily regulated based on hydrogen bond dynamic adjustability. When hydrogen-bonding break reagents were introduced, the emission shifted from yellow to blue. Hence, we put forward a novel solid-state photoluminescence mechanism, namely, the yellow emission can be excited by the formation of J-aggregates and the blue emission can be excited by dispersion. Based on this phenomenon, we developed a new CDs composites with dual modes FL emissions. These findings may provide a novel strategy to easily prepare CDs with solid-state fluorescence and tunable fluorescence. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dots; Hydrogen bonding self-assembly; Solid-state fluorescence; Tunable fluorescence",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101369635

To support policy for emission reduction and route of low-carbon society development, this paper estimated building stocks and building embodied carbon emissions (BECEs) in China’s 31 provinces from 1997 to 2016 by material flow analysis (MFA). Furthermore, global and local Moran’s indices were employed to investigate the geographical clustering patterns, and temporal and spatial decomposition models were proposed to identify the driving forces. The results reveal the total BECEs has boomed from 9.67 billion tons in 1997 to 28.99 billion tons in 2016. BECEs in 31 provinces have experienced consistent increase but obvious differences in growth rate, and are spatially inclined to decrease from eastern coastal regions to western inland regions. The change of spatial agglomeration pattern is complex and variable. It presents that a long and narrow “H-L agglomeration” is located in the two northernmost provinces and the other 29 provinces enforce a sequence arrangement with an order of “H–H”, “L–H”, “H–L”, and “L–L” from east to west. Temporal decomposition results show that investment scale, economic level, and population density are the main driving forces for the increase of BECEs from both national and provincial levels, while the main reasons for the decrease are technical level and return on investment. Spatial decomposition results demonstrate that population density and provincial area are the main driving forces for the difference between provincial and national average, and others cause the difference among provinces. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Building; Driving forces decomposition analysis; Embodied carbon emissions; Spatial and temporal distribution","agglomeration; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; economic conditions; environmental economics; material flow analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Matthiola; carbon; carbon dioxide; China; investment; population density; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Investments; Population Density",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098783062

This paper, taking Henan province as an example, analyzed the influence of water resource policy on regional economic growth through a calculable general equilibrium model and further discussed the relevant policy recommendations. The results showed that the improvement of water supply, water efficiency and water technology could promote the growth of the regional economy and result in a positive effect on regional GDP, employment and resident income. However, the rise of water price has a negative impact on regional economic development, mainly reflected in regional GDP, employment and household income. The improvement of water price, water efficiency and water conservancy technology would lead to a decrease in regional water consumption, while only the increase of the water supply would lead to an increase in water consumption. Accordingly, the paper puts forward policy suggestions, such as accelerating the improvement of water conservancy facilities, establishing a reasonable water price mechanism and actively exploring experience in water conservation and emission reduction. © 2021 The Authors","CGE model; Henan province; Policy adjustment; Regional economy; Water policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105296658

The poor infrastructure and low adaptation capabilities of these nations are the prime concern of current studies. Pakistan is vulnerable to climate-induced hazards including floods, droughts, water shortages, shifts in weather patterns, loss of biodiversity, melting of glaciers, and more in the coming years. For marginal societies dependent on natural resources, adaptation becomes a challenge and the utmost priority. Within the above context, this study was designed to fill the existing research gap concerning public knowledge of climate vulnerabilities and respective adaptation strategies in the northern Hindukush–Himalayan region of Pakistan. Using the stratified sampling technique, 25 union councils (wards) were selected from the nine tehsils (sub-districts) of the study area. Using the quantitative method approach, structured questionnaires were employed to collect data from 396 respondents. The study reveals varying public perceptions about different factors contributing to the causes and impacts of climate change and the sources of information in the three zones of the study area. The primary causes of climate change are deforestation, industrial waste, anthropogenic impurities, natural causes, and the burning of fossil fuels exacerbated by increased population. Changes in temperature, erratic rainfalls, floods, droughts, receding glaciers, and extreme weather events are some of the impacts observed over the past decades. While limiting the indiscriminate use of fossil fuels combined with government-assisted rehabilitation of forests can help combat climate change, the lack of proper education and economic, social, and governance barriers are hindering the local adaptation strategies. In addition, reduce environmental pollution (air, water, soil, etc.) and plantation polluted areas with suitable plants, are the two main actions in combating climate change. This study recommends policy interventions to enhance local adaptation efforts through building capacity, equipping local environmental institutions, discouraging deforestation, and ensuring sustainable use of natural resources. © 2021 by the authors.

The study evaluates the possible role of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies under an international emissions trading market as a way to mitigate welfare losses. To model the strategic context, one assumes that a global cumulative emissions budget will have been allocated among different coalitions of countries—the GCC being one of them—and the existence of an international emissions trading market. A meta-game model is proposed in which deployment of CDR technologies as well as supply of emission rights are strategic variables and the payoffs are obtained from simulations of a general equilibrium model. The results of the simulations indicate that oil and gas producing countries and especially the GCC countries face a significant welfare loss risk, due to “unburnable oil” if a worldwide climate regime as recommended by the Paris Agreement is put in place. The development of CDR technologies, in particular direct air capture (DAC) alleviates somewhat this risk and offers these countries a new opportunity for exploiting their gas reserves and the carbon storage capacity offered by depleted oil and gas reservoirs. © 2021, The Author(s).","Carbon dioxide removal; CDR technologies; Climate negotiations; Financial compensation; GCC countries; Negative emissions","Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Clock and data recovery circuits (CDR circuits); Commerce; Cost accounting; Emission control; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Carbon dioxide removal; Cumulative emissions; Economic assessments; General equilibrium models; Gulf Cooperation Council; Oil and gas reservoir; Strategic variables; Surface air temperatures; Proven reserves; air temperature; assessment method; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon storage; economic analysis; emissions trading; game theory; hydrocarbon reservoir; international agreement; strategic approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105764867

The holobiont can impact the nutrient balance of their hosts amid an otherwise oligotrophic environment, including by cycling physiologically important nitrogen compounds. Here we use 15N-tracer experiments to produce the first simultaneous measurements of ammonium oxidation, nitrate reduction, and nitrous oxide (N2O) production among five iconic species of reef-building corals (Acropora palmata, Diploria labyrinthiformis, Orbicella faveolata, Porites astreoides, and Porites porites) in the highly protected Jardines de la Reina reefs of Cuba. Nitrate reduction is present in most species, but ammonium oxidation is low potentially due to photoinhibition and assimilatory competition. Coral-associated rates of N2O production indicate a widespread potential for denitrification, especially among D. labyrinthiformis, at rates of ~1 nmol cm−2 d−1. In contrast, A. palmata displays minimal active nitrogen metabolism. Enhanced rates of nitrate reduction and N2O production are observed coincident with dark net respiration periods. Genomes of bacterial cultures isolated from multiple coral species confirm that microorganisms with the ability to respire nitrate anaerobically to either dinitrogen gas or ammonium exist within the holobiont. This confirmation of anaerobic nitrogen metabolisms by coral-associated microorganisms sheds new light on coral and reef productivity. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"anoxic conditions; bacterium; coral record; metabolism; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; oxidation; oxygenation; photoinhibition; reef; Cuba; Acropora palmata; Anthozoa; Bacteria (microorganisms); Diploria labyrinthiformis; Porites astreoides; Porites porites; Scleractinia; nitrogen; anaerobic growth; animal; Anthozoa; coral reef; microflora; Anaerobiosis; Animals; Anthozoa; Coral Reefs; Microbiota; Nitrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097809717

This work attempts to advance the knowledge of pavement carbon uptake based on a bottom-up approach and using state-level data to estimate the carbon uptake of the US pavements and its associated cost. To do so, a pavement management system model was developed to predict the performance and characteristics of the national pavement network using local maintenance and repair practices and data science approaches. Then, a high-resolution carbon uptake estimation method was applied to this system model. Our results show that 5.8 million metric tons (Mt) CO2 can be sequestered by the US pavement network, of which 52% will be sequestered when the demolished concrete is stockpiled at the end of life. The climate condition and mix design practices in California result in this state having the largest carbon uptake during the use phase of the pavement life cycle, while the end-of-life uptake is larger in those states that have an extensive composite pavement network. Extending the stockpiling period up to 30 years can increase the total end-of-life carbon uptake to 11.8 Mt CO2. The cost associated with concrete stockpiling varies depending on the scenario, but abatement costs for a 1 to 17-year stockpiling timeframe are $25–100/ton CO2, making end-of-life stockpiling a competitive strategy for greenhouse gas mitigation of the road network. © 2021","Abatement Cost; Carbonation; Concrete mix design; Data science; End of life; Pavement use","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Concretes; Cost benefit analysis; Data Science; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Pavements; Surface treatment; Bottom up approach; Competitive strategy; Composite pavements; Demolished concretes; Estimation methods; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Local maintenances; Pavement management systems; Information management; carbon; carbon dioxide; concrete; abatement cost; bottom-up approach; carbon; climate conditions; concrete; design; estimation method; maintenance; pavement; repair; abatement cost; Article; California; carbon uptake; climate; construction work and architectural phenomena; controlled study; cost control; data science; decision tree; environmental aspects and related phenomena; flow measurement; greenhouse gas; highway; landfill; pavement; pollution control; prediction; United States; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098969692

However, issues related with hydrogen storage and distribution currently obstruct its implementation. Alternatively, an energy-carrier such as ammonia with its carbon neutral chemical formula, high energy density and established production, transportation and storage infrastructure could provide a practical short-term next generation power solution for maritime industry.

Hence, they require specific climate change adaptation and policy responses, informed by delta-scale analysis. However, available climate knowledge on deltas is based mainly on broad-scale analysis that masks information unique to deltas. This applies to the Volta Delta system of Ghana. This study presents annual and intra-annual climate variability and trend analysis carried out across the Volta Delta, using the coefficient of variation (CV), anomaly, Mann-Kendall and Pettit statistics. There were time and space differences in climate change and variability. Statistically significant (P < 0.05) positive trends were observed for the major wet season and the mean annual rainfall for Ada and highly significant (P < 0.01) positive trends for Akatsi. These contrasted with the observations in Adidome, which experienced a statistically highly significant (P < 0.01) decreasing trend in rainfall. There were significant (P< 0.05) increases in annual minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures over time in both coastal and inland delta stations. The annual rate of change of mean temperature ranged from 0.03 to 0.05. Ada, the more coastal location, has experienced a narrow range of temperature change, most probably due to the buffering capacity of the ocean. Point changes were observed in the climate data series in four (4) localities. We recommend that adaption and policy actions should include, the provision of small-scale irrigation, encouraging adoption of drought-resistant crop varieties and crop diversification, and also be made responsive to the existing spatiotemporal climate variability and change within the Volta Delta. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate variability; Mann–Kendall; Rainfall; Seasonal variability; Temperature; Volta Delta","Crops; Drought; Rain; Statistics; Buffering capacities; Climate change adaptation; Climate variability; Climate variability and change; Coastal locations; Coefficient of variation; Crop diversification; Temperature changes; Climate change; rain; rain; adaptive management; annual variation; climate change; climate variation; crop yield; delta; hydrological response; policy approach; precipitation intensity; rainfall; temperature gradient; Article; climate change; controlled study; crop; drought resistance; environmental policy; Ghana; gross national product; human; irrigation (agriculture); population research; temperature; trend study; vegetation; climate change; environmental monitoring; Volta River; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Ghana; Rain; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103529338

In such systems, the formation of solid urea by-products is an undesired phenomenon and reduces the overall efficiency. In order to minimize this deposit build-up, it is essential to understand the deposit formation process in the presence of spray–wall contact and how this process is influenced by the surface morphology on which the deposit grows. In this regard, the objective of this study is to gain a profound understanding of the morphology of urea-derived deposits in SCR systems and to establish a methodology to characterize the surface topology of such surfaces. For that purpose, characteristic urea deposits are created in a laboratory test bench at two different temperature regimes. Optical and confocal microscopy are used together to investigate the variations in the surface texture and to measure the surface topology. The morphology of the deposit samples is then characterized by using the root mean square roughness, power spectral density (PSD) and fractal dimension analysis. Results suggest that the form of the 3D deposit structure is composed of the underlying urea-derivative crystal blocks, which display a finite size range in all cases. Furthermore, all deposit samples exhibit self-affine surfaces and yield the same power law distribution, indicating that the surface morphology is governed by the same height cascade. In a similar manner, all surfaces converge to the same fractal dimension of 2.3, suggesting that the deposit formation process evolves into a unique fractal structure for the tested operating conditions. Accordingly, it can be used to quantitatively describe the complex morphology of the urea-derived deposits. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","FFT analysis; Fractal dimension; Power spectral density (PSD); Surface morphology; Urea deposits","Crystal structure; Deposits; Exhaust systems (engine); Fractal dimension; Gas emissions; Metabolism; Selective catalytic reduction; Spectral density; Surface morphology; Textures; Topology; Urea; Fractal dimension analysis; Morphological characterization; Power law distribution; Power spectral densities (PSD); Root mean square roughness; Selective catalytic reduction systems; Self-affine surfaces; Temperature regimes; Morphology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098204558

Without effective medications or vaccines available, authorities turned toward mitigation measures such as use of face masks, school's closings, shelter-in-place, telework and social distancing. People found refuge on the internet and social media apps; however, there was a proliferation of instant messaging containing hoaxed, deliberate misleading information: fake news messaging (FNM). The aim of this study was to assess FNM through content analysis and to discriminate them in a proposed taxonomy structure. A sample of convenience of messages, memes, tweets or cartoons in several languages was selected from the most popular social media outlets, i.e. Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter etc. More than 300 FNM were identified. Descriptive statistics were used for highlighting potential relationships between variables. Content analysis determined that FNM could be divided into Health- and non-health-related types. There are several sub-types considering, but not limited to, religious beliefs, politics, economy, nutrition, behaviors, prevention of the infection, the origin of the disease and conspiracy theories. The parallel FNM pandemic affected the response from an already debilitated public health system through the confusion created in the community and the erosion in the credibility of genuine media. Public health practitioners had to face people's unpredictable behaviors, panic, tensions with the communities and, in some cases, a hostile climate toward frontline workers.

This study tests deuterated water as a tracer to quantify the amount of “new” methane generated and the effectiveness of Microbial Enhancement of Coalbed Methane (MECoM) approaches, as methanogens incorporate hydrogen from formation waters into methane during methanogenesis. Microorganisms (including methanogens), formation water, and coal obtained from the Powder River Basin were used to establish batch reactor stimulation experiments, using algal extracts, in which incremental amounts of deuterated water were added. The greatest amount of methane was produced in the amended coal-associated experiments and there was a consistent uptake of D into microbial methane. The shorter duration (36 days) coal amended experiment had a lower slope (m = 0.31) of δD-CH4 vs. δD-H2O and a similar offset between δD-H2O and δD-CH4 (371.2‰) compared to the longer duration (m = 0.44; 114 days; 358.8‰ offset) experiment, both consistent with the stimulation of primarily acetoclastic methanogenesis. The success of our proof-of-concept laboratory experiments confirms that deuterated water can be used as a quantitative tracer of stimulated coal-associated methanogenic activity. We also provide an example of how it can be applied in field-scale MECoM projects. In addition, deuterated water may serve as a useful tracer for other natural or enhanced subsurface microbial activities, such as microbial enhanced oil recovery or bioremediation of organic contaminants. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coal; Deuterium; Enhanced; Isotope; Methane; Methanogenesis","Batch reactors; Bioremediation; Coal; Coal deposits; Coal industry; Deuterium; Enhanced recovery; Gas industry; Methanogens; Natural gas deposits; Tracers; Laboratory experiments; Methane production; Methanogenic activity; Microbial activities; Microbial communities; Microbial enhanced oil recoveries; Microbial production; Organic contaminant; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098603158

Wildfires have historically contributed to shaping the natural vegetation and are now being used in the establishment and management of agricultural systems and pastures. Consequently, the fire regime has been changing over the last few decades and increasingly affecting native vegetation, natural habitats, and ecosystem services in tropical regions. Mapping fire dynamics and spatial distribution are crucial to assess impacts on ecosystems and to define and enforce strategies and measures of fire control and prevention. In this study, we developed an alternative approach for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome in Brazil, using Landsat imagery and Deep Learning algorithm, implemented on the Google Earth Engine and on Google Cloud Storage platform. We compared our mapping results with two Burned Area products developed by INPE (30 m resolution) and MODIS MCD64A1 Burned Area Product (500 m resolution). Additionally, we assessed the accuracies of these three mapping products using 2,200 validation points within the study area. By comparing our mapping result with MCD64A1 and INPE burn scar products, we estimated an average agreement of 34% for both. We observed that most mapping disagreements were mainly because of the effects of clouds/shadow conditions that affected the ability for spectral observations, differences in methodologies, and spatial resolution of each remotely sensed datasets used for mapping burned areas. Our validation results indicated an overall accuracy of 97% of our methodological approach for mapping burned areas and, therefore, it can be successfully applied across savanna regions. Our results showed that 202,230 km2 was affected by fires within the Cerrado biome in 2017, in which 31% overlapped cropping lands (agricultural fields and pastures) and 67% overlapped various types of native vegetation (forest, savanna and grassland). Our proposed methodological approach and its results can be useful to enforce environmental command and control policies and to estimate carbon emissions, analyses interactions between climate and ecological drivers of fire, develop predictive models of fire risk dynamics, and providing spatial information that can help public policies and fire management/prevention actions for the Cerrado conservation. © 2021 The Authors","Cerrado biome; Deep neural network; Forest fires; Google earth engine; Remote sensing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100551957

For this reason, on March 25, preventive isolation was declared mandatory. These measures involved the suspension of economic activities and drastically reduced the number of vehicles on the road. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic on PM2.5 concentrations at 5 monitoring stations and aerosol optical depth values of the Terra/MODIS satellite. We analyzed and compared the weekly and monthly concentrations of PM2.5 before and during the lockdown between the week of January 6 to June 22, 2020, and compared the daily values obtained from the Terra/MODIS satellite for the months of January–June during the years 2018–2020 to elucidate the effects of the lockdown. Similar to other monitored sites in the world, we observed substantial reductions in weekly PM2.5 concentrations, from 41 to 84% (Bogotá), from 13 to 66% (Funza), from 17 to 57% (Boyacá), from 35 to 86% (Valledupar) and 31 at 60% (Risaralda). Unlike other studies, the aerosol optical depth values increased up to 59% during the months of lockdown compared to previous years and up to 70% of the weekly mean when compared to before the lockdown. These spatiotemporal behaviors of PM2.5 and the aerosol optical depth in Colombia are influenced by reductions in vehicular flow during quarantine, regional rainfall, and height of the planetary boundary layer.

However, hydrogen is associated with an embrittlement phenomenon that imparts substantial damage to the infrastructure by reducing the ductility, fracture strength, strength bearing capacity, etc., of metallic components. Therefore, understanding hydrogen-induced crack initiation mechanisms in metals are of prime importance. Greater insights into this critical phenomenon are expected if the hydrogen-induced crack initiation can be correlated with the local microstructure and corresponding stress-strain state towards their propensity for hydrogen accumulation. With this motivation, in this work, crack initiation is studied for the uncharged and hydrogen charged nickel specimens during in-situ tensile loading under the scanning electron microscope. By assuming the material to be elastic at low strains, a novel approach is implemented for generating the microstructural stress maps through strain and stiffness tensor extracted at each point in the region of interest on the specimen surface using high-resolution digital image correlation (HR-DIC) and Euler angles (given by electron backscattered diffraction data), respectively. Based on this analysis at low strain, the crack initiation sites for uncharged and hydrogen charged nickel specimens are correlated with microstructural maps of maximum Schmid factor, elastic modulus in the loading direction, hydrostatic stress, von Mises stress, and triaxiality factor. The analysis highlighted two independent factors responsible for hydrogen enhanced decohesion (HEDE) based intergranular failure observed only at the random grain boundaries, (i) strain localization due to hydrogen enhanced localized plasticity (HELP) mechanism of hydrogen embrittlement, and (ii) hydrostatic stress-based hydrogen diffusion to the crack initiation sites. These critical insights thus can help to design hydrogen embrittlement resistant metals. In addition, the novel experimental approach can be used to calibrate advance micromechanical models while providing quantitative estimate of the hydrogen distribution in realistic metallic microstructure responsible for hydrogen-assisted crack initiation with deformation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Crack initiation; Digital image correlation; Electron backscattered diffraction; Hydrogen embrittlement; Stress maps","Crack initiation; Cracks; Factor analysis; Fracture toughness; Global warming; Grain boundaries; Hydraulics; Hydrogen embrittlement; Image segmentation; Nickel; Nickel metallography; Scanning electron microscopy; Strain; Stress analysis; Textures; Crack initiation sites; Electron back-scattered diffraction; Experimental approaches; High resolution digital images; Hydrogen-enhanced decohesion; Hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticities; Metallic microstructures; Random grain boundaries; Loading",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100396298

Several variable valve timing strategies can be used to achieve an increment in the after-treatment upstream temperature by increasing the residual gas amount. In this study, a one-dimensional gas dynamics engine model has been used to carry out a simulation study comparing several exhaust variable valve actuation strategies. A steady-state analysis has been done in order to evaluate the potential of the different strategies at different operating points. Finally, the effect on the after-treatment warm-up, fuel economy and pollutant emission levels was evaluated over the worldwide harmonized light vehicles test cycle. As a conclusion, the combination of an advanced exhaust (early exhaust valve opening and early exhaust valve closing) and a delayed intake (late intake valve opening and late intake valve closing) presented the best trade-off between exhaust temperature increment and fuel consumption, which achieved a mean temperature increment during low-speed phase of the worldwide harmonized light vehicles test cycle of 27 °C with a fuel penalty of 6%. The exhaust valve re-opening technique offers a worse trade-off. However, the exhaust valve re-opening leads to lower nitrogen oxide (29% less) and carbon monoxide (11% less) pollutant emissions. © IMechE 2020.","after-treatment thermal management; diesel engine emissions; light-duty diesel engine; light-off temperature; one-dimensional model; Variable valve actuation; variable valve timing; world harmonized light-duty vehicle test procedure","Carbon monoxide; Economic and social effects; Fuel economy; Fuels; Gas dynamics; Intake valves; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Temperature control; Testing; After-treatment; Diesel engine emissions; Light duty vehicles; Light-duty diesel engines; Light-off temperatures; One-dimensional model; Variable valve actuation; Variable valve timing; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077540207

While work has rapidly progressed to understand the physics and chemistry in this environment, much less is known about the microorganisms present despite the fact that they are responsible for vital biogeochemical processes. This paper presents a review of the current state of knowledge of microbes within beach aquifers and the mechanisms that control the beach aquifer microbiome. We review literature describing the distribution and diversity of microorganisms in the freshwater-saltwater mixing zone of beach aquifers, and identify just 12 papers. We highlight knowledge gaps, as well as future research directions: The understanding of beach aquifer microorganisms is informed primarily by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences. Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics have not yet been applied but are promising approaches for elucidating key metabolic and ecological roles of microbes in this environment. Additionally, variability in field sampling and analytical methods restrict comparison of data across studies and geographic locations. Further, documented evidence on the migration of microbes within the beach aquifer is limited. Taking into account the physical transport of microbes through sand by flowing groundwater may be critical for understanding the structure and dynamics of microbial communities. Quantitative measurements of rates of elemental cycling in the context of microbial diversity need further investigation, in order to understand the roles of microbes in mediating biogeochemical fluxes from the beach aquifer to the coastal ocean. Lastly, understanding the current state of beach aquifers in regulating carbon stocks is critical to foster a better understanding of the contribution of the beach aquifer microbiome to global climate models. © Copyright © 2021 Archana, Francis and Boehm.","biogeochemistry; coastal aquifers; groundwater; microbiome; sandy beach; subterranean estuary",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105957882

Here, we apply a bio-economic approach to assess the potential economic value of seasonal climate forecasts (SCFs) as a basis for climate services for use in agricultural decision-making. We use a case study approach, quantifying the impacts of seasonal precipitation on rice cropping, a dominant farming system in the Greater Mekong Region (GMR) in Southeast Asia. We demonstrate values of seasonal precipitation forecasts for a range of forecast skill levels from low to perfect skill for three seasonal precipitation conditions (wet, normal and dry), as well as extreme conditions (extreme wet and extreme dry). Based on our integrated bio-economic assessment and seasonal variation in precipitation, we identify an optimal rice sowing window, which potentially results in improved yield and economic benefits compared with the currently applied sowing window. Applying this approach using common rice varieties grown by farmers – specifically, the medium growth duration Jasmine rice and the short duration Vietnamese long grain white rice variety OM 5451 – we find significant value in using seasonal precipitation forecasts to identify optimal sowing windows, ranging from an average of $135 ha−1 for precipitation forecasts at the current level (70% accuracy) of forecast skill to $220 ha−1 for perfect (100% accurate) precipitation forecasts. We propose that such a framework can be used to examine the value of using seasonal climate forecasts, even at current skill levels, in farm adaptive operational decision-making. We envisage that demonstration of the value of using seasonal forecasts in crop production system decisions will build user confidence and help in upscaling the use of climate information in the region and more broadly. © 2021 The Author(s)","Adaptation; Agricultural climate services; Bio-economic framework; Climate risk management; Cropping decisions; Optimal sowing window","climate change; conceptual framework; cropping practice; decision making; seasonal variation; sowing; weather forecasting; Southeast Asia; Jasminum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109967580

This paper addresses this important gap by evaluating the opportunities and barriers to the uptake of climate information (from short-term weather forecasts, through seasonal forecasts to longer-term climate change information on decadal timescales) by smallholder farmers in the Sudan savannah agro-ecological zone of Ghana. The paper answers the following research questions: i) what kinds of weather and climate information are available and accessible to smallholder farmers for agricultural management decision-making? ii) what opportunities exist for using climate information in agricultural systems in the Sudan savannah agro-ecological zone? iii) what are the key barriers to the uptake of climate information by smallholder farmers in the Sudan savannah agro-ecological zones of Ghana? The study used participatory approaches including household surveys with 555 farmers, 3 stakeholder workshops, 15 key informant interviews and 12 focus group discussions across 6 communities in the Sudan savannah agro-ecological zone. Findings show that more than a third of the study respondents (40%; n = 555) were not receiving climate information. Out of the 60% receiving climate information, the majority (91%; n = 335) indicated receiving information on rainfall with fewer respondents 21% and 26% receiving information on temperature and windstorms, respectively. Radio was the key medium for receiving weather and climate information. Both female and male smallholder farmers were using climate information to make critical farming decisions including time of land preparations (79%), crop variety selection (50%), changing cropping patterns (36%), planting time adjustments (31%), harvesting time (21%) and disease/pest management (10%). Increasing uptake of weather and climate information is confronted with multiple barriers including inadequate information on seasonal forecast for long-term planning, low accessibility of climate information, high levels of illiteracy, difficulties in understanding technical language used in communicating climate information and misalignment between the climate information provided and what smallholder farmers need. Climate information should be linked directly to agricultural impacts and management decision-making to ensure it is both available to, and usable by smallholder farmers. © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate information services; Climate variability; Smallholder farmers; Sub-Saharan Africa; Sustainable development","agroecology; climate change; farming system; information management; smallholder; sustainable development; Ghana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103303770

This paper determines how climate information services have been incorporated into national policies by Anglophone West African states for building agricultural resilience and provides a detailed analysis of issues facing Ghanaian agricultural systems. The paper addresses the questions: (i) to what extent is climate change recognised as a threat to agricultural development in national climate facing policies of Anglophone West African states? (ii) to what extent have climate information services been incorporated into national and regional policy frameworks of Anglophone West African states for resilient agricultural systems? (iii) what are the key challenges in mainstreaming climate information services into national policies for resilient agricultural building in Ghana? The study employed thematic content analysis, multi-stakeholder workshops and expert interviews to understand climate discourses around climate services. Findings show that climate change is highlighted in national and regional level policies as a serious threat to socioeconomic development and agricultural productivity in West Africa. Anglophone West Africa countries are at various stages in establishing a National Framework for Climate Services to help guide future adaptation planning. This study shows that Anglophone West African states have not yet incorporated climate information services into strategic national and regional climate facing policies that are critical in shaping efforts aimed at managing climate risks. For the case of Ghana, the study reveals low awareness of climate change among policy-makers, human and institutional capacity constraints as some of the key factors militating against the mainstreaming of climate information services.

Thus, the pursuit of economic development through industrialisation has equally nurtured numerous environmental disasters with accompanying catastrophic health effects. China is one of the countries with high carbon emissions, but new policy changes have resulted in massive gains in controlling environmental damage while enhancing the environment‐related quality of life. This paper combines the six‐step integrative review strategy with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) strategy to determine appropriate exclusion and inclusion criteria to explore the available stock of literature. We note that overall pollution in China fell by 10% between 2014 and 2019 whereas the average fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration of 93 micrograms per cubic meter reduced by 47% by 2019. Beijing exhibited the top 200 most polluted cities in 2019 after recording the lowest PM2.5 ever. All cities that implemented the 2012 Environmental Air Quality Standards reduced the average concentration of PM2.5 and sulfur dioxide by 42–68% by the end of 2018. Improvements in freshwater quality and a decline in water pollution levels were recorded despite increases in economic growth, urbanisation, energy use, trade openness, and agriculture, all of which are major stimulants of pollution. Deterring environmental tariff, tight ecological inspections, closing down of non‐compliant producers, heavy investment in environmental control, and the ambitious five year‐plan to revitalise renewable energy goals emanating from China’s ecological civilisation masterplan are responsible for these improvements in air and water pollution. China needs to work more aggressively to consolidate the gains already made in order to quicken the actualisation of the ecological civilisation and beautiful China dream. © 2021 by the authors.

Today, a significant amount of concrete waste generated by various demolition and other activities is not fully utilized in infrastructure projects within Helsinki; as a result, a portion of concrete waste generated in the city is be transported to other sites outside the Helsinki metropolitan area. In Helsinki, large-scale land reclamation projects have been implemented, and this trend will continue in the near future. Utilization of concrete waste as fill material in land reclamation projects will reduce the need to transport concrete waste outside the Helsinki metropolitan area, with a concurrent reduction in need to transport blasted rock to the land reclamation sites. This will promote reuse and recycling of waste and will reduce heavy traffic and CO2 emissions. Crushed concrete has not been previously tested in Finland as a fill material in land reclamation projects subjected to deep compaction methods. In 2018-2019 suitability of crushed concrete for land reclamation purposes was tested in a full-scale dynamic compaction test. The objective of the test was to assess the degree of compaction produced by dynamic compaction, determine the compression rate of compacted layers under pre-loading embankment, and measure environmental impacts of the fill material. The pilot structure was implemented in Tritoninpuisto (Triton Park) located in the southern part of Jatkasaari. Crushed concrete with varying grain size was compacted using the dynamic compaction method. All materials compacted well. Results of the pilot study indicate that dynamic compaction can be applied to densify crushed concrete fill material for land reclamation. Settlement plates on the top and the bottom of the pilot structure were used to monitor short-term settlement during dynamic compaction and long-term settlement after completion of the work. Long-term settlement was minor after compaction and placement of a pre-loading embankment.

Doing so quickly through a buildup of natural gas generating capacity as a replacement for coal-fired capacity can greatly aid in lowering near-term emissions towards the Agreement target to limit future climate impact to well below 2 °C but would incur stranded costs as natural gas assets are retired before their end-of-life age. The stranding of such capital investment may inhibit efforts to further decarbonize the world economy because of technology lock-in. One possible solution to reduce such stranded costs is to mitigate CO2 emissions from the existing coal-fleet. For the evaluation of the costs and emissions, we develop a novel method that uses unique coal-fired electric generating unit (EGU) characteristics to evaluate multiple mitigation-technology options under local fuel prices; the result of which is a least-cost mitigation frontier for nine EGU-specific mitigation solutions created within a common assessment framework. With this EGU-specific method, we find the mitigation options that achieve the lowest capital cost and levelized cost of electricity to meet CO2 emission-intensity reduction-targets for a representative EGU in the U.S. coal-fired fleet and use this method to analyze the uncertainty for these deterministic solutions. For this EGU, we find that the portfolio of mitigations defining the frontier is sensitive to fuel price variation, as well as other EGU-specific factors such as efficiency and retirement age. A probabilistic analysis of projected fuel prices indicates that mitigation decision-related regret can be high but may be limited to specific intensity targets. A further insight is that for deep CO2 mitigation, high capital costs and predominantly low natural gas prices may limit the viability of coal-fired EGUs retrofitted with carbon capture and storage with an auxiliary power system, even with a tax credit (e.g., Section 45Q of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018). © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate policy; Decarbonization; Emission-reduction strategy; Least-cost frontier; Regret; Stranded assets","Budget control; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal storage; Economics; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Investments; Natural gas; Natural gas wells; Natural gasoline plants; Taxation; Uncertainty analysis; Capital investment; Coal-fired capacity; Coal-fired power plant; Generating capacity; Levelized cost of electricities; Mitigation options; Probabilistic analysis; Technology options; Cost reduction; carbon dioxide; climate effect; coal-fired power plant; economic conditions; environmental economics; global economy; natural gas; replacement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100876325

To inform the carbon policy development of China's manufacturing industry, this study constructed a DEA-GS (data envelopment analysis and grid search) model from a cost perspective to understand the their emission reduction characteristics. Using a large sample of manufacturing firms from 2008 to 2011, the carbon pricing and reduction potential of China's manufacturing firms was explored by analyzing the firms' marginal abatement costs. The results showed that: (a) with increasing marginal abatement costs, the growth rates of both cumulative emission reduction activities and emission reduction of these firms gradually slowed down. When the marginal abatement cost exceeds 200 Yuan/ton, neither the number of reduction activities nor the amount of reduced emissions increase. (b) The impact of marginal abatement costs on the numbers of reduction activities and firms in each sub-sector is heterogeneous. (c) The emission reduction behaviors of manufacturting firms, determined by carbon pricing, are mostly concentrated in developed areas or around large cities. In contrast, areas with substantial emission reductions are more scattered. The results suggest that The emission reduction characteristics of sub-sectors should be fully considered when formulating carbon policies for China's manufacturing industry.

Household energy consumption is uncontrolled under the current policy both in the developed and developing countries, which is inefficient towards an ambitious climate target. Household participation in emission trading scheme (ETS) is a valuable solution. Enhancing understanding of socioeconomic impacts of the policy will facilitate the deployment and development on ground in the countries with ETS. The dynamic computable general equilibrium model with extended linear expenditure system and emission trading scheme, is used to analyze the impacts. With the case study of China, we find that compared with ETS without household participation, household participation can reduce 45.5% and 28.1% of carbon emissions of rural and urban households, reduce 13.60–14.01% of carbon mitigation cost, reduce household welfare loss and influence social equity in 2050. The allocation mechanism of carbon allowances has significant impact on household welfare and social equity. The methodology can be applied in other regions to explore the magnitude of impacts. This study evidences the benefits of household participation in ETS, and provides policy-makers some insights to design a careful and reasonable household carbon reduction policy around the world. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Allocation mechanism; Computable general equilibrium (CGE) model; Emission trading scheme (ETS); Household participation","Carbon; Commerce; Developing countries; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Allocation mechanism; Carbon allowances; Carbon mitigation; Computable general equilibrium; Dynamic computable general equilibrium models; Emission trading scheme; Household energy consumption; Socio-economic impacts; Economic and social effects; carbon emission; computable general equilibrium analysis; developing world; emissions trading; methodology; policy approach; policy making; pollution policy; social participation; socioeconomic impact; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101080007

This study tested if split applying enhanced efficiency fertilizers (EEFs) resulted in lower N2O emissions than applying equivalent rates of urea at planting. In semiarid southern Alberta, field trials were conducted during three years (planting to harvest) in rainfed winter wheat crops. Annual fertilizer rates ranged from 146 to 176 kg N ha−1. Fertilizer types were urea, and three EEFs (polymer-coated urea, urea with urease and nitrification inhibitors, and urea with a nitrification inhibitor). Each fertilizer type was applied three ways: 100% banded at planting, split applied 30% banded at planting and 70% broadcast in late fall, and split applied 30% banded at planting and 70% broadcast at Feekes growth stage 4 (GS4, post-tiller formation, wheat entering the greening up phase in the early spring). Nitrous oxide was measured using static chambers between sub-weekly and monthly from planting to harvest. Over three years, cumulative N2O emissions ranged from 0.16 to 1.32 kg N ha−1. This was equivalent to emissions factors between 0.009 and 0.688%. Cumulative N2O emissions and emissions factors did not differ between fertilizer types, but they were lower when fertilizer was split applied at GS4 compared to in late fall (P ≤ 0.10). Our study suggests that EEFs do not reduce N2O emissions from rainfed winter wheat crops, but a well-timed split application with a majority of fertilizer applied after winter can minimize N2O emissions. © 2021, Crown.","Nitrification inhibitor; Nitrogen fertilizer; Polymer-coated urea; Urease inhibitor","fertilizer application; nitrification; nitrous oxide; semiarid region; wheat; winter; Alberta; Canada; Alberta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101428324

However, to predict emissions, reliable predictive models are required. Among the promising methods capable of predicting pollutant emissions with a long chemical time scale, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), is conditional moment closure (CMC). However, the practical application of this method to turbulent premixed flames depends on the precision of the conditional scalar dissipation rate, 〈Nc |ζ〉, model. In this study, an alternative closure for this term is implemented in the RANS-CMC method. The method is validated against the velocity, temperature, and gas composition measurements of lean premixed flames close to blow-off, within the limit of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) capability. Acceptable agreement is achieved between the predicted and measured values near the burner, with an average error of 15%. The model reproduces the flame characteristics; some discrepancies are found within the recirculation region due to significant turbulence intensity. © 2021 by the authors.

This combines some advanced formulations for the deposition mechanisms of sedimentation, inertial impaction, turbulent impaction and interception. The scheme also considers bouncing effects. The input quantities relate to the canopy elements (Leaf Area Density, leaf equivalent diameter, leaf shape, orientation and roughness parameters), the transporting fluid (local mean velocity, friction velocity) and the particulate matter (PM local mean concentration, median diameter and density). The deposition scheme is coupled with a well-known Lagrangian Stochastic model for pollutant dispersion, the Open-Source code SPRAY-WEB (Università del Piemonte Orientale et al.). The coupled numerical solution is validated on a laboratory test case representing the dispersion of particulate matter from two line sources within a canopy atmospheric boundary layer. The deposition interfaces are represented by the trees of a scaled spruce forest. Validation refers to the average vertical profile of the deposited mass (not the mean concentration) normalized by the above-canopy mean concentration. Some inter-comparisons are also reported considering uniform Leaf Area Density, the additional effects of molecular diffusion, the height-dependent relative contribution of each deposition mechanism and an alternative deposition scheme. The results of this test case are available as a FOSS tutorial. Considering the Fractional Bias obtained for the deposited mass (FB = 27%), this numerical solution seems suitable to simulating stationary dispersion phenomena within complex canopy boundary layers, assessing the height-dependent dry deposition fluxes of atmospheric PM. The current numerical solution might be improved and applied to elevated obstacles such as electric insulators.

The ability of cassava to withstand difficult growing conditions and long-term storability underground makes it a resilient crop, contributing to food security. Historically, small-scale farmers have grown cassava as a minor crop in the far north-eastern part of the country. However, there is an initiative to scale up cassava production, with two discrete areas of interest: large-scale production for industrial starch, and expanding its footprint as a food security crop for small-scale farmers, especially in the context of climate change. In this scoping study, production, processing and marketing data for cassava were accessed from the FAO and US Commercial trade databases. Other domestic market and demand analysis case studies were also explored. There is no cassava data available for South Africa. The study indicated that South Africa imports more than 66,000 tons of starch annually, of which 33% is cassava starch, showing the availability of a local market. The potential of cassava for the South African economy is discussed. Significant industrial opportunities exist for the production and use of cassava in South Africa. However, the realization of these opportunities will depend on the reliable supply of good quality cassava roots. However, the lack of a well-established cassava research program, and a lack of an existing value chain for the industrial scale cassava production and processing are barriers to the development of cassava industry in South Africa. As the initial step to the development of a successful cassava industry, high potential germplasm is imported, characterized and bred for local conditions to ensure the sustainable primary production of cassava. Subsequently, industrial value chains will need to be developed as the optimization of the breeding and agronomy of the crop are completed, and yield potentials are quantified in the different regions of the country. © Copyright © 2021 Amelework, Bairu, Maema, Venter and Laing.","cassava breeding; climate change; import substitute; industrial application; value chain",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105145370

A significant improvement potential is given with the reduction of friction losses. Here, especially the friction between the piston ring and the cylinder liner is of interest. This article describes a study with the target to enhance the piston ring–cylinder liner conformation through increasing the roundness of the deformed liner during the warm operation state. The approach is based on the assumption that a non-circular liner in the cold state can deform due to thermal and mechanical stresses toward a circular shape under typical hot operation conditions. To test this hypothesis, a computational model for a gasoline engine was built and simulated using advanced finite element methods. The simulation describes the deformation process of the liner from the thermal and mechanical stresses. First, the deformation of a circular liner is simulated, showing asymmetric deformations of up to 30 µm in the warm state for the cylinder positioned at the end of the four-cylinder bank. As experimental data are readily available, a comparison was possible, showing good agreement. Then, three liner configurations with non-circular shape in the cold stage are investigated. For an elliptically shaped configuration, a nearly circular-shaped liner is reached under typical operation conditions. This numerical approach shows the potential for reduced friction of the piston–liner arrangement within internal combustion engines. The planned next step is the extension of this method to three-dimensional shape aspects and the application to the geometry of our test engine of our lab where friction can be measured in detail with a floating-liner measurement system. © IMechE 2019.","Cylinder liner; engine design; finite element method; non-circular liner; piston ring—cylinder liner conformation; thermal deformation","Combustion; Combustion equipment; Deformation; Engine pistons; Finite element method; Friction; Greenhouse gases; Machine design; Piston rings; Pistons; Computational model; Cylinder liners; Engine design; Non-circular; Numerical approaches; Operation conditions; Thermal deformation; Three-dimensional shape; Engine cylinders",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077381462

We explored natural saline habitats, mainly salt marsh (SM) and mangrove (M) sediments, as potential inoculum sources for enriching salt-tolerant CO2 reducing community using two enrichment strategies: H2:CO2 (80:20) enrichment in serum vials and enrichment in cathode chamber of MES reactors operated at −1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Porous ceramic hollow tube wrapped with carbon cloth was used as cathode and for direct CO2 delivery to CO2 reducing communities growing on the cathode surface. Methanogenesis was dominant in both the M- and SM-seeded MES and the methanogenic Archaea Methanococcus was the most dominant genus. Methane production was slightly higher in the SM-seeded MES (4.9 ± 1.7 mmol) compared to the M-seeded MES (3.8 ± 1.1 mmol). In contrast, acetate production was almost two times higher in the M-seeded MES (3.1 ± 0.9 mmol) than SM-seeded MES (1.5 ± 1.3 mmol). The high relative abundance of the genus Acetobacterium in the M-seeded serum vials correlates with the high acetate production obtained. The different enrichment strategies affected the community composition, though the communities in MES reactors and serum vials were performing similar functions (methanogenesis and acetogenesis). Despite similar operating conditions, the microbial community composition of M-seeded serum vials and MES reactors differed from the SM-seeded serum vials and MES reactors, supporting the importance of inoculum source in the evolution of CO2-reducing microbial communities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon capture and utilization; CO2 reduction; CO2 valorization; Dual-function cathode; Salt-tolerant chemolithoautotrophs","Carbon; Cathodes; Clothes; Forestry; Microorganisms; Sodium chloride; Tubes (components); Community composition; Marine environment; Methane production; Methanogenic archaea; Microbial communities; Microbial community composition; Operating condition; Relative abundance; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; methane; silver chloride; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon fixation; carbon monoxide; carbon sequestration; ceramics; community composition; methanogenesis; microbial community; porous medium; salt; valorization; Acetobacterium; acetogenesis; Article; correlational study; habitat; mangrove; Methanococcus; methanogenesis; microbial community; nonhuman; population abundance; porosity; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); salt marsh; salt tolerance; sediment; ceramics; electrode; Acetobacterium; Archaea; Methanococcus; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Ceramics; Electrodes; Porosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092666502

The NASA Goddard Geo-CAPE Airborne Simulator (GCAS), an ultra-violet visible spectrometer, piggybacked on the aircraft mission to allow continuous hyper-spectral measurements at high spectral and spatial resolutions simultaneously with optical lightning detection by the Fly’s Eye GLM Simulator while overflying convective systems. NO2 columns retrieved from GCAS were used to estimate the moles of NOx produced per flash, referred to as lightning NOx production efficiency (LNOx PE) for convective systems over the United States and western Atlantic. The mean PE was determined to be 360 ± 180 mol per flash for optically detected GLM flashes and 230 ± 115 mol per flash for radio-wave detected Earth Networks Total Lightning Network flashes. These values span the commonly cited range of 100–500 mol per flash for midlatitude flashes. LNOx PE was found to be positively correlated with GLM flash multiplicity and flash optical energy but negatively correlated with flash density. The positive correlations provide encouragement for PE parameterizations in terms of flash energy or multiplicity. Observations during the GOES-R PLT field campaign provide a preview of the analysis that will be possible when continuous lightning detection is coupled with hourly NO2 columns from a geostationary instrument such as Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution. © 2021.

Although the increase in heavy metals' (HMs) immobilization through pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of municipal sewage sludge are reported in previous investigations, but there is still limited information available regarding the potential environmental risks associated with these processes. This study investigated the chemical speciation, bioavailability and eco-toxicity of HMs (Zn, Cu, Ni and Pb) in biochars (pyrolysis temperatures of 450 °C and 600 °C) and hydrochars (HTC temperature of 180 °C) produced from two sludge feedstocks (sludge cake and stabilized sewage sludge). The HTC generally resulted in higher char yield compared to pyrolysis process. The raw sewage samples showed a flat morphological surface texture, while HTC process increased the porosity and surface area of produced hydrochars. The pyrolysis process also increased the porous structures and surface morphology of biochars, with higher porosity in biochars produced at 600 °C. The pH value of hydrochars was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than the sludge feedstock, while pyrolysis process significantly (P < 0.05) increased the pH value of produced biochars. The H/C and O/C ratios of char products were gradually decreased by increasing production temperature, illustrating the formation of higher aromaticity and stronger carbonization. The concentration order of HMs in sludge feedstock was Zn > Cu > Pb > Ni, and with thermochemical processes the concentration of HMs increased in biochar and hydrochar products. The enrichment of HMs in all biochars was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than hydrochars. The concentration of HMs significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in bioavailable fraction and increased in stable fraction during pyrolysis and HTC processes. Consequently, the potential environmental risk and eco-toxicity of HMs significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in hydrochars and biochars with low or no environmental risk of direct land application. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Heavy metals; Hydrothermal carbonization; Potential ecological risk; Pyrolysis treatment; Risk assessment","Biochemistry; Carbonization; Chemical speciation; Economic and social effects; Economics; Feedstocks; Heavy metals; Morphology; pH; Porosity; Sewage sludge; Surface morphology; Textures; Thermochemistry; Toxicity; Bioavailable fraction; Environmental issues; Environmental risks; Hydrothermal carbonization; Increasing production; Municipal sewage sludge; Pyrolysis temperature; Thermo chemical process; Pyrolysis; activated sludge; bioavailability; economic development; ecotoxicology; environmental issue; environmental risk; heavy metal; hydrothermal activity; immobilization; pyrolysis; sewage treatment; socioeconomic impact; urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100381327

Since such shifts in the climate, the substantial agriculture sector of Pakistan has been suffering widely from its drastic change. The present study is carried out in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province of Pakistan, to explore the perception of smallholder farmers related to climate change. Data is collected from 400 smallholder farmers of Malakand, Mardan and Swabi districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. This study expounds the perception of farmers and their farming adaptations to variations in climatic occurrence. Binary logistic regression was employed to discover the aspects that shape smallholder farmer's adaptation strategies. Our results depicted that the awareness and farm household's exploits methods for climate change adaptation were common throughout the study area. The main adaptation strategies carried out or executed by the smallholder farmers were irrigation, non-farm activities and early planting schemas. This research identified the barriers to climate change adaptation were lack of money, unavailability of required seed, nonexistence of market access, insecure land tenure system and shortage of information. The findings of the study recommend improving farmer's awareness and providing timely information about climate change. To improve farmer's well-being, adequate extension services and greater investment facilities are required to support farmers to sustain their livelihoods in the long run to cope with climate change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation strategies; Climate change; Pakistan; Perception; Smallholder farmers","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Logistic regression; Adaptation strategies; Agriculture sectors; Binary logistic regression; Climate change adaptation; Coping strategies; Farmers perception; Market access; Smallholder farmers; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097080670

Quantifying these changes in environmental conditions due to government-enforced containment measures provides a unique opportunity to understand the patterns, origins and impacts of air pollutants. During the lockdown in Pakistan, a significant reduction in energy demands and a decline of ∼1786 GWh (gigawatt hours) in electricity generation is reported. We used satellite observational data for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), aerosol optical depth (AOD) and land surface temperature (LST) to explore the associated environmental impacts of shifts in energy demands and emissions across Pakistan. During the strict lockdown period (March 23 to April 15, 2020), we observed a reduction in NO2 emissions by 40% from coal-based power plants followed by 30% in major urban areas compared to the same period in 2019. Also, around 25% decrease in AOD (at 550 nm) thickness in industrial and energy sectors was observed although no major decrease was evident in urban areas. Most of the industrial regions resumed emissions during the 3rd quarter of April 2020 while the urban regions maintained reduced emissions for a longer period. Nonetheless, a gradual increase has been observed since April 16 due to relaxations in lockdown implementations. Restrictions on transportation in the cities resulted in an evident drop in the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect, particularly in megacities. The changes reported as well as the analytical framework provides a baseline benchmark to assess the sectoral pollution contributions to air quality, especially in the scarcity of ground-based monitoring systems across the country. © 2021 The Author(s)","Air pollution; COVID-19; Energy emissions; Lockdown; Nitrogen dioxide (NO2); Pakistan","Air quality; Atmospheric temperature; Benchmarking; Carbon monoxide; Energy utilization; Industrial emissions; Land surface temperature; Landforms; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Aerosol optical depths; Coal based power plants; Electricity generation; Environmental conditions; Ground-based monitoring; Industrial activities; Reduction in energy consumption; Surface urban heat islands; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099522235

Nonetheless agriculture also contributes to global warming through the emission of greenhouse gases such as CO2, CH4 and N2O. Yet this complex conundrum can be alleviated and mitigated through sound soil and water management practices. Despite considerable literature on Conservation Agriculture (CA) as a strategy to improve the resilience and mitigation capacity of agroecosystems, there is still paucity of information on the impacts of CA on crop production and environmental quality on the Plateau. In order to fill this gap this study examined the effects of no-till and straw mulch on crop productivity and greenhouse gas fluxes in agroecosystems on the Plateau where farmers’ common practice of conventional tillage (CT) was tested against three CA practices: conventional tillage with straw mulch (CTS), no-till (NT) and no-till with straw mulch (NTS). The results indicated that all three CA practices (CTS, NT and NTS) markedly increased soil water content (SWC), soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) but reduced soil temperature (ST). Average grain yields were 854.46 ± 76.51, 699.30 ± 133.52 and 908.18±38.64 kg ha-1 respectively under CTS, NT and NTS indicating an increase by approximately 33%, 9% and 41% respectively compared with CT (644.61 ± 76.98 kg ha-1). There were significant (p &lt; 0.05) reductions of Net CO2 emissions under NT (7.37 ± 0.89 tCO2e ha-1y-1) and NTS (6.65 ± 0.73 tCO2e ha-1y-1) compared with CTS (10.65 ± 0.18 tCO2e ha-1y-1) and CT (11.14 ± 0.58 tCO2e ha-1y-1). All the treatments served as sinks of CH4but NTS had the highest absorption capacity (-0.27 ± 0.024 tCO2e ha-1y-1) and increased absorption significantly (p &lt; 0.05) compared with CT (-0.21 ± 0.017 tCO2e ha-1y-1); however, CA did not reduce emissions of N2O. These had an influence on Global warming potential (GWP) as NT and NTS resulted in significant reduction in net GWP. Grain yield was significantly correlated positively with SOC and STN (p &lt; 0.05); ecosystem respiration was also significantly correlated with SWC and ST while CH4 flux was highly correlated with ST (p &lt; 0.001). Crop yield and GHG responses to CA were controlled by soil hydrothermal and nutrient changes, thus improving these conditions through adoption of sustainable soil moisture improvement practices such as no-till, straw mulch, green manuring, contour ploughing and terracing can improve crop resilience to climate change and reduce GHG emissions in arid and semi-arid regions.

The mentioned goal is of special interest for regions like the Mediterranean where the average temperature is rising above the world average with the consequential risk for the future viability of its different ecosystems. The objective of this work is to analyze if the commitments of the Mediterranean Basin countries submitted under the Paris Agreement framework are in line with the 1.5 °C goal. For this analysis, the cumulative emissions of the current Nationally Determined Contributions of these countries until 2030, are compared with the result obtained from distributing the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions compatible with the 1.5 °C global mitigation scenario between 2018 and 2100. This distribution is obtained using the Model of Climate Justice that allocates the global emissions by using equity criteria (equality and responsibility) that take into consideration the historical responsibility for each country, in the period from 1994 to 2017. There are two main conclusions from the analysis of the NDCs. Firstly, it is concluded that the Mediterranean Basin countries, as a whole, are not in line with the 1.5 °C goal, because by 2030, 77% of the emissions budget that should be available until 2100, based on the equity criteria aforementioned, will already have been emitted. And, secondly, when the NDCs for each one of the countries are compared, some significant differences in the degree of ambition can be seen. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Climate Justice; Cumulative emissions; Mediterranean; Mitigation; NDCs; Paris Agreement","Budget control; Climate models; Greenhouse gases; Climate justices; Cumulative emissions; Emissions reduction; Global emissions; Mediterranean basin; Gas emissions; climate change; climate modeling; emission control; environmental justice; environmental risk; future prospect; international agreement; mitigation; Mediterranean Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104944898

They were well respected for their ability to unite the world’s countries on some issues. The paradigm transformation of UN ratifications to combine both business models and social justice has received both positive and negative responses. While adherents argue that such a transformation is fundamental to boost economic development, opponents assert that the ‘so-called paradigm transformation’ has benefited the West by victimising the East, which has essentially complicated the global ‘sustainability crisis’. This also hinders executing the ESD (education for sustainable development) concept, especially in developing countries. The concept of ‘sustainable development’ is now the main agenda item of UN conventions. COP21 (United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2015, otherwise known as the 21st Conference of the Parties), is an example of the UN’s seriousness in addressing the ‘global sustainability crisis’. GATT and GATS are the international policies that are, respectively, the ‘causer’ and ‘developer’ of the private university sector in emerging market economies. Critics claim that this expanding sector generates an urban sustainability crisis. This study examined the effect of private universities’ expansion on urban sustainability, using a qualitative method for assessing primary and secondary data. The indices for night light intensity, heat and greenery served as the essential parameters to calculate the sustainability crisis. Results indicate that while the greenery index has fallen significantly, night light and heat indices have unexpectedly increased, which correlate with the development and expansion of the private university sector. To respond to COP21, a ‘carbon neutrality’ policy framework for the sector is suggested in an effort to control the sustainability crisis. © 2021 by the authors.

For power plants integrated with CO2 capture, optimal operation of the capture unit at part-load and variable capture conditions can be exploited to reduce the operating costs. This paper presents insights into the performance of a reference monoethanolamine (MEA)-based post-combustion CO2 capture unit under steady-state part-load and variable capture operations. A rigorous plant-wide model for the capture unit is developed in the Institute for Design of Advanced Energy Systems computational platform. The contactor model is validated with the data from a wetted wall column (WWC) and two pilot plants. The plant-wide model is used for steady-state optimization under part-load operations and variable capture rates using flue gas similar to pulverized coal and natural gas-combined cycle power plants. Analysis on the performance of the reference rich/lean amine heat exchanger shows that the hot-end temperature approach can considerably vary under part-load operations for a given heat exchanger area. The study shows that if the plant is not optimally operated under part-load and variable capture operations, there can be a high penalty depending on the deviation of the liquid/gas flowrate with respect to its optimal value. This study shows that the optimal operation of an existing capture unit is crucial for minimizing the energy penalty under part-load and variable capture operations. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal combustion; Combined cycle power plants; Ethanolamines; Heat exchangers; Operating costs; Pilot plants; Pulverized fuel; Advanced energy systems; Computational platforms; Heat-exchanger areas; Model development; Natural gas combined cycles; Part load operation; Steady-state optimization; Wetted-wall columns; Natural gasoline plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105112663

Socio-ecological data including estimated resident population, percentage of Indigenous population, housing structure (specifically terrace house), socio-economic index and land use types for each SLA were obtained from Australian Bureau of Statistics, and Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, respectively. To quantify the relationship between dengue, climate and socio-ecological factors, multivariate Poisson regression models in a Bayesian framework were developed with a conditional autoregressive prior structure. Posterior parameters were estimated using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation with Gibbs sampling. Results: In the tropical climate zone of Queensland, the estimated number of dengue cases was predicted to increase by 85% [95% Credible Interval (CrI): 25%, 186%] and 7% (95% CrI: 0.1%, 14%) for a 1-mm increase in average annual rainfall and 1% increase in the proportion of terrace houses, respectively. The estimated spatial variation (structured random effects) was small compared to the remaining unstructured variation, suggesting that the inclusion of covariates resulted in no residual spatial autocorrelation in dengue data. Conclusions: Climate and socio-ecological factors explained much of the heterogeneity of dengue transmission dynamics in the tropical climate zone of Queensland. Results will help to further understand the risk factors of dengue transmission and will provide scientific evidence in designing effective local dengue control programs in the most needed areas. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Bayesian analysis; Dengue; Spatial analysis; Tropical climate zone","rain; autocorrelation; Bayesian analysis; dengue fever; heterogeneity; Markov chain; Poisson ratio; risk factor; simulation; spatial analysis; terrace; Bayes theorem; climate change; dengue; disease transmission; ecology; human; land use; Markov chain Monte Carlo method; nonhuman; priority journal; Queensland; social aspect; spatial analysis; temperature; tropic climate; animal; Australia; dengue; incidence; Australia; Queensland; Animals; Australia; Bayes Theorem; Dengue; Incidence; Queensland; Spatial Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094605058

However, the decision-making process in climate adaptation is complex. To better understand the dynamics of the process, we strive to answer this question: what are the potential trade-offs and synergies related to decision-making and implementation of climate adaptation strategies among smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa region? A systematic literature review methodology was used through the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement with the four-stage inclusion/exclusion criteria to identify the literature from selected databases (Scopus and Google Scholar). The climate adaptation strategies are organized into five broad categories (crop management, risk management, soil/land management, water management, and livestock management strategies). Evidence suggests that potential trade-offs may arise concerning added costs, additional labor requirements, and competition among objectives or available resources. The synergies, on the other hand, arise from implementing two or more adaptation strategies concurrently in respect of increased productivity, resilience, yield stability, sustainability, and environmental protection. Trade-offs and synergies may also differ among the various adaptation strategies with minimum/zero tillage, comparatively, presenting more trade-offs. The development and promotion of low-cost adaptation strategies and complementary climate adaptation options that minimize the trade-offs and maximize the synergies are suggested. Skills and knowledge on proper implementation of climate change adaptation strategies are encouraged, especially at the local farm level. © 2021 Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Adaptation strategy; Climate change; Sub-Saharan Africa; Synergies; Trade-offs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118613471

With this overwhelming growth, the country is experiencing a higher level of carbon emissions. Amid this backdrop, China is under immense pressure to reduce carbon emissions up to a sustainable level. This study adapted 31 provincial panel data from 2007 to 2017 using factor analysis system SBM-undesirable model to calculate the agro-ecological output of each province respectively and used a carbon transfer network impact analysis panel to calculate ecological performance impacts. Results show that (1) overall agro-ecological efficiency in China shows an upward trend but regional differences are evident. The efficiency in the eastern region is higher than that in the central and western regions but the extent of informatization in the central region is higher than that in the western region. (2) Informatization will significantly promote agro-ecological efficiency. (3) Changes in agricultural planting structure, agricultural value-added per capita, employment of human capital in the agricultural sector, and agricultural scale management are also important factors affecting agro-ecological growth.

Mangroves in Indonesia have a total area of 2.9 million hectares, 52 thousand hectares of them disappear every year and aquaculture is responsible for 40 percent. In contrast, with the level of mangroves damage threats is high, the level of sustainable ecosystem awareness is low. In accordance with previous studies, mangroves forests in Bintan Island have been cut down to supply combustion and ended up into charcoal. However, it can be minimized by enabling the local communities to avail themselves of carbon offset/conservation payments under approved climate change mitigation strategic-plans. The law enforcement of Law no 32 Year 2009 and the PERDA No. 14/2007 about neighboring Bintan Island Regional Coastal Planning were designed to support the Mangroves Conservation in Bintan Island.

The present study evaluates char dwellers’ risk perceptions and agricultural adaptations to climate change. Survey data were collected from 98 households, and focus group discussions were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire from Rydas Bari char under the Gaibandha District of Bangladesh. A standardized risk perception index was created using a four-point Likert scale against sixteen climatic events. In addition, a binary logit model was used to estimate the influence of socioeconomic characteristics of sample households on the decision to choose climate change adaptation strategies. Findings suggest that droughts, river erosion, and floods are the major climatic risks perceived by char dwellers. Additionally, results from a climate vulnerability index portray similar findings that char respondents are more exposed to diverse climatic hazards. The study further investigates local adaptation mechanisms in agriculture with regards to major climatic events. In response to the existing climate change risks, the char inhabitants employ several adaptation strategies in agriculture such as implementing new or alternative farming practices, changing planting times, and cultivating short-duration varieties. The llogit analysis suggests that household age, family size, annual income, farm size, farm ownership and farming experience have a significant influence on farmers' adaptation choices. Household access to education, early warning by extension agents, information on improved agricultural technologies, access to off-farm sources of income and incorporating char people during policy design can effectively enhance farmers’ resilience and help reduce vulnerability. © 2021 The Author(s)","Adaptation strategies; Agricultural adaptation; Climate change; Risk perception index; Riverine char dwellers","adaptation; agricultural development; climate change; cropping practice; farming system; risk perception; strategic approach; vulnerability; Bangladesh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100050214

However, assessments of the concept in supporting forest management, through its inclusion in forest policy, is yet to be fully understood in a developing-country context. We analysed national forest-related policy to determine if the elements of the ecosystem services concept or ecosystem services categories were represented in order to support regional and national forest and tree management and rural livelihoods in Bangladesh. Specifically we assessed the policy objectives, statements and proposed programmes of ten policy/legislative documents. We applied a weighted scoring system to assess the coherence between existing policies and the ecosystem services concept and three categories of ecosystem services (provisioning, regulating and cultural services). It was found that, while ecosystem services were mentioned in all forest-related policies in Bangladesh, only one policy covered the ecosystem services concept. No policies provided details on operational aspects, including ecosystem services assessment, the decision-making process and scales of implementation. Different specific forest- and tree-based ecosystem services were not identified clearly in any current policy. All policies reviewed explicitly mentioned regulating services (i.e. carbon sequestration and water regulation) more often than provisioning and cultural services. Given this, we recommend that the current policies should consider ecosystem services-based management goals and decision-making in order to maximise the local benefits of forests and trees in the contexts of diverse social-ecological systems. Different specific forest- and tree-based ecosystem services should be clearly identified in the current forestry and other natural resource management policies in order to enhance the synergy between forests and competing land management practices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity; Ecosystem services; Livelihoods; Policy; Sustainable forest management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101399466

Its effect may be decisive both globally and regionally. Climate change scenarios are a powerful tool for understanding climate change, charting response strategies and supporting climate policy making. Thus, the present research was conducted to foretaste climate change scenarios in Varanasi district, during 2015-2054 using simulated data of 5 CMIP3 GCMs and weighted ensemble method in comparison with observed data. Weighted ensemble method is also method, for diminishing uncertainty in simulated results. Their simulated monthly climatic parameters, that have been received from the CCCSN website of Canada, were downscaled by bilinear interpolation. Then results of 4 downscaled climatic parameters in seasonal and annual scale were validated along with their observed data using statistical formula (R, D, MSD, SB, SDSD and LCS). Results showed that, weighted ensemble method, is generally desirable and proper method, in reducing uncertainty in simulated results. According to the results obtained for the period 2015 to 2054, climate of Varanasi district will experience increased temperature in four seasons and a decrease in rainfall for SW monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. In addition, a decrease is anticipated in relative humidity in winter and summer seasons.

The application of accurate remote sensing data has greatly improved urban biomass estimation and modelling approaches due to development in new satellite sensors to address urban climate dynamics. For example, the launch of Sentinel-2 by the Copernicus programme of the European Union, which provides data down to 10 m, has been quite remarkable. In this study, four vegetation indices (VIs) were derived from the Sentinel-2 data for 2016 (the red and near-infrared bands (10 m)) which were atmospherically corrected by using the “Sen2Cor” tool. The sensitivities of the four VIs to biomass (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), difference vegetation index (DVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) were assessed through a predictive modelling approach using thirty sixty (36) plots belonging to eleven (11) different tree species sampled at different locations along the major streets in the study area. All VIs significantly correlate with the field estimated biomass (p < 0.0001) using Pearson's correlation. Based on the correlation between the VIs and field measured biomass, we established a simple linear model using the 64% of the field data for model estimation while retaining the remaining 36% for evaluating the model accuracy. The assessments of model performance using the mean absolute error (NDVI = 8.91%, SAVI = 8.92%, EVI2 = 8.94%) indicated that the DVI (9.43%) had the largest error. Urban biomass maps are required for urban vegetation monitoring, urban cool/heat island modelling, climate change mitigation and adaptation research and model parameterization and validation. © 2021","Biomass; Forest; Sentinel; Spectral-indices; Tropical-savanna",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102770495

Platooning involves multiple trucks following each other in close proximity, with only the lead truck being manually driven and the rest being controlled autonomously. This approach to semi-truck autonomy is easily integrated on existing platforms, reduces delivery times, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions via fuel economy benefits. Level 1 SAE fuel studies were performed on class-8 trucks operating with the Auburn Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) system, and fuel savings up to 10-12% were seen. Enabling platooning autonomy required the use of radar, global positioning systems (GPS), and wireless vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. Poor measurements and state estimates can lead to incorrect or missing positioning data, which can lead to unnecessary dynamics and finally wasted fuel. This is especially an issue if deceleration is applied in response to a bad measurement. In this study, a faulty radar was shown to cause a greater than 5% increase in fuel consumption. The mechanism of this fuel consumption increase is investigated and applied to other types of sensor failures to indicate their potential effects on fuel economy. This analysis indicates that poor GPS signals over short time can be largely filtered out, with no real gain or loss of fuel economy. V2V communications were intentionally limited by causing interference, which resulted in dropped communication packets over a small physical area, but not an appreciable impact on fuel economy. © 2021 SAE International.

Lovastatin (Lv) is a specific inhibitor of methanogenic archaea. Due to the high cost of pure Lv, solid-state fermentation might be an economical bioprocess to produce Lv and facilitate its use in ruminant nutrition. The goal of this work was to assess the effects of supplementing fermented oat straw as a lovastatin carrier (FOS) to a high-grain ration on in vitro CH4 inhibition and rumen microbiota in beef cattle. The experimental design of in vitro rumen fermentation was completely randomized with four concentrations of Lv in the diet mixture. The supplementation with FOS to give Lv concentration of 100 and 150 mg L−1 in the ruminal fermentation medium significantly inhibited methanogenesis at similar levels. This suggested that less than 20% of FOS was required in the ration to achieve up to 38% of CH4 mitigation without affecting the chemical composition and nutritional value of the ration. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production and profile showed that only the treatments with Lv at 100 and 150 mg L−1 decreased the concentration of total SCFAs; the molar ratio of propionate significantly increased with respect to that of the control. Treatment with Lv at 150 mg L−1 did not result in significant differences in the alpha and beta diversity indices compared to the control. However, significant changes in the relative abundance of some microorganisms were detected, such as an increase in Ruminococcus and a decrease in Prevotella. The predominant 99%+ MA in all controls, treatment, and inocula samples belonged to the Methanobrevibacter genus and very small (negligible) unclassified Methanobacterium genus (Euryarchaeota phylum). Interestingly, the reduction of relative abundance of MA was 39.17%, very close to the percent reduction of CH4 production, 38%. Our data showed that there was a parallel and similar percent decrease of both CH4 production and relative abundance of the predominant MA in our experiment, although the statistical significance was not complete. Finally, our results hold promise for significantly decreasing ruminal CH4 by 38%. Thus, our work is one step toward the sustainable management of the livestock sector. © Copyright © 2021 Ábrego-Gacía, Poggi-Varaldo, Mendoza-Vargas, Mercado-Valle, Ríos-Leal, Ponce-Noyola and Calva-Calva.","fermented oat straw; lovastatin; methanogenesis; microbiota; rumen","Agriculture; Fermentation; Mammals; Microorganisms; Molar ratio; Nutrition; Volatile fatty acids; Alpha and beta diversities; Chemical compositions; Methanogenic archaea; Ruminal fermentation; Short-chain fatty acids; Solid-state fermentation; Statistical significance; Sustainable management; Molar concentration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105407203

Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to investigate the reduction mechanisms of NOx to dinitrogen coupled to the hydroxylation of methane or benzene using the dicopper complex reported by Zhang and co-workers [ J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2019, 141, 10159-10164 ]. The B3LYP functional was used to optimize the (μ-oxo)(μ-nitrosyl)dicopper complex in the quartet state and the (μ-η2:η2-NO2)dicopper complex in the doublet state, the latter of which was found to be the ground state. Then, we investigated the reactivities of the (μ- η2:η2-NO2)dicopper complex toward methane and benzene by considering the conversions of N2O to N2 in the presence and the absence of methane or benzene. In the presence of methane and benzene, the calculated activation energies were 27.0 and 21.0 kcal/mol, respectively, whereas that with N2O alone was prohibitively high (61.9 kcal/mol). Thus, the (μ- η2:η2-NO2)dicopper complex prefers the reactions with methane and benzene to that with N2O. The reaction of the (μ- η2:η2-NO2)dicopper complex with methane or benzene generated the (μ-nitrosyl)dicopper complex. The (μ-nitrosyl)dicopper complex then reacted with N2O to regenerate the (μ- η2:η2-NO2)dicopper complex and N2 with an activation barrier of 31.5 kcal/mol. The overall reactions for methane and benzene hydroxylation were calculated to be exothermic by 41.7 and 54.1 kcal/mol, respectively. These results suggest that the catalytic reduction of NOx using hydrocarbons is feasible at certain operating temperatures. Thus, our calculations provide new insights into the design of catalysts for NOx purification. ©",,"Activation energy; Benzene; Catalysts; Density functional theory; Design for testability; Ground state; Hydrocarbons; Hydroxylation; Methane; Nitric oxide; Activation barriers; Benzene hydroxylation; Catalytic reduction; Copper-based catalysts; Dicopper complexes; Operating temperature; Reaction mechanism; Reduction mechanisms; Nitrogen oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103993205

This paper elaborates three different scenarios for energy transition in Greater Cairo with particular emphasis on the impact of lowering the share of inhabitants living in informal settlements. A city-specific TIMES energy system model is used to investigate how energy supply and demand will evolve between 2015 and 2050. Besides, the impacts in final energy consumption and CO2 emissions are investigated considering different socio-economic pathways. The scenarios show that the long-term cost-efficiency optimization leads to the decarbonization of the power sector even in the absence of climate constraints. Climate policies are modeled to achieve by 2050 a carbon emissions reduction of 50% below the 2015 baseline. The results indicate that the implementation of current urban plans will double the carbon emissions per capita if no mitigation policies are adopted. The urban expansion programs need to take into consideration the energy-environment-economic nexus and to be coupled with climate mitigation policies to contain the rising carbon emissions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Decarbonization; Greater Cairo megacity; Informal settlements; TIMES optimization model; Urban energy system transitions","Carbon; Economics; Emission control; Carbon emissions; Climate mitigations; Energy system model; Energy transitions; Informal settlements; Mitigation policies; Urban energy systems; Urban expansion; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100640164

The expansion of this previously rare disturbance has unknown consequences for lateral nutrient flux from terrestrial to aquatic environments. Lateral loss of nutrients could reduce carbon uptake and slow recovery of already nutrient-limited tundra ecosystems. To investigate the effects of tundra wildfire on lateral nutrient export, we analyzed water chemistry in and around the 10-year-old Anaktuvuk River fire scar in northern Alaska. We collected water samples from 21 burned and 21 unburned watersheds during snowmelt, at peak growing season, and after plant senescence in 2017 and 2018. After a decade of ecosystem recovery, aboveground biomass had recovered in burned watersheds, but overall carbon and nitrogen remained ~20% lower, and the active layer remained ~10% deeper. Despite lower organic matter stocks, dissolved organic nutrients were substantially elevated in burned watersheds, with higher flow-weighted concentrations of organic carbon (25% higher), organic nitrogen (59% higher), organic phosphorus (65% higher), and organic sulfur (47% higher). Geochemical proxies indicated greater interaction with mineral soils in watersheds with surface subsidence, but optical analysis and isotopes suggested that recent plant growth, not mineral soil, was the main source of organic nutrients in burned watersheds. Burned and unburned watersheds had similar δ15N-NO3−, indicating that exported nitrogen was of preburn origin (i.e., not recently fixed). Lateral nitrogen flux from burned watersheds was 2- to 10-fold higher than rates of background nitrogen fixation and atmospheric deposition estimated in this area. These findings indicate that wildfire in Arctic tundra can destabilize nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur previously stored in permafrost via plant uptake and leaching. This plant-mediated nutrient loss could exacerbate terrestrial nutrient limitation after disturbance or serve as an important nutrient release mechanism during succession. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Arctic; disturbance; ecosystem succession; hydrology; nutrient flux; permafrost; streams; tundra; watershed; wildfire","hydrology; nutrient dynamics; organic matter; permafrost; stream; succession; tundra; wildfire; Alaska; Arctic; United States; Matthiola; Alaska; Arctic; ecosystem; soil; tundra; wildfire; Alaska; Arctic Regions; Ecosystem; Nutrients; Soil; Tundra; Wildfires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099748790
