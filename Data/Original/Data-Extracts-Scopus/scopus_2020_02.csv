In this study, δ13C-ethanol was supplemented as solo substrate for AD sludge when the reactors operation stabilized to analyze the methanogenic pathways. The results suggested that approximately 59.3% of methane was produced from acetotrophic methanogens, while 40.7% was formed by hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the PSR group. On the other hand, compared with control, methane produced via CO2 reduction pathway was increased by 4.70%. Meanwhile, the composition variations of the microbial community in AD supported the above conclusion, since the relative abundances of Clostridium and Methanobacterium were enhanced by 7.6% and 10.2%, respectively in PSR reactor. These results provided a theoretical basis for AD applications and biogas yield improvements with EP process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Food waste; High-throughput sequencing; Methanogenic pathway; Microbial community; Stable isotope","Ethanol; Fermentation; Food microbiology; Food waste; Methane; Methanogens; Composition variation; High-throughput sequencing; Hydrogenotrophic methanogens; Mesophilic anaerobic digestion; Methanogenic pathways; Microbial communities; Microbial community analysis; Stable isotopes; Anaerobic digestion; alcohol; carbon dioxide; methane; alcohol; methane; activated sludge; anaerobic digestion; biogas; bioremediation; fermentation; food waste; genetic analysis; methanogenesis; microbial community; stable isotope; substrate; anaerobic digestion; Clostridium; controlled study; fermentation; food waste; Methanobacterium; methanogen; microbial community; nonhuman; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); sludge; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; fermentation; food; microflora; sewage; waste disposal; Clostridium; Methanobacterium; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Ethanol; Fermentation; Food; Methane; Microbiota; Refuse Disposal; Sewage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076536882

Among the major environmental stress factors and human health-related issues, the anthropogenic contamination is of particular concern, since coastal lagoons are intensively exploited for aquaculture activities. Although microbial communities constitute the most abundant fraction of the benthic biomass, also providing valuable ecosystem services, the links between sediment quality and microbial processes were largely disregarded. In this study, we aimed to elucidate whether different levels of riverine influence could provide favourable or adverse environmental conditions to sustain microbial diversity and processes. Sediments collected from four lagoons of the Po River delta were analysed to assess biochemical composition (biopolymeric carbon, Bio-PC), target organic pollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs; nonylphenols; bisphenol A), and microbial community properties (bacterial community composition, prokaryotic biomass, prokaryotic carbon production rate, PCP, community respiration rate, CR, extracellular enzyme activities, EEAs). The major physical and chemical sediment properties allowed identifying two statistically distinct groups of sediments with relatively low (LI) and high (HI) riverine influence. HI sediments were characterised by higher Bio-PC and PAHs concentrations, along with relatively high PAHs potential toxicity estimated by the Toxic Equivalent concentration approach. Contrasting results were obtained by linking the occurrence of dominant bacterial taxa (i.e.,Desulfobulbaceae and Desulfobacteraceae families) to sediment contamination patterns. Notably, the increasing pollution levels were likely to positively affect the occurrence of the Desulfuromonadales Sva1033 family, whereas detrimental effects were found against the family Ectothiorhodospiraceae. In addition, the concurrent increase of PCP/CR ratio along with key EEAs, highlighted that the benthic microbial community could consistently contribute to accelerate the degradation of persistent organic pollutants, with potential implication on the sediment self-purification processes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biopolymers; Bisphenol A; C-flux; Microbial diversity; Microbial processes; Nonylphenols; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons","bacterium; benthos; biodiversity; coastal sediment; deltaic deposit; dye; ecosystem service; environmental stress; functional role; microbial activity; microbial community; organic matter; PAH; persistent organic pollutant; phenolic compound; polymer; prokaryote; sediment pollution; Italy; Po River; Bacteria (microorganisms); Desulfobacteraceae; Desulfobulbaceae; Desulfuromonadales; Ectothiorhodospiraceae; Prokaryota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076842262

However, air pollutant concentrations often exhibit significant spatial and temporal variability depending on local sources and features of the built environment. In 2016, the Center for Air, Climate, and Energy Solutions (CACES) Air Quality Observatory was launched at Carnegie Mellon University to better understand urban spatial and temporal pollution gradients on the &lt; 1 km scale. The specific goal of this study was to understand how highly temporally and spatially resolved low-cost stationary sampler data could be linked to modifiable factors (such as land use characteristics). Measurements in Pittsburgh, PA, USA consisted of a staged deployment of 15 stationary air quality monitoring stations, which used a low-cost air quality monitor, the Real-time Affordable Multi-Pollutant (RAMP) monitor, for measuring CO, NO2, O3, and CO2, the low cost Neighborhood Particulate Monitor for measuring PM2.5 a higher cost instrument for measuring ultrafine particle concentration. The campaign was from August 2016–May 2017 and also included mobile sampling with reference-grade instruments in ~1 km2 grids around the stationary monitors. The stations were deployed as a rural-urban-rural transect along the prevailing wind direction and in downtown urban locations with a range of modifiable factors, such as traffic, restaurant and population densities. Wavelet decomposition was used to separate the pollutant time series from the stationary samplers into short-lived (&lt; 2 h) pollution events, longer-lived events (2–8 h) and persistent enhancements (baseline changes &gt; 8 h) above the regional background. Compared to the non-decomposed total pollutant signal, the short-lived or persistent enhancement pollutant signals, which should come from local sources, were better correlated with covariates used in LUR model construction. For example, Pearson r between total vehicle counts in a 100 m buffer and NO2 increased from 0.57 using the total pollutant signal to 0.83 using the persistent enhancement only. The findings from this study support building more accurate and higher time resolution (e.g., daily, hourly) LURs using low-cost sensors. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Air quality; Exposure; Land use regression; Low-cost sensors; Urban emissions","Air quality; Costs; Land use; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution detection; Population statistics; Sensor networks; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet decomposition; Air pollutant concentrations; Air quality monitoring stations; Carnegie Mellon University; Exposure; Land use regression; Low-cost sensors; Spatial and temporal variability; Urban emissions; Cost benefit analysis; air quality; atmospheric pollution; correlation; cost analysis; decomposition analysis; pollutant property; sensor; wavelet analysis; Pennsylvania; Pittsburgh; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079102682

In this paper, a computational analysis of SF6 bubble evolution in shock-accelerated flow with a transverse density gradient is presented. The influences of different incident shock Mach numbers on various interactions were clarified using high-resolution computation schemes. The results showed that the incident shock wave becomes curved during propagation because of the transverse density gradient. Based on this, two separate shock-focusing processes were identified when Ma = 1.21 and three separate shock-focusing processes were identified when Ma = 2.0. However, the shock-focusing intensity was weaker than previously observed in a flow field with a uniform density distribution. High- and relevant-pressure impingement played vital roles in the formation of three jets near the downstream pole of the SF6 bubble in both cases. In addition, impingement by incident and reflected shocks could induce additional vorticities in the bubble region and promote increased bubble volumes, but these increased bubble volumes could weaken the average vorticity. Upon increasing the incident shock Mach number, the effective bubble volume decreased with the enhanced shock intensity, but the vorticities were strengthened. Furthermore, analyzing the factors that affected vorticity evolution allowed us to find that the compression term had a stronger influence on vorticity evolution than the baroclinic term or the viscosity term. All of these studies complement the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability study. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Aerodynamics; Bubbles (in fluids); Focusing; Mach number; Shock waves; Vorticity; Accelerated flows; Computational analysis; Density distributions; High resolution; Incident shock waves; Reflected shocks; Richtmyer Meshkov instability; Transverse density; Sulfur hexafluoride",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079100508

Black carbon (BC) particles, which are a short-lived climate pollutant, are one cause of Arctic warming and glacier melting. However, the sources of BC particles are still uncertain. We simulated the potential emission sensitivity of atmospheric BC present over the Arctic (north of 66° N) using the FLEXPART (FLEXible PARTicle) Lagrangian transport model (version 10.1). This version includes a new aerosol wet removal scheme, which better represents particle-scavenging processes than older versions did. Arctic BC at the surface (0-500 m) and high altitudes (4750-5250 m) is sensitive to emissions in high latitude (north of 60° N) and mid-latitude (30-60° N) regions, respectively. Geospatial sources of Arctic BC were quantified, with a focus on emissions from anthropogenic activities (including domestic biofuel burning) and open biomass burning (including agricultural burning in the open field) in 2010. We found that anthropogenic sources contributed 82% and 83% of annual Arctic BC at the surface and high altitudes, respectively. Arctic surface BC comes predominantly from anthropogenic emissions in Russia (56 %), with gas flaring from the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug and Komi Republic being the main source (31% of Arctic surface BC). These results highlight the need for regulations to control BC emissions from gas flaring to mitigate the rapid changes in the Arctic environment. In summer, combined open biomass burning in Siberia, Alaska, and Canada contributes 56 %-85% (75% on average) and 40 %-72% (57 %) of Arctic BC at the surface and high altitudes, respectively. A large fraction (40 %) of BC in the Arctic at high altitudes comes from anthropogenic emissions in East Asia, which suggests that the rapidly growing economies of developing countries could have a non-negligible effect on the Arctic.

A few studies have highlighted the increasing frequency of SM droughts at the river basin scale in China, however, little is known about the SM response to precipitation (P) and near-surface temperature (T) at national and regional scales. In this study, the long-term SM dynamics based on a sophisticated land surface hydrological model (i.e., the Variable Infiltration Capacity, VIC) were identified after model evaluation. A simple but effective sensitivity-based approach was developed to quantify the elasticity (ε) and sensitivity (S) of SM to P and T, and the SM was projected for the near future at the regional scale. The results indicate that China has experienced slightly wetter soil conditions during the past five decades and the SM has increased in the arid and semi-arid regions of China, i.e., the North East (0.11 mm/yr) and the North West (0.047 mm/yr). The elasticity and the sensitivity of SM are the highest in the humid region (i.e., South East China), indicating that small increases of P and T are likely to induce considerable changes in the SM relative to other regions. The sensitivity-based approach could perform SM estimation similar to the complex VIC modeling. This approach projected that North China (−5.05 ± 2.31%) and South West China (−5.95 ± 2.04%) are likely to experience drying with a considerable decline in SM due to reduction in P and rise in T in the near future period from 2020 to 2050. The slightly wet soil conditions in the past and a drying future scenario may imply a contrasting consequence for the regional-scale hydrological cycles. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Land surface modeling; Sensitivity; Soil moisture","Climate change; Climate models; Elasticity; Surface measurement; Arid and semi-arid regions; Hydrological cycles; Hydrological modeling; Hydrological process; Land surface modeling; Near surface temperature; Sensitivity; Variable infiltration capacities; Soil moisture; air temperature; climate change; drought; hydrological cycle; hydrological modeling; land surface; precipitation (climatology); sensitivity analysis; soil moisture; article; China; climate change; elasticity; hydrological model; precipitation; quantitative analysis; soil moisture; soil treatment; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076251308

This paper investigates the effects of industrial reconstructuring on energy conservation and emission reduction. A multi-objective optimization model was established. The model classifies industrial sectors into four groups according to their carbon emission levels and contributions to economic growth, then non dominated sorting genetic algorithm is applied to solve the model and the Pareto frontier is obtained. The best solution is selected from the Pareto frontier by using a super data envelopment analysis model which measures the degree of coordination between economy and environment. The model is used to analyze the effects of industrial reconstructuring in Beijing during 2018–2020. The results show that industrial reconstructuring enabled economic growth to reach the government's planned rate while the carbon intensity and energy intensity surpassed the goal of the 13th Five-Year Plan. This case can provide decision-making basis for the sustainable development of ecology and economy in other regions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy saving and emissions reduction; Industrial structure; Multi-objective programming model; Pareto frontier; Super data envelopment analysis model","Carbon; Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Sustainable development; Data envelopment analysis models; Emissions reduction; Industrial structures; Multiobjective programming; Pareto frontiers; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075433588

We reported here that this challenge can be tackled with a plasma-catalysis hybrid system constructed by packing supported Au/CeO2/Al2O3 nanocatalysts into discharge region. This hybrid system could completely remove toluene with above 90% CO2 selectivity and greatly reduced concentration of poisonous byproducts (O3 and NOx) at 1500 J/L, while exhibiting good humidity tolerance and superior stability. The combination of Au nanocatalysts with plasma possesses relatively uniform discharge mode for generating large numbers of reactive species, removing organic intermediates from catalyst surface at low temperatures, and suppressing the formation of secondary pollutants and the poisoning of Au nanocatalysts. Furthermore, the strong interaction of Au nanoparticles with CeO2 effectively alleviates the coarsening phenomenon of Au nanocatalysts during the plasma-catalysis process and creates more oxygen vacancies for efficient oxidation of toluene into CO2 under the action of plasma. The high-performance plasma-catalysis hybrid system packed with supported Au/CeO2/Al2O3 nanocatalysts offers a promising approach to use the highly active Au-based nanocatalysts for refractory VOCs removal at low temperatures. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Non-thermal plasma; Plasma-catalysis; Supported Au nanocatalysts; Synergetic effect; Toluene removal","Benzene refining; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Catalyst deactivation; Catalyst poisoning; Cerium oxide; Coarsening; Electric discharges; Gold; Gold nanoparticles; Hybrid systems; Indoor air pollution; Nanocatalysts; Toluene; Efficient oxidations; High performance plasma; Nonthermal plasma; Organic intermediates; Plasma catalysis; Supported Au; Synergetic effect; Uniform discharges; Plasma applications",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071360254

PM2.5 is the main factor causing haze weather, reducing visibility and affecting traffic safety. PM2.5 enters the alveoli through the respiratory tract and endangers human health. The basic characteristics of PM2.5 are small size, light weight, long residence time in the atmosphere, and can be transported to a long distance by the atmospheric circulation, causing a wide range of air pollution.In 2018, the proportion of days with excellent and good air quality in Guilin City in January and February was 71.2%, ranking 10th among the 14 cities in the Guangxi Autonomous Region. As a famous tourist city, its air quality should be paid more attention. The main air pollutant in Guilin City is PM2.5, which refers to fine particles with a diameter of 2.5&thinsp;&mu;m or less in the air, it has great harm to human health and reduces the visibility of the atmosphere. Air quality data, meteorological data, and GPS tropospheric delay data (ZTD: zenith tropospheric delay) were collected to calculate the correlation between PM2.5 concentration and influencing factors by the gray correlation model, and the relationship between the main influencing factors and the variation characteristics of PM2.5 concentration was analyzed. The result shows that PM2.5 has strong correlation with other air pollutants SO2, NO2, wind direction, relative humidity, ZTD, temperature and wind speed; moderately correlated with rainfall and pressure. The degree of gray correlation between the impact factor and PM2.5 varies with the seasons.Based on this research and analysis, air quality pollutants and meteorological factors are used as input factors and the concentration of PM2.5 values as the output factor of the neural network model. The model is trained by training sample data to establish a neural network model to predict the concentration value of PM2.5 in Guilin. The accuracy of the model is verified by the accuracy index. The summer neural network model has the best precision. The MAE is 4.51&thinsp;&mu;g/m3, the RMSE is 5.73&thinsp;&mu;g/m3, and the MRE is 15.1%. The correlation coefficient between the predicted value and the measured value reaches 0.908. It shows that the neural network model based on meteorological factors and ZTD has a good predictive effect and has certain guiding significance for the prevention and control of air pollution in Guilin. © Authors 2020.","bp neural network; gray correlation; meteorological factors; PM2.5; ZTD","Acid rain; Air quality; Atmospheric humidity; Climate change; Health; Health hazards; Particle size analysis; Quality control; Safety factor; Smoke; Troposphere; Visibility; Wind; Atmospheric circulation; Atmospheric environment; Atmospheric particulate matter; Correlation coefficient; Meteorological factors; Prevention and controls; Variation characteristics; Zenith tropospheric delays; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083173080

To this end, this study employs the state-of-the-art global integrated assessment model MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM to investigate mid-century decarbonization strategies for developing Asia to 2050. Our results indicate that a radical change in the energy portfolio is required to reach the target of ‘well below’ 2°C. Specifically, our scenarios point to a rapid reduction of fossil fuel utilization, enhancement of low-carbon energy supply, and boosting of energy efficiency efforts. Such a transformation leads to a deep cut in CO2 emissions by 78% and 93% by 2050 in scenarios consistent with the 2°C and 1.5°C targets, respectively. Electricity generation and final energy consumption become dominated by low-carbon energy by 2050 in these scenarios. In terms of investment needs beyond a baseline scenario, the 2°C and 1.5°C pathways imply that the scale of low-carbon investment may need to double and triple, respectively. These increases would be partially offset by disinvestment in coal, oil and natural gas extraction and conversion infrastructure. Decarbonizing the energy system also impacts the capital needed for making progress on other sustainable development goals (SDGs), such as air pollution, clean water and food security. Key policy insights Governments will need to employ a variety of policy mechanisms, including mandates and subsidies for renewables and electric vehicles, efficiency standards for end-use technologies, and bans on free-emitting fossil fuel plants, among others. Relative to the baseline scenario for developing Asia, the scale of investment into low-carbon energy to 2050 may need to double for a 2°C scenario, and to triple for 1.5°C. Policy instruments such as green finance are essential for this region to mobilize a broadened channel of investment, particularly from the private sector. Low-carbon investment would significantly reduce the capital investment needed to achieve the SDG target for air quality, but increase the requirements for meeting targets on clean water and food security, though only to a small extent. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change policies; energy scenarios; integrated assessment; Investment strategies; sustainable development","carbon emission; climate change; electricity generation; energy efficiency; energy use; environmental policy; infrastructural development; integrated approach; investment; sustainable development; Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079366258

However, unreliable RC coefficients when satellite sensors lack accurate and in-time RC may lead to pronounced uncertainties in the products through error propagation. To address this issue, a novel approach for estimating water quality parameters, taking suspended particulate matter (SPM) as a case, was proposed by coupling the procedures of RC and SPM model development. The coupled models were established using digital numbers (DNs) from target sensors and “in-situ” SPM measurements from concurrent well-calibrated reference sensors, with the RC coefficients introduced as unknown model parameters. The approach was tested and validated in varied Chinese inland/coastal regions, including the Hongze lake (HL), Taihu lake (TL), and Hangzhou bay (HB). The results show: (1) the DN-based SPM models can achieve a degree of accuracy comparable to reflectance-based SPM models with determination coefficients (R2) of 0.94, 0.92, and 0.72, and root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 7.02 mg/L, 15.73 mg/L, and 619.2 mg/L for the HL, TL, and HB, respectively, and the biases less than 3% between the derived and official gain RC coefficients; (2) the uncertainty of SPM products increases exponentially as the RC uncertainty increases for exponential reflectance-based SPM models; (3) the DN-based SPM models are less sensitive to the uncertainties of atmospheric correction and RC coefficients, while the reflectance-based models suffer deeply. This study provides encouraging results to the improvement of SPM retrieval using the DN-based models by coupling RC and SPM retrieving processes, especially for sensors without precise RC coefficients. © 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement",,"Calibration; Lakes; Mean square error; Radiometry; Reflection; Water quality; Atmospheric corrections; Degree of accuracy; Determination coefficients; Parameter retrieval; Radiometric calibrations; Root mean square errors; Suspended particulate matters; Water quality parameters; Parameter estimation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079356088

Emissions of particle number (PN), particle mass (PM), black carbon (BC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), particle size distributions, and particle volatility were measured from 556 individual heavy-duty trucks (HDTs). Substantial reductions in PM, BC, NOx, CO, and to a lesser extent PN were observed from Euro III to Euro VI HDTs by 99 %, 98 %, 93 %, and 57 % for the average emission factors of PM, BC, NOx, and CO, respectively. Despite significant total reductions in NOx emissions, the fraction of NO2 in the NOx emissions increased continuously from Euro IV to Euro VI HDTs. Larger data scattering was evident for PN emissions in comparison to solid particle number (SPN) for Euro VI HDTs, indicating a highly variable fraction of volatile particle components. Particle size distributions of Euro III to enhanced environmentally friendly vehicle (EEV) HDTs were bimodal, whereas those of Euro VI HDTs were nucleation mode dominated. High emitters disproportionately contributed to a large fraction of the total emissions with the highest-emitting 10 % of HDTs in each pollutant category being responsible for 65 % of total PM, 70 % of total PN, and 44 % of total NOx emissions. Euro VI HDTs, which accounted for 53 % of total kilometres driven by Swedish HDTs, were estimated to only contribute to 2 %, 6 %, 12 %, and 47 % of PM, BC, NOx, and PN emissions, respectively. A shift to a fleet dominated by Euro VI HDTs would promote a transition of atmospheric emissions towards low PM, BC, NOx, and CO levels. Nonetheless, reducing PN, SPN, and NO2 emissions from Euro VI HDTs is still important to improve air quality in urban environments. © 2020 Author(s).",,"air quality; atmospheric chemistry; emission control; emission inventory; nitrogen dioxide; particle size; road; roadside environment; size distribution; traffic emission; trucking; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079477688

This paper aims to provide a practical model for location decision of PV charging station (PVCS) which combines geographic information system (GIS) with multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods. To verify the feasibility and practicality, an empirical study was conducted in Beijing. First, seven suitable areas were selected preliminarily by suitability analysis of GIS. This stage focused on traffic flow and road distribution. Second, MCDM methods were used to further evaluation. At this stage, a comprehensive evaluation index system of natural, economic, technical and social criteria was established. Interval number, triangular fuzzy number and hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set were utilized to collect and describe evaluation information. Then, the subjective and objective weights of the criteria were calculated by best-worst method and mixed information entropy method, respectively. Finally, the TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and MCDM) method was used to rank the alternatives. The ranking results illustrated that alternative sites A3 and A7 are outstanding. Moreover, dual sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis proved the stability and reliability of the model. Scenario analysis expanded the application scope of TODIM method, which also showed that it is necessary to express decision preferences by setting different recession coefficients.

Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC), a process-based model, was used in this study to evaluate the effects of different field management practices on CH4 and N2O emissions from flooded paddy fields in Shanghai, China. The results indicated that the predicted seasonal patterns of CH4 (R2 = 0.76, ME = 0.71) and N2O (R2 = 0.71, ME = 0.67) emissions were in line with the observations from our experimental paddy field under traditional management practices. The total CH4 and N2O fluxes from paddy fields in the Shanghai region in the 2013 rice season reached 32,300 and 175 tons, respectively, and varied widely across 101 simulated rice-cultivating towns. A sensitivity analysis indicated that CH4 emissions were positively correlated with the organic fertilizer rate, the straw returned fraction, the tillage depth and the soil organic carbon (SOC) content and negatively correlated with the soil clay fraction. N2O emissions had a positive relationship with precipitation, the urea rate, the tillage depth and the SOC content and a negative relationship with the soil pH and the clay fraction. Based on the sensitivity analysis, four field management variables, including the fertilization rate, the irrigation method, the straw returned fraction and the tillage depth, were selected to construct several management scenarios for the DNDC scenario simulation tests. The simulated results indicated that reducing the rate of fertilization by 20% combined with moistening irrigation (keeping the paddy soil saturated with water but not covered with a layer of water) was the best practice for long-term sustainable management of paddy fields. This best management practice could reduce integrated emissions of CH4 and N2O (CO2-equivalent) by 33%, while maintaining optimal rice yields. However, straw returning and deep plowing increased CH4 emissions from paddy fields in Shanghai. © 2019","CH4; DNDC model; N2O; Paddy field; Scenario simulation; Sensitivity analysis","agricultural land; best management practice; decomposition; denitrification; experimental study; methane; mitigation; nitrous oxide; precipitation (chemistry); scenario analysis; sensitivity analysis; urea; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075276162

Based on a theoretical analysis of how stringent environmental regulation affects carbon emission transfer within regions, we put forward the concept of carbon heaven effect (CHE) and explore the mechanism that environmental regulation influences carbon emissions through investment. We employ a mediating effect model to empirically study the existence of CHE in terms of per capita carbon emission, carbon emission intensity, and the proportion of regional carbon emission to the national emission. Further, the impacts of environmental regulation on the scale expansion and employment of carbon-intensive industries (CIIs) are investigated. Our results indicate that: (1) The CHE does exist in China, i.e., different environmental regulation intensities among different areas have indeed caused carbon emission transfer within regions; (2) The impact of environmental regulation on carbon emissions includes the total effect of emission reduction and the indirect effect of carbon-intensive industrial investment transfer; (3) The scale and employment of CIIs in regions with stringent environmental regulation have been constrained, while the regions with weaker environmental regulation become the havens for CIIs development; (4) Giving that the emission reduction targets were assigned and implemented at the provincial level since 2006, we further examine the effects of this constrain policy on CHE, and find that the impacts of environmental regulation on local carbon emission has strengthened. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon haven effect; Carbon-intensive industries; Environmental regulation; Pollution haven hypothesis","Carbon; Emission control; Carbon emission intensities; Carbon emissions; Emission reduction; Emission reduction targets; Indirect effects; Industrial investments; Mediating effect; Pollution haven hypothesis; Environmental regulations; carbon emission; environmental legislation; industrial emission; policy approach; pollution control; pollution policy; regulatory framework; targeting; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078528211

Combined with window analysis, the technical efficiency and emissions reduction potential of China's industrial sectors are also discussed. The empirical results show that: (1) China's industrial carbon congestion is obvious and the congestion effect witnesses a trend of regional agglomeration and evident regional and sectoral heterogeneity. In particular, undesirable congestion mainly occurs in the eastern region, and desirable congestion mainly occurs in the western region, followed by the eastern region; both undesirable and desirable congestions mainly occur in some sectors in the Manufacturing and Power-Gas-Water industries. (2) If all sectors produce on the production frontier, the average annual potential carbon emissions reduction would reach 722.82 million tons, with the higher potential in western region and Shanxi province of central region, as well as Manufacturing and six high-energy-consuming sectors.

However, the detailed information in the isotopes that results from intra-annual climate scenarios and is associated with mineral accumulation remains unclear. Combined with investigations of elements and ash contents, variations in foliar δ13C in relation to annual, winter and summer climate scenarios were investigated in a dendroclimatologically important tree species Sabina przewalskii Kom. Foliar δ13C exhibited a significant negative correlation with mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation and mean annual relative humidity as well as significant positive correlations with elevation. Climatic factors in winter and summer have opposite effects on the variation of δ13C. The beneficial mineral element Si had a significant positive correlation with foliar δ13C, whereas the essential mineral elements K, Ca, and Mg did not. Specifically, Si and δ13C have similar correlations with climate factors and elevation. These results suggest that measurement of Si content has a similar potential to δ13C for use as an alternative climate indicator when detailed climatic information may otherwise be limited and provide a basis for understanding the integration of δ13C in plant responses to climate. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon isotope; Environmental limitation; Mineral element; Sabina przewalskii Kom.; Silicon","Isotopes; Silicon; Annual relative humidity; Carbon isotopes; Environmental limitations; Mean annual precipitation; Mean annual temperatures; Mineral element; Sabina przewalskii Kom; Stable carbon isotope ratio; Minerals; calcium; carbon 13; magnesium; mineral; potassium; silicon derivative; carbon; silicon; accumulation; carbon isotope; climate conditions; coniferous tree; dendroclimatology; isotopic ratio; mineral; paleoclimate; Pleistocene; seasonal variation; silicon; Article; climate; correlational study; environmental temperature; forestry; humidity; nonhuman; precipitation; priority journal; Sabina przewalskii; summer; tree; winter; chemistry; environmental monitoring; plant leaf; Tibet; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Carbon Isotopes; Climate; Environmental Monitoring; Plant Leaves; Silicon; Tibet; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076214382

Clean coal briquettes can meet both demands of clean environment and residential heating. As a byproduct from the Bayer process, red mud has the potential to be used as briquettes additive, although its recycling procedure is challenging. In this study, red mud was used to replace the currently used calcium oxide as additive in coal briquetting. Twelve sets of combustion experiments were conducted for bituminous coal, anthracite coal and their briquettes, and each set of the experiment was repeated at least three times. Emission profiles of PM2.5, SO2 and NOx were recorded during experiments. The highest emission reduction rates for PM2.5, SO2 and NOx were achieved at red mud contents of 10%, 5% and 2.5%, respectively, for bituminous coal, and at 10%, 5% and 7.5%, respectively, for anthracite coal. The corresponding emission reduction rates were 37.5%, 25.8% and 61.9% for bituminous coal and 31.2%, 55.1% and 17.9% for anthracite coal. In addition, both SO2 and NOx emissions showed clear peaks during the initial-burning stage for the two kinds of coals, while SO2 emission for anthracite coal burning showed another peak during the char-burning stage. Benefit analysis was also conducted assuming all the currently used raw coals were replaced with clean coal briquettes in Shaanxi province.

Such approaches are particularly beneficial to rainfed agriculture, the livelihood choice for the majority of the world’s poor population, for which yields are highly sensitive to climate conditions. However, a notable gap still exists between scientific communities producing predictions and the end users who may actually realize the benefits. In this study, an interdisciplinary approach connecting climate prediction to agricultural planning is adopted to address this gap. An ex ante evaluation of seasonal precipitation prediction is assessed using an agro-economic equilibrium model to simulate Ethiopia’s national economy, accounting for interannual climate variability and prediction-guided agricultural responses. Given the high spatial variability in Ethiopian precipitation, delineation of homogeneous climatic regions (i.e., regionalization) is also considered in addition to growing season precipitation prediction. The model provides perspectives across various economic indices (e.g., gross domestic product, calorie consumption, and poverty rate) at aggregated (national) and disaggregated (zonal) scales. Model results illustrate the key influence of climate on the Ethiopian economy, and prospects for positive net benefits under a prediction-guided agricultural planning (e.g., reallocation of crop types) strategy, as compared with static business-as-usual agricultural practices. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Agriculture; Climatology; Decision making; Economics; Forecasting; Agricultural planning; Agricultural practices; Gross domestic products; Interannual climate variability; Rain fed agriculture; Scientific community; Seasonal climate prediction; Seasonal precipitations; Climate models; agricultural economics; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural management; agrometeorology; climate prediction; economic planning; growing season; interdisciplinary approach; rainfed agriculture; regionalization; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075934721

Vulnerability assessment is central to the implementation of interventions for adapting climate change. However, synthetic vulnerability based on an integrative analysis of ecosystem service and socioeconomic characteristics in urban coastal zones with tightly coupled human-nature interactions is not fully understood. Based on the Coastal Vulnerability model of the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs) tool, a holistic framework for assessing coastal vulnerability to multiple hazards (sea level rise, waves and storm surge) was developed by integrating ecological, physical and socioeconomic factors into a single spatial representation and applied to the coast of Shenzhen, China. Based on the levels of biophysical exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of coastal communities, a three-dimensional decision matrix was proposed for planning location-specific interventions. Results show that approximately 15% of the coastline were categorized as having high vulnerability. Spatial vulnerability heterogeneity was found within and across the coastal districts, with Yantian grouped into the most vulnerable district. The biophysical exposure has greater influences on the overall vulnerability than either sensitivity or adaptive capacity. This study highlights the significance of complex interactions between natural ecosystems and socioeconomic conditions in driving vulnerability and suggests that combined natural-based defenses and socioeconomic factors contribute to lower vulnerability. The results can help decision-makers prioritize coastal zones for interventions and identifying adaptive strategies that target drivers of vulnerability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Coastal hazards; Coastal zone management; Three-dimensional decision matrix; Vulnerability assessment","adaptive management; assessment method; climate change; coastal zone; coastal zone management; ecosystem service; hazard assessment; human activity; implementation process; prioritization; socioeconomic conditions; three-dimensional modeling; trade-off; urbanization; vulnerability; article; China; climate change; coastal waters; human; sea level rise; seashore; socioeconomics; acclimatization; China; ecology; ecosystem; environmental protection; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen; Yantian; Acclimatization; China; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecology; Ecosystem; Humans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075425065

In 1992, the United Nations agreed to take action at the Earth Summit to stabilize and reduce net zero global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Tree planting was identified as an effective method to offset CO2 emissions. A high net photosynthetic rate (Pn) with fast-growing trees could efficiently fulfill the goal of CO2 emission reduction. Net photosynthetic rate model can provide refernece for plant’s stability of photosynthesis productivity. Methods and results Using leaf phenotype data to predict the Pn can help effectively guide tree planting policies to offset CO2 release into the atmosphere. Tree planting has been proposed as one climate change solution. One of the most popular trees to plant are poplars. This study used a Populus simonii (P. simonii) dataset collected from 23 artificial forests in northern China. The samples represent almost the entire geographic distribution of P. simonii. The geographic locations of these P. simonii trees cover most of the major provinces of northern China. The northwestern point reaches (36°30’N, 98°09’E). The northeastern point reaches (40°91’N, 115°83’E). The southwestern point reaches (32°31’N, 108°90’E). The southeastern point reaches (34°39’N, 113°74’E). The collected data on leaf phenotypic traits are sparse, noisy, and highly correlated. The photosynthetic rate data are nonnormal and skewed. Many machine learning algorithms can produce reasonably accurate predictions despite these data issues. Influential outliers are removed to allow an accurate and precise prediction, and cluster analysis is implemented as part of a data exploratory analysis to investigate further details in the dataset. We select four regression methods, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and generalized additive model (GAM), which are suitable to use on the dataset given in this study. Cross-validation and regularization mechanisms are implemented in the XGBoost, SVM, RF, and GAM algorithms to ensure the validity of the outputs. Conclusions The best-performing approach is XGBoost, which generates a net photosynthetic rate prediction that has a 0.77 correlation with the actual rates. Moreover, the root mean square error (RMSE) is 2.57, which is approximately 35 percent smaller than the standard deviation of 3.97. The other metrics, i.e., the MAE, R2, and the min-max accuracy are 1.12, 0.60, and 0.93, respectively. This study demonstrates the ability of machine learning models to use noisy leaf phenotype data to predict the net photosynthetic rate with significant accuracy. Most net photosynthetic rate prediction studies are conducted on herbaceous plants. The net photosynthetic rate prediction of P. simonii, a kind of woody plant, illustrates significant guidance for plant science or environmental science regarding the predictive relationship between leaf phenotypic characteristics and the Pn for woody plants in northern China. © 2020 Zhang et al.

The conventional iron ore sintering (CIOS) process was simulated with this model, and the reliability of the model was verified by field testing. Based on the CIOS simulation results, and focused on maintaining the stability of the highest temperature of the sintering bed and waste heat utilization of the flue gas, flue gas recirculation sintering (FGRS) and fuel layered distribution sintering (FLDS) are proposed. Optimized iron ore sintering (OIOS) is also proposed based on the combination of FGRS and FLDS. The simulation results indicate that OIOS can increase the highest temperature of the upper part of the sintering bed and decrease that of the lower part. OIOS can increase the thickness of the sintering bed over a reasonable temperature range, making the distribution of the highest temperature in the sintering bed more reasonable and the sintering process more stable. Waste heat utilization of OIOS is increased by 1.7453 × 108 kJ/h and fuel consumption of OIOS is decreased by 2.66 t/h compared to values for CIOS. OIOS can decrease flue gas emissions, reduce the burden of the desulfurization system, and increase the recirculation rate of flue gas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Flue gas recirculation; Fuel layered distribution; Iron ore sintering; Numerical simulation","Computer simulation; Flue gases; Flues; Fuels; Gas emissions; Iron ores; Iron research; Ore sintering; Porous materials; Refuse incinerators; Temperature; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Flue gas recirculation; Highest temperature; Non equilibrium thermodynamics; Numerical research; Recirculation rates; Sintering beds; Sintering process; Temperature range; Sintering; chemical reaction; fuel consumption; iron ore; numerical method; numerical model; porous medium; simulation; temperature effect; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075882127

Although two thirds of the global rivers are regulated by dams, the impacts of river regulation on stream temperature and thermoelectricity production have not been evaluated in previous studies. Using a state-of-the-art integrated water cycle model and a power generation model, we quantify the impacts of river regulation on stream temperature and usable capacity of once-through thermoelectric power in the United States. Our study demonstrates that by lowering stream temperature and increasing water availability during the low-flow season, river regulation can curtail the loss of summer power plant usable capacity induced by climate change. The alleviation of power loss by water management is comparable to that resulting from emission mitigation that reduces warming in the future.

Generally, trees with higher TSC values are prone to snow, icing, and wind damage than trees with smaller TSC values. Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.) a native and fast growing species, is widely distributed in southern China. Yet our understanding of how TSC of Chinese fir plantations is affected by biotic (including size, competition, and age) and climatic variables in different sites is limited. A data set of 60 remeasured plots consisted of five spacing trials and distributed in in Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Sichuan provinces in southern China were used to explore TSC of Chinese fir relating to biotic and climatic variables using nonlinear mixed effects model (NLME). Results showed that TSC values increased with increasing stand age (Age), stand basal area (BA), and mean annual temperature (MAT). In contrast, it decreased with increasing tree density index (TN), relative diameter (RD = DBH/quadratic mean diameter), mean warmest month temperature (MWMT), and annual heat-moisture index (AHM). The relative importance of RD influencing TSC was the most followed by Age, Spacing A, TN, Spacing D, MAT, BA, Spacing C, Spacing B, AHM, and MWMT through hierarchical partitioning analysis. MAT was the most important climate factor that contributed to TSC variations, followed by AHM, and MWMT, which indicated that temperature was a critical climate variable modulating TSC of Chinese fir in southern China. Additionally, trees grown in less dense stands of 1667, 3333, and 5000 trees ha−1 were more stable (lower TSC) than those grown in dense stands of 6667 and 10 000 trees ha−1.

A 4–5 year observational study was conducted to illustrate the air pollution profile at the Kanazawa University Wajima air monitoring station (KUWAMS), an ideal remote background site in Japan. Methods: Nine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the particulate phase and various air pollutants were continuously monitored for 4–5 years. Diagnostic ratios of PAHs and back-trajectory analysis were applied to trace the possible sources of the air pollutants collected at the sampling site. Results: The atmospheric concentration of PAHs in the atmosphere at the site decreased from 2014 to 2019, benefit from the predominant air pollution control policy in China and Japan. Common air pollutants including sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone, methane (CH4), and non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) were detected in low concentrations from 2016 to 2019, while ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM2.5, PM with a diameter less than 2.5 µm) were present in high levels that exceeded the Japanese standards. Most air pollutants peaked in spring and showed evident diurnal variations in spring and summer. Conclusions: This is the first study to clarify the atmospheric behaviors of multiple air pollutants at a background site in Japan. Significant external air pollutant impact and unneglectable air pollution were demonstrated at KUWAMS, indicating the importance of studying atmospheric pollution at remote sites. © 2020 by the authors.

These preferences, however, may neglect the important role of people who are the direct beneficiaries in this ecosystem. Therefore, including these stakeholders in ES assessment identifies their relations and perceptions between ecosystem services and society. In order to quantify and map these relations and perceptions, we designed and implemented an analytical framework based on the Public Participatory Geographic Information System (PPGIS) method to explore local stakeholders’ (Farmers, Government managers/Experts, and Company employees) similarities and differences in recognition of preferences and social values for ecosystem services in a typical Karst basin. Our results showed that remarkable differences appeared in preferences for ES across three groups. Farmers gave more preferences to provisioning services, Government managers/Experts to regulating and cultural services, and Company employees’ preferences were individualized. The spatial distributions and relations of social values for ES also showed great differentials. Provisioning services were always related to specific natural conditions, regulating services to forests, and cultural services to specific locations around tourism localities, forest, and wetland parks. The three stakeholder groups perceived more synergies than tradeoffs between the different ecosystem services. Landscape beauty was the most influential service in Farmers’ and Company employees’ perceptions, while Local climate change regulation was the most influential service in those of Government managers/Experts. The local stakeholders’ surveys can improve the enthusiasm of the local people to participate in environmental management and provide more socio-ecological information to help the managers alleviate the conflicts among different stakeholders. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem services; Preferences; Social values; Stakeholders; Xiaojiang Basin","analytical framework; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; environmental values; GIS; local participation; perception; preference behavior; stakeholder; China; Xiaojiang Basin; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076609637

The people’s cognition, willingness and behavior may prove to be pivotal in ecologically protecting cultivated land. The purpose of this paper is to explore suppliers’ and demanders’ cognition, willingness and behavior with respect to the ecological protection of cultivated land. The second‐order structural equation model was employed, and a five‐point Likert scale was designed. Based on data obtained from a questionnaire surveyed on a sample of 460 (farming and no‐farming households) from Caidian district, Wuhan, China, the results show that within/between suppliers and demanders, there are mismatches in willingness as well as behavior to ecologically protect cultivated land. In the suppliers group and in the demanders group, there are mismatches with respect to the interactive mechanism of cognition, willingness and behavior in the ecological protection of cultivated land. Three factors, subjective norms, attitude toward behavior, and perceived behavior control, affect willingness and behavior with respect to protection differently between the suppliers and the demanders. The “intermediary” effects of willingness and behavior in the ecological protection of cultivated land only appear in the demanders model, and are not significant in the suppliers model. In addition, another finding was that farmers’ behavior as suppliers and demanders of ecological protection of cultivated land were mismatched. The article contributes firstly to exploring the ecological protection of cultivated land from the perspective of suppliers’ and demanders’ subjective psychology. Farmers with “dual roles” as suppliers and demanders should pay more attention to the ecological protection of cultivated land. Their cognition and skills in the ecological protection of cultivated land are in need of improvement. It is also necessary to bridge the gap between suppliers and demanders; access to the knowledge of the ecological value of cultivated land will incentivize their behavior with respect to the ecological protection of cultivated land. © 2020 by the authors.

However, such development often causes environmental problems. Among others, the haze caused by industrial SO2 emissions is particularly prominent. Based on Niche theory and combined with Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA, a decoupling index model, and a Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) factor decomposition model, this paper reports a study on the spatio-temporal distribution and the driving factors of industrial development and industrial SO2 emissions of cities in Henan, China between 2005 and 2014. The results showed that over the studied period in Henan: (1) SO2 emissions reduced by 4.56 × 105 tons and showed a slowly decreasing trend, which gradually transitioned to a ""green health"" industrial structure in Henan cities; (2) studied cities with high and low industrial niche values (0.038-0.139) showed an absolute decoupling relationship between industrial development and industrial SO2 emissions; (3) except for Zhengzhou city and Hebi city, other studied cities showed a trend of gradually increasing industrial output; (4) along with increases in the values of industrial output, studied cities showed increased levels of SO2 emissions but with energy intensity and energy structure showing a fluctuating trend of increases and decreases in their contributions to SO2 emissions; and (5) the energy consumption intensity and environmental technology were critical factors that were conducive to industrial SO2 emissions and the evolving industrial structure. These findings are important for the control of industrial SO2 emissions, though the levels of their influences are different in different cities. The scale of industrial production and the composition of energy structure in a region could lead to further deterioration of industrial SO2 emissions in the future. © 2020 by the authors.","Factor decomposition; Henan Province; Industrial SO2 emissions; Industry development; Niche theory; Spatio-temporal distribution","decomposition analysis; economic conditions; energy intensity; environmental economics; environmental technology; industrial development; industrial production; industrial structure; spatiotemporal analysis; sulfur dioxide; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081225873

Among them, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has the properties of earth rich, metal-free, high physicochemical stability, and suitable electronic band structure and band gap for many kinds of photocatalyst reactions. However, the energy conversion efficiency still limited due to the low utilization efficiency in the longer wavelength. Dye sensitization is currently one of promising methods to extend the absorption response region of semiconductors, and enhances the separation and transportation of photogenerated electrons and holes between dyes and semiconductors. It may be a good candidate strategy to enhance photocatalysis efficiency, even though lack of stability and repeatability for these composites. In this article, we have summarized dye-sensitized g-C3N4 with different mechanisms for variety of photocatalysis process, the relationship between structure of dyes and photocatalytic activity. Especially, dyes in H2 evolution process are divided into metal-free organic dyes, phthalocyanines, and porphyrins in detail. Comparing to metal-free organic dyes, the absorption of phthalocyanines and porphyrins can easily move to near-infrared region, which lead to the enhancement of H2 evolution activity. It may provide a guidance of the structure designing and constructing for highly effective dye-sensitized g-C3N4 photocatalysts for various applications. At last, we shared our opinions on the challenges and perspectives of dyes on g-C3N4 for photocatalyst. © 2019, Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences.","Carbon nitride; CO2 reduction; Dye sensitization; H2 evolution; Pollutant degradation",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072042139

The ability to detect sea ice drift in real-time also contributes to the safe navigation of ships and the prevention of offshore oil platform accidents. In this paper, an Enhanced Delaunay Triangulation (EDT) algorithm for sea ice tracking was proposed for dual-polarization sequential Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, which was implemented by combining feature tracking with pattern matching based on integrating HH and HV polarization feature information. A sea ice retrieval algorithm for feature detection, matching, fusion, and outlier detection was specifically developed to increase the system's accuracy and robustness. In comparison with several state-of-the-art sea ice drift retrieval algorithms, including Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) and the Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) method, the results of the experiment provided compelling evidence that our algorithm had a higher accuracy than the SURF and ORB method.

The development of effective air pollution emission reduction policies requires knowledge of the sources and health risks of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-enriched fine particulate matter (PM2.5). We investigated the seasonal variation and source apportionment of 16 priority PAH-enriched PM2.5 samples in Tangshan during 2014 and 2015, and we assessed the health risks associated with inhalation exposure to PAHs. The PM2.5 samples were collected from April 2014 to February 2015. We analyzed the concentrations of PM2.5 and PAH-enriched PM2.5, and used principal component analysis and molecular diagnostic ratios to identify potential sources. We explored the relationship between distribution and meteorological conditions, and used an incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) model to quantitatively evaluate exposure from the inhalation risk of PAHs. The average mass concentration of PM2.5 was 196 µg/m3, with a range 34.0 to 586 µg/m3. The median ∑16PAH values in PM2.5 were 190 ng/m3, with a range of 60.2 to 862 ng/m3 over the sampling period. The order of ∑16PAHs concentration was winter &gt; autumn &gt; summer &gt; spring. The results show that the primary sources of PAH-enriched PM2.5 are coal combustion, vehicle exhaust, and biomass burning. The annual mean of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) was 8.37 ng/m3, more than 8-fold greater than the BaP annual standard (1 ng/m3) set by the Chinese State Environmental Protection Agency. The ILCR values for 3 groups (children, teenagers, and adults) over the 4 seasons were between 10–6 and 10–4, indicating a potential health risk from PAHs in Tangshan.

Abstract: Global warming has now persisted for more than 100 years, but an unusual pause in this rising temperature began in the 2000s, at least for the climate of China. This shift presents an unusual opportunity to investigate possible differences in the radial growth of trees during a climate warming period (1980–2001) and the warming hiatus (after 2001) for different age groups under different moisture conditions. We sampled a total of 304 tree-ring cores of Picea crassifolia in the eastern and western Qilian Mountains, which were divided into four age groups for study. The results indicate that trees of the young group and half-mature group in the wetter eastern region showed insignificant growth trend, while all trees in the drier west showed significant growth reduction related to climate warming. Radial growth of trees in the east showed weak correlation with precipitation, and that in the west positively correlated with precipitation from the previous August–September and current May–June from 1980 to 2001. In contrast, trees in the east positively correlated with precipitation from the previous August–September and current July, and those in the west positively correlated with precipitation from the current April–May during the temperature pause after 2001. Trees in the east showed negative correlation with temperature in the winter dormancy period, and those in the west negatively correlated with temperature from the previous July, November and the current June from 1980 to 2001. Trees in both the east and west showed weak correlations with temperature after 2001. Older trees (> 150 years old) showed a weaker response to precipitation than the younger trees (< 150 years old). In the east, older trees responded to temperature more weakly during the period of climate warming; while in the west, older trees responded to temperature more strongly. If the temperature begins to rise again as it did before 2001, trees in the western region, especially older trees, will suffer more from warming than those in the eastern region. Consequently, older trees in the western Qilian Mountains should be the subject of greater oversight with respect to forest management and protection. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Age group; Different regions; Radial growth–climate relationship; Tree-ring; Warming hiatus","Global warming; Age groups; Different regions; Radial growth; Tree rings; Warming hiatus; Forestry; Correlation; Forest Management; Forestry; Growth; Mountains; Precipitation; Temperature; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074011701

It has been reported that incorporation of some conductive materials into reactors treating complex organic matter could enhance reactor performance. In this study, the aim was to study this possibility of application of granular activated carbon (GAC) in anaerobic digestion of rapeseed oil. As expected, the GAC-amended reactor could significantly improve methane yield and reduce acidification. Besides, the GAC-amended broth could efficiently degrade palmitate into methane. Microbial community analysis showed that bacteria (Syntrophomonas) and methanogens (Methanosarcina) were greatly enriched on the GAC surface in GAC-amended system. These results, and the kwon of easy enrichment of Syntrophomonas on conductive materials or current-harvesting electrodes in methanogenic and/or electrogenic systems, suggest that Syntrophomonas could participate in direct interspecies electron transfer with Methanosarcina species, when GAC is available as an electron transfer mediator. Hence, the addition of GAC could efficiently, stably and environmentally enhance the methanogenic metabolism of rapeseed oil. © 2019","Anaerobic digestion; Direct interspecies electron transfer; LCFAs; Methane; Palmitate; Rapeseed oil","Acidification; Activated carbon; Conductive materials; Electron transitions; Granular materials; Methane; Oilseeds; Palmitic acid; Vegetable oils; Complex organic matters; Electron transfer; Electron transfer mediators; Granular activated carbons; LCFAs; Microbial community analysis; Palmitate; Rapeseed oil; Anaerobic digestion; activated carbon; granular activated carbon; lipid; methane; palmitic acid; rapeseed oil; unclassified drug; charcoal; activated carbon; anaerobic digestion; anoxic conditions; efficiency measurement; electron; essential oil; granular medium; lipid; metabolism; methane; methanogenesis; microbial activity; microbial community; reaction kinetics; acidification; anaerobic metabolism; anaerobic methanation; Article; chemical modification; direct interspecies electron transfer; electron transport; food waste; Methanosarcina; microbial community; nonhuman; priority journal; Syntrophomonas; anaerobic growth; electron; metabolism; procedures; sewage; Brassica napus; Methanosarcina; Syntrophomonas; Anaerobiosis; Charcoal; Electrons; Methane; Rapeseed Oil; Waste Disposal, Fluid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075881205

Based on the panel data of 18 key provinces and cities between 2006 and 2015, this paper evaluated the agricultural carbon emission efficiency with the data envelopment analysis–Malmquist model and further explored their dynamic evolutionary trends. There were several main findings. First, the efficiency levels of agricultural carbon emissions showed significant regional differentiation among the areas, with that along the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road being much higher than that along the Silk Road Economic Belt. Second, technical efficiency was the key factor that restricted the improvement of the comprehensive efficiency of agricultural carbon. Third, most provinces invested in too many redundant and unreasonably allocated resources, showing a trend of diminishing returns to scale. Last, According to dynamic evolution analysis, the total productivity still demonstrated a diminishing trend. This paper provides some suggestions for effectively improve the efficiency of agricultural carbon emissions in China, such as optimize the agricultural industrial structure, increasing the investment of carbon emission reduction technology, and implementing a carbon emission quota clearing system.

However, the combined influences of straw retention and nitrogen (N) fertilizer application on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes from paddy fields merits significant attention. In this work, we conducted a field experiment in the lower Yangtze River region of China to study the effects of straw retention modes and N fertilizer rates on rice yield, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission fluxes, global warming potential (GWP), and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) during the rice season. The experiments included six treatments: the recommended N fertilizer-240 kg N·ha-1 with (1) no straw, (2) wheat straw, (3) rice straw, and (4) both wheat and rice straw retentions; in a yearly rice-wheat cropping system (N1, WN1, RN1, and WRN1, respectively); as well as both wheat and rice straw retentions with (5) no N fertilizer and (6) 300 kg N·ha-1 conventional N fertilizer (WRN0, WRN2). The results showed that CH4 emissions were mainly concentrated in the tillering fertilizer stage and accounted for 54.2%-87.5% of the total emissions during the rice season, and N2O emissions were primarily concentrated in the panicle fertilizer stage and accounted for 46.7%-51.4% total emissions. CH4 was responsible for 87.5%-98.5% of the total CH4 and N2O GWP during the rice season, and was the main GHG contributor in the paddy field. Although straw retention reduced N2O emissions from paddy field, it significantly increased CH4 emissions, which resulted in a significant net increase in the total GWP. Compared with the N1 treatment, the total GWP of WN1, WRN1, and RN1 increased by 3.45, 3.73, and 1.62 times, respectively; and the GHGI increased by 3.00, 2.96, and 1.52 times, respectively, so the rice straw retention mode had the smallest GWP and GHGI. Under double-season's straw retentions, N fertilizer application increased both CH4 and N2O emissions, and the WRN1 treatment not only maintained high rice yield but also significantly reduced the GWP and GHGI by 16.5% and 30.1% (p &lt; 0.05), respectively, relative to the WRN2 treatment. Results from this study suggest that adopting the ""rice straw retention + recommended N fertilizer"" mode (RN1) in the rice-wheat rotation system prevalent in the lower Yangtze River region will aid in mitigating the contribution of straw retention to the greenhouse effect. © 2020 by the authors.","GHG emissions; GWP; N fertilizer rate; Rice-wheat rotation; Straw retention mode","air-water interaction; crop rotation; fertilizer application; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; paddy field; straw; China; Yangtze River; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081199563

The evolution of heat affected zones of mitigated damages with increasing pulse length from 5 μs to 90 μs indicates that the thickness of heat affected zone increases with increasing pulse length, but can be tightly confined by shortening the pulse length. The mitigated damages with confined heat affected zones show minimal redeposit, negligible residual stress and rimless. Raman spectra of heat affected zones show that local densification of fused silica occurs as a result of local fictive temperature enhancement induced by the CO2 laser pulse.

However, costly biomass harvesting, insufficient biomass productivity, and energy-intensive extraction methods are major bottlenecks restricting their large-scale development. To break through such limitations, researchers have focused on the technologies towards consolidating microalgal-bacterial consortia, which exhibit numerous advantages related to economy, energy, and environment, due to the cooperative interactions between microalgae and bacteria. This paper recapitulates the most recent work on microalgal-bacterial interaction mechanisms, and describes the diverse biotechnological applications of microalgal-bacterial consortia. Based on this review, the interaction mechanisms cover substrate exchange, cell-to-cell signaling, and horizontal gene transfer. Nutrient availability, growth phase, and cultivation conditions are major factors affecting their interactions. In terms of wastewater treatment, attached microalgal-bacterial consortia are economically feasible and technically superior compared to suspended microalgal-bacterial consortia. Appropriate carrier, bioreactor type, operation mode, operational factor, and further perspectives for engineering attached microalgal-bacterial consortia are critically assessed. Bacteria play an important role in promoting microalgal growth, enhancing bio-flocculation and facilitating cell wall disruption, and thus expanding the application potential of microalgal biofuel production.

China, Beijing, 100038, China","Energy usage and CO2 emission have intimate and inseparable linkages. The growth of energy usage causes an increase in CO2 emissions, which will in turn constrain the related energy policies and challenge the energy-system stability. It is essential to quantify China's CO2 emission inventories embodied in production-driven, demand-driven and supply-driven chains considering different energy types. A Three-Perspective Energy-Carbon Nexus model is developed to facilitate comprehensive CO2 emission-reduction analysis in China. The model incorporates environmental input-output analysis and ecological network analysis within a general framework to clarify the relationships among provinces in terms of the production-based, consumption-based and income-based accountings. A new indicator, indirect emission dominant factor, is for the first time examined to evaluate the dominant capabilities of indirect emissions. It is discovered that the emissions triggered by the demand-side are not sensitive to energy types. Furthermore, the changes of integral flow control intensity in each province are insignificant from consumption-based and income-based perspectives. Final demand contributes 80% of consumption-based emissions and gross value-added creation leads to a total of 82% income-based CO2 emissions in China in 2012. When controlling emissions from multiple perspectives, traditional methods may not be effective since they do not consider the forms of emissions; some methods (e.g., product allocation) are not suitable for suppressing indirect emissions. Moreover, the prosperity of developed regions (e.g. Guangdong) highly rely on support from underdeveloped regions (e.g. Inner Mongolia). Some underdeveloped provinces are receptors of CO2, while the developed ones are emitting CO2 to the system without assuming their emission-reduction responsibilities. In addition, secondary energy consumptions in developed regions are conducive in increasing their emission contributions to the system. In this research, an innovative perspective is initiated to disclose the energy-carbon interconnections across Chinese provinces. The obtained findings could help support the formulation of China's CO2 emission-reduction policies. © 2019","Emission factor; Energy-carbon nexus; Environmental management; Input-output analysis; Policy making","Carbon; Economic analysis; Emission control; Environmental management; System stability; CO2 emission reduction; Ecological network analysis; Emission factors; Energy-carbon nexus; Environmental input-output analysis; Input output analysis; Policy making; Product allocations; Carbon dioxide; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; energy policy; environmental management; input-output analysis; network analysis; policy development; Article; carbon footprint; China; conceptual framework; cost control; ecology; energy; environmental management; environmental policy; fossil energy; geographic distribution; mathematical analysis; priority journal; recycling; risk evaluation and mitigation strategy; socioeconomics; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076244705

Energy utilization leads to an increase in CO2 emissions, which will in turn limit the formulation of energy policies and stability of energy systems. A provincial-scale Energy-Carbon Nexus Model is established to shed insight into the complicated system interactions among provinces. Specifically, different power generation types are considered to quantify the inter-provincial transfers of CO2 embodied in electricity transmission through the Multiregional Input-Output Analysis. Ecological Network Analysis is used to describe the integral mutual relationships between provinces and distinguish the control intensity of each province from different CO2 flows directions. Five new Energy-carbon emission factors are first performed to provide a more accurate assessment of the province's emissions capacity from different perspectives. Based on the theoretical basis of energy-carbon nexus, the emission reduction simulations considering energy substitution policy can be conducted to forecast the changes of provincial responsibility under different interventions. Results show that some provinces (e.g., Beijing) depend heavily on the supply of other provinces because of their low self-sufficiency rate in electricity, while some provinces (e.g., Guangdong) have high self-sufficiency rate and still emit more CO2 to other provinces to promote their own development. The importance of East China to the system cannot be ignored, but it should also undertake more responsibility for reducing emissions. However, the pace of development in Shandong will slow down because it mainly relies on coal power generation to indirectly promote the development of other provinces. What's more, importing electricity to achieve emission reduction may result in a rebound in indirect emissions and have a negative impact on the region's use of its own energy resources. This paper offers a new way to reveal details of energy-carbon interrelations across provinces and the achievements could provide references for formulating CO2 reduction policies of China electricity trading. © 2019","CO2 emission reduction simulation; Electricity transmission; Energy-carbon emission factor; Energy-carbon nexus; Input-output analysis","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Carbon emission factors; CO2 emission reduction; Electricity transmission; Energy-carbon nexus; Input output analysis; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074533356

However, there is still considerable uncertainty about the above- and belowground quantity and distribution of carbon stocks in African forests. Here, we evaluate how different carbon pools (aboveground live biomass, aboveground dead biomass, belowground biomass) contribute to total carbon stocks, and how different carbon components (e.g. large trees, understorey trees, coarse woody debris, roots, soil organic carbon etc.) contribute to carbon pools and total carbon stocks. We evaluated data of extensive inventories within 30 1-ha plots spanning the terra-firme semi-deciduous forest in eastern Cameroon. Hence, the plots were placed at a mean distance of 1 km from the nearest plot and we analyzed the data using variation partitioning, linear regressions and correlation tests. We found that the terra-firme semi-deciduous forests store 283.97 ± 51.42 Mg C ha−1. The aboveground biomass pool, with a carbon stock of 180.99 ± 25.8 Mg C ha−1, mostly explained variation in total carbon stocks (R2 = 0.79). From all aboveground biomass components, carbon in large trees was most strongly correlated with total carbon stocks. The second most important carbon pool was belowground carbon (on average 85.06 ± 16.86 Mg C ha−1; R2 = 0.78), mainly explained by coarse root carbon. Carbon in dead biomass had only a small contribution to total carbon stocks (R2 = 0.04). Hence, our results indicate that aboveground live biomass is a good predictor for variation in total carbon storage within this semi-deciduous terra-firme forest. However, aboveground live carbon and belowground carbon and their interactions explained most of the variation in total carbon stock, indicating that a whole-ecosystem approach is necessary for a full understanding of the carbon cycle. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass; Cameroon; Carbon storage; Climate change; Terra-firme semi-deciduous forest; Tropical rainforest; Variation partitioning","Biomass; Climate change; Data handling; Digital storage; Forestry; Lakes; Cameroon; Carbon storage; Semi-deciduous; Tropical rain forest; Variation partitioning; Organic carbon; aboveground biomass; aboveground production; belowground production; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; climate change; correlation; deciduous forest; rainforest; tropical region; Biomass; Cameroon; Carbon; Data Processing; Forestry; Forests; Lakes; Trees; Cameroon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076259972

Empirical results also show that synergy effect is evident in all the regional or sub-regional groupings.

The flow patterns investigated were the shear line (SL), confluence region (CR), and easterly wave (EW) patterns. Although these flow patterns are recognized as favorable environmental conditions for TCG, their general characteristics, such as the climatological horizontal distribution, have not been previously investigated and there has been no comparison of the significance of the TCG cases to the climatological mean. We examined flow patterns using flow pattern indices defined by the modified semiobjective analysis method. SL and CR were broadly distributed over the WNP east of the Philippines during the boreal summer season. There was apeakin the EW from summer toautumn and it was distributed in a band running in an east-west direction at a lower latitude. Flow pattern indices of all three flow patterns gradually intensified until the TCG date was reached. The SL and EW indices became more intense compared to the climatological mean one day before the TCG, while that of the CR did not exceed the climatological mean. TCG occurred at the eastern edge of the area with a high genesis potential index and relative humidity and a weak vertical shear over flow patterns. This determination of the general characteristics of favorable flow pattern conditions improves our understanding of the TCG process. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.",,"Hurricanes; Shear flow; Storms; Tropics; Analysis method; Easterly wave; Environmental conditions; Horizontal distribution; Pattern characteristic; Tropical cyclone; Vertical shear; Western North Pacific; Flow patterns; atmospheric dynamics; climatology; cyclogenesis; flow field; flow pattern; marine atmosphere; summer; tropical cyclone; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Philippines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082884390

We investigated the government policy from the perspective of a supply chain, which consisted of the upstream government (she) and the downstream manufacturing firm (he). The government decided on the policy (tax or subsidy) to maximize the social welfare, while the firm decided on the greenness level of the product, which affects the consumers' choice behavior and hence his own demand. Assuming else being equal, the government should adopt the tax policy if consumers are very sensitive to the greenness, the cost of greening is high, or the negative impact due to carbon emission is large, and subsidize the firm otherwise. We also conduct some numerical studies when price is endogenous.

Leaves are considered as important organs to purify particulate matter and alleviate air pollution. However, the current research mainly focuses on the removal capacity of particulate matter by urban plants at different scales, there are relatively few studies on the change of particle diameter at the air-leaf interface during this process. This study is one of the first to propose the existence of coagulation effect of aero submicron particles on the leaves, and a sweep-resuspension method and X-ray microscope were used to measure such size changes of two typical subtropical broad-leaf plants. The results showed that the size of submicron particles increased significantly during the migration from atmosphere to leaf surface: the average particle size increased from 0.48 μm at emission to 3.40 μm on the leaf surface, while the proportion of submicron particles decreased from 95% to less than 20%. The sweep-resuspension method was easy to implement, the data was easy to obtain, and the cost was low, therefore it could be widely used in the determination of the coagulation effect. The coagulation effect was also inferred as an important mechanism used by plants to reduce particulate matter. In the process of particulate removal: coagulation effect and dry deposition are actually two steps that occur simultaneously and interact. This finding refined the understanding of particulate removal processing, and laid a foundation for further research on factors affecting coagulation, which can be helpful for optimizing tree species selection and plant arrangement. Size of submicron particles increased when migrating from the atmosphere to the leaf surface, this coagulation effect was inferred as an important mechanism used by plants to reduce particulate matter. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Average particle size; Coagulation effect; Plant leaves; Submicron particles; Sweep-resuspension and X-ray microscope","Coagulation; Health risks; Particle size; Plants (botany); X ray microscopes; X rays; Average particle size; Coagulation effects; Plant leaves; Re-suspension; Sub-micron particles; Particles (particulate matter); coagulation; leaf; microscopy; particle size; particulate matter; plant; aero submicron particle; air pollution; comparative study; controlled study; dry deposition; heavy metal removal; leaf surface; microscopy; nonhuman; particle resuspension; particle size; particulate matter; plant leaf; process optimization; quantitative analysis; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; human; particle size; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Plant Leaves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075878518

Herein, we present an oxygen-deficient PbO decorated rice-husk-based hierarchical porous carbon (RHHPC@PbO1-x) composite as an effective additive of negative electrode in lead-carbon battery. The RHHPC@PbO1-x composite was prepared from a facile sol-gel/annealing method. The obtained RHHPC@PbO1-x composite and the lead-carbon electrode with RHHPC@PbO1-x additives were characterized by various physicochemical methods, such as scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and multiple electrochemical methods. The RHHPC@PbO1-x composite enhances the electrochemical active surface area and strengthens the structural stability of lead-carbon electrode, which improves the electrode kinetics and the cycling stability of lead-carbon negative electrode. As a result, the cycling life of a 2 V/4 Ah valve-regulated lead-carbon battery with RHHPC@PbO1-x composite additives exhibited a lifespan of 900 cycles (triple of the blank battery). Our work gives an insight for interphase and porosity tuning of lead-carbon additives used in lead-carbon battery. Based on the existing mature production facilities of lead-acid battery, it is promising for this RHHPC@PbO1-x additive to be used in commercial lead-carbon batteryies for renewable energy storage. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Hierarchical porous carbon; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Lead-acid battery; Lead-carbon composite; Partial state of charge","Additives; Carbon carbon composites; Charging (batteries); Electrochemical electrodes; Energy storage; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Lead acid batteries; Lead metallography; Lead oxide; Porous materials; Scanning electron microscopy; Sol-gels; Stability; Carbon composites; Electrochemical active surface areas; ELectrochemical methods; Hierarchical porous carbons; Partial state; Physicochemical methods; Renewable energy storages; Structural stabilities; Phosphorus compounds; alternative energy; composite; electrode; energy storage; hierarchical system; lead; reaction kinetics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076398334

Toward this goal, here we analyze the radiation at the top of the atmosphere and propose a measure of the DCC radiative effect (DCCRE) as the difference between the total radiative fluxes with the full cloud cycle and its uniformly distributed cloud counterpart. When applied to the frequency of cloud occurrence, DCCRE is linked to the covariance between DCC and cloud radiative effects. Satellite observations show that the daily cloud cycle is strongly linked to pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and climate hiatus, revealing its potential role in controlling climate variability. Climate model outputs show large inter-model spreads of DCCRE, accounting for approximately 20% inter-model spread of the cloud radiative effects. Climate models also suggest that while DCCRE is not sensitive to rising temperatures at the global scale, it can be important in certain regions. Such a framework can be used to conduct a more systematic evaluation of the DCC in climate models and observations with the goal to understand climate variability and reduce uncertainty in climate projections. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Climate hiatus; Cloud feedback; Cloud radiative kernels; Diurnal cycle of clouds; Pacific decadal oscillation","climate change; climate feedback; climate modeling; climate variation; cloud cover; cloud radiative forcing; diurnal variation; energy budget; future prospect; global warming; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; radiative forcing; top of atmosphere; uncertainty analysis; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076605106

It has been over seven years since the initiation of seven pilot carbon markets, but has the implementation achieved the goal of controlling carbon emissions in the region? Are the effects really resulted from the carbon market other than other energy-saving and emission reduction policies? Based on the provincial panel data of China from 2005 to 2016 this paper conducts an empirical study on the emission reduction effects of pilot projects using the Difference-in-differences model (DID). The results show that: (1) The implementation of carbon markets in Beijing, Shanghai and Hubei exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on local carbon emissions, but a promoting effect in Guangdong, and no significant effect was found in Tianjin; (2) In terms of time lag effect, no significant inhibiting effect on the local carbon emissions is found during the first year of opening of Shanghai carbon market but the effect grew significantly from 2015 to 2016; while for Hubei and Beijing, significant effect was shown from the first year of running. Being an experimental program to see whether the carbon trading policy would work in China or not and if it does, under what conditions and settings the policy becomes effective, the 7 pilot markets provide important experiences and lessons to the upcoming nationwide market in China. Based on the empirical result that the carbon trading system in Beijing, Shanghai and Hubei effectively reduced carbon emissions, it is suggested that the national carbon market should actively learn from the experiences of these three pilot markets particularly. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Carbon market; Climate change; DID model; ETS","Climate change; Climate models; Emission control; Energy conservation; Carbon emissions; Carbon markets; Difference-in-differences models; Emission reduction; Empirical studies; Energy saving and emission reductions; Experimental program; Inhibitory effect; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075478578

Our analyses suggest that Chinese households' electricity consumption tends to increase with the severity of heavy air pollution. Our results are shown to be robust across various model specifications, sample configurations and alternative air quality indicators.

The biggest renewable energy sources in the UK are bioenergy, wind, solar, and hydro. The UK is located in prime geography, considered to be the best in Europe, for harvesting, and over the last three decades, the number of wind farms has increased greatly. However, the interaction of wind speed and structural strength has limited the height of platform-based wind turbines to a maximum height of around 100 m. Airborne wind energy (AWE) systems enable the extraction of more energy from the wind at elevated altitudes beyond 150 m using a device termed a kite. A method is required to determine suitable locations for AWE system implementation. In this work, a regional feasibility study has been conducted to establish an ideal suitable location to implement AWE systems. Extensive research has been carried out to assess the electricity costs, energy savings, area availability, as well as regional airborne wind energy power densities at different regions within the UK. A standardized method has been developed to assess the viability of AWE in various geographical locations. It was found that Scotland was the most suitable location for the implementation of AWE systems due to the high wind power density in this region and existing high costs of electricity, thus greater potentials for energy cost savings.

A significant study has been made in fracture characteristics; however, the detailed structural and fractal characteristics of micro-fractures and micro-pores of tectonically deformed coals are poorly understood. To get deep insight into the variability and heterogeneity of micro-pores and micro-fractures in different tectonically deformed coals collected from the Guojiahe coal mine, the multifractal analysis using the Menger sponge and box-counting model was employed to study deformed coals based on mercury injection porosimetry and scanning electron microscopy. The results show that tectonic deformation changed the structure of the micro-pores by increasing their diameter and that of the micro-fractures by expanding, intersecting, and creating additional microfracture networks at any scale. For the coals investigated in this study, permeability was nonlinearly correlated with their structural fractal. For undeformed coals, with the increase in the fractal dimension of micro-pores, the distribution of coal permeability exhibits a U-shape. However, it exhibited an inverted U-shape as the fractal dimension of micro-fractures increased. The distribution of the permeability of deformed coal samples is characterized by a U-shape as the fractal dimension of micro-fractures increased, while the fractal dimension of micro-pores decreased. Thus, the structural proportional odds of micro-pores and micro-fractures are vital in defining the maximum value of permeability. As a whole, deformed coals have a relatively high permeability as local micro-pores and micro-fractures are well connected. We suggest that coal seams with brittle deformation at syncline, anticline, and folded areas are favorable for CBM exploitation. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Coal; Coal deposits; Coal mines; Deformation; Fracture; Metal recovery; Methane; Micrometers; Scanning electron microscopy; Tectonics; Brittle deformation; Coal permeabilities; Fractal characteristics; Fracture characteristics; Fracture structures; Multifractal analysis; Tectonic deformations; Tectonically deformed coals; Fractal dimension",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079696817

Herein, we successfully fabricated a nickel-nitrogen-modified porous carbon/carbon nanotube hybrid electrocatalyst (Ni-NPC/CNTs) with necklace-like geometry through a three-step assembly process including the integration of Zn-based metal-organic framework (ZIF-8) and carbon nanotube, double-solvent solution impregnation of Ni component, and pyrolysis treatment. Owing to the abundant and dispersive surface Ni-Nx and pyridine-N active sites, synesthetic effect between active sites, favored necklace-like geometry with micro-/mesopores, large surface areas, and interconnected electron highway, the as-assembled Ni-NPC/CNTs electrocatalyst exhibits exciting catalytic performance for the selective reduction of CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO) in 0.5 M KHCO3, gives a maximum CO faradaic efficiency of 94% at a moderate overpotential of 660 mV with large current density of 11.2 mA cm−2, and maintains an average CO faradaic efficiency of 92% and high durability over a wide potential range from −0.67 to −1.0 V.

Although CO2 capture and utilization have received great attention, water capture from power plant has received limited attention. The power plants in Qatar exhaust 33 Million m3 of water per year. This paper explores selected alternative technologies namely absorption, compression &amp; cooling, and quenching, to enable the recovery of water vapor contained in a base case 750 MW power plant flue gas streams. The alternatives for water capture were modeled and optimized over a wide range of operating conditions (pressure, temperature, and flow rate). Using data from an actual gas fired power plant in the state of Qatar, simulation studies were carried out and optimized for all modeled technologies to minimize production cost using Aspen HYSYS V8.6. The results show that the quench unit, operated at pertinent water circulation temperature (50 °C), pressure (6 atm), and flowrate of 3500 m3/h (recyclable), can extract up to 80.7% of the water in the flue gas. Apart from production cost and water capture percentage, criteria used to screen the alternative technologies were payback period, CO2e emission and brine reduction rate. The research work determined that the quench alternative had the lowest payback period (8.8 years), lowest CO2 emission rate (13 kg CO2/m3 H2O) and highest brine reduction (3.44%) among all the tested alternatives.

Hourly air temperature and relative humidity were continuously measured for three years in 10 neighborhoods of Nanjing, China, which were selected based on the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) scheme. Data collected from the LCZ sites and suburban meteorological stations were analyzed and used as inputs for building energy simulations. Two types of building use (residential and office) were investigated. For the 10 LCZ sites, the annual mean UHI intensity ranged from 0.4 °C to 2.2 °C in the nighttime (19:00–06:00), and from 0.3 °C to 0.9 °C in the daytime (07:00–18:00). The heat islands presented in the LCZ sites could increase the cooling demand of residential (office) buildings by 12−24% (9−14%) and reduce heating demand by 3−20% (5−20%), leading to an increase of 2−5% (2−6%) in annual total demand. Compared with residential buildings, office buildings were less sensitive to UHI with respect to cooling and heating demand. Analysis of the hottest and coldest days shows that the average daily peak cooling load of residential (office) buildings was increased by 6−14% (5−9%), and the average daily peak heating load was decreased by 4−15% (3−14%). The study indicates that the spatiotemporal variability of UHI at the local scale can exert different effects on the energy performance of buildings. In addition, this study emphasizes the importance of developing site-specific climatic data to reliably assess the energy performance of buildings in urban contexts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building energy demand; Climatic data; Local climate zone; Long-term observation; Urban heat island","Atmospheric temperature; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Housing; Office buildings; Thermal pollution; Building energy demands; Climatic data; Local climate; Long term observations; Urban heat island; Urban growth; air temperature; building; data set; demand analysis; heat island; heating; neighborhood; observational method; relative humidity; temperature effect; Nanjing [Jiangsu]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076287095

The decision tree (DT) method is one of the commonly used techniques to simulate reservoir operation and release strategies because of its simplicity and effectiveness. However, the performances and simulation accuracy vary among different DT models due to many structures and splitting rules associated with each DT model. In this study, we propose a dynamic merge technique (DMerge), which adopts a concept from particle swarm optimization, to postprocess outputs from different DT models with the purpose of increasing the simulation accuracy and producing a model ensemble with dynamically changing weights throughout the validation phase. A case study of Shasta Lake in northern California is presented, where the daily hydropower releases are predicted and compared using the DMerge, AdaBoost DT, random forest, and extremely randomized trees methods. Results show that the DMerge method has the best statistics compared to other popular DT algorithms. Furthermore, scenario tests were carried out to analyze the sensitivity to model inputs (i.e., hydrological condition, reservoir storage and regulation, climate phenomenon indices, and water quality) with respect to explaining the variability of hydropower releases. According to the results, we found that the hydropower releases are a complex decision-making process and water quality and climate conditions could play an even more significant role than both hydrological forcing and system states in our case study. The proposed DMerge method is a robust and efficient technique in solving water-energy prediction and simulation problems, and it is suitable for joint use with other data-driven approaches. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Decision tree; Environmental impacts; Hydropower; Reservoir operation","Adaptive boosting; Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Decision making; Decision trees; Digital storage; Environmental impact; Hydroelectric power; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Reservoirs (water); Water quality; Data-driven approach; Decision tree method; Engineering constraints; Hydrological condition; Hydropower; Multi-source informations; Reservoir operation; Simulation accuracy; Climate models; accuracy assessment; algorithm; artificial intelligence; climate change; discharge; environmental impact; hydroelectric power plant; hydrological modeling; optimization; water quality; water storage; California; Shasta Lake; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075893511

Yet few studies have focused on how fire affects taxonomic and functional diversities of soil microbial communities, along with changes in plant communities and soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics. Here, we analyze these effects in a grassland ecosystem 9 months after an experimental fire at the Jasper Ridge Global Change Experiment site in California, USA. Fire altered soil microbial communities considerably, with community assembly process analysis showing that environmental selection pressure was higher in burned sites. However, a small subset of highly connected taxa was able to withstand the disturbance. In addition, fire decreased the relative abundances of most functional genes associated with C degradation and N cycling, implicating a slowdown of microbial processes linked to soil C and N dynamics. In contrast, fire stimulated above- and belowground plant growth, likely enhancing plant–microbe competition for soil inorganic N, which was reduced by a factor of about 2. To synthesize those findings, we performed structural equation modeling, which showed that plants but not microbial communities were responsible for significantly higher soil respiration rates in burned sites. Together, our results demonstrate that fire ‘reboots’ the grassland ecosystem by differentially regulating plant and soil microbial communities, leading to significant changes in soil C and N dynamics. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Californian grasslands; climate change; fire; GeoChip; high-throughput sequencing; microbial communities","climate change; ecosystem function; fire behavior; functional group; grassland; microbial community; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil nitrogen; taxonomy; temperature effect; California; Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve; United States; California; ecosystem; grassland; microbiology; microflora; soil; California; Ecosystem; Grassland; Microbiota; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074583222

Due to its social benefits, many provinces/municipalities provide subsidies for rail containers. These subsidies, aimed at reducing road traffic and emissions, may, however, have unexpected results if they are uncoordinated. Our objective is to illustrate the problem with uncoordinated subsidies and propose an optimal subsidy scheme. This study applies the minimum cost flow model to analyze three scenarios: no subsidy, the internalization of external costs, and uncoordinated subsidies. A bi-level programming model is developed to study the scenario of coordinated subsidies, where a hypothetical network planner minimizes the total subsidies for a given externality reduction target in the upper level and the cargo owners minimize total transportation cost in the lower level. A novel method is designed to transform the model into a simple four-step linear programming process. The model and solution method are then applied to containerized trade of Northeast Asia with Europe and that with northern Chinese inland cities. The coordinated subsidy scheme is found to use less in total subsidies, achieve better results than the uncoordinated one, and better total social welfare. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bi-level programming; multimodal container; novel solution method; Optimal subsidy; transportation network","container ship; cost analysis; maritime transportation; subsidy system; traffic emission; traffic management; transportation development; transportation system; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075242211

Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) exists in various phytoplankton species and is an important enzyme in the photosynthetic process. To investigate the phytoplankton composition (internal driving forces), we selected the functional gene of the Rubisco large subunit (rbcL) as the target gene for this study. Phytoplankton gross primary productivity was measured using light and dark biological oxygen demand bottles to assess the carbon sequestration potential. The fundamental environmental indicators were determined to analyze the mechanisms that drive the carbon fixation process. The correlation results indicated that green algae were only controlled by nitrate, and that diatoms were positively correlated with phosphate. The cluster analysis results demonstrated that nitrite was the major driver controlling phytoplankton primary productivity. During the wet seasons (spring and summer), the contribution of the planktonic community respiration to the carbon sequestration potential was higher than net primary productivity (NPP), followed by dissolved organic carbon and nitrate. During the dry season (autumn), NPP, total nitrogen, and nitrite ranked highest in terms of carbon sequestration potential. The contributions of green algae and diatoms to the carbon sequestration potential were temporally higher than those of cyanobacteria. The maximum carbon sequestration potential occurred during autumn because of diatom production and the function of phosphate, whereas the minimum carbon sequestration potential occurred in summer. Spatially, the upstream carbon sequestration potential was higher compared with downstream because of the effect (contribution) of cyanobacteria (Phormidium), diatoms (Surirella solea and Thalassiosira pseudonana), and environmental variable (nitrite). These findings provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of phytoplankton productivity and the influences of environmental variables on carbon sequestration in urban river ecosystems. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon sequestration potential; Environmental variables; Phytoplankton; Spatiotemporal contribution; Urban river","biochemical oxygen demand; carbon fixation; carbon sequestration; cluster analysis; correlation; cyanobacterium; diatom; dissolved organic carbon; dry season; respiration; Bacillariophyta; Chlorophyta; Cyanobacteria; Phormidium; Solea; Surirella; Thalassiosira pseudonana; carbon sequestration; chemistry; diatom; ecosystem; phytoplankton; river; season; Carbon Sequestration; Diatoms; Ecosystem; Phytoplankton; Rivers; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076929639

Considering the lowest carbon emission intensity and the greatest mitigation task in the Eastern Economic Zone of China, this paper analyses the change of carbon emission intensity in Eastern China from 2000 to 2015. First, to prove the significance of carbon emission intensity, this paper studies the cointegration relationship between carbon emissions and the GDP. Afterwards, from the spatiotemporal perspective, this paper decomposes and analyses the carbon emission intensity of the whole country, Eastern China and the provinces of Eastern China and quantifies the impact of different factors. This paper finds that the energy structure of China and the East was in a relatively stable state during this period. In the past, the decrease in carbon emission intensity mainly depended on the improvement of sectoral emission efficiency, and the influence of industrial structure is growing. Furthermore, changes in the eastern region are similar to those in the whole country. The eastern region needs to give full play to its economic advantage in the future. On the spatial scale, GDP per capita and the ratio of tertiary industry have a significant impact on the spatial heterogeneity of carbon emission intensity in East China, while the ratio of secondary industry has few effects. Replacing energy-intensive industry with the service industry will be the focus of emission reduction in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaption strategy; Carbon emission intensity; Climate change; Spatiotemporal analysis","Carbon; Emission control; Risk assessment; Adaption strategy; Carbon emission intensities; Carbon emission reductions; Cointegration relationship; Energy intensive industries; Industrial structures; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatiotemporal analysis; Climate change; adaptive management; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; pollution policy; risk factor; spatiotemporal analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077682102

In this study, we revealed rapid and strong biocidal effect of ferrate (Fe(VI)) on sulfidogenic and methanogenic sewer biofilms, leading to control of sulfide and methane production in sewer. The inactivation of the microorganisms in sewer biofilms by Fe(VI) could be accomplished within 15 min for a single dosing event and the biocidal effect could be enhanced by applying pulse dosing strategy. The microbiological analysis showed that the key functional genes involved in sulfide and methane production, i.e. dsrA and mcrA, in the viable cells after Fe(VI) dosing were decreased substantially by 84.2% and 86.6%, respectively. Significant drops were also observed in the relative abundances of viable sulfide reducing bacteria (SRB) and methanogenic archaea (MA). The direct dosing of Fe(VI) into a sewer reactor led to instant and complete suppression of sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities, and the recovery of the activities resembled the regrowth of residual SRB and MA.

Here we are to explore the conversion of organic carbon (OC) from decayed plant litter in soil and its influence on final SOC sequestration. Materials and methods: In situ investigation combined with laboratory soil incubation experiments were conducted in mixing zones dominated by halophytes of Phragmites communis and Spartina alterniflora in the Jiuduansha wetland of the Yangtze River estuary to investigate differences in conversion patterns of OC from two decayed plant litters of different characteristics using traditional physicochemical indicators and stable isotope tracing. Additionally, the mechanism of biotransformation was investigated through analysis of soil microbial community structure. Results and discussion: Due to the higher content of lignin and cellulose in P. communis litter, the associated soil microbial community was more conducive to the formation of soil humus (HS). By contrast, more easily decomposable S. alterniflora litter induced its related soil microbial community more amenable to mineralization. Consequently, OC from decayed S. alterniflora litter remained in soil for less time than that from decayed P. communis, and the lost OC was more readily converted into CO2. OC from decayed P. communis was degraded very slowly during the early stage of conversion (November), and its longer duration in soil was favorable for HS formation. Conclusions: Analysis of the conversion of intermediates derived from different types of decayed plants can provide insight into plant litter input and SOC formation, and indicate the whereabouts of lost OC. From the perspective of plant biomass and conversion of plant litter-derived OC, P. communis is more conducive to soil carbon sequestration than S. alterniflora. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biotransformation; Phragmites communis; Plant litter; Soil microbial community; Soil organic carbon; Spartina alterniflora","biotransformation; carbon sequestration; cellulose; grass; humus; invasive species; leaf litter; microbial community; native species; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; wetland; China; Jiuduansha; Shanghai; Yangtze Estuary; Phragmites australis; Spartina alterniflora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075208198

Through a series of actions to control air pollution, the emissions of major atmospheric pollutants are reduced to improve urban air quality. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of control measures taken to mitigate atmospheric pollution, we investigated and analyzed the implementation of the CAAP in Beijing from 2013 to 2017, estimating the corresponding reduction in emissions of major air pollutants. The contribution of different control measures to the improvement of air quality was quantified and the experiences of managing air pollution were summarized, which provided references for the continuous improvement of air quality in Beijing and the surrounding areas. The results showed that the emission of SO2, NOX, PM10, PM2.5, and VOCs from air pollution source have been decreased by 119,924, 116,091, 116,810, 46,652, and 97,267 tons after the implementation of the CAAP. The sum of these five air pollutants emissions have been reduced by 39% in 2017 compared with 2013, the largest decrease in SO2 emissions was 87%, which was related to the vigorous control on coal-fired combustion. The control measure with the greatest contribution to decreasing the ambient PM2.5 concentration was the clean energy transformation of coal-fired power plants, which contributed 27% of the total reduced concentration and 6.1 μg/m3 of the average PM2.5 concentration reduction in Beijing. Clean Residential coal use also significantly decreased the PM2.5 concentration by 5.4 μg/m3, which was 23% of the total reduction. In addition, the industrial restructuring and the management of automotive vehicle use and dust could also contribute to efficiently reducing the PM2.5 concentration by 4.0, 3.2, and 2.3 μg/m3, or 17%, 14%, and 10% of the total reduction, respectively. Due to the implementation of control measures of Clean Air Action Plan, the energy and industrial structure of Beijing have been adjusted and optimized, leading to the reduction of pollutant emissions, which is the secret of urban long-term air quality improvement. © 2020 by the authors.","Clean air action plan (CAAP); Control measure; Emission reduction; Environmental effective assessment; Major atmospheric pollutant","Air quality; Coal; Coal combustion; Emission control; Fossil fuel power plants; Action plan; Atmospheric pollutants; Control measures; Emission reduction; Environmental effective assessment; Quality control; action plan; air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission control; environmental assessment; policy implementation; urban atmosphere; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081156526

Increasing pavement albedo, therefore, has been considered as a technological strategy to mitigate global warming. Previous studies have evaluated this strategy using global average models. To factor this effect into life cycle assessments, location-specific models of the albedo effect for pavements are required. A parametric analytical model is developed to estimate the radiative forcing (RF) using a novel model form and an iterative solution approach. The new model is extended to estimate the corresponding global warming potential (GWP) over an analysis period of 50 years for an albedo change in a pavement surface. This was applied to quantify the GWP impacts of increasing pavement albedo in 14 cities across various climate zones in the US. For the United States, the GWP in kg CO2 equivalent per square meter of altered surface ranges from 0.8 to 1.6 per 0.01 change in albedo, a range of more than 40%. Analysis of a hypothetical albedo change to all darker pavements in the US would produce a negative RF of a magnitude equivalent to that associated with a reduction in CO2 emissions of more than 17 Mton per year. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Atmospheric radiation; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Life cycle; Pavements; Albedo materials; Analytical approach; Earth's radiative balance; Global warming potential; Iterative solutions; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Pavement surface; Radiative forcings; Solar radiation; asphalt; carbon dioxide; concrete; albedo; analytical method; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; global warming; life cycle; pavement; radiative forcing; solar radiation; strategic approach; warming; aerosol; albedo; analytic method; Article; climate change; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; highway; land use; life cycle assessment; Maryland; radiative forcing; reduction (chemistry); solar radiation; city; climate; greenhouse effect; United States; Cities; Climate; Climate Change; Global Warming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080962556

PM retention by plant leaves can reduce PM pollution from atmosphere, but in urban areas winds can cause PM resuspension, thereby preventing retention and worsening airborne pollution. Unlike winds, rainfall events can cause PM to be washed off leaves and onto the ground, which represents a net removal of PM from the atmosphere. This systematic review examines previous studies of leaf-PM interaction events involved PM retention, PM resuspension, or PM wash-off from leaves. Publication frequency of studies on using plants for airborne PM reduction in urban areas had grown over the past decade and we focused on 65 published papers in this review. Most of these studies were performed in Europe and East Asia, and involved PM retention on the leaves of varied urban trees in different time and space. In general, these studies indicated that rough leaves showed higher degree of PM retention than glabrous leaves. However, only six out of the 65 papers considered PM wash-off from leaves; as shown in these studies, smooth leaves may have a higher PM wash-off level than rough leaves. We conclude by recommending that future researches should be focused on studying leaf-retained PM wash-off in greater detail. We also suggest that urban plant species associated with a higher PM wash-off efficiency should be identified. Moreover, we may be able to increase PM net removal mass and thereby reduce winter haze by adding more evergreen plants with a higher leaf-retained PM wash-off efficacy. Finally, establishing a standard evaluation system for airborne PM reduction based on leaf-retained PM wash-off mass may be highly useful for landscape planning and design in the future. © 2019","Airborne particulate matter; Leaves; PM net removal; PM resuspension; PM retention; PM2.5","atmospheric pollution; biomass; combustion; fossil fuel; frequency analysis; literature review; particulate matter; resuspension; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; Europe; Far East",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076246035

However, evaluation of the chemical composition of precipitation and N deposition flux in rural areas of Beijing has received little attention to date. This paper presents the chemical constituents, possible sources and wet deposition fluxes of water-soluble ions (NH4 +, NO3 −, SO4 2−, Cl−, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) in precipitation samples collected during 2017–2018 at a rural site located at northwest of Beijing city; meanwhile, dry deposition of reactive N species (gaseous ammonia, nitrogen dioxide, nitric acid, and particulate (p) NH4 + and NO3 −) were also quantified. During this 2-year period, the volume-weighted mean (VWM) pH of precipitation was 6.73, and all samples had pH values above 6.0. The VWM electric conductivity of precipitation and the mean sum of all measured ions was 43.8 μS cm−1 and 591.9 μeq L−1, respectively, indicating a significant impact of atmospheric pollution. Ca2+ and NH4 + were the dominant neutralizing species for precipitation acidity. Positive matrix factorization analysis further confirmed five sources for water-soluble ions, including sea salt aging, secondary formation, agriculture, crust, and biomass burning. The annual mean wet N deposition was 4.6, 3.4 and 8.0 kg N ha−1 yr−1 for NH4 +, NO3 − and total inorganic N, respectively. The total dry N deposition was dominated by gaseous ammonia (11.5 kg N ha−1 yr−1). The total N deposition (wet plus dry) was 27.7 kg N ha−1 yr−1, where dry deposition contributed to 75% and wet deposition 25% of the total. The simulations from the GEOS-Chem model indicate that agricultural (fertilizer use and livestock) and nonagricultural sources (industry, power plant, and transportation) are both important contributors to total N deposition. These results could be useful in evaluating/developing emission control policies to protect the eco-environment in Beijing. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Ammonia; Nitrogen deposition; Rainwater chemistry; Source apportionment","Agriculture; Air pollution; Air quality; Ammonia; Emission control; Factorization; Ions; Nitrogen oxides; Rural areas; Atmospheric nitrogen deposition; Atmospheric pollution; Nitrogen deposition; Non-agricultural sources; Positive Matrix Factorization; Precipitation chemistry; Rainwater chemistry; Source apportionment; Atmospheric chemistry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077364646

Although many sustainable construction materials have been developed to alleviate these problems, because of the relatively high cost, sustainable construction materials are not yet widely used by construction materials suppliers, which is contrary to many regional authority environmental protection targets. With full consideration of the interests of the regional authorities and construction materials suppliers, this paper developed a Stackelberg equilibrium-based approach to balance economic benefits and carbon emissions reductions. The proposed model was applied to a case from China to demonstrate its effectiveness and practicality in reducing carbon emissions, from which it was found that the model was able to effectively reduce construction materials production and transportation carbon emissions, encourage construction materials suppliers to take environmental initiatives by increasing their production and sales of sustainable products, and assist local authorities achieve their emissions reduction targets. Practical and feasible policy approaches were then given based on the results to assist regional authorities further control construction industry carbon emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Economic benefits; Environment economic equilibrium; Sustainable construction materials; Sustainable development; Unsustainable construction materials","Carbon; Construction industry; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Environmental protection; Greenhouse gases; Materials handling; Natural gas transportation; Planning; Carbon emissions; Carbon emissions reductions; Economic benefits; Economic equilibrium; Environmental initiatives; Production and transportations; Stackelberg equilibrium; Sustainable construction; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075206132

Previous studies have demonstrated the detection of known sources of CH4 emission using the hyperspectral technology based on in situ vertical CH4 profile or ground CH4 emissions data. However, those approaches have not yet to detect the unknown terrestrial sources of CH4 emission at local-scale or regional-scale. In this paper, the Shortwave Airborne Spectrographic Imager (SASI) was employed to detect concentrated sources of CH4 emissions based on the absorption of CH4 in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region. As a result, a band ratio (namely RCH4, RCH4 = Band91/Band78) determined through wavelet transform singularity detection has proposed for detection of the terrestrial CH4 emissions sources using SASI hyperspectral radiance image data, and elevated CH4 locations in the oil shale retorting plants were identified. Additionally, SASI surface reflectance data and multiple reference spectra in the spectral angle mapper (SAM) were used to classify surface sources of CH4 release. High-resolution Google Earth imagery and thermal imaging camera (FLIR GF320) had also verified that the CH4 releasing sources are mainly the oil shale mining field and the retorting plant. Therefore, the high-resolution imaging hyperspectral spectrometer can provide a powerful tool for detecting terrestrial CH4 release sources at local-scale to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions related to hydrocarbon development. © 2020 by the authors.","Band ratio; Concentrated sources; Hyperspectral data; Methane emissions; Wavelet transform","Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrocarbon refining; Hyperspectral imaging; Infrared imaging; Infrared radiation; Methane; Oil shale; Oil shale retorting; Wavelet transforms; Airborne hyperspectral data; Band ratios; Concentrated source; High-resolution imaging; Hyperspectral Data; Hyperspectral spectrometer; Methane emissions; Thermal imaging cameras; Oil shale processing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080942513

However, relevant data that are important for climate change mitigation, have rarely been collected in regions outside of East Asia and India. Information on seasonal patterns of NPP and its components will enable the quantification of factors that influence the carbon balance in bamboo forests. In this study, we quantified the aboveground biomass (AGB) and aboveground NPP of five major bamboo species in northern Laos using monthly data collected over a 12-month period. Methods: All live culms in 10, 2 m × 2 m plots (for one monopodial bamboo species: Indosasa sinica) and 30 clumps per species (for four sympodial bamboo species: Bambusa tulda, Cephalostachyum virgatum, Dendrocalamus membranaceus and Gigantochloa sp.) were numbered and measured at breast height. We set 10 or 20 litter traps per species to collect litterfall. Censuses of dead and recruited culms and litterfall collection were performed once per month for 12 months. Important Findings: The AGB was highest in I. sinica (59.87 Mg ha-1) and lowest in C. virgatum (11.54 Mg ha-1), and was mostly below the plausible global range for bamboos (32-256 Mg ha-1). The sympatric distribution of multiple bamboo species at the study sites may have suppressed the AGB in four of the five studied species. The aboveground NPP estimates were between 3.43 and 14.25 Mg ha-1 yr-1; those for D. membranaceus (8.20 Mg ha-1 yr-1) and I. sinica (14.25 Mg ha-1 yr-1) were comparable to mean global estimates for temperate evergreen forests (8.78 Mg ha-1 yr-1) and tropical moist forests (10.56 Mg ha-1 yr-1). High culm recruitment rates (15.20-23.39% yr-1) were major contributors to aboveground NPP estimates. Seasonal patterns of aboveground NPP were largely influenced by the phenology of the new culms. In the four sympodial bamboo species, new culms began to emerge following the onset of persistent rainfall, mainly in July and August. However, the sprouting of new culms in the monopodial species I. sinica followed a trend of increasing temperatures, mainly in March and April. Thus, our results indicate that bamboos have considerable potential for sequestering carbon in northern Laos, but that this potential may be affected by climate change. © 2019 The Author(s).

Drawing lessons from these project experiences may thus help improve the design of jurisdictional programs, which is the focus of REDD+ implementation in the Paris Agreement. Here we first scrutinize how REDD+ was historically conceptualized, the most prominent model being that of a multitier payments for environmental services (PES) scheme of “passing on” carbon mitigation responsibilities and credits across scales, from international buyers to forestland owners. Then we analyze two REDD+ project databases, ID-RECCO and GCS-REDD, using principal component and regression analysis. Among 226 conservation-oriented REDD+ projects, only 88 had planned conditional incentives to landowners—the key feature of PES. Intentions to apply PES rose after 2007, and correlate strongly with efforts to seek certification, including as a benefit-sharing strategy, and with carbon sales. Zooming closer into a portfolio of 23 local REDD+ projects that were actually implemented on the ground, we found project implementers reported conditional incentives as potentially being both the most promising and effective intervention. Likewise, treated households identified conditional incentives as comparatively effective in changing their land-use plans, while also providing above-average welfare returns. Still, these conditional incentives remained underutilized in implementation, with only one-third of the treatment intensity compared to non-conditional incentives. Project implementers cited insecure land tenure and uncertain REDD+ financial flows as key impediments to using conditional incentives. The original vision of a multitier PES model for REDD+ thus ran into both supply and demand side problems, jointly explaining the discrepancy between REDD+ theory and practice. Since jurisdictional approaches to REDD+ so far also receive only hesitant and slow climate financing flows, coming mostly in non-conditional form, and operate under forest-frontier governance with similar tenure restrictions, jurisdictions would seem well-advised to plan for conditional landowner incentives only in scenarios where the preconditions for PES are met. Implementers of jurisidictional approaches may also want to avoid conceptualizing their new model too narrowly and prescriptively, as was arguably the case with the conceptualization of REDD+ as a multitier PES scheme. © Copyright © 2020 Wunder, Duchelle, Sassi, Sills, Simonet and Sunderlin.","carbon markets; certification; climate change mitigation; deforestation; payments for environmental services",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092430059

In this study, emissions from ships at berth in Guangzhou, southern China, were characterized before and after the implementation of the fuel switch policy (IFSP) with an FSC limit of 0.5% in the Pearl River Delta ECA (ECA-PRD). After IFSP, the emission factors (EFs) of SO2 and PM2.5 for the coastal vessels decreased by 78% and 56% on average, respectively; however, the EFs of the VOCs were 1807±1746 mg kg-1, approximately 15 times that of 118±56:1 mg kg-1 before IFSP. This dramatic increase in the emissions of the VOCs might have been largely due to the replacement of high-sulfur residual fuel oil with low-sulfur diesel or heavy oils, which are typically richer in short-chain hydrocarbons. Moreover, reactive alkenes surpassed alkanes to become the dominant group among the VOCs, and lowcarbon- number VOCs, such as ethylene, propene and isobutane, became the dominant species after IFSP. As a result of the largely elevated EFs of the reactive alkenes and aromatics after IFSP, the emitted VOCs per kilogram of fuel burned had nearly 29 times greater ozone formation potential (OFP) and approximately 2 times greater secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAFP) than those before IFSP. Unlike the coastal vessels, the river vessels in the region used diesel fuels consistently and were not affected by the fuel switch policy, but the EFs of their VOCs were 90% greater than those of the coastal vessels after IFSP, with approximately 120% greater fuel-based OFP and 70 % 140%greater SOAFP. The results from this study suggest that while the fuel switch policy could effectively reduce SO2 and PM emissions, and thus help control PM2.5 pollution, it will also lead to greater emissions of reactive VOCs, which may threaten ozone pollution control in harbor cities. This change for coastal or oceangoing vessels, in addition to the large amounts of reactive VOCs from the river vessels, raises regulatory concerns for ship emissions of reactive VOCs. © 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc..

However, the city-level mercury emission inventory as the cornerstone of proper policy design is still in its infancy, due to data availability. For the first time, this study developed a comprehensive city-level atmospheric mercury emission inventory from coal combustion in China in 2010, by updating emission factors based on high-resolution information such as the plant-specific air pollution control devices (APCDs) in 182 cities. The estimated atmospheric mercury emissions from coal combustion were 202.3 tons (−51.7%,133.6%), over half of which were concentrated in 36 cities such as Chongqing (megacity) and Ordos (heavily coal-reliant city), implying mercury emissions were unevenly distributed. Mercury emitted from coal-fired power plants with the largest coal consumption was less than that from industrial coal combustion, because more efficient APCDs were installed in power plants. This study also took GDP, the proportion of coal in energy mix and cities’ population as the benchmark to classify cities into various groups.

The experiment involved RDI and PRD treatment, irrigated with the 50 % replacement of pan evaporation (Ep) during the slow fruit growth stage, and 80 % replacement of Ep during rapid fruit enlargement stage. Control trees were irrigated with the 80 % replacement of Ep during the whole growing season. No significant differences in the soil and leaf water status between PRD and RDI were observed, which resulted in the similar vegetative growth, fruit yield and leaf gas exchange between PRD and RDI trees. In conclusion, the leaf gas exchange, the vegetative and fruit growth of pear trees planted under extreme drought condition were mainly controlled by the irrigation volume rather than the irrigation method. Therefore, application of the PRD technique was not recommended in the extremely arid region compared with the RDI strategy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Fruit yield; Leaf physiological parameters; Soil water status; Vegetative growth","arid region; climate effect; crop yield; desert; endogenous growth; fruit; growing season; growth; irrigation system; orchard; physiology; rhizome; rhizosphere; soil water; Pyrus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076118314

The Action Plan for Tackling the Challenges of Diesel Truck Pollution Control issued by the Chinese government requires the establishment of a national monitoring network for transport-related air pollution and the use of various means to monitor diesel truck emissions. This study briefly summarized the requirements for diesel truck emission monitoring and supervision. Relying on the highway network traffic survey data, a method for identifying the main route of regional highway freight transportation was proposed. Then referring to the experience of highway air quality monitoring networks at home and abroad, the article proposed layout methods for roadside air quality monitoring stations, vehicle remote sensing monitoring stations, and road inspection stations, which fills the gap in domestic methods. At last, a demonstration study on the layout plan for the in-use diesel truck emissions monitoring stations in Shanxi Province was carried out.

Respiratory viruses are often associated with PM2.5 exposure, but the mechanism of toxicity remains to be explored. The vitro models that adequately reproduce healthy cells or diseased cells exposing to PM2.5 and infecting VSV can provide a useful tool for studying innate immune mechanisms and investigating new therapeutic focus. In the environment of PM2.5, an infection model in which VSV infected A549 cells was established, that mimics the state in which the antiviral innate immune pathways are activated after the respiratory system is infected with RNA viruses. Subsequently, the model was exposed to PM2.5 for 24 h. PM2.5 could be ingested by A549 cells and synergize with VSV to inhibit cell viability and promote apoptosis. The expression of VSV-G were more abundant after VSV-infected A549 cells were exposed to PM2.5. Furthermore, PM2.5 inhibits VSV-induced IFN-β expression in A549 cells. ISG15, CCL-5, and CXCL-10 had the same expression tendency with IFN-β mRNA, consistently. Interestingly, when MG132 was applied, the expression of p-IRF-3 and IFN-β proteins reduced by PM2.5 were refreshed. Conversely, the expression of VSV-G proteins were decreased. PM2.5 could degrade p-IRF-3 proteins by ubiquitination pathway to inhibit VSV-induced IFN-β expression in A549 cells. Therefore, replication of the VSV viruses was promoted. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","A549; IFN-β; PM2.5; Urban particulate matter; Vesicular stomatitis virus","benzyloxycarbonylleucylleucylleucinal; beta interferon; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; guanine nucleotide binding protein; interferon regulatory factor 3; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase; RANTES; beta interferon; interferon regulatory factor 3; IRF3 protein, human; mitogen activated protein kinase; A-549 cell line; antiviral activity; apoptosis; Article; cell viability; concentration (parameter); controlled study; cytotoxicity; environmental exposure; enzyme activation; human; human cell; innate immunity; nonhuman; particulate matter; protein degradation; protein expression; ubiquitination; vesicular stomatitis; Vesiculovirus; virus replication; A-549 cell line; air pollutant; cell survival; dose response; drug effect; metabolism; particulate matter; toxicity; ubiquitination; vesicular stomatitis; Vesiculovirus; virology; A549 Cells; Air Pollutants; Apoptosis; Cell Survival; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Humans; Interferon Regulatory Factor-3; Interferon-beta; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Particulate Matter; Ubiquitination; Vesicular Stomatitis; Vesiculovirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074238987

Therefore, considering the elimination of coal power overcapacity and introduction of carbon capture and storage technology, this study established an optimization model to identify the low-carbon production pathways for Shandong's power industry. The results indicated that nuclear power, wind power and complementary energy power would be the overriding clean energy power generation technologies. As to coal power, less than 300 MW-level generating units would be eliminated totally at the end of 2021, then followed by 300 MW-level generating units. And no doubt, 1000 MW-level generating units would become the primary coal-fired power generation technology gradually. Moreover, in 2021, clean energy power would account for about 52.33% of the total installed capacity, surpassing coal power for the first time and undertaking the main task of power generation. Hence, while striving to develop clean energy, those acquired achievements refer to elimination of coal power overcapacity should be further consolidated. Furthermore, when promoting carbon capture and storage technology, governments should not only make a trade-off analysis between its cost and environmental benefit, but also take the provincial actual situation and economic affordability into account. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture and storage technology; Coal power overcapacity; Low-carbon production; Optimization model; Power industry","Carbon capture; Coal; Coal storage; Cost benefit analysis; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Environmental technology; Nuclear fuels; Optimization; Power generation; Production control; Wind power; Capture and storage technologies; Low carbon; Optimization modeling; Over capacity; Power industry; Coal industry; carbon emission; coal; electricity generation; energy market; energy storage; nuclear power; optimization; power generation; trade-off; wind power; China; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076198862

The performance of different bias correction techniques was evaluated using several statistical metrics. The bias correction methods performance under climate condition different from the current climate was also evaluated using the differential split sample testing (DSST) and reveals that the distribution mapping technique is valid under climate condition different from the current climate. All bias correction methods were effective in adjusting mean monthly and annual RCM simulations of rainfall and temperature to the observed rainfall and temperature values. However, distribution mapping method was better in capturing the 90th percentile of observed rainfall and temperature and wet day probability of observed rainfall than other methods. As a result, we use the future (2021–2100) simulation of RCMs which are bias corrected using distribution mapping technique. The output of bias-adjusted RCMs unfolds a decline of rainfall, a persistent increase of temperature and an increase of extremes of rainfall and temperature in the future climate under emission scenarios of Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5, 8.5 and 2.6 (RCP4.5, RCP8.5 and RCP2.6).

In East Kalimantan, 5,000,000 ha of land are zoned for surface-mined coal. Deforestation from this mining threatens biodiversity and results in soil degradation, erosion, and polluted runoff, all directly impacting human populations. Revegetation methods developed for temperate forests are commonly used globally for mine rehabilitation. However, few empirical studies of native forest restoration as part of mine rehabilitation exist from wet tropical regions. Here, a chronosequence was established to observe forest succession under leguminous plantations at the PT Singlurus Pratama coal mine in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Soil and natural regeneration data were recorded from samples of ten 20 × 60-m plots randomly located in plantings aged 2, 7, and, 9 years postmining. Linear models (LMEMs) did not reveal greater soil pH, woody plant diversity, or soil phosphorus and nitrogen in older plantings. Rather, they showed higher soil carbon in older plantings, whereas nitrogen and pH were positively correlated with woody species diversity and abundance. Graminoids were less abundant, but ferns were more abundant in older sites in an ordination analysis. The implications are exotic tree plantations shade-out competitive understory herbaceous species (such as graminoids), opening growing space for other vegetation.

In this study, a systematic investigation of physics tendencies is demonstrated to help identify and correct compensating sources of model biases. The model improvement process is illustrated by addressing a commonly known issue in warm-season rainfall forecasts from parameterized convection models: the misrepresentation of the diurnal precipitation cycle over land, especially in its timing. Recent advances in closure assumptions in mass-flux cumulus schemes have made remarkable improvements in this respect. Here, we investigate these improvements in the representation of the diurnal precipitation cycle for a spring period over the United States, and how changes to the cumulus scheme impact the model climate and the behavior of other physics schemes. The modified cumulus scheme improves both the timing of the diurnal precipitation cycle and reduces midtropospheric temperature and moisture biases. However, larger temperature and moisture biases are found in the boundary layer as compared to a predecessor scheme, along with an overamplification of the diurnal precipitation cycle, relative to observations. Guided by a tendency analysis, we find that biases in the diurnal amplitude of the precipitation cycle in our simulations, along with temperature and moisture biases in the boundary layer, originate from the land surface model. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.",,"Boundary layers; Clouds; Moisture; Precipitation (meteorology); Weather forecasting; Closure assumptions; Compensating sources; Convection model; Diurnal precipitation; Land surface modeling; Precipitation cycles; Tendency analysis; Warm season rainfall; Climate models; air temperature; atmospheric convection; boundary layer; climate modeling; cumulus; numerical model; parameterization; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; troposphere; weather forecasting; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082884774

At the same time, the need to address carbon emissions to reach global climate-change targets is becoming increasingly recognised. Plentiful deep fresh groundwater is available but is difficult, and typically uneconomical, to access due to the high costs of borehole drilling and completion. The emerging concept of ‘enhanced water recovery’ (EWR) hypothesises that carbon dioxide (CO2) injection into the deep aquifers will increase pressure, making groundwater more easily available at shallower depths across a broad region while simultaneously contributing to a reduction in CO2 emissions. One example where this has been proposed is in the Great Artesian Basin’s Surat Basin in Queensland. The findings from a series of focus groups held with different stakeholders, including agricultural producers, rural residents, and urban residents, demonstrate how different groups perceived the risks and benefits of injecting CO2 as part of the carbon capture and storage (CCS) process to raise borehole water levels. The paper discusses the trade-offs that the different stakeholder groups found more acceptable. The significance of this research is that it will be the first to publish public responses to an emerging technology that has the potential to provide multiple benefits in terms of climate-change mitigation and groundwater use. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial recharge; Australia; Climate change; Public acceptance; Risk perceptions","aquifer; artificial recharge; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; perception; public access; risk assessment; Australia; Great Artesian Basin; Queensland; Surat Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076214130

A case-only analysis was used to examine subject and small-area neighborhood characteristics that modified the association between hot days and mortality. Deaths of Boston, Massachusetts residents that occurred from 2000-2015 were analyzed in relation to the daily temperature and heat index during the warm season as part of the case-only analysis. The modification by small-area (census tract, CT) social, and environmental (natural and built) factors was assessed. At-home mortality on hot days was driven by both social and environmental factors, differentially across the City of Boston census tracts, with a greater proportion of low-to-no income individuals or those with limited English proficiency being more highly represented among those who died during the study period; but small-area built environment features, like street trees and enhanced energy efficiency, were able to reduce the relative odds of death within and outside the home. At temperatures below current local thresholds used for heat warnings and advisories, there was increased relative odds of death from substance abuse and assault-related altercations. Geographic weighted regression analyses were used to examine these relationships spatially within a subset of at-home deaths with high-resolution temperature and humidity data. This revealed spatially heterogeneous associations between at-home mortality and social and environmental vulnerability factors. © 2020 by the authors.","Built environment; Climate change; Extreme heat; Heat-related mortality; Urban heat island; Urban resilience",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080859970

Germany pursues an incentive-oriented policy that is not spatially targeted and lets regional and local stakeholders determine where and how renewable energies are used. A core question is how to achieve the national goals, in a federal system that allows freedom of planning for the local communities. The aim of this paper is to show the discrepancies between the current expansion of wind energy and the necessary expansion that is derived from a scientific analysis. Methods: The study examined the policy objectives for the expansion of wind energy, based on a literature analysis. In a second step, the regulatory competences and spatial planning at the various levels and their influence on the expansion were explored. In a third step, the current procedure was compared with scientific scenarios of the energy system in 2050 and concretized using the example of the Hannover Region. Results: The theoretical and empirical analysis shows that people at regional level underestimate their responsibility for contributing to energy transition. The expansion targets for wind energy in the Hannover Region projected in the scientific scenario are above the minimum demand that the local authorities have assumed. The same applies to the state of Lower Saxony, which underestimates its own wind energy potential and thus its necessary contribution to achieving the national targets. Conclusions: We propose a nationwide coordinated strategy for the successful implementation of the energy transition. With the methodology described, regional targets can be determined and the responsibility of the region and the local actors can be clarified. With the help of spatial planning and public participation, the energy transition can be achieved with this approach. © 2020 The Author(s).","Energy transition; Implementation of climate targets; Regional planning; Wind energy","Regional planning; Climate targets; Coordinated strategies; Empirical analysis; Energy transitions; Literature analysis; Public participation; Renewable energies; Scientific analysis; Wind power; energy efficiency; environmental policy; federal system; local participation; policy implementation; regional planning; spatial planning; wind power; Germany; Hannover; Lower Saxony",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081087429

We randomly exposed participants of different ages to either a Legacy, Place, or control writing induction task before they completed various self-report measures. Both induction conditions were associated with significantly greater pro-environmental behavioral intentions and donations for all age groups when compared to the control condition.

Before, these areas were prone to floods and disease outbreak. The Sultan Ground and private owned land statuses by the riversides created difficulties since many urban poor in this city lived in these areas. The local authority supported the poor through community engagement. This scheme resulted in a breakthrough. The communities there became more aware of the misuse of rivers. They proactively participated in the discussions and initiated a movement to conserve the riverside areas. The urban river governance proceeded both bottom-up and top-down approaches. This case used the explanation with purposive sampling derived from a list of related informants. The primary data was acquired through snowballing interviews, while secondary data was obtained from related stakeholders' archives. Both types of data were collected to understand the multilevel governance structure within the stakeholders' collaboration context. The movement resulted in better city planning. It reduced the vulnerability of the poor, while increasing their adaptive capacity to climate change.

A recent intense episode of volcanic degassing associated with severe impacts on air quality accompanied the 2018 lower East Rift Zone (LERZ) eruption of Kīlauea volcano, Hawai'i. This resulted in a major increase in gas emission rates with respect to usual emission values for this volcano, along with a shift in the source of the dominant plume to a populated area on the lower flank of the volcano. This led to reduced air quality in downwind communities. We analyse open-access data from the permanent air quality monitoring networks operated by the Hawai'i Department of Health (HDOH) and National Park Service (NPS), and report on measurements of atmospheric sulfur dioxide (SO2) between 2007 and 2018 and PM2.5 (aerosol particulate matter with diameter &lt;2.5 μm) between 2010 and 2018. Additional air quality data were collected through a community-operated network of low-cost PM2.5 sensors during the 2018 LERZ eruption. From 2007 to 2018 the two most significant escalations in Kīlauea's volcanic emissions were: the summit eruption that began in 2008 (Kīlauea emissions averaged 5–6 kt/day SO2 from 2008 until summit activity decreased in May 2018) and the LERZ eruption in 2018 when SO2 emission rates reached a monthly average of 200 kt/day during June. In this paper we focus on characterizing the airborne pollutants arising from the 2018 LERZ eruption and the spatial distribution and severity of volcanic air pollution events across the Island of Hawai'i. The LERZ eruption caused the most frequent and severe exceedances of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) PM2.5 air quality threshold (35 μg/m3 as a daily average) in Hawai'i in the period 2010–2018. In Kona, for example, the maximum 24-h-mean mass concentration of PM2.5 was recorded as 59 μg/m3 on the twenty-ninth of May 2018, which was one of eight recorded exceedances of the EPA air quality threshold during the 2018 LERZ eruption, where there had been no exceedances in the previous 8 years as measured by the HDOH and NPS networks. SO2 air pollution during the LERZ eruption was most severe in communities in the south and west of the island, as measured by selected HDOH and NPS stations in this study, with a maximum 24-h-mean mass concentration of 728 μg/m3 recorded in Ocean View (100 km west of the LERZ emission source) in May 2018. Data from the low-cost sensor network correlated well with data from the HDOH PM2.5 instruments, confirming that these low-cost sensors provide a robust means to augment reference-grade instrument networks. © Copyright © 2020 Whitty, Ilyinskaya, Mason, Wieser, Liu, Schmidt, Roberts, Pfeffer, Brooks, Mather, Edmonds, Elias, Schneider, Oppenheimer, Dybwad, Nadeau and Kern.","air quality; emissions; Hawai'i; Kīlauea; PM2.5; SO2; volcano","Agricultural robots; Air quality; Costs; Environmental Protection Agency; Particulate emissions; Sensor networks; Sulfur dioxide; Aerosol particulate matters; Air quality monitoring networks; Airborne pollutants; Department of healths; Hawai'i; National Park Service; PM2.5; Spatial and temporal variation; Volcanoes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081662207

This article describes how such risks can be determined by accounting for the physical and chemical properties of all components of a CO2 storage site using elements of the National Risk Assessment Partnership Integrated Assessment Model for Carbon Storage (NRAP-IAM-CS). We used practical data from three sites that are part of two CarbonSAFE (Carbon Storage Assurance Facility Enterprise) projects to demonstrate application of the NRAP-IAM-CS toolset to determine project risk areas. NRAP-IAM-CS was used to estimate the project risk area that could represent the AoR and the impact of leakage through legacy wells to overlying drinking waters at these candidate CO2 storage sites. Our study shows that risk to USDWs is minimal despite (1) the presence of multiple legacy wells at these sites where the AoR approximates the maximum extent of injected CO2 or (2) the presence of a much larger AoR approximating the pressure front caused by the injection of CO2. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","AoR; CarbonSAFE; Geologic carbon storage; Integrated assessment model; NRAP; NRAP-IAM-CS; Risk assessment","Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental regulations; Potable water; Risk perception; CarbonSAFE; Geologic carbon storages; Integrated assessment models; NRAP; Physical and chemical properties; Risk based approaches; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Underground source; Risk assessment; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; drinking water; leakage; regulatory approach; risk assessment; water quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075308611

In the research project GROWA+ NRW 2021 initiated by the Federal States' Ministry for Environment, Agriculture, Nature and Consumer Protection, amongst other aspects, a model-based analysis of agricultural nitrogen inputs into groundwater and nitrate concentration in the leachate was carried out. For this purpose, the water balance model mGROWA, the agro-economic model RAUMIS, and the reactive N transport model DENUZ were coupled and applied consistently across the whole territory of North Rhine-Westfalia with a spatial resolution of 100 m x 100 m. Besides agricultural N emissions, N emissions from small sewage plants, urban systems, and NOx deposition were also included in the model analysis. The comparisons of the modelled nitrate concentrations in the leachate of different land use influences with observed nitrate concentrations in groundwater were shown to have a good correspondence with regard to the concentration levels across all regions and different land-uses in North Rhine-Westphalia. On the level of ground water bodies (according to EU ground water directive) N emissions exclusively from agriculture led to failure of the good chemical state. This result will support the selection and the adequate dimensioning of regionally adapted agricultural N reduction measures. © 2020 by the authors.","Groundwater; Leachate rate; Modelling; Nitrate; Nitrogen sources; Source apportionment","Chemical analysis; Consumer protection; Economics; Groundwater; Land use; Models; Nitrates; Sewage; Urban transportation; Concentration levels; Leachates; Model-based analysis; Nitrate concentration; Nitrogen sources; Source apportionment; Spatial resolution; Water balance models; Agriculture; concentration (composition); groundwater; land use; leachate; modeling; nitrate; nitrogen; Germany; North Rhine-Westphalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081720959

A source of this difficulty is the aggregation-induce quenching effect of emitters in the solid state, which results in low EL efficiency and severe roll-off. Herein, four isomeric aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens), namely TPE-3Cz-mPBI, TPE-3Cz-pPBI, TPE-2Cz-mPBI, and TPE-2Cz-pPBI, are constructed by varying the linkage positions of electron-accepter 1,2-diphenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (PBI), electron-donor carbazole, and AIE-active triphenylethene functional groups. A comprehensive investigation is carried out, and the results indicate that position isomerism dramatically affects electronic structures, photophysical properties, carrier transport capabilities, and device performances. Compared with TPE-3Cz-mPBI and TPE-3Cz-pPBI, TPE-2Cz-mPBI, and TPE-2Cz-pPBI exhibit more excellent AIE-active with the fluorescence quantum yield up to 72.5% and 89.7% in the neat films. Moreover, TPE-2Cz-mPBI shows high electron transport property and appropriate energy level, which favor balanced charge carrier injection/transporting in OLEDs. Hence, non-doped device based on TPE-2Cz-mPBI exhibits the best EL performance with external quantum efficiency, current efficiency, and power efficiency of 3.2%, 7.8 cd A−1, and 7.7 lm W−1, respectively. The isomeric strategy presents a promising method to extend the structural diversity of highly efficient AIE emitters, optimize optoelectronic properties, and construct high-performance non-doped devices. Due to intrinsic twisted structure and accessible protonated N-electron in molecular framework, the isomers exhibit impressive mechanochromism and acidochromism. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aggregation-induced emission (AIE); Electron-transporting property; Isomeric effect; Non-doped device; Organic light-emitting diode","Electroluminescence; Electron transport properties; Electronic structure; Isomers; Optoelectronic devices; Organic light emitting diodes (OLED); Plants (botany); Stereochemistry; Aggregation-induced emissions; Carrier-transport capability; Electron transporting; External quantum efficiency; Fluorescence quantum yield; Isomeric effect; Non-doped devices; Organic light emitting diodes(OLEDs); Quantum efficiency; Agglomeration; Efficiency; Electroluminescence; Electrons; Isomers; Performance; Stereochemistry; Transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072542601

Air pollution is a complex mixture of particles, vapors and gases emitted from natural and anthropogenic sources as well as formed through photochemical transformation processes. In metropolitan areas, air pollutants from combustion emissions feature a blend of emitted particles, oxides of carbon, sulfur and nitrogen, volatile organic compounds, and secondary reaction products, such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and secondary organic aerosols. Because many of the primary and transformed pollutants track together, their relative contributions to health outcomes are difficult to disentangle. Aside from the criteria pollutants ozone and nitrogen dioxide and some of the simpler aldehydes (e.g. formaldehyde and acrolein), other products from photochemical processes are a particularly vexing class of chemicals to investigate since they comprise a dynamic ill-defined complex mixture in both particulate and gas phases. The purpose of this review was to describe and compare health effects of freshly emitted versus oxidatively or photochemically aged air pollutants. In some cases, (e.g. single volatile organic compounds) photochemical transformation resulted in marked enhancements in toxicity through formation of both known and unidentified reaction products, while in other examples (e.g. aging of automobile emissions) the potentiation of effect was variable. The variation in experimental design, aging system employed, concentration and type of starting agent, and toxicity endpoints make comparisons between different studies exceedingly difficult. A more systematic approach with a greater emphasis on higher throughput screening and computational toxicology is needed to fully answer under what conditions oxidatively- or photochemically-transformed pollutants elicit greater health effects than primary emissions. © 2019","Air pollution; Comparison; Health effects; Mixtures; Photochemistry; Toxicology","Aldehydes; Blending; Gases; Geriatrics; Mixtures; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Photochemical reactions; Reaction products; Sulfur dioxide; Toxicity; Volatile organic compounds; Anthropogenic sources; Comparison; Health effects; Photochemical process; Photochemical transformations; Relative contribution; Secondary organic aerosols; Toxicology; Air pollution; organic compound; volatile organic compound; aldehyde; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; atmospheric pollution; comparative study; concentration (composition); health impact; mortality risk; photochemistry; pollution exposure; toxicology; aerosol; air pollutant; carbon footprint; chemical modification; combustion; concentration (parameter); exhaust gas; high throughput screening; human; nonhuman; photochemistry; photooxidation; priority journal; Review; smoke; toxicity; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental exposure; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Aldehydes; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Volatile Organic Compounds",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076182672

A persistent pollution case during 6 December 2016–8 January 2017 was selected to investigate the relations between turbulent intermittency and frequent PM2.5 (particulate matters with diameter less than 2.5 μm) pollution events over the metropolitan region of Beijing, China. The accumulation of PM2.5 near the surface frequently occurred as a combined result of strong inversion layers, stagnant winds, high ambient humidity levels, and stable stratification during this case. Arbitrary-order Hilbert spectral analysis indicated that steep decreases in the PM2.5 concentration were simultaneous with the occurrence of intermittent turbulence and strong vertical mixing. A wind profiler observation revealed existence of low-level jets (LLJs) at the end of the polluted periods, suggesting that the upper-level turbulent mixing accompanied by the wind shear of LLJ was transported downward and enhanced the vertical mixing near the surface, which might have caused an abrupt reduction in PM2.5 and improvement in air conditions. © 2020, The Chinese Meteorological Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Beijing; intermittent turbulence; PM2.5; stable stratification","air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); metropolitan area; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; turbulence; vertical mixing; winter; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077513071

However, a growing body of knowledge demonstrates negative ecological and environmental effects of this practice. We present a meta-analysis of North American and European studies from 2004 to 2019, which incorporates three previously unpublished datasets from eastern Canada, to investigate how mowing intensity impacts the ecology of urban lawns. The meta-analysis provides aggregated evidence that invertebrate and plant diversity is lower in urban lawns under increased mowing intensity. This decline is independent of the level of contrast between mowing ‘treatment’ and ‘control’ (e.g. height or frequency of mowing), which differed considerably between studies. Intensive mowing also increases the occurrence of pest species (e.g. herbivorous beetle larvae and allergenic plants), though studies in this group were limited to northern environments. Changes in ecosystem-level variables (soil temperature, soil moisture deficit and carbon deficit) were less evident and suggest changes in abiotic processes may take longer to become apparent. An economic case study of the mowing costs in Trois-Rivières, Canada, suggests that cost savings of 36% may be possible with a modest reduction of mowing frequency. Synthesis and Applications.

Despite declines in anthropogenic Hg emissions and downward trends for Hg in precipitation, many fisheries remain contaminated in otherwise pristine regions. Here, we report that trends in bioaccumulation are confounded by a near-decadal oscillation of the water cycle that is connected to large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns. In hundreds of lakes within the upper Laurentian Great Lakes region, mercury levels in pelagic fish and piscivorous birds oscillate in phase with near-decadal changes in water level, independent of atmospheric Hg loading. Geochemical data suggest that the cause is variation in the microbial production of MeHg as littoral sediments dry out and reflood. A recently amplified oscillation of the water cycle points to more intense episodes of fish contamination as the climate warms, further obscuring the benefit of reduced Hg emissions.

In this study, we tested this hypothesis by investigating the phylogeography of Excoecaria acerifolia (Euphorbiaceae), a riparian plant species that is widely distributed in the hot/warm-dry river valleys of the Sino-Himalayan region. Spatial analysis of molecular variance, a median-joining network and a Bayesian phylogenetic tree based on plastid DNA, all suggested three major lineages corresponding to the Jialing-Min-Dadu (JMD lineage), Jinsha-Yalong-Salween (JY lineage) and Yarlung Tsangpo-Mekong-Red-Nanpan (YMRN lineage) drainage basins. This was also generally supported by the results based on nuclear DNA. The divergence times of these three major lineages based on both datasets fell in the early Pleistocene, coinciding with the period of drainage reorganization events in the Sino-Himalayan region. The diversification times in the lineages were, however, dated back to the mid Pleistocene, corresponding to the Naynayxungla glaciation (0.72-0.50 Mya) and the penultimate glaciation (0.30-0.13 Mya), which were the most and second most severe glaciations in this region, respectively. Furthermore, mismatch analyses, neutrality test and ecological niche modelling suggest long-term demographic stability of the JY and JMD populations, with expansion only in the YMRN populations during the period(s) from the late penultimate glaciation (138.12 Kya) to the Last Interglacial (95.79 Kya), probably because of less extensive glaciations since the late Pleistocene and the gradually warming interglacial stage. Our study provides one of the few pieces of evidence indicating that combined historical drainage reorganization and climatic change since the Pleistocene might also have acted as important factors in the evolutionary history of riparian plants in the region. © 2019 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society.","climatic change; drainage reorganization events; glaciation; Pleistocene","climate variation; dicotyledon; divergence; drainage basin; Last Interglacial; molecular analysis; phylogenetics; phylogeography; riparian vegetation; spatial analysis; Himalayas; Euphorbiaceae; Excoecaria; Mya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084407689

We describe here a N2O-producing Defluviicoccus-dominated microbial community that alternately accumulates glycogen and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). 13C-labelled acetate experiments confirmed the role of glycogen in PHA synthesis, and a metabolic model was developed to simulate this process. Batch experiments enabled estimation of model parameters. Key anaerobic reactions are uptake of acetate and fermentation of glycogen to poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydrovalerate). Key anoxic transformations are growth with PHA oxidation coupled to nitrite reduction to N2O, and conversion of PHA back to glycogen. With this simple model, we predicted and confirmed improved bioreactor performance at higher nitrogen loading rates.

Since the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with landfilling waste can occur over decades to centuries, the standard static approach to estimating global warming impacts may not accurately represent the global warming impacts of landfills. The objective of this study is to assess the implications of using 100 yr and 20 yr static and dynamic global warming potential (GWP) approaches to estimate the global warming impacts from municipal solid waste landfills. A life-cycle model was developed to estimate GHG emissions for three gas treatment cases (passive venting, flare, CH4 conversion to electricity) and four decay rates. For the 100 yr GWP, other model uncertainties (e.g., static GWP values, decay rate, moisture content, or gas collection efficiency) generally had a larger effect on the estimated global warming impact than the choice of static versus dynamic GWP methods. This shows that when comparing single-point GWP values, the choice of static versus dynamic is relatively unimportant for most landfills. While dynamic GWPs consider temporal variance and provide useful estimates for the warming over a set time horizon, for most comparative analyses, static values provide reasonable bounds for the actual 100 yr warming impact.

This slow response reduces the efficiency of carbon assimilation. Transitions from low to high light require photosynthetic induction, including the activation of Rubisco and the opening of stomata, whereas transitions from high to low light require the relaxation of dissipative energy processes, collectively known as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). Previous attempts to assess the impact of these delays on net carbon assimilation have used simplified models of crop canopies, limiting the accuracy of predictions. Here, we use ray tracing to predict the spatial and temporal dynamics of lighting for a rendered mature Glycine max (soybean) canopy to review the relative importance of these delays on net cumulative assimilation over the course of both a sunny and a cloudy summer day. Combined limitations result in a 13% reduction in crop carbon assimilation on both sunny and cloudy days, with induction being more important on cloudy than on sunny days. Genetic variation in NPQ relaxation rates and photosynthetic induction in parental lines of a soybean nested association mapping (NAM) population was assessed. Short-term NPQ relaxation (<30 min) showed little variation across the NAM lines, but substantial variation was found in the speeds of photosynthetic induction, attributable to Rubisco activation. Over the course of a sunny and an intermittently cloudy day these would translate to substantial differences in total crop carbon assimilation. These findings suggest an unexplored potential for breeding improved photosynthetic potential in our major crops. © 2020 The Authors.

Yet, there were few studies dealing with the issue in the high altitudes of this region. In order to improve climate modeling in this region, a network consisting of 14 rain gauges was set up at elevations &gt; 2800 m above sea level along a CHM valley. Numerical experiments with Weather Research and Forecasting model were conducted to investigate the effects of meso- and micro-scale terrain on water vapor transport and precipitation. The control case uses a high horizontal resolution (0.03°) and a Turbulent Orographic Form Drag (TOFD) scheme to resolve the mesoscale terrain and to represent sub-grid microscale terrain effect. The effects of the horizontal resolution and the TOFD scheme were then analyzed through comparisons with sensitivity cases that either use a low horizontal resolution (0.09°) or switch off the TOFD scheme. The results show that the simulations with high horizontal resolution, even without the TOFD scheme, can not only increase the spatial consistency (correlation coefficient 0.84–0.92) between the observed and simulated precipitation, but also considerably reduce the wet bias by more than 250%. Adding the TOFD scheme further reduces the precipitation bias by 50% or so at almost all stations in the CHM. The TOFD scheme reduces precipitation intensity, especially heavy precipitation (&gt; 10 mm h−1) over high altitudes of the CHM. Both high horizontal resolution and TOFD enhance the orographic drag to slow down wind; as a result, less water vapor is transported from lowland to the high altitudes of CHM, causing more precipitation at lowland area of the CHM and less at high altitudes of CHM. Therefore, in this highly terrain-complex region, it is crucial to use a high horizontal resolution to depict mesoscale complex terrain and a TOFD scheme to parameterize the drag caused by microscale complex terrain. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Central Himalayas; High horizontal resolution; Meso- and micro-scale orographic effects; Precipitation and water vapor transport; TOFD","climate modeling; complex terrain; computer simulation; drag; mesoscale meteorology; mountain region; orographic effect; parameterization; precipitation (climatology); precipitation intensity; raingauge; synergism; water vapor; weather forecasting; China; Himalayas; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077634902

Studies have characterized the asymmetry of daily urban air temperature based on the increase in mean temperature, decrease in amplitude, and significant phase delay in the highly compact high-rise city of Hong Kong. In this study, a simple physical-based energy balance strategy was developed to investigate urban morphological impacts on city thermal climate. This energy balance model was first evaluated by using a meso-scale model, i.e. a weather research and forecasting model coupled to the BEP-BEM urban canopy model, and then applied to investigate urban daily air temperature profiles in a high-rise compact city. The modelling results show that urban thermal storage has no direct impact on the mean urban air temperature, but does affect amplitude and phase. The results reveal that different city morphologies lead to different urban air temperature profiles. Two important parameters for engineers and urban planners are introduced: a relative convective heat transfer number λ, and a time constant, τ, which respectively describe the relationships between convective heat transfer and urban thermal storage and ventilation rate in urban areas. These two parameters modulate the mean, amplitude term, and phase term of the daily urban air temperature cycles. The results have significant implications for design of city morphologies and urban planning of climate-resilient cities. The new results from this study and the proposed simple model should facilitate the rapid development and testing of potential urban heat island mitigation strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","City-scale morphology; Diurnal urban air temperature; UHI mitigation; Urban heat island; Urban thermal environment; WRF/Urban canopy model","Energy balance; Heat convection; Heat storage; Planning; Temperature control; Urban planning; Weather forecasting; Canopy model; City scale; UHI mitigation; Urban air; Urban heat island; Urban thermal environment; Atmospheric temperature; air temperature; diurnal variation; energy balance; heat island; mesoscale meteorology; temperature profile; urban atmosphere; weather forecasting; China; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075215217

The uncertainty results from both the rapid adjustment that occurs before SST changes and the slow feedbacks that occur after SST changes. The analysis in this paper focuses on the rapid adjustment. We use a novel method to decompose the temperature change in AMIP-type climate simulation in order to understand the adjustment at the process level. We isolate the effects of different processes, including radiation, convection, and large-scale circulation in the temperature adjustment, through a set of numerical experiments using a hierarchy of climate models. We find that radiative adjustment triggers and largely controls the zonal mean atmospheric temperature response pattern. This pattern is characterized by stratospheric cooling, lower-tropospheric warming, and a warming center near the tropical tropopause. In contrast to conventional views, the warming center near the tropopause is found to be critically dependent on the shortwave absorption of CO2. The dynamical processes largely counteract the effect of the radiative process that increases the vertical temperature gradient in the free troposphere. The effect of local convection is to move atmospheric energy vertically, which cools the lower troposphere and warms the upper troposphere. The adjustment due to large-scale circulation further redistributes energy along the isentropic surfaces across the latitudes, which cools the low-latitude lower troposphere and warms the midlatitude upper troposphere and stratosphere.

In this study, hourly concentrations of SNA in PM1 were measured through an Aerodyne Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) at an urban site of Beijing, from February 3rd to 20th of 2017. The analysis of the differences between two pollution cases during the sampling period was further conducted. The results showed that the concentrations of NO3−, SO42− and NH4+ were 38.9 ± 10.5 μg/m3, 41.9 ± 22.2 μg/m3 and 31.3 ± 10.6 μg/m3 respectively in the first case. A negative correlation was reflected between the PM2.5 concentrations and the following two ratios: 1) NO3−/SO42−; 2) [NH4+] to ([NO3−]+2[SO42−]), with a correlation coefficient of −0.92 and −0.76 respectively. In the second case, the PM2.5 concentrations (proportions) were much higher, with values of 49.9 ± 17.0 μg/m3 (22.9 ± 7.7%), 42.3 ± 15.8 μg/m3 (20.3 ± 7.2%) and 33.1 ± 10.1 μg/m3 (15.3 ± 4.3%). In contrast. The two ratios were positively correlated with the PM2.5 concentrations, along with the correlation coefficient of 0.77 and 0.62. Hence, it is palpable that two pollution cases were sulfate and nitrate dominant in respective. The emission characteristics due to the Chinese Spring Festival before P1 might be a major cause. A modeling-monitoring coupled approach was established for the recognition of the secondary conversion of SO42− and NO3−. Results showed that sulfate/nitrate aged ratio (SAR and NAR) and sulphur oxidation ratio (SOR) in the second case were 0.48 ± 0.23, 0.22 ± 0.07 and 0.38 ± 0.23. They were all higher than those of the first case whose values were 0.32 ± 0.15, 0.18 ± 0.05 and 0.22 ± 0.12, which indicated that secondary conversion of precursors was enhanced in the second case. Although the OH concentrations were of no obvious difference in both cases, the average concentrations of H2O2, NO2 and the relative humidity were much higher in the second case, which provided sufficient conditions and time for the formation of SO42− and NO3−. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric oxidation; SNA; Sulfate/nitrate aged ratio; Sulphur oxidation ratio; WRF-CAMx","Atmospheric humidity; Chemical speciation; Oxidation; Sulfur compounds; Urban growth; Atmospheric oxidation; Average concentration; Composition analysis; Correlation coefficient; Emission characteristics; Negative correlation; Sulfate/nitrate aged ratio; WRF-CAMx; Pollution; ammonia; nitrate; nitrogen; sulfate; sulfur; air quality; air sampling; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric pollution; nitrate; oxidation; particle size; particulate matter; relative humidity; speciation (chemistry); sulfate; urban site; aerosol; air pollution; air quality; chemical composition; China; humidity; meteorology; particulate matter; precursor; priority journal; species differentiation; spring; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076835924

This was investigated by material balance analysis, biochemical reaction process and its metrology of ordinary heterotrophic bacteria, denitrifying bacteria, nitrifying bacteria and phosphorus-accumulating bacteria. The flow and distribution of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen in the MUCT, and the influence of the regulation of the c(NO3) on the carbon source, cellular matter production, and oxygen consumption of the process were explained in detail. In the programmable logic controller (PLC) automatic control system, the circulating flow rate of nitrate was set as the controlled variable. Adopting the feedback control structure, c(NO3) was altered at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0 mg·17−1, respectively. In this experimental study, the quality of influent and other operation design parameters remained unchanged. The results showed that the effluent quality was at its best when c(NO3) was controlled at 2.0–4.0 mg/L. Again, the distribution of chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the anaerobic section was between phosphorus-accumulating bacteria, common heterotrophic bacteria and denitrifying bacteria, and the distribution was related to c(NO3). Due to this phenomenon, the distribution of nitrate-nitrogen between denitrifying bacteria and denitrifying phosphorus-accumulating bacteria, and poly-hydroxy alkanoates (PHA) between denitrifying phosphorus-accumulating bacteria and aerobic phosphorus-accumulating bacteria was changed. Carbon source of 110.0 kg acetic acid/103 m3 sewage was saved, while the cell material output was reduced by 37.5%, and the oxygen consumption of 51.1 kg O2/103 m3 sewage was reduced. In the MUCT process, the regulation of c(NO3) enhanced the denitrifying phosphorus uptake performance of the main anoxic section and obtained good carbon source savings, reduction of cellular matter production, and reduction of oxygen consumption. © 2020, The Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers.","Biochemical Reaction Process; Carbon Saving; Cellular Matter Production; Denitrifying Phosphorus Uptake; Oxygen Consumption",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078666617

Here, we re-evaluate global cropland-N2O emissions in 1961-2014, using N-rate-dependent emission factors (EFs) upscaled from 1206 field observations in 180 global distributed sites and high-resolution N inputs disaggregated from sub-national surveys covering 15593 administrative units. Our results confirm IPCC Tier 1 default EFs for upland crops in 1990-2014, but give a ∼15% lower EF in 1961-1989 and a ∼67% larger EF for paddy rice over the full period. Associated emissions (0.82 ± 0.34 Tg N yr-1) are probably one-quarter lower than IPCC Tier 1 global inventories but close to Tier 3 estimates. The use of survey-based gridded N-input data contributes 58% of this emission reduction, the rest being explained by the use of observation-based non-linear EFs. We conclude that upscaling N2O emissions from site-level observations to global croplands provides a new benchmark for constraining IPCC Tier 1 and 3 methods. The detailed spatial distribution of emission data is expected to inform advancement towards more realistic and effective mitigation pathways. © 2020 The Author(s) 2019.

Moreover, the main fuel source of global carbon emissions is still coal. Therefore, controlling China's coal consumption is critical to global emissions reductions. Existing production-based accounting principles emphasize on the direct coal use within the geographic territory, while ignoring indirect use driven by external demand in worldwide trading. Through measuring mainland China's external-demand coal consumption with multi-regional input-output model and decomposing key factors with structure decomposition analysis, this work is aimed to systematically investigate how external demand affects the direct and indirect coal consumption in mainland China. The results show that mainland China is still a net exporter of embodied coal, which means that coal consumption of its own country to meet external demand is much higher than that used abroad to meet final domestic demand. Furthermore, in mainland China's external-demand consumption, intermediate goods exports account for a large proportion. As for sectoral details, “petroleum, chemical and non-metallic mineral products”, “electricity, gas and water” and “metal products” are top three export departments; as for regional details, the United States, Japan, Hong Kong and Germany are major demanders. Among the composition of external-demand consumption, “household final consumption” consumes the most mainland China's embodied coal, followed by “gross fixed capital formation”. The decomposition results indicate that the flourishing global intermediate goods trade and the large-scale transfer of external demand to mainland China have become the main impetus to promote the growth of mainland China's external-demand embodied coal consumption, while the decline in mainland China's coal use intensity has effectively suppressed this growth. Controlling external-demand coal consumption provides a new perspective for China to control the total amount of coal consumption. This work also provides a reference of the research framework to investigate coal consumption in export-oriented developing economies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Coal footprint; Embodied coal; External demand; Multi-regional input-output model; Structural decomposition analysis","Chemical analysis; Decomposition; International trade; Developing economies; External demand; Global carbon emission; Input output model; Nonmetallic minerals; Research frameworks; Structural decomposition analysis; Structure decomposition; Coal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074404020

We advanced and applied an adjoint air quality model to map contributions of individual O3 precursor emission sources [nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compound (VOC)] at each location to annual regional O3 concentrations and to identify the possible dominant influential pathways of emission sources to O3 at different spatiotemporal scales. Additionally, we introduced the novel adjoint sensitivity approach to assess the relationship between precursor emissions and O3-induced premature mortality. Adjoint results show that Shenzhen was a major source contributor to regional O3 throughout all seasons, of which 49.4% (3.8%) were from its NOx (VOC) emissions. Local emissions (within PRD) contributed to 83% of the regional O3 whereas only ~54% of the estimated ~4000 regional O3-induced premature mortalities. The discrepancy between these two contributions was because O3-induced mortalities are dependent on not only O3 concentration, but incident rate and population density. We also found that a city with low O3–induced mortalities could have significant emission contributions to health impact in the region since the transport pathways could be through transport of local O3 or through transport of O3 precursors that form regional O3 thereafter. It is therefore necessary to formulate emission control policies from both air quality and public health perspectives, and it is also critical to have better understanding of influential pathways of emission sources to O3. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adjoint sensitivity analysis; Health impact assessment; Ozone; Source apportionment","Air quality; Emission control; Health; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Population statistics; Sensitivity analysis; Volatile organic compounds; Adjoint sensitivity analysis; Background compositions; Fine particulate matter; Health impact assessment; Pearl River Delta region; Source apportionment; Source-receptor relationships; Volatile organic compound (VOC); Quality control; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; assessment method; background level; concentration (composition); health impact; mapping method; ozone; particulate matter; pollutant source; sensitivity analysis; source apportionment; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; controlled study; health impact assessment; human; particulate matter; photochemical smog; population density; premature mortality; priority journal; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076522517

Amending soil with waste products can mitigate CH4 emissions in crops, but little is known about the impacts of amendments with steel slag and biochar on the populations and activities of aerobic methanotrophs in rice cropland. We used real-time quantitative PCR detecting system and high-throughput sequencing to determine the effects of slag and biochar amendments on CH4 emission, abundance, and community structure of methanotrophs, and the relationships between soil properties and the abundance and community composition of methanotrophs during the rice growing season in both early and late paddies. Soil salinity and pH were significantly higher for an amendment with both slag and biochar than the control in both the early and late paddies, and pH was significantly higher for a slag amendment in the late paddy. Cumulative CH4 emission was lower for the slag and slag + biochar amendments than the control in early paddy by—34.1%. Methanotrophic abundance was three- and sixfold higher for the slag + biochar amendment than the control in the early and late paddies (p &lt; 0.05), respectively. The abundance of different groups of methanotrophs varied among the treatments. The relative abundance of Methylosarcina was higher for the slag amendment than the control, and the relative abundance of Methylomonas was lower for biochar, and slag + biochar amendments than the control. The relative abundance of Methylocystis was higher for the slag and slag + biochar amendments than the control in the early paddy, and the relative abundance of Methylocystis was higher for the slag, biochar, and slag + biochar amendments in the late paddy. Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that the higher abundance of methanotrophic bacteria for the slag and slag + biochar amendments was correlated with soil pH, salinity, soil organic carbon, and C/N ratio, and the relative abundances of Methylocystis, Methylomonas, and Methylosarcina were associated with the effective mitigation of CH4 emission in the paddies. A discriminant general analysis indicated that the total population of methanotrophs was larger for the slag + biochar amendment than the control, and that this effect was only weakly correlated with changes in the soil properties, demonstrating that this effect on the size and species composition of methanotrophic soil populations was mostly associated with a direct effect of the slag + biochar amendment. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Biochar; Greenhouse gases; Methanotrophs; Paddies; Slag","biochar; greenhouse gas; methane; methanotrophy; paddy field; slag; soil amendment; soil pollution; soil quality; steel; Methylocystis; Methylomonas; Methylosarcina; biochar; charcoal; methane; air pollutant; chemistry; ecosystem restoration; growth, development and aging; metabolism; metallurgy; microbiology; Oryza; season; soil; waste; Air Pollutants; Charcoal; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Metallurgy; Methane; Oryza; Seasons; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Waste Products",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069731581

Here we used pre-adapted and non-adapted digesters to link microbial community structure to digester function. Before disturbance, the pre-adapted and non-adapted digesters showed similar methane production and microbial community diversity but dissimilar community composition. When exposed to an identical disturbance, the pre-adapted digester achieved better performance, while the non-adapted digester was inhibited. When re-exposed to disturbance after recovery, communities and performance of both digesters converged, regardless of the temporal variations. Co-digestion of up to 75% GIW added on a volatile solids (VS) basis was achieved, increasing methane yield by 336% from 0.180 to 0.785 L-methane/g-VS-added, the highest methane yield reported to date for lipid-rich waste.

Adopting the World Bank’s classification of income levels, this paper classifies 177 countries into four groups and then analyzes the spatial-temporal variations in CO2 emissions. Based on that analysis, the core task of our study is to estimate a carbon Kuznets curve (CKC) from two methods of traditional statistics and spatial econometrics. The main findings indicate that global CO2 emissions have significant spatial clustering characteristics, and the clustering types are closely linked to geographic location and income level. In addition, the existence of standard CKC and spatial CKC were confirmed. Countries with different income levels have different CO2 emission stages, and a country’s CO2 emissions are affected both directly by its own economy and indirectly by the economies of its neighbors. In this context, the mitigation and adaptation strategies for CO2 reduction are proposed as follows. (1) Neighboring countries must develop regional cooperative initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions. (2) Clarifying the emission stage of a country is an important basis for policymakers to formulate emission reduction strategies. (3) The economic development and CO2 emissions of neighboring countries are also important factors in formulating emission reduction plans. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon Kuznets curve; CO2 emissions; Global scale; Income levels; Spatial econometrics","carbon emission; econometrics; economic development; emission control; empirical analysis; environmental impact assessment; Kuznets curve; policy making; spatial analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach; World Bank",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067978132

In this study, Free nitrous acid combined with potassium ferrate (FNA + PF) pretreatment was used to enhance solubilization and biochemical methane potential of WAS. Results indicated that the maximum removal rates of total suspended solid by PF, FNA, and PF + FNA pretreatment were 21.84%, 38.09%, and 56.17%, respectively. The biochemical methane potential of WAS without pretreatment reached 61.22 L CH4/kg VSS added while this value increased to 147.07 L CH4/kg VSS added after FNA + PF pretreatment (0.06 g/g TSS NaNO2 and 0.25 g/g TSS K2FeO4). Shotgun metagenomic analysis revealed that FNA + PF pretreatment could increase the diversity and stability of microbial communities by shifting methanogenic pathways from strictly acetoclastic to acetoclastic/hydrogenotrophic, thereby enhancing methane production.

The ceramic shows moderate optical transparency due to its dense microstructure, as well as good photoluminescence (PL) properties of up-conversion (UC) emission in the visible region and down-shifting (DS) emission in the near-infrared region. Simultaneously, the colors of all the ceramics turn darker after 365 nm illumination, and then recover to their initial states upon thermal stimulus (210 °C, 10 min), exhibiting a typical PC phenomenon. In particular, the effect of the PC behavior on PL lifetimes of Nd3+ was investigated. Multi-mode reversible modulations of various optical behaviors were realized based on the PC behavior, especially for the regulation of near-infrared emission. And the maximum modulation ratios of transmittances, UC or DS PL intensities and luminescence lifetimes are 43.0%, 66.7%, 66.4% and 12.8%, respectively. Owing to higherature sintering and Nd3+ substitution in the ceramics, cation and oxygen vacancies appear to produce F′ and V1 color centers, which are in charge of the PC behavior and corresponding modulations.

It is applied to Fujian Province to demonstrate its feasibility. The direct and indirect CO2 emissions of six major sectors are calculated using the input-output table. It is revealed that the total carbon emissions of the industrial sector were higher than other sectors, accounting for 74% of Fujian Province total carbon emissions. And the indirect emissions generated during the consumption process in the industrial sector were also the largest, with 0.43×109 tons of emissions. The wholesale and retail catering sector had the smallest carbon emissions, with only 14.9×106 tons of emissions. In addition, carbon emissions in all industries were on the rise. Then, network utility analysis is employed to define the various relationships between different sectors. It is found that the mutual relationship between various sectors in Fujian Province has developed from 1 pair of competition relationships to 3 pairs of competition relationships, which has reduced from 13 pairs of exploitation relationships to 12 pairs of exploitation relationships. The results can help to provide integral reference for policy makers to propose the effective mitigation strategies. The study found that Fujian's carbon emission metabolism system is different from other metabolic systems in terms of industry structure. The competitive relationship represents the mutual suppression of carbon emissions between sectors, which further provides a good opportunity for carbon reduction. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Planning; Sustainable development; Carbon emissions; Carbon reduction; Industrial sector; Industry structures; Input-output table; Metabolic systems; Mitigation strategy; Network utility; Industrial emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079662447

In the previous work, we have investigated interactions between compositional effects and the underlying heterogeneities of the flow field in near-miscible floods (Wang et al. in Transp Porous Media 129(3):743–759, 2019a). In this current study, we have further analysed the effects of reduction in interfacial tension (IFT) on the flow behaviour, as motivated by the study on the film-flow mechanism previously presented by Sorbie and van Dijke (SPE improved oil recovery symposium, Society of Petroleum Engineers, 2010). We identify two clear mechanisms of oil recovery that may occur in near-miscible CO2 (or other gas) injection processes, which we denote, MCE, as oil stripping or conventional compositional effects, and MIFT as lower IFT oil film-flow effects. The latter MIFT effects are described by an enhanced hydrocarbon relative permeability in the near-miscible three-phase relative permeabilities (3PRP). Various combinations between the MCE and MIFT mechanisms were tested by numerical simulations to evaluate the impact of each mechanism on the flow behaviour, i.e. their separate and joint effects on quantities such as the local oil displacement efficiency, phase flow vectors and the ultimate oil recovery. When acting in combination, the oil stripping and IFT effects can greatly improve the local displacement performance even when viscous fingering flow occurs. Viscous fingering is well known to lead to bypassed oil in the “non-preferential” flow paths between the main fingers. We show that the remaining oil in these non-preferential flow paths (i.e. bypassed oil) can be efficiently recovered by the combined MCE and MIFT mechanisms, but only with the application of water alternating gas (WAG). In contrast to oil stripping effects, the IFT effect is not dependent on continuous contact between oil and CO2. Instead, the remaining oil is mobilized by gas as the IFT is reduced and can be efficiently produced by subsequent water injection. This MIFT mechanism has much less impact in cases with continuous CO2 injection compared to its efficiency in WAG. This is because during continuous injection, gas fingers are dominant in the preferential flow paths, and therefore the local displacement efficiency is very good, but only in these preferential routes. On the other hand, WAG is able to make full use of the IFT effects because of its relatively stable displacing front, which allows the MIFT mechanism to contribute. In this study, the effects of using different three-phase relative permeability methods were investigated and, as expected, different methods yielded different results. However, an important observation is that when IFT effects (MIFT) were included, there was much less difference in the final oil recovery using the different 3PRP models; our analysis shows why this is the case. © 2019, The Author(s).","CO2 WAG; Compositional effects; Fingering flow; Interfacial tension effects; Near-miscible displacements","Carbon dioxide; Efficiency; Flow fields; Groundwater flow; Numerical models; Oil well flooding; Porous materials; CO2 WAG; Compositional effects; Enhanced oil recovery; Fingering flow; Miscible displacement; Oil-displacement efficiency; Relative permeability; Three-phase relative permeability; Enhanced recovery; carbon dioxide; enhanced oil recovery; fingering; flow field; immiscible fluid; permeability; preferential flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070683663

However, findings about how global changes affect ecosystem C sequestration are conflicting. To understand how land use and climate change affect ecosystem C and nitrogen (N) pools, this study investigated the effects of mowing and fertilizer on the C and N pools of plants and soil, and on the aggregate-associated C and N content, by means of a field manipulating experiment established in August 2012 in a typical steppe. The results showed that mowing significantly decreased the mass and the C and N pools of shoots by 14.3%, 17.3% and 12.1%, respectively. Compared to ambient N treatments, N addition stimulated shoot biomass and litter mass by 28.8% and 77.4%, respectively, but had no affect on root biomass. Simultaneously, N addition increased the plant N content and the N pools, and it decreased the ratio of plant C to N in the shoots, litter and roots. However, neither mowing nor N addition affected the proportion of macroaggregate, microaggregate, <0.053 mm size class, geometric mean diameter or aggregate-associated C and N contents. Nitrogen deposition under conditions of climate change stimulated plant productivity but had no affect on soil C sequestration in this short-term experiment. Our results indicate that mowing may be beneficial for providing food for large mammals, but it did not affect soil C and N pools in the study region. Our findings suggest that the response of plant mass and C pools is more sensitive than that of soil C sequestration and soil texture to mowing and N deposition in the temperate steppes of the Mongolian Plateau. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon sequestration; Nitrogen fertilization; Plant C and N content; Plant functional group; Soil aggregation; Temperate grassland","arid region; belowground biomass; carbon sequestration; climate change; experimental study; fertilizer application; gas exchange; grassland; land use change; nitrogen cycle; semiarid region; soil aggregate; steppe; temperate environment; Mongolian Plateau; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075382834

Changing the crop cultivars and adjusting the sowing dates are used as strategies to adapt to climate change. First, we evaluated the simulation ability of the Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT) CERES wheat model based on the experimental data with varied sowing dates and cultivars. Second, we designed optimal cultivars in three different environmental conditions with the highest grain yield in the North China Plain (NCP) based on model sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, we optimized the sowing dates for three sites with the above-derived cultivar parameters. The results showed that the DSSAT-CERES wheat model was suitable for winter wheat simulation after calibration and validation with a Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) between 0.9% and 9.5% for phenology, 6.8% and 17.8% for above ground biomass, and 4.6% and 9.7% for grain yield. The optimal cultivars significantly prolonged the wheat growth duration by 14.1, 27.5, and 24.4 days at the Shangzhuang (SZ), Xingtai (XT), and Zhumadian (ZMD) sites compared with current cultivars, respectively. The vegetative growth duration (from sowing to anthesis) was prolonged 18.4 and 12.2 days at the XT and ZMD sites significantly, while shortened 0.81 days at the SZ site. The grain yield could be potentially improved by 29.5%, 86.8%, and 34.6% at the SZ, XT, and ZMD sites using the optimal cultivars, respectively. Similarly, the improvement of aboveground biomass at three sites was 5.5%, 47.1%, and 12.7%, respectively. Based on the guaranteed rate and analysis of variance, we recommended a later sowing date (from 15 September to 20 October) at the SZ and ZMD sites, and 15 September to 15 October at the XT site. In addition, the methodology of this study could be expanded to other regions and possibly to other crops. © 2020 by the authors.","Adaption; Climate change; North china plain; Virtual cultivar; Winter wheat","adaptation; assessment method; climate change; crop production; cultivar; decision support system; environmental conditions; environmental factor; genotype; management practice; sowing date; wheat; winter; China; Hebei; North China Plain; Xingtai; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081231285

Here we examine the stability of Pt single atoms (Pt1) on the commonly exposed (100) surfaces of SrBO3 perovskites (B = 3d transition metals) and their methane-adsorption properties by first principles density functional theory. We find that the stability and charge state of Pt1 on the SrBO3(100) surfaces are termination-sensitive. Due to polar compensation, Pt1 is negatively charged on the A termination but positively charged on the B termination. This charge state greatly impacts methane adsorption: negatively charged Pt1 on the A-termination chemisorbs methane (in some cases, dissociatively), but positively charged Pt1 on the B-termination adsorbs methane physically. Analysis of the density of states of the negatively charged Pt1 reveals that its sp states are key to methane chemisorption and C-H activation. Our work shows that polar compensation on the perovskite surfaces can be used to tune the charge state of a single atom for methane chemisorption and C-H activation.

However, empirical knowledge on associated governance processes is scarce and fragmented. Against this background, this paper examines the integration of nature-based approaches for climate change adaptation into municipalities’ daily planning practices and associated governance. A city-to-city learning lab was established to systematically analyze selected urban development projects step-by-step, from the initial idea, to comprehensive and detailed planning, procurement, implementation, maintenance and follow-up. The results show the numerous constraints municipal staff face and how they use targeted strategies to overcome them and tap into existing drivers. We identify five, complementary strategies: i) targeted stakeholder collaboration; ii) strategic citizen involvement; iii) outsourcing; iv) the alteration of internal working structures; and v) concealed science–policy integration. Importantly, these strategies reveal an increasing need for relational approaches that, in turn, require individuals to develop the cognitive/emotional capacity to establish trust, communicate inclusively and promote social learning, while at the same time dealing with an increasingly complex and uncertain working environment. We conclude that tapping into the potential of nature-based solutions for climate adaptation governance requires more financial and human resources, and capacity development to support personal development, systematic mainstreaming and, ultimately, more sustainable development. © 2019 The Authors","Adult development; Champions; Climate governance; Ecosystem-based planning; Inner transformation; Mainstreaming; Nature-based solutions; Transformation; Urban sustainability","Integration; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Adult development; Champions; Climate governance; Inner transformation; Mainstreaming; Transformation; Urban sustainability; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075867450

Growing evidence points to indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs) as buffers against large-scale carbon emissions across a nine-nation network of indigenous territories (ITs) and protected natural areas (PNAs). Previous studies have demonstrated a link between indigenous land management and avoided deforestation, yet few have accounted for forest degradation and natural disturbances—processes that occur without forest clearing but are increasingly important drivers of biomass loss. Here we provide a comprehensive accounting of aboveground carbon dynamics inside and outside Amazon protected lands. Using published data on changes in aboveground carbon density and forest cover, we track gains and losses in carbon density from forest conversion and degradation/disturbance. We find that ITs and PNAs stored more than one-half (58%; 41,991 MtC) of the region’s carbon in 2016 but were responsible for just 10% (−130 MtC) of the net change (−1,290 MtC). Nevertheless, nearly one-half billion tons of carbon were lost from both ITs and PNAs (−434 MtC and −423 MtC, respectively), with degradation/disturbance accounting for >75% of the losses in 7 countries. With deforestation increasing, and degradation/disturbance a neglected but significant source of region-wide emissions (47%), our results suggest that sustained support for IPLC stewardship of Amazon forests is critical. IPLCs provide a global environmental service that merits increased political protection and financial support, particularly if Amazon Basin countries are to achieve their commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

We compute that an “all-electric” approach could require a 70% increase in nationwide electricity system capacity. New peak loads would be highly heterogeneous (e.g., 4-fold increase in some states) with very low load factors (fewer than 100 full load hours annually). Without increasing peak loads, currently available electric heat pumps can reduce fossil fuels to 43% of total heating energy supply (currently 70%). Future advances in heat pump technology could reduce this further to 23%; however, several challenging regions would remain. We show that installing heat pumps and retaining some fossil fuel equipment for use in only the coldest weather could reduce fossil fuels to 1%–3% of heating energy while progressively reducing fossil fuel heating capacity and avoiding electricity capacity upgrades. Therefore, strategic use of legacy infrastructure could facilitate a more flexible transition to low-carbon heating. Building heating decarbonization is essential, but the prominent “all-electric” proposal—replace all fossil fuel heating with electric heat pumps and expanded renewable electricity supply—could require massive buildouts of underutilized electricity infrastructure according to the analysis presented in this paper. Future heat pump advances could mitigate these issues, but some regions could still require more than double the current delivery capacity. Because it is imperative to start rapidly reducing emissions now, this paper evaluates a viable transitional approach: dual source systems that maintain existing fossil fuel equipment with new heat pumps. Because the highest heating needs are infrequent, using fossil fuels for only 3% of total U.S. heating energy could avoid any increase in local peak electricity demands. Such an approach would further allow the flexibility to adapt to future developments, such as viable alternative fuels or unanticipated major heating technology advances. We model building space heating electrification across the United States, computing a potential 70% increase in nationwide electricity delivery capacity with very low capacity factors. Without increasing peak electric loads, fossil fuels can be reduced to 43% of total heating energy using current heat pump technology and 23% with future advances.

We review the “global city thesis”, which dominates urban scholarship and practice, and ask whether it adequately captures the Sydney experience. Although the global city thesis is a useful analytical construct for policy makers and scholars, we argue that it does not adequately chart Sydney's rise as a leading global city and its current problems. The global city thesis ignores the political institutions and processes that shape and direct the global city. The City of Sydney is a small area of the city-region, accounting for only about four percent of the metropolis. Sydney lacks a metropolitan or regional government and has few regional collaborative processes or platforms. Instead the global city strategy of Sydney is shaped and directed by the New South Wales state government. This is contrary to the political decentralisation and devolution trends heralded by international actors such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Sydney also illustrates the dilemma of global cities in that those members at the top of the knowledge economy are highly rewarded and those in the middle and lower strata face difficulty maintaining or improving their situations. Local governments lack the capacity to act independently and the state and federal governments are unwilling to address serious urban problems associated with globalisation, such as public transit or housing. Given the governments' embrace of neoliberalism, the global city vision advanced by leaders is threatened. There is little concrete policy offered by any level of government to address the crisis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Climate leadership; Climate policy; Economic competitiveness; financialization of housing; Global city; Housing affordability; Housing crisis; Housing stress; Inequality; Local government reform; Metropolitan governance; Private renters; Public transit; Social housing; Sustainability transition; Sydney; Transformative capacity; Urban problems; Urbanisation","climate change; competitiveness; environmental economics; environmental policy; financial system; global change; local government; policy approach; social housing; sustainability; sustainable development; urbanization; Australia; New South Wales; Sydney [New South Wales]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055966866

However, local practitioners face many barriers that can undermine their capacity to adopt and sustain adaptation initiatives to reduce exposure and vulnerability and strengthen resilience to climate risks. Existing scholarship suggests that national governments play an important role in providing leadership and resources to support local adaptation policy development. However, less research attention has been devoted to investigating sub-national, regional government initiatives to support local adaptation policy and planning in federal states, despite their financial resources and constitutional responsibility to oversee municipalities. This article analyzes how one sub-national government, the provincial government of Nova Scotia (Canada), activated and motivated local adaptation policy and planning through a combination of policy instruments and municipally focused capacity-building initiatives. In addition to describing the structure and dynamics of the provincial mandate for municipal adaptation planning in Nova Scotia, we provide case study evidence to draw insights about the enabling conditions for the successful implementation of climate change adaptation governance initiatives of this kind. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptation planning; Municipalities; Nova Scotia; Regional governance","adaptive management; climate change; environmental planning; governance approach; policy development; vulnerability; Canada; Nova Scotia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053050624

We compare the CF of non-members and members of grassroots initiatives in the domains of food, clothing, housing and transport. We further compare the groups by testing the influence of socio-economic variables that are typically associated with both footprint and well-being. Here we show that grassroots initiative members have 16% lower total carbon footprint, and 43% and 86% lower carbon footprints for food and clothing respectively, compared to their “non-member” regional socio-demographic counterparts. We find a higher adoption of some energy-saving behaviors for initiative members such as greater active travel distance and lower indoor temperatures in the winter, yet no significant differences in the CF of housing and transport. Interestingly, increases in income are not associated with increases in the total CF of members, while the influence of income is confirmed for the CF of the total sample. Instead, factors such as age, household size, and gender better explain the variation in the domain-specific CFs of initiative members. Finally, members show higher life satisfaction compared to non-members and are 11–13% more likely to evaluate their life positively.

A reduction of supply chain costs could contribute to increased utilization of pellets. Existing literature on pellet costs was reviewed to explicate cost differences, focusing on the impact of supply chain design. This was combined with a techno-economic analysis of the impact of different design variables on cost components, including feedstock type, production location and pellet plant size. The results of this study show that variation in literature can only be partly attributed to design differences, with large remaining uncertainty. The cost reduction potential of optimization strategies was found to be limited. Different supply chain design approaches result in trade-offs between cost components. Increasing the size of pellet plants was calculated to result in decreased pelletizing and shipping costs, but at the same time leads to increased costs for feedstock procurement and transport. Supply chain costs are highly dependent on specific supply chain conditions, including the regional availability of feedstock, and results varied for different pellet plant locations analyzed within the US. The average calculated costs for a 500 kt/a pellet plant amount to 136 €2017/t pellets, compared to 143 €2017/t pellets for a 50 kt/a pellet plant. The most prominent components across the entire chain are feedstock costs and pelletizing operating costs, including additional feedstock use for drying.

Abstract: Wood density is one of the most widely used parameters for the description of the structure of a plant and its production of biomass/carbon, as well as its strategies of growth and survival in the context of varying environmental conditions. Data were compiled on the wood density of the three mangrove tree species [Rhizophora mangle L., Avicennia germinans (L.) L., and Laguncularia racemosa (L.) C. F. Gaertn.] that predominate on the Ajuruteua Peninsula in Bragança on the Amazon coast of the Brazilian state of Pará, focusing on the stem position and diameter classes. The influence of the salinity gradient on the wood density of A. germinans was analyzed based on the definition of the three zones of salinity defined from the mean salinity values ascertained from the principal tidal channels found on the peninsula. Wood density varied significantly among species, diameter classes, and saline zones, but not in relation to the position on the stem. Our findings indicate that the inter- and intra-specific variation found in the wood density of the mangrove trees is the result of the different levels of salinity found in the study area, mediated by the variation in the growth of the plant in response to desiccation and hypersalinity that occur at higher elevation in the intertidal zone. In addition, the A. germinans trees with the highest wood density were found in the most saline zone, where these mangrove trees present a reduced assimilation of carbon, which affects the spatial distribution of this species, its production of biomass, and carbon storage. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Avicennia germinans; Axial and radial wood density; Laguncularia racemosa; Rhizophora mangle; Salinity gradient; Tree growth","Digital storage; Ecology; Hardwoods; Plants (botany); Avicennia germinans; Laguncularia racemosa; Rhizophora mangle; Salinity gradients; Tree growth; Wood density; Forestry; Diameter; Ecology; Forestry; Hardwoods; Mangrove; Salinity; Trees; Wood Density",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071010784

It is a harmless, recyclable, and ecofriendly fuel (reduces air pollutions such as dust, particulates, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and oxides of sulphur and air toxics). In India, the favourable conditions for the growth of Jatropha exist. Its use a biofuel is going to prove very beneficial for the Indian as well as the world market with the increase in fossil fuel’s demand and its reducing availability. The only drawback in using jatropha oil as a fuel is that the NOx emission is more than that of petroleum diesel.

We use ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a rotating Milky Way-type disc galaxy with distributed star formation sites for three star formation rates (0.3, 3, 30 M☉ yr−1). From our simulations, we see emergence of galactic-scale magnetized outflows, carrying gas from the disc. We compare the morphology of the outflowing gas with hydrodynamic simulations. We look at the spatial distribution of magnetic field in the outflows. Assuming that a certain fraction of gas energy density is converted into cosmic ray energy density, and using information about the magnetic field, we obtain synchrotron emissivity throughout the simulation domain. We generate the surface brightness maps at 1.4 GHz. The outflows are more extended in the vertical direction than radial and hence have an oblate shape. We further find that the matter right behind the outer shock shines brighter in these maps than that above or below. To understand whether this feature can be observed, we produce vertical intensity profiles. We convolve the vertical intensity profile with the typical beam sizes of radio telescopes, for a galaxy located at 10 Mpc to estimate the radio scale height and compare with observations. The radio scale height is ∼300-1200 pc, depending on the resolution of the telescope. We relate the advection speed of the outer shock with the surface density of star formation as vadv ∝ ΣSFR0.3 , which is consistent with earlier observations and analytical estimates. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society","Galaxies: evolution; Galaxies: haloes; Galaxies: spiral; Radio continuum: galaxies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082663234

Methane and acetic acid are typically the main CO2-reduction products attained in microbial electrosynthesis studies, although the production of other more valuable products has also been reported. So far, however, practical strategies to manipulate and steer the distribution of CO2 reduction products during microbial electrosynthesis, particularly when mixed microbial cultures are employed as catalysts, are lacking. To specifically address this issue, here we investigated the influence of magnetite nanoparticles (NPs) supplementation (to a final concentration of 300 mg Fe L−1) on the microbial electrosynthesis process. Results demonstrated, that cells supplemented with magnetite NPs, exhibited a substantially higher yield of acetate production relative to unamended controls (up to 8.5 times higher, during the run with the cathode set at a potential of −700 mV vs. SHE, with a corresponding cathode capture efficiency of 17%) and, correspondingly, a lower yield of methane production (52% in the magnetite-supplemented cell vs. 74% in the unamended control cell).

This implies an adjusted nutrient management, especially of nitrogen (N), in irrigated horticultural systems under semiarid conditions. These horticultural systems are highly relevant in SE Spain from an economic perspective. However, the management of N fertilizer, generally applied in large amounts (150–250 kg N ha−1 in a split application), could trigger losses of reactive N to the environment. The use of novel fertilizers may fulfill the nitrogen requirements of the crop, but should also help to decrease the environmental impacts of production, thus achieving carbon-neutral horticultural systems through (e.g.) enhancement of carbon (C) stocks and greenhouse gases (GHG) emission abatement. In this experiment, eight different fertilizing scenarios at a normalized N application rate of 150 kg N ha−1 were assessed in terms of crop yields, nutrients uptake, C stocking capacity, and yield-scaled GHG emissions. Inorganic NPK fertilizers, digestates, biosolids, composts, and vermicomposts were included among this set of fertilizers. Our results show that organic-based stabilized materials, especially composts, lowered the NO3 − concentration in spinach leaves, in comparison to organic raw materials and synthetic fertilizers. They also produced yields similar to those of slow-release synthetic fertilizers, but with a significant increase in soil organic C 61 days after application. In general, N2O emissions were positively affected by the treatments. Nevertheless, direct N2O emissions were generally low (the highest emission factor, 0.13, being for the biosolid treatment) due to the combined mitigating effect of both the edapho-climatic conditions and the management practices. In general, cumulative CO2 emissions were high in all organic scenarios compared to the control treatment (299 kg C-CO2 ha−1), the highest values being observed in the treatment with biosolid (589 kg C-CO2 ha−1), probably due to differences in the labile organic C contents. In conclusion, some of the organic-based treatments showed multiple positive effects: on crop quality (i.e. leaf N content), crop yields, and GHG mitigation potential. Based on our results, the use of these materials represents an optimized N fertilizer strategy to help achieve a circular economy, by closing nutrient loops and decreasing the environmental impacts of horticultural production systems in semiarid regions of southern Europe. © 2019","C stocks; GHG mitigation; Nutrients uptake; Spinach; Yield-scaled N2O","carbon sequestration; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse gas; horticulture; leafy vegetable; organic farming; yield response; Spinacia oleracea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076288243

The capacity of co-products such as recycled materials and recovered energy to avoid primary production of equivalent products largely determines the environmental performance of waste treatment technologies. Estimating the reductions in resource use, emissions, and impacts enabled by this substitution of primary production is often the most influential and controversial factor in quantifying the overall environmental performance of a waste management strategy. This study aims to critically evaluate the modelling of substitution in LCAs of recovered material from municipal solid waste management systems (MSWMS) by answering two questions. First, to what extent is substitution modelling transparently documented in the literature? Second, are the substitution ratios justified to represent physically realistic replacement of one product by another? To address these questions, we performed a systematic analysis of 51 LCA studies on MSWMS published in the peer-reviewed literature. We found that 22% of the substitution ratios are only implicitly expressed. A significant proportion of substitution ratios is not justified (65%), while for the remaining 35%, justifications do not represent physically realistic substitutions. We call for more rigor and transparency, and we propose guidance for the documentation of substitution ratios, with the aim of reaching more credible and robust analyses. For the justification of a substitution ratio to be considered physically realistic, information should notably be provided concerning loss of quality, the function performed by substitutable materials, and the sector of use. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy recovery; LCA; Modelling; Municipal solid waste; Recycling; Substitution","Emission control; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Life cycle; Models; Recycling; Substitution reactions; Waste treatment; Energy recovery; Environmental performance; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Recovered materials; Systematic analysis; Treatment technologies; Waste management policy; Waste management strategies; Municipal solid waste; polyethylene terephthalate; life cycle analysis; municipal solid waste; recycling; substitution; waste management; waste treatment; anaerobic digestion; Article; life cycle assessment; municipal solid waste; natural resource; priority journal; solid waste management; waste water management; recycling; solid waste; waste disposal; waste management; Recycling; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075910599

The case study was conducted in locations in central Italy and was based on olive crops which are widely grown in that area under rainfed or deficit irrigation regimes. For each locality, the available time series of daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures were used to simulate the daily soil water dynamics (SWt) for olive crops. The simulation was performed assuming 10 irrigation strategies, different for both the volume and date of the interventions. By applying the Theory of Runs to SWt, with a threshold corresponding to the readily available water, the agricultural drought events in the time series were identified and characterised by their duration D (days) and severity S (i.e. the cumulative evapotranspiration deficit in mm) for each locality and strategy. A 2-parameter Gamma distribution was fitted to both D and S, whilst their dependence structure was modelled by a Gumbel copula. The evaluation of the best irrigation strategy in each locality was obtained by comparing the contour lines of the pairs (d,s) having a 10-year return period for the condition D ≥ d AND S ≥ s. Results showed a great influence of both climate and irrigation strategy on the joint distribution of D and S. Some strategies, despite a very similar behaviour in the severity, differed a lot in terms of the associated values of duration, thus denoting different dynamics of water stress (more or less intense). Among the single-irrigation strategies, the optimal one was usually represented by an application at the end of June. Among the double-irrigation strategies, the optimal one involved two interventions, one at the end of June and one at the end of July. These results were also discussed taking into account the corresponding probability of consecutive severe drought events. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Copula; Deficit irrigation; Joint return periods; Olive crops; Risk of water deficit; Transition probabilities","Crops; Drought; Plants (botany); Soil moisture; Time series; Water resources; Copula; Deficit irrigation; Joint return period; Transition probabilities; Water deficits; Irrigation; agrometeorology; drought stress; fruit production; irrigation system; precipitation assessment; probability; return period; severe weather; soil water; time series analysis; water stress; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076261960

The WRF-Chem model was applied over three nested domains and employed with the aim of reproducing local background concentrations, taking into account meteorological and chemical transformation at the regional scale with nested resolutions of 15 km, 3 km and 1 km. Conversely, the PMSS modelling system was applied to simulate 3D air pollutant dispersion, due to traffic emissions, with a very high-resolution (4 m) on a 6 km × 6 km domain covering the city of Modena. The methodology employed to account for anthropogenic emissions relies on two different strategies. Traffic emissions were based on a bottom-up approach using emission factors suggested by the European Environmental Agency with traffic fluxes estimated by the PTV VISUM model in the urban area of Modena, combined with direct traffic flow measurements performed between October 28 and November 8, 2016 which was used for the hourly vehicle modulation. Other anthropogenic emissions were taken from the TNO-MACC III inventory at the scales resolved by the WRF-Chem model. Simulations were performed for the same period whereby the traffic measurement campaign was carried out. 2 m temperature and 10 m wind speed were captured quite well by the WRF-Chem model with statistical metrics in line with similar case studies related to the Northern Italy. The NOx concentrations reproduced in the Po Valley area by WRF-Chem were on average simulated reasonably well with a general negative bias in almost all the examined rural background monitoring stations. Additionally, the deployment of an emission inventory at the original resolution (7 km) highlighted that increasing resolution from 3 km to 1 km does not generally improve the model performance. Nevertheless, simulated and observed NOx hourly concentrations in the urban area of Modena exhibit a large agreement in particular for urban traffic site where detailed traffic emission estimations proved to be very successful in reproducing the observed NOx trend. At urban background stations, despite a general underestimation of the observed concentrations, the combination of WRF-Chem with PMSS provided daily pattern in line with observations. The analysis of the modelled NOx daily cycle pointed out also that at both traffic and background urban stations the morning NOx peak concentration was on average underestimated. This could be explained with an overestimation of mixing phenomena between 07:30 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. by WRF-Chem which leads to a greater dispersion of NOx along the vertical and thus a morning underestimation. The statistical analysis showed finally that PMSS combined with WRF-Chem at both the resolutions (3 km and 1 km) and at both traffic and background sites fulfilled standard acceptance criteria for urban dispersion model evaluation, confirming that the proposed multi-modelling system can be employed as a tool to support environmental policies, epidemiological studies and urban mobility planning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Modena; Multi-model approach; PMSS modelling system; Traffic emissions; WRF-Chem","Air pollution; Environmental protection; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Urban growth; Wind; Modelling systems; Modena; Multi model; Traffic emissions; WRF-Chem; Urban transportation; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric transport; background level; bottom-up approach; chemical element; concentration (composition); emission inventory; Lagrangian analysis; nitrogen oxides; traffic emission; urban area; urban pollution; air pollutant; article; environmental policy; flow measurement; human; Italy; simulation; urban area; wind speed; Emilia-Romagna; Italy; Modena; Po Valley; Peru tomato mosaic virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078195977

Biofuels from locally available resources and waste materials can contribute toward handling this ecological issue. In this work, an attempt has been made to study the performance, combustion, and emission characteristics of a Simpson S217, twin-cylinder tractor diesel engine using soapnut oil methyl ester as fuel. Soapnuts were purchased from organic shops, and oil was extracted by the cold-press method from soapnut kernels. The extracted oil was further subjected to the transesterification process with the presence of KOH and methanol to separate glycerin and fatty acids. Various proportions of soapnut oil methyl ester and diesel were blended on a volumetric basis. The properties of resulting blends SNB10, SNB20, and SNB30 satisfied ASTM biodiesel standards. Experimental investigations were carried out to study the effect of these blends on fuel consumption, thermal efficiency, cylinder pressure, exhaust gas temperature, and tail pipe emissions. The results revealed that the use of biodiesel blends reduced carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and smoke emissions with a slight increase in the NOx emission compared to diesel. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Agriculture; Biodiesel; Carbon monoxide; Construction equipment; Diesel engines; Esters; Exhaust systems (engine); Fatty acids; Gas emissions; Global warming; Materials handling; Off road vehicles; Potassium hydroxide; Road vehicles; Smoke; Tractors (agricultural); Waste incineration; Bio-diesel blends; Cylinder pressures; Emission characteristics; Environmental pollutions; Exhaust gas temperatures; Experimental investigations; Thermal efficiency; Transesterification process; Engine cylinders",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080943432

In order to reduce the environmental impact caused by these vehicles, it is encouraged to use biofuels which are renewable and locally available throughout the year. In the present work, a light biofuel- pine oil was introduced to blend with a methyl ester derived from soapnut oil. This paper details the experimental investigations of the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of an agricultural tractor engine using the combination of biofuels as a complete replacement of conventional diesel fuel. The methyl esters of soapnut oil was blended with pine oil at different proportions. The blends P100SNB0, P75SNB25, P50SNB50, P25SNB75 and P0SNB100 were prepared on volume basis and complied with ASTM D-6751 specifications. The experiments were conducted in a Simpson S217, Twin cylinder tractor diesel engine to study the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of the prepared biofuel. The results showed that the specific fuel consumption of P100SNB0 and biofuel blends decreases up to 4% with the increased engine load. The brake thermal efficiency of the blend P50SNB50 and P75SNB25 were increased by 8% and 10% respectively at full load condition compared with diesel. The biofuel blends outperformed conventional Petro-diesel in terms of smoke, unburnt hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) with a slight penalty on NOx emissions. Up to 50% pine oil blended biodiesel (P75SNB25, P50SNB50) fuel can be used in diesel engines without affecting its performance, emission and combustion characteristics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural tractor engine; Combustion; Hybrid biofuel; Off-road vehicles; Pine oil; Soapnut oil methyl esters","Agriculture; Carbon monoxide; Combustion; Diesel engines; Engine cylinders; Environmental impact; Esters; Off road vehicles; Roads and streets; Smoke; Tractors (agricultural); Agricultural activities; Brake thermal efficiency; Combustion characteristics; Emission characteristics; Experimental investigations; Methyl esters; Pine oil; Specific fuel consumption; Biofuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075444630

We have systematically analyzed the results using APSYS software and compared with simulated AlGaN nanowire DUV LEDs. From the simulation results, significant efficiency droop was observed in AlGaN based devices, attributed to the significant electron leakage. However, compared to AlGaN nanowire DUV LEDs at similar emission wavelength, the proposed single quantum well (SQW) AlInN based light-emitters offer higher internal quantum efficiency without droop up to current density of 1500 A/cm2 and high output optical power. Moreover, we find that transverse magnetic polarized emission is 5 orders stronger than transverse electric polarized emission at 238 nm wavelength. Further research shows that the performance of the AlInN DUV nanowire LEDs decreases with multiple QWs in the active region due to the presence of the non-uniform carrier distribution in the active region.

A summary of the conventional solvents used for acid gas removal and novel solvent formulations specifically adapted to new challenges such as fossil-fuels power plants and industrial processes was reported. Novel configurations from the conventional CO2 absorption-desorption layout were summarized and their impact on the operational performance and the reboiler duty was further evaluated.

This paper investigates the structure and performance of weather and climate services for farmers from a governance perspective. Empirically the paper compares the institutional design and operations of agro-meteorological services in Maharashtra/India and Norway through a ‘most different case study’ approach. The two cases were selected to represent great diversity in location, scale and institutional design. A governance approach based on semi-direct interviews and policy and institutional analysis was combined with local survey data of farmers’ perceptions and use of the services. Despite the fact that the context for the two agromet advisory services was very different from a climate-weather, eco-agriculture and socio-institutional angle, the analysis reveals great similarities in the services structures and critical governance challenges. In both countries the agromet services communicated knowledge that was largely perceived not to be well tailored to farmers’ needs for decisions in specific crops- and farm operations, spatially too coarse to address local issues, and, often unreliable or inaccurate in terms of the quality of data. Farmers did, however, respond positively to specific and locally relevant information on e.g., warnings about high rainfall and spread of pests. Observing such similarities across very diverse contexts enhances the generalization potential, precisely because they evolved under very different circumstances. Similar observations find support in the wider WCS literature. Based on the empirical findings, we propose a more deliberate approach to institutional design of WCS in order to enhance governance performance and co-creation of the services at local, district and national scales. It is suggested that greater participation of farmers and agricultural extension agents in the co-creation of these services is a necessary means of improving the services, supported by the WCS literature. However, we insist that greater participation is only likely to materialize if the deficiencies in institutional design and knowledge quality and relevance are addressed to greater extent than done today. The comparison between the two services shows that Norway can learn from India that a more ambitious scope and multiple forms of communication, including the use of social media/WhatsApp groups, can facilitate greater awareness and interest among farmers in multi-purpose agromet services for multi-way communication. India can learn from Norway that a more integrated and decentralized institutional design can strengthen the network attributes of the services, foster co-creation, and improve participation of both poor and large-scale farmers and extension agents. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agro-meteorological services; Climate adaptation; Co-creation; Governance; Participation; Weather and climate services","rain; agricultural worker; Article; awareness; climate; decentralization; human; India; interview; Maharashtra; Norway; perception; priority journal; social media; weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078741825

We investigated the response of recruits of the temperate coral Oculina arbuscula to increased CO2 concentrations, a species whose adults show significant tolerance to elevated concentrations of CO2. Specifically, we exposed small colonies (5−12 mm diameter) to 475, 710, and 1261 ppm CO2 for 75 d in the laboratory to address the hypothesis that, like adults, the health of O. arbuscula recruits is not affected by increased CO2 concentrations. Calcification rates were monitored regularly during the experiment, while mortality, respiration rates, photosynthetic rates, algal symbiont densities, and soluble protein were quantified at the end. As predicted, CO2 concentration did not impact survival, algal densities, or soluble protein concentrations in O. arbuscula recruits. In contrast, both calcification rates and photosynthesis:respiration ratios tended to be lower at higher CO2. Comparing the results of this study on recruits with published studies on adults suggested that both life stages exhibit a similar non-linear response to CO2 concentration, whereby recruits may be unable to counter the increased energetic cost of calcification that occurs at the highest CO2. Based on these results and environmental monitoring showing that mean pCO2 is increasing by ~2.4% yr−1 in the waters off Georgia, USA, we conclude that O. arbuscula recruits may begin to exhibit depressed calcification rates within the current century if CO2 emissions are not reduced. © Inter-Research 2020","Calcification; Ocean acidification; Physiology; Recruitment; Temperate corals","adult; bioenergetics; calcification; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; concentration (composition); coral; environmental monitoring; ocean acidification; photosynthesis; population density; protein; recruitment (population dynamics); survival; temperate environment; Georgia; United States; algae; Anthozoa; Oculina arbuscula; Scleractinia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087758399

This interest has prompted transitions from scientist- to stakeholder-driven or collaborative approaches to climate science. A common indicator of successful collaboration is whether stakeholders use the information resulting from the projects in which they are engaged. However, detailed examples of how stakeholders use climate information are relatively scarce in the literature, leading to a challenge in understanding what researchers can and should expect and plan for in terms of stakeholder use of research findings. Drawing on theoretical, typological, and evaluation insights from the field of information use, we examine stakeholder use of climate information emerging from 13 collaborative climate science projects conducted in the western United States between 2012 and 2016. Three primary types of use emerge from our findings—conceptual, instrumental, and justification—reflecting common typologization of information use. Conceptual use was the most predominant. We suggest that researcher awareness of this typology can enable more systematic understanding of what project outputs stakeholders use and impacts of those outputs, giving way to new areas of inquiry and aiding in the conceptualization and design of climate information products for land and natural resource managers. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Climate information use; Collaborative climate science; Natural resource management; Research impacts","Information management; Managers; Natural resources management; Product design; Changing climate; Climate information; Climate science; Collaborative approach; Natural resource management; Research impacts; Resource managers; Western United States; Information use; climate change; natural resource; resource management; stakeholder; typology; article; awareness; climate; drawing; human; human experiment; manager; natural resource; theoretical study; United States; climate; climate change; environmental protection; natural resource; problem solving; United States; Climate; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Natural Resources; Problem Solving; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077566857

Accompanying this trend has been the emergence of intermediary organisations, whose role it is to mediate between these actors cf. the market and the state, with the aim to move from local experimentation to widespread transformational change. While in recent years a significant body of research has emerged that has considered intermediary functions, less is known about intermediary spaces. By tracing how intermediary spaces are shaped, negotiated, protected, and expanded, this article makes three contributions to the literature on energy governance and low-carbon intermediaries. First, a focus on the relational nature of intermediary spaces challenges the community/state binary in energy governance. Second, it highlights the power dynamics behind these emergent relational spaces; showing such spaces are not neutral, but produced through social relations within and beyond them, affecting the functions that intermediaries seek to fulfil. Third, it provides an understanding of how the ever-changing nature of intermediary spaces can also enable new spaces for action to emerge and challenge the status quo. © The Author(s) 2019.","boundary organisations; Energy governance; intermediaries; low-carbon transitions; relational space","alternative energy; community organization; energy market; energy planning; governance approach; household energy; power generation; state role",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067821949

We further report constant ratios across the galaxy populations and redshifts, suggesting that gas temperatures T exc traced by [C i] do not strongly vary. We find only a mild correlation with T dust and that, generally, T exc ≲ T dust. We fit the line ratios with classical photodissociation region models, retrieving consistently larger densities and intensities of the UV radiation fields in submillimeter galaxies than in main-sequence and local objects. However, these simple models fall short in representing the complexity of a multiphase interstellar medium and should be treated with caution. Finally, we compare our observations with the Santa Cruz semi-analytical model of galaxy evolution, recently extended to simulate submillimeter emission. While we confirm the success in reproducing the CO lines, we find systematically larger [C i] luminosities at fixed IR luminosity than predicted theoretically. This highlights the necessity of improving our understanding of the mechanisms regulating the [C i] emission on galactic scales. We release our data compilation to the community. © 2020.

Objectives: Apply G-computation to estimate hypothetical effects of several realistic scenarios for future air pollution reductions on lung growth. Methods: Mixed-effects linear regression was used to estimate FEV1 and FVC from age 11 to 15 years in 2,120 adolescents across 3 cohorts (1993–2001, 1997–2004, and 2007–2011). Models included regional pollutants (nitrogen dioxide [NO2] or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter &lt;2.5 mm [PM2.5]) and other important covariates. Using G-computation, a causal inference–based method, we then estimated changes in mean lung growth in our population for hypothetical interventions on either NO2 or PM2.5. Confidence intervals (CIs) were computed by bootstrapping (N = 1,000). Measurements and Main Results: Compared with the effects of exposure from observed NO2 concentrations during the study period, had communities remained at 1994 to 1997 NO2 levels, FEV1 and FVC growth were estimated to have been reduced by 2.7% (95% CI, 23.6 to 21.8) and 4.2% (95% CI, 25.2 to 23.4), respectively. If NO2 concentrations had been reduced by 30%, we estimated a 4.4% increase in FEV1 growth (95% CI, 2.8–5.9) and a 7.1% increase in FVC growth (95% CI, 5.7–8.6). Comparable results were observed for PM2.5 interventions. Conclusions: We estimated that substantial increases in lung function would occur as a result of interventions that reduce NO2 or PM2.5 concentrations. These findings provide a quantification of potential health benefits of air quality improvement.

Ozone is not emitted directly but formed in the atmosphere during complex chemical reactions of precursors, carbon monoxide, methane, non-methane volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides, in sunlight. These ozone precursors are emitted from a wide range of anthropogenic activities. Reductions in ozone precursor emissions are needed to mitigate ozone vegetation damage but it is unclear which are the most effective source sectors to target. Here, we apply a global Earth system model to compare the benefits to gross primary productivity of stringent 50% emission reductions in the seven largest anthropogenic ozone source sectors. Deep cuts in air pollutant emissions from road transportation and the energy sector are the most effective mitigation measures for ozone-induced gross primary productivity losses in Eastern China, Eastern United States, Europe and globally. Our results suggest that mitigation of ozone vegetation damage is a unique opportunity to contribute to negative carbon emissions, offering a natural climate solution that links fossil fuel emission abatement, air quality and climate. However, achieving these benefits requires ambitious mitigation pathways that tackle multiple source sectors. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,,Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078407703

These developments have commanded considerable attention in the empirical literature. In this piece, we consider the philosophical dimensions of climate action at the sub-national level. Specifically, we argue that climate action at the sub-national level is an instance of a more general class of cases in which the failure of some collective agent to discharge some duty to which it is subject entails duties for the sub-collectives of which it is comprised to partially discharge that duty. We begin, then, with a discussion of such cases, and a defence of the devolution principle, which sets out conditions under which such duties arise. We then set out the argument with respect to sub-national political communities’ duties to take action on climate change, specifically. The article concludes by considering complications arising out of the inevitable fact of partial compliance, drawing upon recent work in the literature on slack-taking duties. © The Author(s) 2019.","climate justice; collective duties; partial compliance; political philosophy; sub-national political communities",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061965861

At the national level in EU Member States, improvements in energy efficiency are measured against model-based scenarios and ex ante engineering estimates, which might provide inaccurate indications of the actual energy savings delivered by energy efficiency. Thus, the objectives of this study are to provide new insights on (i) the contribution of energy efficiency improvements to reducing energy consumption in Finland over the 2005–2015 period by employing an ex post multi-sectoral decomposition analysis approach—Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index I—and (ii) the energy security and climate benefits associated with energy efficiency improvements. The results indicate that from 2005 to 2015, efficiency saved 0.58 Mtoe of final energy; without the energy efficiency improvements that occurred between 2005 and 2015 (ceteris paribus), the final energy consumption in 2015 would have been 2.4% higher. Compared to the energy savings reported by the Finnish government to the European Commission, the savings calculated with the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index I are significantly lower. Energy efficiency improvements between 2005 and 2015 reduced Finland's carbon dioxide emissions and dependence on energy imports by 3.5% and 5% in 2015, respectively.

Water harvesting and the implementation of reduced application or more efficient irrigation technologies were identified as two of the most efficient practices to mitigate the declining patterns on groundwater resources. However, prior to implementing these practices, understanding how groundwater interacts with surface water and responds to natural and anthropogenic stressors is crucial. Integrated modeling tools that are able to exchange fluxes in both domains are needed to assess how conservation practices will affect our water resources under different projected climate and land use scenarios. This study aimed to evaluate the most likely impacts of current land management practices under the most severe projections of future climate and quantify the potential mitigation effects of three conservation scenarios on the water resources of the Fort Cobb Reservoir Experimental Watershed (FCREW) in western Oklahoma. The semicoupled SWAT-MODFLOW (SWATmf) model was used to simulate the hydrologic responses of the FCREW to a 50% reduction in the irrigation depths and the transition of 50% and 75% of croplands to rangelands under 32 distinct climate projections. Results showed that future climate can drive a reduction in the streamflow (-18%) and an increase to the depth of the water table (99%-120%) in the western part of the FCREW by the end of the century. The Fort Cobb Reservoir was expected to reduce its release after the mid-2060s to maintain its current target level. All the scenarios, aimed at decreasing groundwater extractions or implementing conservation measures, signaled a full recovery response in the groundwater levels 7-10 years after the year the conservation practices were implemented. The 50% reduction in the irrigation depths was found to elicit faster hydrologic systemic responses than the two that implemented conservation measures, which contravene tradition and would imply cessation of agricultural activities. This study can enable stakeholders to formulate timely adaptation and mitigating strategies to adopt to land use changes. © 2020 by the authors.","Agricultural landscape; Climate projections; Groundwater; MODFLOW; Risk; Surface water; SWAT; SWATmf","Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Irrigation; Land use; Natural resources management; Reservoir management; Risks; Surface waters; Underground reservoirs; Water conservation; Agricultural landscapes; Climate projection; MODFLOW; SWAT; SWATmf; Climate models; agricultural land; groundwater pollution; groundwater resource; harvesting; irrigation system; land management; risk assessment; streamflow; surface water; water demand; water table; Fort Cobb Reservoir; Oklahoma [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081729750

They can act as carbon sinks or sources depending upon their location, type, and condition. Rehabilitation of wetlands is gaining popularity as a nature-based approach to helping mitigate climate change; however, few studies have empirically tested the carbon benefits of wetland restoration, especially in freshwater environments. Here we investigated the effects of passive rehabilitation (i.e. fencing and agricultural release) of 16 semi-arid rain-filled freshwater wetlands in southeastern Australia. Eight control sites were compared with older (&gt;10 year) or newer (2–5 year) rehabilitated sites, dominated by graminoids or eucalypts. Carbon stocks (soils and plant biomass), and emissions (carbon dioxide - CO2; and methane - CH4) were sampled across three seasons, representing natural filling and drawdown, and soil microbial communities were sampled in spring. We found no significant difference in soil carbon or greenhouse gas emissions between rehabilitated and control sites, however, plant biomass was significantly higher in older rehabilitated sites. Wetland carbon stocks were 19.21 t Corg ha−1 and 2.84 t Corg ha−1 for soils (top 20 cm; n = 137) and plant biomass (n = 288), respectively. Hydrology was a strong driver of wetland greenhouse gas emissions. Diffusive fluxes (n = 356) averaged 117.63 mmol CO2 m2 d−1 and 2.98 mmol CH4 m2 d−1 when wet, and 124.01 mmol CO2 m2 d−1 and –0.41 mmol CH4 m2 d−1 when dry. Soil microbial community richness was nearly 2-fold higher during the wet phase than the dry phase, including relative increases in Nitrososphaerales, Myxococcales and Koribacteraceae and methanogens Methanobacteriales. Vegetation type significantly influenced soil carbon, aboveground carbon, and greenhouse gas emissions. Overall, our results suggest that passive rehabilitation of rain-filled wetlands, while valuable for biodiversity and habitat provisioning, is ineffective for increasing carbon gains within 20 years. Carbon offsetting opportunities may be better in systems with faster sediment accretion. Active rehabilitation methods, particularly that reinstate the natural hydrology of drained wetlands, should also be considered. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","16S amplicon sequencing; Carbon sequestration; Depressional; Freshwater wetland; Land use; Restoration","carbon; carbon dioxide; methane; rain; rain; agricultural catchment; carbon cycle; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; environmental assessment; environmental restoration; freshwater ecosystem; land use change; methanogenic bacterium; microbial community; mitigation; soil microorganism; source-sink dynamics; wetland; Article; Australia; biodiversity; biomass; carbon footprint; controlled study; diffusion flux; greenhouse gas; habitat; hydrology; Methanobacteriales; nonhuman; soil microflora; spring; vegetation; wetland; ecosystem; soil; Australia; Methanobacteriales; Myxococcales; Australia; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Methane; Rain; Soil; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076467451

In this study, we estimated the threshold effects of temperature on Aedes mosquito larval index as an early warning tool for dengue prevention. We also investigated the relationship between dengue vector index and dengue epidemics in Taiwan using weekly panel data for 17 counties from January 2012 to May 2019. To achieve our goals, we first applied the panel threshold regression technique to test for threshold effects and determine critical temperature values. Data were then further decomposed into different sets corresponding to different temperature regimes. Finally, negative binomial regression models were applied to assess the non‐linear relationship between meteorological factors and Breteau index (BI). At the national level, we found that a 1°C temperature increase caused the expected value of BI to increase by 0.09 units when the temperature is less than 27.21 °C, and by 0.26 units when the temperature is greater than 27.21 °C. At the regional level, the dengue vector index was more sensitive to temperature changes because double threshold effects were found in the southern Taiwan model. For southern Taiwan, as the temperature increased by 1°C, the expected value of BI increased by 0.29, 0.63, and 1.49 units when the average temperature was less than 27.27 °C, between 27.27 and 30.17 °C, and higher than 30.17 °C, respectively. In addition, the effects of precipitation and relative humidity on BI became stronger when the average temperature exceeded the thresholds. Regarding the impacts of climate change on BI, our results showed that the potential effects on BI range from 3.5 to 54.42% under alternative temperature scenarios. By combining threshold regression techniques with count data regression models, this study provides evidence of threshold effects between climate factors and the dengue vector index. The proposed threshold of temperature could be incorporated into the implementation of public health measures and risk prediction to prevent and control dengue fever in the future. © 2020 by the authors.

In cities with relatively good air quality, and where NOx concentrations rarely exceed legal limits, adverse health effects on the population may still occur. Therefore, detecting small deviations in air quality and deriving methods of controlling air pollution are challenging. This study presents different data analytical methods which can be used to monitor and effectively evaluate policies or measures to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions through the detection of pollution episodes and the removal of outliers. This method helps to identify the sources of pollution more effectively, and enhances the value of monitoring data and exceedances of limit values. It will detect outliers, changes and trend deviations in NO2 concentrations at ground level, and consists of four main steps: classical statistical description techniques, statistical process control techniques, functional analysis and a functional control process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the outlier detection methodology proposed, it was applied to a complete one-year NO2 dataset for a sub-urban site in Dublin, Ireland in 2013. The findings demonstrate how the functional data approach improves the classical techniques for detecting outliers, and in addition, how this new methodology can facilitate a more thorough approach to defining effect air pollution control measures. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; Functional data analysis; Non-normal data; Outlier; Statistical process control",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080120678

This study provides fundamental insights into SNF-related traits and will accelerate efforts for SNF breeding. Abstract: Symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) increases sustainability by supplying biological nitrogen for crops to enhance yields without damaging the ecosystem. A better understanding of this complex biological process is critical for addressing the triple challenges of food security, environmental degradation, and climate change. Soybean plants, the most important legume worldwide, can form a mutualistic interaction with specialized soil bacteria, bradyrhizobia, to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Here we report a comprehensive genome-wide association study of 11 SNF-related traits using 79K GBS-derived SNPs in 297 African soybeans. We identified 25 QTL regions encompassing 40 putative candidate genes for SNF-related traits including 20 genes with no prior known role in SNF. A line with a large deletion (164 kb), encompassing a QTL region containing a strong candidate gene (CASTOR), exhibited a marked decrease in SNF. This study performed on African soybean lines provides fundamental insights into SNF-related traits and yielded a rich catalog of candidate genes for SNF-related traits that might accelerate future efforts aimed at sustainable agriculture. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"Agriculture; Climate change; Food supply; Genes; Sustainable development; Atmospheric nitrogen; Biological process; Biomass accumulation; Genome-wide association; Genome-wide association studies; Mutualistic interaction; Sustainable agriculture; Symbiotic nitrogen fixation; Nitrogen fixation; biomass; gene expression regulation; genetics; genome-wide association study; genotype; growth, development and aging; metabolism; nitrogen fixation; nodulation; phenotype; phylogeny; physiology; plant breeding; plant root; quantitative trait locus; shoot; single nucleotide polymorphism; soybean; symbiosis; Biomass; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Nitrogen Fixation; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Plant Breeding; Plant Roots; Plant Shoots; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Root Nodules, Plant; Soybeans; Symbiosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076771039

Few studies have explored on-road vehicular PM2.5 emissions and the health effects attributed to these emissions under different traffic conditions. Based on driving data obtained from 20000 taxi receipts, a motor vehicle emission simulator (MOVES) model was used to estimate the PM2.5 emission levels of motor vehicles in the urban area within the Sixth Ring Road of Beijing (SRRB) on weekdays and weekends, respectively. Two different PM2.5 exposure scenarios were further simulated using an atmospheric dispersion model. Subsequently, the health effects attributable to traffic-related PM2.5 exposure were quantified by using exposure-response function to calculate the population acute morbidity and premature mortality during different time periods. We found that PM2.5 emission levels of motor vehicles on normal weekdays were overall higher than those on weekends. The median vehicular PM2.5 dispersion concentration in the study area was 2.68 μg/m3 on weekdays and 1.82 μg/m3 on weekends. Annually, there were 4435 premature deaths attributed to vehicle emissions (95% confidence interval (CI): 3655, 4904) under weekday exposure conditions, and this number sharply decreased to 3462 (95% CI: 3052, 4011) on weekends. Considering the hourly measurements, road traffic emissions have the greatest impact on public health during morning rush hour (8:00 a.m.). Total PM2.5 emissions were closely associated with road traffic conditions and largely determined the magnitude of the health impacts caused by traffic-related PM2.5 exposure. These findings provide information to aid in formulating reasonable public health policies to address vehicular PM2.5 emission-induced health implications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Health effects; PM2.5; Urban traffic; Vehicular emission","Air pollution; Pollution; Public health; Taxicabs; Atmospheric dispersion modeling; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Health effects; Mobile source emissions; Motor vehicle emissions; PM2.5; Urban traffic; Vehicular emission; Roads and streets; atmospheric pollution; confidence interval; health risk; particulate matter; public health; road traffic; traffic emission; urban area; air quality; Article; atmospheric dispersion; cardiovascular disease; China; chronic obstructive lung disease; concentration (parameter); environmental exposure; exhaust gas; grid cell; health hazard; hospital admission; human; ischemic heart disease; lung cancer; morbidity; mortality risk; motor vehicle; outpatient department; particulate matter; premature mortality; priority journal; simulation; traffic; urban area; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077357999

However, specific emission reduction effects of various temporary emission reduction policies are difficult to evaluate. During the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Beijing in 2014, the Chinese government implemented a number of emergency emission control measures in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area to maintain the air quality in this region. This gave us an opportunity to quantify the effectiveness of the emission reduction measures separately and identify the efficient policy combinations for the reduction of major pollutants. In this study, we evaluated the impacts of specific emission reduction measures on the concentrations of two major air pollutants (PM2.5 and O3) under eight policy scenarios using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). Comparing these scenarios, we found that the control policies against the primary PM2.5 emission achieved the most significant results. Meanwhile, all the emission control measures raised the ozone concentrations in different degrees, which might be partly attributed to the changes of PM2.5 concentration and the ratio of NOx and VOCs caused by the emission control measures. Our results suggest that, in VOC-sensitive areas like Beijing, emergency control measures focusing on primary PM2.5 emission could lead to significant PM2.5 reduction and relatively small ozone increase, and should be considered as a priority policy. Joint emission control at the regional scale is also important especially under unfavorable meteorological conditions. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","APEC blue; Emission reduction policy; North China Plain; Ozone; PM2.5; WRF-Chem","Air quality; Emission control; Ozone; Weather forecasting; APEC blue; Emission reduction policies; North China Plain; PM2.5; WRF-Chem; Quality control; ozone; volatile organic compound; ozone; air quality; Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; ozone; particulate matter; pollution policy; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; Asia; China; controlled study; environmental policy; government regulation; meteorology; Pacific islands; particulate matter; simulation; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; prevention and control; China; North China Plain; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Asia; Beijing; China; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Policy; Ozone; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077838420

These platoons can automatically accelerate or brake together, allowing them to travel at closer distances. With the world moving towards a more environment-friendly approach to everyday decisions, it is not a surprise that the concept of truck platooning is gaining momentum, as it reduces CO2 emissions by lowering fuel consumption. However, studies need to be performed to confirm that existing bridges will be able to adequately support truck platoons. The scope of this research is to study the effects of truck platooning on steel girder bridges in the United States (US). A multi-dimensional parametric study was conducted, which evaluated a variety of bridge span configurations and span lengths. Load ratings (using three different methodologies) were calculated for each of these structures for a range of truck platoons (both the number of trucks within a platoon and spacing between trucks). For comparison, the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) design and legal load ratings were also calculated for each bridge and were used to quantify the adequacy of current bridges to carry truck platoons. The study was able to identify the potentially inadequate existing bridges based on the original design methodology, configuration, and span length. This information is intended to be valuable to bridge owners as an initial screening process along corridors that will be subjected to regular truck platoon traffic. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.",,"Automobiles; Autonomous vehicles; Industrial trucks; Truck transportation; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Association of state; Bridge load ratings; Environment friendly; Gaining momentum; Multi dimensional; Parametric study; Screening process; Steel girder bridge; Bridges",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086142852

Scenarios of future climate change predict an increase of severe drought conditions in temperate climate regions. This implies the need for adaptations of locally managed forest systems, such as European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) monocultures, for instance, through the admixing of deep-rooting silver fir (Abies alba Mill.). We designed a stable-isotope-based split-root experiment under controlled conditions to test whether silver fir seedlings could perform HR and therefore reduce drought stress in neighboring beech seedlings. Our results showed that HR by silver fir does occur, but with a delayed onset of three weeks after isotopic labelling with 2H2O (δ2H ≈ +6000‰), and at low rates. On average, 0.2% of added 2H excess could be recovered via HR. Fir roots released water under dry-soil conditions that caused some European beech seedlings to permanently wilt. On the basis of these results, we concluded that HR by silver fir does occur, but the potential for mitigating drought stress in beech is limited. Admixing silver fir into beech stands as a climate change adaptation strategy needs to be assessed in field studies with sufficient monitoring time. © 2020 by the authors.","Drought; European beech; Hydraulic redistribution; Mixed stand; Silver fir","Drought; Ecosystems; Forestry; Isotopes; Silver; Soils; Climate change adaptation; Controlled conditions; European beech; European beech (fagus sylvatica l.); Mixed stands; Silver fir; Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.); Water redistribution; Climate change; climate change; coniferous tree; drought; ecosystem resilience; forest ecosystem; Drought; Ecosystems; Fagus Sylvatica; Forestry; Isotopes; Silver; Abies; Abies alba; Fagus; Fagus sylvatica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081117139

In this paper, the effect of n-butanol-gasoline blends on combustion and emissions performance of direct injection gasoline engine under urban conditions (throttle opening is 10% and 35%) is studied by using GT-Power simulation software. By comparing the several fuels, we find a fuel that is more suitable for the engine to operate in urban conditions. This is of great significance for reducing China's dependence on oil. The simulation results show that adding n-butanol into gasoline can significantly reduce the peak in-cylinder temperature (Tmax), improve the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of the engine. It is advantageous for the engine to operate under urban conditions. By comparison, it is found that Bu40 is the most suitable fuel. When the throttle opening is 10%, high engine speed operation will reduce brake power (BP), brake torque (BT) and BTE, and increase CO emissions. In terms of emissions, n-butanol gasoline blends can reduce CO and NOx emissions, but HC emissions increase. Finally, the results show that n-butanol-gasoline blends can be used in SI direct injection gasoline engine instead of pure gasoline. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Combustion characteristics; Emission; GDI; N-butanol-gasoline blends; Simulation","Brakes; Combustion; Computer software; Direct injection; Engines; Neutron emission; Brake thermal efficiency; Combustion characteristics; Cylinder temperatures; Direct injection gasoline engine; Emission characteristics; Emissions performance; Gasoline blends; Simulation; Gasoline; chemical compound; combustion; diesel engine; efficiency measurement; emission; operations technology; performance assessment; simulation; temperature effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068172416

Understanding the public acceptability of policy aimed at behaviour change in this domain will help to focus strategy towards effective and targeted solutions. Across two studies (n = 259, 300) we consider how policy approaches at different levels of governance (individual, community, and national) might be influenced by the inducement of hypocrisy and the activation of social norms. We also examine the influence of these experimental manipulations upon behavioural intention to reduce consumption (e.g., repair not replace, avoiding luxuries). Dynamic social norm framing was unsuccessful in producing an effect on policy acceptance or intentions to reduce consumption. Information provision about the impact of individual consumption on global climate change increased support for radical policies at the national level (banning environmentally harmful consumption practices) and the community level (working fewer hours, sharing material products, collaborative food cultivation), yet the inducement of hypocrisy had no additional effect. This is in contrast to individual-level behavioural intentions, where the inducement of hypocrisy decreased intentions to engage in high-consumption behaviour. This paper concludes with implications for low-consumption governance. © 2020 by the authors.","Consumption; Governance; Hypocrisy; Neoliberalism; Policy acceptance; Pro-environmental behaviour; Psychology; Regulation; Social norms","global climate; governance approach; lifestyle; neoliberalism; policy making; psychology; public attitude",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081244562

The proposed approach eliminates the bias resulting from predefined indices at regional scale. The study was performed for eight unimpaired streamflow stations from 1962–2016. First, the Singular Valued Decomposition (SVD) teleconnections of the streamflow corresponding to 500 mbar geopotential height, sea surface temperature, 500 mbar specific humidity (SHUM500), and 500 mbar U-wind (U500) were obtained. Second, the skillful SVD teleconnections were screened non-parametrically. Finally, the screened teleconnections were used as the streamflow predictors in the non-linear regression models (K-nearest neighbor regression and data-driven support vector machine). New hydrological insights: The SVD results identified new spatial regions that have not been included in existing predefined indices. The nonparametric model indicated the teleconnections of SHUM500 and U500 being better streamflow predictors compared to other climate variables. The regression models were capable to apprehend most of the sustained low flows, proving the model to be effective for drought-affected regions. It was also observed that the proposed approach showed better forecasting skills with preprocessed large scale climate variables rather than using the predefined indices. The proposed study is simple, yet robust in providing qualitative streamflow forecasts that may assist water managers in making policy-related decisions when planning and managing watersheds. © 2019","Climate variability; Forecast; KNN; Streamflow; SVD; SVM; Teleconnections",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076039156

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a combined online universal (ie, delivered to all pupils) school-based preventive intervention targeting substance use, depression, and anxiety in adolescence. Methods: We did a multicentre, cluster-randomised controlled trial in secondary schools in Australia, with pupils in year 8 or 9 (aged 13–14 years). Participating schools were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to one of four intervention conditions: (1) Climate Schools–Substance Use, focusing on substance use only; (2) Climate Schools–Mental Health, focusing on depression and anxiety only; (3) Climate Schools–Combined, focusing on the prevention of substance use, depression, and anxiety; or (4) active control. The interventions were delivered in school classrooms in an online delivery format and used a mixture of peer cartoon storyboards and classroom activities that were focused on alcohol, cannabis, anxiety, and depression. The interventions were delivered for 2 years and primary outcomes were knowledge related to alcohol, cannabis, and mental health; alcohol use, including heavy episodic drinking; and depression and anxiety symptoms at 12, 24, and 30 months after baseline. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12613000723785) and an extended follow-up is underway. Findings: Between Sept 1, 2013, and Feb 28, 2014, we recruited 88 schools (12 391 pupils), of whom 71 schools and 6386 (51·5%) pupils were analysed (17 schools dropped out and 1308 pupils declined to participate). We allocated 18 schools (1739 [27·25%] pupils; 1690 [97·2%] completed at least one follow-up) to the substance use condition, 18 schools (1594 [25·0%] pupils; 1560 [97·9%] completed at least one follow-up) to the mental health condition, 16 schools (1497 [23·4%] pupils; 1443 [96·4%] completed at least one follow-up) to the combined condition, and 19 schools (1556 [23·4%] pupils; 1513 [97·2%] completed at least one follow-up) to the control condition. Compared with controls, the combined intervention group had increased knowledge related to alcohol and cannabis at 12, 24, and 30 months (standardised mean difference [SMD] for alcohol 0·26 [95% CI 0·14 to 0·39] and for cannabis 0·17 [0·06 to 0·28] at 30 months), increased knowledge related to mental health at 24 months (0·17 [0·08 to 0·27]), reduced growth in their odds of drinking and heavy episodic drinking at 12, 24, and 30 months (odds ratio for drinking 0·25 [95% CI 0·12 to 0·51], and for heavy episodic drinking 0·15 [0·04 to 0·58] at 30 months), and reduced increases in anxiety symptoms at 12 and 30 months (SMD −0·12 [95% CI −0·22 to −0·01] at 30 months). We found no difference in symptoms or probable diagnosis of depression. The combined intervention group also showed improvement in alcohol use outcomes compared with the substance use and mental health interventions and improvements in anxiety outcomes when compared with the mental health intervention only. Interpretation: Combined online prevention of substance use, depression, and anxiety led to increased knowledge of alcohol, cannabis, and mental health, reduced increase in the odds of any drinking and heavy episodic drinking, and reduced symptoms of anxiety over a 30-month period. These findings provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of an online universal school-based preventive intervention targeting substance use, depression, and anxiety in adolescence.

The performance of Cu2O nanomaterials in these applications depends crucially on their surface chemistry and optical properties. Here, we demonstrate that the absorption spectrum of colloidal Cu2O nanocrystals depends strongly on the oxidation states of surface copper species. Pristine as-synthesized colloidal Cu2O nanoparticles exhibit an absorption spectrum with a resonance at λ = 570 nm that disappears upon exposure to air or water. Both ground-state and transient absorption spectra of pristine Cu2O nanoparticles are very similar to the analogous spectra of colloidal metallic Cu nanoparticles and are therefore consistent with the behavior expected of a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). X-ray photoelectron and Auger spectroscopy indicate that the observation of an LSPR feature in pristine Cu2O nanoparticles correlates with the presence of Cu0 atoms on their surfaces. This work demonstrates the significant role that surface redox chemistry plays in determining the optical properties of colloidal Cu2O nanocrystals. Additionally, the correlation between the localized redox chemistry of Cu2O nanoparticles and their optical spectra revealed here is distinct from the behavior of Cu2E (E = S, Se, Te) nanoparticles and will allow for a deeper understanding of the mechanistic aspects of their catalytic and photocatalytic behaviors.

In this study, we present a regional-scale insight into the transition of aerosol properties during this special period based on integrated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR), and ground-based AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) observations. As a response, aerosols in eastern China have exhibited notable reversal in both the amount and optical properties. Regional haze pollution with Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) > 1.0 in northern China declined from more than ~80 days per year to less than ~30 days. While fine-mode particles exhibited a continuous decrease by ~30-40% during the time period of 2013-2018, the levels of coarse aerosols had no regular variations. MISR fraction AOD of different size modes shows that there has been an obvious overall decline in coarse particles over eastern China, but natural sources such as long-range dust transport make a considerable contribution. The Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) increased steadily from 2001 to 2012 by more than-0.05. In contrast, aerosol absorption has been getting stronger since 2013, with SSA increasing by ~0.03, due to a much larger reduction in sulfate and nitrate. The drastic transition of aerosol properties has greatly changed aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) in eastern China. The negative ARF at the top (TOA) and bottom (BOA) of the atmosphere decreased by ~30 and ~50 W/m2, respectively, in Beijing during the 2001-2012 period. Although aerosol loading continued to decline after 2013, the magnitudes of TOA and BOA ARF have increased by ~10 and ~30 W/m2, respectively, since 2013, due largely to the enhanced aerosol absorption. Our results suggest that more comprehensive observations are needed to improve understanding of the intense climate and environment effects of dramatic aerosol properties in eastern China. © 2020 by the authors.","Aerosols; Anthropogenic emissions; Eastern china; Reversal; Satellite","Aerosols; Atmospheric radiation; Optical properties; Radiometers; Satellites; Spectrometers; Sulfur compounds; Aerosol radiative forcing; Aerosol robotic networks; Anthropogenic emissions; Eastern China; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Multiangle imaging spectroradiometer; Reversal; Single scattering albedo; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080941697

Wind power and solar photovoltaics are classified as types of variable renewable energy (VRE), which have both pros and cons. Interregional trading of VRE is a key factor to make the most of it. Early studies of demand response or smart grids demonstrated the effective matching of supply and demand in a region. Studies of virtual power plants provided important implications for the selection of control parameters. However, questions remain when regions are crossed. The purpose of this study is to clarify the role of cross-border interconnectors in achieving high VRE penetration and to find the causality structures of interconnector operations for VRE. By developing multi-regression models for Denmark, a nation that has accepted VRE, and comparing them with 3 areas with different VRE progress stages in Japan, who is trying hard to achieve the target of 44% zero-emission sources in its generation mix by 2030, the general configuration of cross-border interconnectors with VRE that can be extended to other countries was clarified. This is the first report on the direct effects of power exchange to VRE using newly developed models. The results show that Japan still maintains traditional network planning. If countries such as Japan use flexible policies, a much higher VRE penetration might be achieved, thereby reducing the CO2 emissions. This model might also be applicable to other developing countries in which electricity supply is crucial for economic growth. © 2019, The Japan Section of the Regional Science Association International.","Causality structure; Cross-border interchange; Flexibility; Multiple regression; VRE",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100564515

In this study, ensemble hindcast and non-global warming (NGW) simulations of this heavy rainfall event were implemented. In the NGW simulations, initial and boundary conditions were generated by using the outputs of natural forcing historical experiments by twelve different global climate models. The results of the hindcast and NGW simulations indicated the high likelihood of the generation of linear heavy rainfall bands and the intensification of Kinugawa heavy rainfall due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. However, in some NGW simulations, the total rainfall was greater than in the hindcast. In addition, the maximum total rainfall was greater in many NGW simulations. Lower atmospheric temperature, sea surface temperature (SST), and precipitable water content (PWC) under the initial conditions can cause less rainfall in the NGW simulations. However, some discrepancies were found in the initial conditions and simulated rainfall; less rainfall with higher atmospheric temperature, SST and PWC, and vice versa. A detailed investigation of simulated atmospheric conditions explained the simulated rainfall. These results indicate that it is not sufficient to examine climatological anomalies to understand individual extreme weather events, but that detailed simulations are useful. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Event attribution; Heavy rainfall; Natural greenhouse gas emission; Numerical simulation; Regional weather model","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate change; Climate models; Computer simulation; Extreme weather; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Oceanography; Rain; Surface waters; Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; Event attribution; Extreme weather events; Heavy rainfall; Initial and boundary conditions; Precipitable water content; Regional weather; Sea surface temperature (SST); Atmospheric temperature; boundary condition; carbon emission; climate change; climate modeling; computer simulation; global warming; greenhouse gas; rainfall; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081122518

This study uses a whole-farm land use optimisation approach to explore climate change impacts, when including adaptation, on farm profitability, production and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the Loess Plateau of northern China. The results show that with adaptation activities, the losses in smallholder farm profitability caused by the climate change could be moderate. Declining rainfall results in land use changes that generate higher on-farm GHG emissions with the most economically beneficial adaptations. With 5 % or 10 % decline in annual rainfall, the introduction of agricultural carbon tax would generate substantial reduction in on-farm GHG emissions. With 30 % rainfall reduction, agricultural carbon tax is not likely to bring about considerable emission reduction. The economically optimised land uses are generally sensitive to potential changes. When rainfall reductions appear, there is a clear trend toward reducing cropping area and transiting to pasture. With 5–10% rainfall reductions, increasing agricultural carbon tax with same rainfall reduction leads to the expansion in cropping enterprises. However, with 30 % rainfall reduction, land allocations are not sensitive to agricultural carbon tax. When with declining annual rainfall, in the optimal enterprises more oats-pasture rotations are employed to reduce wheat dominated rotations.

In this study, we developed an eigenvector spatial filtering based spatially varying coefficient (ESF-SVC) model to estimate ground PM2.5 concentration. To generate and analyze the spatiotemporal distribution of PM2.5 concentration in the China's Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, ESF-SVC model which uses a set of satellite remote sensing data, factory locations, and road networks, was fitted at different time scales from December 2015 to November 2016. Comparisons among the ESF-SVC, eigenvector spatial filtering (ESF) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models suggest that the ESF-SVC model with an average annual and seasonal adjusted R2 of 0.684, is 10.3 and 13.8% higher than the GWR and ESF models, respectively. The average annual and seasonal cross validation root mean square error (RMSE) of the ESF-SVC models lower than the GWR and ESF models. PM2.5 concentration distribution maps for annual and seasonal were produced to illustrate YRD region's spatiotemporal characteristics. In summary, an ESF-SVC model offers a reliable approach for PM2.5 concentrations estimation in large area. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Eigenvector spatial filtering; GWR; PM2.5; Spatially varying coefficient; Yangtze river delta region","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Mean square error; Microchannels; Remote sensing; Rivers; Static Var compensators; Geographically weighted regression models; PM2.5; Satellite remote sensing data; Spatial filterings; Spatially varying coefficients; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Spatiotemporal distributions; Yangtze river delta; Beamforming; concentration (composition); eigenvalue; interpolation; particle size; particulate matter; remote sensing; spatial analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; article; China; filtration; geographically weighted regression; neglect; remote sensing; river; China; Yangtze Delta; Spring viremia of carp virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081063586

Huge variation in the capture rates of packaging waste (paper, plastic, metal, composite material and glass) exists in Europe, even between municipalities with similar characteristics, which suggests there is great potential to increase the amount of these materials that can be recovered. In order to assess the environmental impacts linked to higher collection rates, a Life Cycle Assessment model was built that considers the reduced need for virgin materials as the system's loops are closed. An extra 18 million tonnes of waste could be collected annually in Europe if best practice collection strategies were to be deployed, leading to a 13% reduction in greenhouse gas production associated with the packaging and packaging waste. Although high collection performance is crucial for efficient resource use, improving source separation waste collection systems alone will not be enough to achieve recycling targets; material losses must be reduced throughout the value chain, i.e. at the sorting and recycling stages. By evaluating the circularity and environmental implications of current waste management, it can be shown at which points in the system the most improvement needs to be made for each material in order to facilitate the transition towards a circular economy. © 2019 The Authors","Circular economy; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Packaging and packaging waste; Plastic waste; Recycling; Waste collection systems","Artificial life; Collector efficiency; Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Metal recovery; Packaging; Packaging materials; Plastic recycling; Recycling; Source separation; Circular economy; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Packaging waste; Plastic wastes; Waste collection; Waste management; environmental conditions; life cycle analysis; plastic waste; recycling; waste management; article; economic aspect; environmental impact; Europe; greenhouse gas; life cycle assessment; plastic waste; recycling; Europe; packaging; recycling; waste management; Europe; plastic; Europe; Plastics; Product Packaging; Recycling; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077780853

As a case study, the megacity of Tehran in Iran was studied. A key policy challenge in this city is to curb high concentrations of PM2.5 and mitigate the associated adverse impacts. The results demonstrated that in the business as usual case, the spatially averaged primary and secondary PM2.5 concentration in Tehran will increase by 30% in the 2010–2030 period. Adopting certain planned policy scenarios and the corresponding pollutant concentration reductions in Tehran shows that although most of the emission comes from industrial activities around the city, the distribution of the transportation emission sources may play the most effective role in decreasing pollution levels in transport-related energy policies. Next, based on environmental damage costs and abatement costs in different pollution mitigation scenarios, the best (most environmentally cost-effective) scenarios were evaluated. The eco-efficiencies of the energy policies were assessed based on two proxies of environmental impacts: the reduced damage cost as a function of the reduced emission rates of the pollutants and the decreased number of polluted days in the year. In a sample area in which the simulated concentrations were verified by local measurements, the most efficient mitigation scenario would decrease the average concentration of PM2.5 by 35% in 2030 and the number of polluted days by 20%. These findings indicate how far the linear functionality of the damage cost from emission levels may mislead environmental impact assessments. This is due to neglecting the source distribution effects and geographical conditions of the environment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Eco-efficiency; Energy; PM2.5; Tehran megacity","Air pollution; Cost effectiveness; Damage detection; Energy policy; Average concentration; Eco-efficiency; Energy; Environmental effectiveness; Geographical conditions; Megacities; PM2.5; Pollutant concentration; Industrial emissions; abatement cost; atmospheric pollution; cost-benefit analysis; efficiency measurement; energy policy; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; megacity; policy analysis; pollutant source; pollution control; air pollution; article; cost effectiveness analysis; environmental impact assessment; Iran; pollutant; simulation; Iran; Tehran [Iran]; Tehran [Tehran (PRV)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076246146

Moreover, Indochina has convoluted meteorological scales, and regional meteorological conditions dominate the transport patterns of pollutants. This study focused on the impacts of BB emission inventories and atmospheric reanalyses on simulated PM10 over Indochina in 2014 using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Meteorological fields to input to CMAQ were produced by using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulation with the United States National Centers for Environmental Prediction Final (NCEP FNL) Operational Global Analysis or European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts Interim Reanalysis (ERA-interim). The Fire INventory from NCAR (FINN) vl.5 or the Global Fire Emissions Database including small fires (GFED v4.1s) was selected for BB emissions for the air quality simulation. The simulation case with NCEP FNL and FINN vl.5 (FNL + FINN) performed best throughout 2014, including the season when BB activities were intensified. The normalized percentage difference for maximum daily mean PMjo concentrations at Chiang Mai for FNL + FINN and the two simulation cases applying GFED v4.1s for BB emissions (-53% to-27%) was much larger than that between the FNL + FINN and ERA + FINN cases (10%).

However, debate remains about the causes and consequences of this “impact winter.” We perform simulations of the Chicxulub impact with an Earth system model that can simulate the evolution of extreme aerosol loading to quantify the climatic responses to emissions (soot, sulfur, and dust) associated with the impact winter. We show that all impact winter emissions can drastically reduce surface temperature and precipitation. However, only soot emission from impact-driven firestorms is capable of reducing light to below the photosynthetic threshold for many months. Therefore, our results suggest that widespread fires may have been necessary to produce the observed pattern of marine extinction across the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary.

One way to reduce the risk of chloride corrosion is the co-combustion of fuel mixtures in the presence of a mineral additive containing chemical compounds that bind the emitted chlorides. This paper concerns the influence of mineral additives – constituting waste material, on the process of the binding of emitted chlorides. One of these waste materials could be a halloysite, not yet used in power industry. The research has shown its high chloride binding effectiveness, comparable to that of kaolin (known in literature as a mineral additive effectively binding chloride). Moreover, the studies have shown that SRF combustion in the presence of stabilized, dried and granulated sewage sludge, with a 25% mass fraction of sewage sludge, allows reducing chloride emissions.

Complementary to official reported bottomup emission inventories, quantification can be done with an inverse modelling framework, combining atmospheric transport models, prior gridded emission inventories and a network of atmospheric observations to optimize the emission inventories. An important aspect of such a method is a correct quantification of the uncertainties in all aspects of the modelling framework. The uncertainties in gridded emission inventories are, however, not systematically analysed. In this work, a statistically coherent method is used to quantify the uncertainties in a high-resolution gridded emission inventory of CO2 and CO for Europe. We perform a range of Monte Carlo simulations to determine the effect of uncertainties in different inventory components, including the spatial and temporal distribution, on the uncertainty in total emissions and the resulting atmospheric mixing ratios. We find that the uncertainties in the total emissions for the selected domain are 1 % for CO2 and 6 % for CO. Introducing spatial disaggregation causes a significant increase in the uncertainty of up to 40 % for CO2 and 70 % for CO for specific grid cells. Using gridded uncertainties, specific regions can be defined that have the largest uncertainty in emissions and are thus an interesting target for inverse modellers. However, the largest sectors are usually the best-constrained ones (low relative uncertainty), so the absolute uncertainty is the best indicator for this. With this knowledge, areas can be identified that are most sensitive to the largest emission uncertainties, which supports network design. © 2020 Author(s).",,"atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; computer simulation; data inversion; emission inventory; Monte Carlo analysis; network design; numerical model; pollution monitoring; quantitative analysis; uncertainty analysis; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079615750

Melamine is the only precursor in the whole process, and there are no harmful solvents or cross-linking agents used for self-assembly with cyanuric acid, which comes from melamine under hydrothermal treatment. Surpassing the simple hollow carbon nitride tube, this hierarchical hollow structure, which is clearly visualized by 3D electron tomography, offers more contact sites and creates new heterogeneous catalytic interfaces synergistically. Hence, the as-prepared photocatalyst achieves a satisfactory hydrogen yield, ascribed to the large surface area, short charge transfer distance, light scattering, fast mass transfer and suitable bandgap with midgap states. This eco-friendly method provides a new opportunity for designing novel micro-nanostructures with desirable performance in solar-to-chemical energy conversion.

The resulting precursors in liquid phase were substantially homogeneous solid solutions and could directly convert into sinterable garnet powders via pyrolysis. Substituting 35 at.% of Lu3+ for Gd3+ was effective to stabilize the cubic GAG garnet structure and transparent (Gd,Lu)3Al5O12:Ce ceramics were successfully fabricated by vacuum sintering at 1715°C. The ceramic transparency was improved by optimizing the particle processing conditions and the best sample had an in-line transmittance of ~70% at 580 nm (Ce3+ emission center) and over 80% in partial infrared region with a fine average grain size of ~4.5 μm. Transparent (Gd,Lu)3Al5O12:Ce ceramics have a short critical wavelength (&lt;200 nm) and a maximal infrared cut-off at ~6.6 μm. Both the (Gd,Lu)3Al5O12:Ce phosphor powder and the transparent ceramic exhibited characteristic yellow emission of Ce3+ with strong broad emission bands from 490 to 750 nm upon UV excitation into two groups of broad bands around 340 and 470 nm. The photoluminescence and photoluminescence excitation intensities as well as the quantum yield were greatly enhanced via high-temperature densification.

In contrast to regular buildings, NZEBs have interactive and complex energy systems that require synthetical evaluation of their complicated interplay with the grid. Many studies implemented various optimization approaches to improve the NZEBs energy system designed with a global optimal sizing solution. However, the optimal design is often infeasible due to the availability of proper equipment sizing on the markets. In addition, due to the uncertainty caused by different climate conditions, government feed-in-tariff subsidies, and availability of renewable systems, there could exist multiple distinctive design solutions for the same building. Therefore, this study intends to develop a heuristic multiple objectives algorithm based on the glowworm swarm mechanism to refine the optimization of the grid-interactive NZEB design. To validate the proposed method, a case study of the Hong Kong Zero Carbon Building was examined and three design variables (area of the photo-voltage system, installation power of the wind turbine system, and capacity of the thermal energy storage system) were optimized. The results suggest that the optimized design can outperform the baseline design in terms of operating costs and grid energy consumption. In addition, multiple local optima design solutions that represent different design strategies can be identified using the proposed non-linear model. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Glowworm swarm optimization; Grid-interactive NZEBs; Multi-objective optimization; Net-zero energy buildings","Architectural design; Availability; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Multiobjective optimization; Operating costs; Structural design; Complex energy systems; Glowworm swarm optimizations; Grid-interactive NZEBs; Heuristic optimization; Net-zero energy buildings; Optimization approach; Thermal energy storage systems; Wind turbine systems; Zero energy buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076230866

The dispersity of platinum is defined as the distribution density of Pt particles on the surface of carbon supports. In order to exclude the influence of catalyst layer thickness, different platinum dispersity cathode catalyst layers are prepared by mechanical mixing Pt/C with different mass ratios, different Pt loadings with the same amount of Pt and carbon in the MEAs to keep the thickness of catalyst layers consistent. Initial fuel cell performance is much higher with lower Pt dispersity. Oxygen transport resistance is measured through limiting current density method, and the total oxygen transport resistance Rtotal, Fick diffusion resistance RF, and local oxygen transport resistance R are calculated. All of them increase at higher Pt dispersity. Platinum dispersity shows obvious influence both on performance and oxygen transport resistance. Thus, increasing the ratio of platinum particles distributed at the surface of carbon supports and the density of platinum particles on carbon supports can be effective ways to solve the problem of performance loss with low Pt loading at high current densities. © 2019","Catalyst layer thickness; Local oxygen transport resistance; Mass transport resistance analysis; Pt dispersity","Carbon; Catalysts; Oxygen; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Catalyst layer thickness; Cathode catalyst layers; Dispersity; Fuel cell performance; High current densities; Limiting current density; Mass-transport resistance; Oxygen transport; Platinum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076339240

To improve the application, a 2D/3D fluid model is needed to investigate the CO2 conversion mechanisms in the actual discharge geometry. Therefore, the complex CO2 chemical kinetics description must be reduced due to the huge computational cost associated with 2D/3D models. This paper presents a chemistry reduction method for CO2 plasmas, based on the so-called directed relation graph method. Depending on the defined threshold values, some marginal species are identified. By means of a sensitivity analysis, we can further reduce the chemistry set by removing one by one the marginal species. Based on the so-called flux-sensitivity coupling, we obtain a reduced CO2 kinetics model, consisting of 36 or 15 species (depending on whether the 21 asymmetric mode vibrational states of CO2 are explicitly included or lumped into one group), which is applied to a GA discharge. The results are compared with those predicted with the full chemistry set, and very good agreement is reached. Moreover, the range of validity of the reduced CO2 chemistry set is checked, telling us that this reduced set is suitable for low power GA discharges. Finally, the time and spatial evolution of the CO2 plasma characteristics are presented, based on a 2D model with the reduced kinetics. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.","2D model; chemistry reduction; directed relation graph; gliding arc","Carbon dioxide; Directed graphs; Electric arcs; Energy efficiency; Kinetics; Sensitivity analysis; 2-D model; Chemistry reductions; Conversion mechanism; Directed relation graph; Gliding arc; High energy efficiency; Plasma characteristics; Value-added chemicals; Chemical analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080092046

The combination of highly rigid molecular architecture and pretwisted charge transfer states endow these emitters with relatively high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and small energy gap (ΔEST). By tuning the electron-donating capabilities of the donor as well as the amount of donor unit, the photophysical properties of these emitters in films can be systematically regulated, with emissions ranging from green to red.

This study focuses on problems associated with reforestation under extreme continental climatic conditions. The objectives were to assess relative seedling performance (survival and growth) with respect to plantation age, and to analyze the influence of specific climatic factors during the early stages of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) plantations. The study was carried out in reforested areas of the Tujyin Nars region of northern Mongolia on six Scots pine plantations ranging from 5 to 10 years. In each of the six plantations, five 900 m2 permanent sample plots were established and survival rates and growth performance measured annually over 7 years. Results show high variation in survival among the plantations (p &lt; 0.001, F = 29.7). Seedling survival in the first year corresponded directly to the number of dry days in May. However, survival rate appeared to stabilize after the second year. The insignificant variation of height categories throughout the observation period indicated low competition among individuals. Two linear mixed-effect models show that height and radial growth were best explained by relative air humidity, which we consider to be a reliable indicator of site-specific water availability. Insufficient amounts and uneven distribution of rainfall pose a major threat during the first year of plantation establishment. Humidity and water availability are decisive factors for a successful seedling plantation.

A set of methods and tools designed at international level is expected to be transferred to the domestic level in many developing countries, in order to generate information on how these countries contribute to global emissions reduction through local forest landscapes. Using the monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) device as an example, this paper sets out to analyze this knowledge transfer by identifying bottlenecks. It proposes an original analysis that will help to better understand how such knowledge transfers could be improved at the domestic level. Based on empirical case studies related to REDD+ projects in Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, it assesses knowledge transfer and the role of stakeholders involved at multiple levels (global, regional, national and local). For this purpose, we used the Research Integration and Utilization (RIU) model, which is an analytical framework allowing analyses showing how scientific results can be owned, integrated and disseminated to meet specific needs. Results show that there is a weakness in MRV knowledge transfer from global to local levels and back. The MRV knowledge has a strong research background, a weak MRV knowledge integration and a mitigated direct utilization. The RIU model allows us to identify significant weaknesses in the transfer of MRV knowledge, including institutional dysfunction, weak institutional coordination, a lack of integration and reduced utilization of the scientific knowledge produced, despite the creation of coordinating institutions. These weaknesses are due partly to the absence of a common platform between exogenous and endogenous knowledge. To overcome these obstacles, synergies between scientists and indigenous actors should be explored and developed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Forest policy; Knowledge transfer; Monitoring verification and reporting (MRV); REDD+; RIU model","Deforestation; Developing countries; Emission control; Integration; Democratic Republic of Congo; Empirical case studies; Forest policy; Knowledge integration; Knowledge transfer; REDD; Scientific knowledge; Scientific results; Knowledge management; Congo; Deforestation; Developing Countries; Integration; Monitoring; Reduction; Transfer; Utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076930002

In the coastal valleys of central California, the principal objective of soil fumigation has been to confine Verticillium dahliae population densities to levels below the threshold at which yield losses occur. The wide-spread adoption of alternative fumigants has coincided with the emergence of soilborne diseases caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. fragariae and Macrophomina phaseolina. The ability to harness native soil microbiomes to manage plant pathogens remains a promising but relatively unexplored area. Our studies have focused on substrate-mediated changes in soil prokaryote communities with the goal to convert Verticillium wilt-conducive soils to Verticillium wilt-suppressive soils. The effect of broccoli residue and crustacean meal on soil microbiomes and suppression of Verticillium wilt were studied in soils with distinct land-use histories: intense agriculture, transition from pasture to agriculture, and native, undisturbed soil. Regardless of the soil type, the organic inputs significantly reduced V. dahliae microsclerotia and wilt incidence and severity on eggplants in the greenhouse, and these reductions were correlated with an increase in the proportion of known fungal antagonists. Prokaryote communities identified were distinct in the wilt-suppressive soils as compared to the wilt-conducive soils. Three cycles of inputs nearly eliminated the pathogen in all three soil types. This approach was validated in a 12.2 ha commercial lettuce field in Salinas Valley with a known history of severe Verticillium wilt. After an 18-month broccoli-Romaine lettuce-broccoli rotation including amending soil with crustacean meal before each crop, significant reductions in V. dahliae microsclerotia density were achieved. These studies demonstrated the potential for harnessing native soil microbiomes to manage plant pathogens using specific carbon sources that favor fungal antagonists. This approach worked in soils with various land use and disease incidence histories and was validated in a commercial lettuce field in Salinas Valley, California. © 2020 International Society for Horticultural Science.

Carbonate looping is a 2nd generation post-combustion CO2 capture technology using solid sorbents that form carbonates when reacting with CO2. This technology has economic benefits caused by the low efficiency penalty and the low cost of the sorbent. Autothermal continuous operation of this process at high CO2 capture rates has been successfully proven in several pilot plants up to 1.7 MWth. The 1 MWth pilot plant in Darmstadt has been operated for more than 2000â»h with long periods of steady-state conditions, which allows the evaluation of the performance of the reactor system during long-term operation. This paper presents complementary results of these pilot tests focussing on the performance of the carbonator and calciner reactors. A high carbonator efficiency above 80 % is possible in the temperature range of 650-675â»°C with a specific solid inventory above 700â»kg/m2 combined with either a high sorbent looping ratio of 16â»molCa/molCO2 or a high make-up ratio of 0.13 molCa/molCO2. A calcination efficiency of 90 % can be achieved by a calciner space time above 6â»min, if the calciner temperature is 30â»K above the equilibrium temperature at the prevailing CO2 concentration. Heating of the sorbent entering the calciner consumes almost half of the thermal fuel input. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.","Calcium looping; Carbon capture; Carbonate looping; Pilot plant","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Costs; Pilot plants; Sorbents; Sorption; Calcium looping; Carbonate looping; CO2 concentration; Continuous operation; Energy intensive industries; Equilibrium temperatures; Steady-state condition; Temperature range; Calcination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077238146

Addressing both analysis and deliberation, analytic-deliberative processes are increasingly used for complex decision contexts. Yet, there remain significant disagreements about best practices for what constitutes a successful engagement process, be it analytic-deliberative, or otherwise. In response, theoretical frameworks and guidelines have been proposed to inform the design and evaluation of participatory engagement processes broadly. A common critique, however, is that the complexity and inflexibility of existing frameworks can make them inaccessible or impractical for natural resources managers and practitioners to use. Here, we propose a simple yet comprehensive framework for the design and evaluation of analytic-deliberative processes. We trial this framework in the context of an engagement process involving stakeholders and Indigenous peoples across the Canadian province of British Columbia on topics relating to forest carbon mitigation. Our recommendations highlight the importance of involving multiple actors, views and worldviews. We also emphasize the importance of inclusive deliberation that is based on the best available science, but also on other forms of expertise, including lay and traditional knowledge. Perhaps most importantly, our recommendations are consistent with others who call for opening-up analysis, deliberation and appraisal in participatory engagement. This means acknowledging that a one-size-fits-all solution does not always exist, but rather that plural and conditional policy options are often more advised in the context of complex environmental issues.

Although transboundary (i.e., international) transport of pollution to the UK is believed to have an impact on UK pollutant concentrations, large uncertainties remain in these estimates. Therefore, the extent to which emission reductions in neighbouring countries would benefit UK AQ relative to local emission reductions also remains unknown. We have used a back-trajectory model in conjunction with synoptic scale classifications of UK circulation patterns (Lamb Weather Types [LWT]), to quantify the accumulation of nitrogen oxide (NOx = NO2 + NO) emissions in air masses en-route to the UK. This novel method presents a computationally inexpensive and useful method of quantifying the accumulation of pollutants under different circulation patterns. We find the highest accumulated NOx totals occur under south-easterly and southerly flows (&gt;15 μg⋅m−2), with a substantial contribution from outwith the UK (&gt;25%). In contrast, the total accumulated NOx under northerly and westerly flows is lower (∼10 μg⋅m−2), and dominated by UK emissions (&gt;95%). This indicates that European emissions can contribute substantially to UK local-scale pollution in urban areas under south-easterly and southerly flows. The sensitivity of integrated NOx emission totals under different air masses is investigated by modelling future European emission contributions based on emission reduction targets. Under targets set by the European Union, there would be a decrease in accumulated NOx emissions in London under most wind directions except for north-westerly, westerly and northerly flow. The largest benefits to UK AQ from transboundary contributions occur with emission reductions in the Benelux region, due to its close proximity and high NOx emission rates, emphasising the importance of international cooperation in improving local AQ. © 2020 The Authors.

This is of interest because the environmental significance of federal political systems is still contested. We first review the literature on federalism in the context of environmental and climate policymaking, and we show that the effects of federal political systems can be positive or negative (depending on interactions between politics and problem characteristics). We then summarize the two qualitative country studies. By analysing who initiated and coordinated respective policies at what time and why, we show that respective policy changes neither emerged bottom-up nor diffused between provinces/cantons, although the latter are fully responsible for building policies. While most policy changes were triggered by federal and/or European Union interventions, the provinces/cantons usually delayed and/or watered down policy changes to smallest common denominator solutions. Based on these findings we conclude that the building sectors of the two countries became more efficient despite, not because of federalism. Against this background we recommend centralizing building policies, or to engage sub-national actors in national target-setting early on. © 2019 The Authors.

The majority of these efforts have been limited to marine shales, with little work on carbonate systems. Applying similar methods of trace metal analysis on carbonate-dominated rocks may provide valuable insight into the paleoseawater chemistry, such as redox state, and productivity, of ancient carbonate systems. This study evaluates the application of trace metals as paleoproxies in carbonate rocks. Middle-ramp wackestones to grainstones from the “Mississippian Limestone” in the Midcontinent were analyzed using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for both the carbonate-fraction and the bulk-fraction trace metal content. Our data show that productivity proxies, such as Cd and P, are captured within the carbonate-fraction and may reflect seawater chemistry of the system. High Cd, and moderate bionutrient (P, Ni, Zn) enrichments indicate primary productivity in the system, though it is difficult to quantify to what extent. Vanadium, Cr, U, and Mo appear to be primarily associated with the bulk-fraction content and correlate well with Al content, indicating a detrital origin. Furthermore, V, U, and Mo show no significant enrichments, and Mo/Fe ratios correlate with those of shales from a modern oxic shelf. This suggests that anoxic or euxinic conditions in the water column were not present. Trace metal content of carbonate rocks have the potential to be used in paleoenvironmental reconstruction of carbonate systems, though challenges exist such as the lack of comparable carbonate trace metal data, bias of trace metal incorporation pathways into carbonates, and diagenetic alteration. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbonate geochemistry; Carbonate systems; Chemostratigraphy; Mass spectrometry; Mississippian limestone; Paleoenvironment; Redox proxies; Seawater proxies; Trace metal enrichment; Trace metals","Carbonates; Carbonation; Geochemistry; Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; Lime; Limestone; Mass spectrometry; Metal analysis; Metals; Molybdenum; Seawater; Trace analysis; Carbonate system; Chemostratigraphy; Mississippians; Paleo-environment; Redox proxies; Trace metal; Trace metal enrichments; Trace elements; carbonate system; chemostratigraphy; enrichment; limestone; mass spectrometry; paleoenvironment; redox conditions; seawater; trace metal; water chemistry; Midcontinent; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073106301

Given the fact that wastewater treatment plants can generate enormous heat surpluses, this decision gives leeway to couple the wastewater infrastructure with the energy system in order to increase energy efficiency at the system level, allow for power to heat solutions in order to integrate volatile renewable electricity generation and, thus, foster a sustainable energy transition and cleaner production. Yet, the success of these system integrations depends on the availability of energy consumers in proximity of the wastewater treatment plants, and the temporal patterns of energy supply and energy demand. So far, the importance of both temporal and spatial variations in performance of wastewater heat recovery systems have been discussed in literature, but only as separate considerations to date. In order to exhaust the potential of wastewater energy, the combination of both aspects still has to be studied sufficiently, and this paper aims at filling that gap. A three-step methodology is proposed, including an energetic analysis at the wastewater treatment plant, a spatio-temporal analysis of supply and demand in potential supply areas, and an integrated analysis, overlaying the supply and demand profiles. This allows to account for both the proximity of consumers and potential temporal mismatches between supply and demand. The methodology was applied on a case study in Ireland, being able to clearly identify potentials and pitfalls for laying out grids and dimensioning the energy generation systems. It can be concluded, that wastewater energy is a well-suited source of energy to supply baseloads, but the spatio-temporal patterns reveal that both periods of excess wastewater heat potentials as well as additional heating in bivalent systems is required.

FORHYCS is based on the coupling of the hydrological model PREVAH and the forest landscape model TreeMig. In a coupled simulation, both original models are executed simultaneously and exchange information through shared variables. The simulated canopy structure is summarized by the leaf area index (LAI), which affects local water balance calculations. On the other hand, an annual drought index is obtained from daily simulated potential and actual transpiration. This drought index affects tree growth and mortality, as well as a species-specific tree height limitation. The effective rooting depth is simulated as a function of climate, soil, and simulated above-ground vegetation structure. Other interface variables include stomatal resistance and leaf phenology. Case study simulations with the model were performed in the Navizence catchment in the Swiss Central Alps, with a sharp elevational gradient and climatic conditions ranging from dry inner-alpine to high alpine. In a first experiment, the model was run for 500 years with different configurations. The results were compared against observations of vegetation properties from national forest inventories, remotely sensed LAI, and high-resolution canopy height maps from stereo aerial images. Two new metrics are proposed for a quantitative comparison of observed and simulated canopy structure. In a second experiment, the model was run for 130 years under climate change scenarios using both idealized temperature and precipitation change and meteorological forcing from downscaled GCM-RCM model chains. The first experiment showed that model configuration greatly influences simulated vegetation structure. In particular, simulations where height limitation was dependent on environmental stress showed a much better fit to canopy height observations. Spatial patterns of simulated LAI were more realistic than for uncoupled simulations of the forest landscape model, although some model deficiencies are still evident. Under idealized climate change scenarios, the effect of the coupling varied regionally, with the greatest effects on simulated streamflow (up to 60 mmy-1 difference with respect to a simulation with static vegetation parameters) seen at the valley bottom and in regions currently above the treeline. This case study shows the importance of coupling hydrology and vegetation dynamics to simulate the impact of climate change on ecosystems. Nevertheless, it also highlights some challenges of ecohydrological modeling, such as the need to realistically simulate the plant response to increased CO2concentrations and process uncertainty regarding future land cover changes. © 2020 Author(s).",,"canopy architecture; carbon dioxide; catchment; climate change; concentration (composition); environmental stress; forest dynamics; land cover; leaf area index; simulation; streamflow; vegetation dynamics; water budget; Alps; Central Alps; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079769487

Beyond the most discussed biosignature gas O2, only a handful of gases have been considered in detail. In this study, we evaluate phosphine (PH3). On Earth, PH3 is associated with anaerobic ecosystems, and as such, it is a potential biosignature gas in anoxic exoplanets. We simulate the atmospheres of habitable terrestrial planets with CO2- and H2-dominated atmospheres and find that PH3 can accumulate to detectable concentrations on planets with surface production fluxes of 1010 to 1014 cm-2 s-1 (corresponding to surface concentrations of 10s of ppb to 100s of ppm), depending on atmospheric composition and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. While high, the surface flux values are comparable to the global terrestrial production rate of methane or CH4 (1011 cm-2 s-1) and below the maximum local terrestrial PH3 production rate (1014 cm-2 s-1). As with other gases, PH3 can more readily accumulate on low-UV planets, for example, planets orbiting quiet M dwarfs or with a photochemically generated UV shield. PH3 has three strong spectral features such that in any atmosphere scenario one of the three will be unique compared with other dominant spectroscopic molecules. Phosphine's weakness as a biosignature gas is its high reactivity, requiring high outgassing rates for detectability. We calculate that tens of hours of JWST (James Webb Space Telescope) time are required for a potential detection of PH3. Yet, because PH3 is spectrally active in the same wavelength regions as other atmospherically important molecules (such as H2O and CH4), searches for PH3 can be carried out at no additional observational cost to searches for other molecular species relevant to characterizing exoplanet habitability. Phosphine is a promising biosignature gas, as it has no known abiotic false positives on terrestrial planets from any source that could generate the high fluxes required for detection. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.","Anoxic environments; Atmospheric gases; Biosignature; Exoplanet; Phosphine; Spectroscopy","biological marker; phosphine; phosphine derivative; astrobiology; atmosphere; chemistry; devices; gas; procedures; space; spectroscopy; telescope; Atmosphere; Biomarkers; Exobiology; Extraterrestrial Environment; Gases; Phosphines; Spectrum Analysis; Telescopes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079018160

It has become resistant to several herbicides and, therefore, its control is problematic. On the other hand, its seed biology, with little dormancy and short-term viability, can play a major role in reducing its seed bank, which would improve control of this weed. For this reason, knowledge of the emergence patterns of this species entails improvements for its management. In this work seeds from one population of L. rigidum, collected in Northeastern Spain, were distributed and sown in 11 sites across Spain, and its emergence was followed every 2–7 days for two growing seasons (2016-17 and 2017–18). These emergence sequences were compared with previously published thermal time and hydrothermal time based models, and new models were developed afterwards. The hydrothermal time based model did not significantly improve models based solely on thermal time. The accuracy of these newly developed models varied from site to site, but in general, they worked better for Northern locations than for Southern locations. Thus, the experimental sites were split between North and South, and specific models for each region were developed. The model developed for Northern sites worked very well, but the one for Southern sites needs improvement. This works reveals that, with regard to this weed species, probably different models should be developed for different climatic conditions. The model developed with data from Northern sites should be validated with local populations, while the one developed with data from Southern sites will probably need to be revised or newly developed with data from more Southern populations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Gompertz; Hydrothermal time; Log-logistic; LOLRI; Ryegrass; Thermal time; Weibull","climate conditions; ecological modeling; emergence; grass; growing season; herbicide; hydrothermal activity; logistics; model validation; pesticide resistance; seed bank; weed; weed control; Weibull theory; Spain; Lolium; Lolium rigidum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074697209

P. 8580, Douala, Cameroon","The fluorescent nucleobase surrogate M (2-thienyl-3-hydroxychromone fluorophore) when imbedded in DNA opposite an abasic site exhibits a two colour response highly sensitive to environment changes and base composition. Its two colour emission originates from an excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), which converts the excited normal N∗ form into its T∗ tautomer. To get deeper insight on the spectroscopic properties of M in DNA duplexes, quantum chemical calculations were performed on M stacked with different base pairs in model trimers extracted from MD simulations. The photophysics of M in duplexes appeared to be governed by stacking interactions as well as charge and hole transfer. Indeed, stacking of M in DNA screens M from H-bonding with water molecules, which favours ESIPT and thus, the emission of the T∗ form. With A and T flanking bases, the electronic densities in the frontier MOs were localized on M, in line with its effective absorption and emission. In addition, reduction of the free rotation between the thienyl and chromone groups together with the shielding of the dye from water molecules largely explain its enhanced quantum yield in comparison to the free M in solution. By contrast, the localisation of the electron density on the flanking G residues in the ground state and the energetically favorable hole transfer from M to G in the excited state explains the reduced quantum yield of M sandwiched between CG pairs. Finally, the much higher brightness of M as compared to 2-aminopurine when flanked by A and T residues could be related to the much stronger oscillator strength of its S0 → S1 transition and the ineffective charge transfer from M to A or T residues. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Bioinformatics; Charge transfer; Chemical bonds; DNA; Ground state; Photophysics; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; Quantum yield; Effective absorption; Electronic transition; Environment change; Excited-state intramolecular proton transfer; Oscillator strengths; Quantum chemical calculations; Spectroscopic property; Stacking interaction; Excited states",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081136372

This paper intends to comprehensively review the status of the air quality measured in harbour areas. The published studies show a limited number of available air quality monitoring data in harbours areas, mostly located in Europe (71%). Measured concentrations of the main air pollutants were compiled and intercompared, for different countries worldwide allowing a large spatial representativeness. The higher NO2 and PM10 concentrations were found in Europe - ranging between 12 and 107 μg/m3 and 2–50 μg/m3, respectively, while the higher concentrations of PM2.5 were found in Asia (25–70 μg/m3). In addition, the lower levels of SO2 monitored in recent years suggest that current mitigation strategies adopted across Europe were very efficient in promoting the reduction of SO2 concentrations. Part of the reviewed studies also estimated the contributions from ship emissions to PM concentration through the application of source apportionment methods, with an average of 5–15%. In some specific harbour areas in Asia, ships can contribute up to 7–26% to the local fine particulate matter concentrations. This review confirms that emissions from the maritime transport sector should be considered as a significant source of particulate matter in harbour areas, since this pollutant concentrations are frequently exceeding the established standard legal limit values. Therefore, the results from this review boost the implementation of mitigation measures, aiming to reduce, in particular, particulate matter emissions. A review was performed focused on air quality over harbour areas, concluding that shipping activities have a significant contribution to PM and NO2 emissions: the highest concentrations of NO2 and PM10 are found in European harbours, ranging between 12 and 107 μg/m3 and 2–50 μg/m3, respectively, while the highest PM2.5 concentrations were found in Asia, ranging from 25 to 70 μg/m3. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; NO2; PM10; PM2.5; PMF; Ports; Ships; SO2; Source apportionment","Air pollution; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Ports and harbors; Ships; Air quality monitoring; Fine particulate matter; Particulate matter emissions; PM10; PM2.5; Pollutant concentration; Ports; Source apportionment; Air quality; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); environmental impact; particulate matter; port operation; ship handling; source apportionment; air pollution; air quality; Asia; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; Europe; particulate matter; pollutant; seashore; ship; spatial analysis; urban area; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; ship; time factor; traffic and transport; Asia; Europe; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Asia; Environmental Monitoring; Europe; Particulate Matter; Ships; Time Factors; Transportation Facilities",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075512739

However, there is little research on potential decarbonization trajectories unique to SIDS. Here, we argue that insular topology, scale, and economy are distinctive characteristics of SIDS that facilitate overcoming carbon lock-in. We investigate these dimensions for the three islands of Barbados, Fiji, and Mauritius. We find that insular topologies and small scale offer an opportunity for both public transit corridors and rapid electrification of car fleets. The tourism sector enables local decision-makers and investors to experiment with shared mobility and to induce spillover effects by educating tourists about new mobility options. Limited network effects, and the particular economy thus enables to overcome carbon lock-in.

The effects of fuel state on temperature, pressure, turbulent kinetic energy, heat release rate, NO, and soot in the cylinder during the operation of the internal combustion engine were simulated. Ignition occurred faster, and the peak temperature in the cylinder was achieved in shorter time under the supercritical-state fuel injection condition than under the subcritical condition. The cylinder pressures in both states peaked at the same time, but the value of pressure in the supercritical fuel state was larger than that in the subcritical state. Furthermore, the turbulence in the supercritical fuel state was more intense than that in the subcritical state. The intense turbulence was beneficial to fuel and air mixing. NO emission increased, and soot emission decreased in the supercritical fuel state. The results show that supercritical fuel can be fully mixed with air to reduce the local concentration area in the cylinder, improve the combustion performance of the engine, and greatly reduce pollutant emissions. © 2020 by the authors.","Internal combustion engine; Numerical simulation; Subcritical fuel; Supercritical fuel",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081624418

To date, little is known about how the diversity and species interactions of the active rhizomicrobial community change during soil carbon sequestration and what interactions drive these changes. In this study, we used a combination of DNA and stable isotope method to explore correlations between the composition of microbial communities, N transformation, and the sequestration de novo of carbon in soils around Pinus tabuliformis and Quercus variabilis roots in North China. Rhizosphere soils from degraded lands, primary stage land (tree roots had colonized in degraded soil for 1 year), and nature forest were sampled for analyses. The results showed that microbial communities and newly sequestered soil organic carbon (SOC) contents changed with different tree species, environments, and successive stages. The fungal unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances could better show the different microbial species structures and differences in successive stages. Newly sequestered SOC was positively correlated with the bacterial order Rhizobiales (in P. tabuliformis forests), the fungal order Russulales (in Q. variabilis forests), and δ15N. Consequently, the bacterial order Rhizobiales acted as an important taxa for P. tabuliformis root-driven carbon sequestration, and the fungal order Russulales acted as an important taxa for Q. variabilis root-driven carbon sequestration. The two plant species allocated root exudates to different portion of their root systems, which in turn altered microbial community composition and function. The δ15N of soil organic matter could be an important indicator to estimate root-driven carbon sequestration. © Copyright © 2020 Song, Tong, Liu and Li.","13C isotopic tracing; 15N isotopic tracing; carbon sequestration; microbial community; plant–soil interactions; tree roots","DNA; nitrogen 15; organic carbon; soil organic matter; stable isotope; Article; bioinformatics; carbon sequestration; chemical composition; China; controlled study; fungus; microbial community; Micrococcales; nonhuman; Pinus tabuliformis; plant root; Quercus variabilis; Rhizobiales; Rhodospirillales; Russulales; soil analysis; soil microflora; Sphingomonadales; tree",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082551774

Many functional genes have been identified and used to study the genetic potential of microbes to produce and catabolize these organosulfur compounds in different marine environments. Here, we sampled seawater, marine sediment and hydrothermal sediment, and polymetallic sulfide in the eastern Chinese marginal seas and analyzed their microbial communities for the genetic potential to cycle DMSP, DMS, and MeSH using metagenomics. DMSP was abundant in all sediment samples, but was fivefold less prominent in those from hydrothermal samples. Indeed, Yellow Sea (YS) sediment samples had DMSP concentrations two orders of magnitude higher than in surface water samples. Bacterial genetic potential to synthesize DMSP (mainly in Rhodobacteraceae bacteria) was far higher than for phytoplankton in all samples, but particularly in the sediment where no algal DMSP synthesis genes were detected. Thus, we propose bacteria as important DMSP producers in these marine sediments. DMSP catabolic pathways mediated by the DMSP lyase DddP (prominent in Pseudomonas and Mesorhizobium bacteria) and DMSP demethylase DmdA enzymes (prominent in Rhodobacteraceae bacteria) and MddA-mediated MeSH S-methylation were very abundant in Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea sediments (BYSS) samples. In contrast, the genetic potential for DMSP degradation was very low in the hydrothermal sediment samples—dddP was the only catabolic gene detected and in only one sample. However, the potential for DMS production from MeSH (mddA) and DMS oxidation (dmoA and ddhA) was relatively abundant. This metagenomics study does not provide conclusive evidence for DMSP cycling; however, it does highlight the potential importance of bacteria in the synthesis and catabolism of DMSP and related compounds in diverse sediment environments. © Copyright © 2020 Song, Zhang, Liu, Zhong, Zheng, Zhou, Yu, Todd and Zhang.","DMS; DMSP; marginal seas; marine sediment; metagenome; sulfur cycle","dimethyl sulfide; dimethylsulfoniopropionate; genomic DNA; liquid nitrogen; methanethiol; organosulfur derivative; propionic acid; RNA 16S; unclassified drug; agar gel electrophoresis; Alexandrium; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial genetics; biosynthesis; China; DNA extraction; DNA sequence; gene; gene function; gene sequence; genetic analysis; geographic distribution; hydrothermal vent; mddA gene; Mesorhizobium; metabolism; metagenomics; microbial community; mtox gene; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; phytoplankton; protein degradation; Pseudomonas; real time polymerase chain reaction; sediment; spectrophotometry; water temperature; Yellow Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080859635

SIF is produced by plants alongside photosynthesis so it is generally thought to provide a more direct probe of plant status. We analyze inter-annual variations of SIF over the US Corn Belt using a seven-year time series (2010–2016) retrieved from measurements of short-wave IR radiation collected by the Japanese Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT). Using survey data and annual reports from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), we relate anomalies in the GOSAT SIF time series to meteorological and climatic events that affected planting or growing seasons. The events described in the USDA annual reports are confirmed using remote sensing-based data such as land surface temperature, precipitation, water storage anomalies and soil moisture. These datasets were carefully collocated with the GOSAT footprints on a sub-pixel basis to remove any effect that could occur due to different sampling. We find that cumulative SIF, integrated from April to June, tracks the planting progress established in the first half of the planting season (Pearson correlation r > 0.89). Similarly, we show that crop yields for corn (maize) and soybeans are equally well correlated to the integrated SIF from July to October (r > 0.86). Our results for SIF are consistent with reflectance-based vegetation indices, that have a longer established history of crop monitoring. Despite GOSAT's sparse sampling, we were able to show the potential for using satellite-based SIF to study agriculturally-managed vegetation. © 2019 The Authors","Crops; Fluorescence; GOSAT;; Yield","anomaly; chlorophyll; GOSAT; land surface; photosynthesis; pixel; remote sensing; soil temperature; water storage; yield response; Corn Belt; United States; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074269853

A finite volume method (FVM) with staggered grids is used for numerical solution. Equations of continuity, momentum, energy, ideal gas state and kinetic equations with thermodynamic and thermo-chemical information of chemical species are solved using the numerical method of SIMPLE. The convective terms are discretized using Power Law scheme (PLS). The under-relaxation factor dependent on temperature has been utilized to solve the chemical kinetic equations. In this research, by increasing the diluent mass fraction, the mass fraction of the fuel is diminished to the same extent. Therefore, the sum of the diluent and fuel mass fraction values remains constant. The results depicted that as the amount of CO2 diluent in the fuel increases, the total lift-off height and flame length decreases linearly, and the maximum temperature in the combustion chamber becomes smaller than that at the inlet of the chamber. When the concentration of CO2 increases in the fuel, the temperature changes become negligible at the inlet of the combustion chamber. By using the CO2 diluent, shorter combustion chambers can be used. While the diluent is used, the increase in the length of the combustion chamber will not have any effect on the NOx emissions reduction. Therefore, the more concentration of the diluent is used, the smaller the combustion chamber can be selected. Moreover, by increasing the diluent, NOx pollutant decreases in the combustion chamber. © 2019","Combustion; Diluent; Laminar; non-premixed; NOx; SIMPLE","Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Emission control; Equations of state; Finite volume method; Fuels; Integral equations; Kinetic energy; Kinetic theory; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Numerical methods; Temperature; Chemical kinetic equations; Diluent; Laminar; Maximum temperature; Non-premixed; SIMPLE; Temperature changes; Under-relaxation factors; Combustion chambers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075986715

As a result, nations and states that are interested in reducing the carbon intensity of their economies will need to find ways to reduce the emissions of their existing industrial capacity. Industrial carbon capture provides one potential mechanism for reducing the carbon intensity of existing industrial facilities, however, an economically feasible capture system requires that the captured CO2 be integrated into a system of transport and storage with income generated either through tax credits, enhanced oil recovery (EOR), or both. Here, we present a cash-flow model of an integrated system with industrial capture, pipeline transport, and EOR, and we parameterize the model with data from Louisiana. Given a $50/bbl oil price, an integrated capture, transport and EOR system that uses ethylene oxide production, ammonia production, or natural gas processing as sources is predicted to have a net present value of about $500 million; hydrogen-based capture has a cash flow of −$214 given the same assumptions. Further, we find that the recent 45Q Tax Credit expansion has a positive impact on the cash flow of the system but does not change the overall profitability of the systems under the specified assumptions such that without the tax credits natural gas processing, ammonia production and ethylene oxide production-based capture systems remain cost-effective, while hydrogen-based capture remains unprofitable with or without the tax credit. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"Ammonia; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Enhanced recovery; Ethylene; Gas producers; Industrial emissions; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Petrochemical plants; Petrochemicals; Petroleum refineries; Petroleum transportation; Taxation; Ammonia production; Enhanced oil recovery; Industrial capacity; Industrial facilities; Integrated systems; Natural gas processing; Pipeline transport; Potential mechanism; Industrial economics; capital flow; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; employment; financial system; profitability; tax system; Louisiana; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075214968

This approach is especially important for alpine plants in which the relative roles of topographic complexity and nonclimatic or stochastic factors vary across spatial scales. Methods: We examined the structure of alpine plant communities across elevation gradients in the White Mountains, California. Using community climatic niche means (CCNMs) and measures of community dissimilarity, we explored the relation between community composition and elevation gradients at three scales: the mountain range, individual peaks, and within elevation contours. Results: At the mountain range scale, community turnover and CCNMs showed strongly significant relations with elevation, with an increase in the abundance of cooler and wetter-adapted species at higher elevations. At the scale of single peaks, we found weak and inconsistent relations between CCNMs and elevation, but variation in community composition explained by elevation increased. Within the elevation contours, the range of CCNMs was weakly positively correlated with turnover in species identity, likely driven by microclimate and other site-specific factors. Conclusions: Our results suggest that there is strong environmental sorting of alpine plant communities at broad scales, but microclimatic and site-specific, nonclimatic factors together shape community turnover at finer scales. In the context of climate change, our results imply that community–climate relations are scale-dependent, and predictions of local alpine plant range shifts are limited by a lack of topoclimatic and habitat information. © 2019 Botanical Society of America","alpine ecology; beta diversity; climatic niche mean; community assembly; elevation gradient; Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments; GLORIA; Great Basin; species turnover; White Mountains","alpine environment; climate change; community composition; microclimate; plant community; turnover; United States; White Mountains [California-Nevada]; biodiversity; California; climate change; ecosystem; microclimate; plant; Biodiversity; California; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Microclimate; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074990185

The dominant fish species in these ecosystems are cold-water salmonids, which play a central ecological role in lake ecosystems, where they are often exposed to size-selective fisheries that truncate their size and age distributions, making them potentially vulnerable to exploitation and environmental perturbations. Here, we address the combined effects of climate-induced water temperature increase (using regionally downscaled climate models based on the RCP-4.5 and RCP-8.5 climate scenarios together with an air-to-water temperature model) and gillnet harvesting, over the period from 1950 to 2100, on the somatic growth, demography and vulnerability of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.), using an eco-genetic individual-based model. The model captures successive annual life-history events, including the key processes of size-dependent mortality, age- and size-dependent maturation described by a probabilistic reaction norm, temperature-dependent growth, size-dependent reproduction and density-dependent recruitment. Our model predicts that higher water temperatures will increase the somatic growth of Arctic charr, leading to larger body size at age and increased stock biomass: for RCP-8.5, we predict an 80% increase in stock biomass in the year 2100 relative to the year 2000 in the absence of fishing. Interestingly, this potential increase in biomass in future climate scenarios will be partially masked by harvesting: for a fishing mortality of 0.3 year−1, we predict a mere 40% increase in stock biomass in 2100 relative to 2000. Despite the predicted increase in stock biomass, yield will increase substantially only when fishing mortality is low. In addition, climate warming will accentuate the age-truncation effect of harvesting, which will target younger individuals, including immatures, thus elevating the vulnerability of the population to environmental perturbations. Synthesis and applications. Our model-based analyses highlight the combined effects of climate change and size-selective fishing, emphasizing the emerging vulnerability of fish populations to multiple stressors.

The work in this paper demonstrates the significant benefits of the use of Photovoltaic Arrays for disaster response and compares their use to the normally deployed generators which are commonly deployed in emergency response. In this paper, we consider the case of India, which has a large population and is highly vulnerable to natural disasters. Society is seriously affected by the power outage caused during disaster, because electricity is the most common and basic infrastructure that supports modern life Most of today‘s global service depend on electric power from basic lighting to advanced facilities such as communications and medical services. Modern life deteriorates without electrical power even for few hours thus a rapid delivery of emergency power is a crucial aspect of a successful response to disasters. In this paper, we focus on the use of PV based generators for the Indian sub-continent and show that portable solar energy systems are especially effective when used to deliver critical services promptly. Renewable power also minimizes fossil fuel usage which in turn helps reduce carbon emissions reducing climate change. Solar technology can be provided in a mobile format, e.g. Rapid-roll which unfurls solar arrays like a carpet behind a truck, These array can be rapidly deployed to generate energy in the region of catastrophe delivering power rapidly to a mobile clinic with 120 beds/ Such a system is capable of an average of 11KWh of energy especially when connected to batteries that can store 24KWh for non-sunshine hours. The mobile solar power can also provide refrigeration for medical supplies, water filtration systems and communication equipment that are required during a recovery process. In the case when recovery lasts a long period of time, generators will need large amount of fuel which gives solar power an advantage. In India fuel emissions are increasing at the fastest rate for 7 years and even though India has the solar target of 100GW by 2022 only 28GW has been installed since 2011. Given that India is world‘s most disaster affected country and among the top 15 countries suffering power outages and abundant sunshine that solar power is highly suited for disaster relief operations providing significant relief and helping the country realize its solar mission target.

The modelling approach integrates air pollution dispersion and exposure assessment, including treatment of the locations and time activity of the population in three microenvironments, namely, residential, work and transport, based on national demographic information. The approach also includes differences between urban centre and suburban areas of London by taking account of the population movements and the infiltration of PM2.5 from outdoor to indoor. The approach is tested comprehensively by modelling ambient air concentrations of PM2.5 at street scale for the year 2008, including both regional and urban contributions. Model analysis of the exposure in the three microenvironments shows that most of the total exposure, 85%, occurred at home and work microenvironments and 15% in the transport microenvironment. However, the annual population weighted mean (PWM) concentrations of PM2.5 for London in transport microenvironments were almost twice as high (corresponding to 13–20 μg/m3) as those for home and work environments (7–12 μg/m3). Analysis has shown that the PWM PM2.5 concentrations in central London were almost 20% higher than in the surrounding suburban areas. Moreover, the population exposure in the central London per unit area was almost three times higher than that in suburban regions. The exposure resulting from all activities, including outdoor to indoor infiltration, was about 20% higher, when compared with the corresponding value obtained assuming inside home exposure for all times. The exposure assessment methodology used in this study predicted approximately over one quarter (−28%) lower population exposure, compared with using simply outdoor concentrations at residential locations. An important implication of this study is that for estimating population exposure, one needs to consider the population movements, and the infiltration of pollution from outdoors to indoors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Infiltration; Microenvironment; OSCAR; Particulate matter; Population movement; Population-weighted concentration","Atmospheric movements; Housing; Infiltration; Pulse width modulation; Air pollution dispersion; Ambient air concentration; Exposure assessment methodology; Microenvironments; OSCAR; Particulate Matter; Population movement; Transport microenvironment; Air pollution; ambient air; concentration (composition); dispersion; infiltration; megacity; numerical model; particulate matter; pollutant transport; pollution exposure; prediction; air pollution; ambient air; article; England; microenvironment; particulate matter; population exposure; suburban area; work environment; air pollutant; England; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; indoor air pollution; particle size; particulate matter; England; London [England]; United Kingdom; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Air Pollution, Indoor; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; London; Particle Size; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075900486

Analyzing these climate variables in isolation without considering their interdependencies might result in severe underestimation of their combined effects. In addition, the assumption of linearity between temperature and precipitation does not represent the real physical processes that govern these climate variables. In this study, copula functions are used to describe the joint behaviour of temperature and precipitation across 15 ecozones of Canada at multiple temporal scales. The Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) relation is investigated using daily records to quantify changes in extreme precipitation with temperature increases. In addition, using historical records, dating back to 1910s, temporal changes in the dependence structure across southern Canada are analyzed using a non-stationary framework. Results show clear signs of accelerated warming and wetting over northern Canada while strong evidence of hot and dry conditions is found in the Prairie provinces. Analyses over seasonal and monthly scales indicate increases in warm-wet and hot-dry conditions in winter and summer, respectively. Non-stationary analyses reveal shifts towards warm and wet climate conditions for the majority of southern Canada. Considerable deviations from the theoretical CC scaling rate of 6.8% is observed for extreme precipitation over parts of Canada with super-CC scaling rates observed in northern Canada and sub-CC scaling rates in the majority of southern Canada. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"air temperature; extreme event; historical record; precipitation (climatology); probability; temporal variation; thermodynamics; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076829239

Recent studies have emphasized that increased plant water-use efficiency can ameliorate the impact of drought due to climate change. However, there is a potentially counterbalancing impact due to the increased leaf area. We investigate long-term trends (1951 to 2015) of observed streamflow in the Southeastern United States (SE US) and quantify the contribution of major drivers of streamflow changes using single factor climate modeling experiments from Community Land Model Version 5 (CLM5). The SE US streamflow observations do not exhibit a trend, which is in agreement with the CLM5 control experiment. Using the factorial set of CLM5 experiments, we find that increased leaf area under elevated CO2 leads to decreased runoff and completely counteracts increased runoff due to water-use efficiency gains under elevated CO2 and land-use change. ©2020.

Resilience was employed as an explanatory concept and governing tool, signalling a professed transition in the municipality’s understandings to an altered climate episteme–or what they have called, a ‘New Normal’. This article focuses on how public framings of resilience were used by the City of Cape Town to signal divorce from conventional approaches to climate and water. It contrasts conventional framings of a Holocene world, with those of a posited ‘mentality of the Anthropocene’ in order to elaborate this ostensible shift in mentality. Although this case study illustrates how public governors are finding utility in resilience as a term to facilitate explanation of their operating context, decisions and responses, contested and transitional mentalities elaborate why the municipality initially failed to anticipate, perceive and respond the drought. This article thereby highlights the cognitive tensions and practical challenges of transition for professionals patterned by conventional techno-managerial approaches, to a way of thinking more in line with reflexive and adaptive approaches anticipated to be necessary in an Anthropocene world. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Anthropocene; Cape Town drought; mentalities; Resilience; water resilience","Anthropocene; climate change; drought; Holocene; public-private partnership; urban area; Cape Town; South Africa; Western Cape",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065661698

Although all three datasets showed similar climatic patterns during each PDO phase, they showed distinct intensities for circulation and precipitation variables. The mean low frequency flow propagation over the South Pacific during negative and positive PDO phases reached central-eastern South America with opposite signals, contributing to the modulation of the local climate. During the negative PDO phases, the northerly flow over South America is intensified, while during the positive phase it is weakened. NCEP-NCAR reanalysis I, in comparison with JRA-55 and ERA-40 values, always indicates the strongest signal for circulation and precipitation variables. NCEP-NCAR reanalysis I meridional wind at the low-level jet area was about 5 and 12% larger than the respective JRA-55 and the ERA-40 values. For the positive and negative PDO phases, only NCEP-NCAR and ERA-40 high-level zonal wind anomalies showed divergent (positive PDO) and convergent (negative PDO) patterns close to 140° W at equatorial latitudes of the Pacific Ocean, respectively. This one indicated distinct representations of the positioning of Walker cells in the three reanalysis datasets. GPCC dataset, NCEP-NCAR, JRA-55, and ERA-40 reanalysis showed, in general, the dipole precipitation pattern over eastern South America, with signs of changes between the central-eastern and southeastern areas during PDO reversal phases. Over the central-eastern South American region, NCEP-NCAR precipitation is, on average, 57% larger than GPCC values, and 35 and 46% larger than JRA-55 and ERA-40 values, respectively. The observed patterns of anomalies for different PDO phases appeared in all reanalysis datasets, leading us to conclude that the physical meaning is independent from the datasets. Even considering the JRA-55 climate signal over South America associated with the PDO influence as the weakest one, the ability of JRA-55 to calculate monthly precipitation provided the highest linear correlation coefficient values in tropical areas, leading us to consider this dataset as the most reliable for the studied area. © Copyright © 2020 Silva, Silva, Ambrizzi, Drumond and Patucci.","ERA-40; GPCC; JRA-55; NCEP-NCAR I; PDO; South America climate","ERA-40; GPCC; JRA-55; Linear correlation coefficient; Pacific decadal oscillation; Physical meanings; Precipitation patterns; South America; Tropics; climate modeling; data set; flow modeling; frequency analysis; jet flow; numerical model; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; weather forecasting; zonal wind; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079668756

This hypothesis is examined in the context of the countries and regions of the European Union using a hierarchical three-level analysis on the third wave (2011–2012) of the European Quality of Life Survey for a sample of EU citizens. The ecological state is operationalized using a climate change performance index. NO2 emissions data at the regional level are used as a measure of GHG emissions for regions of the European Union. The findings seem to support the hypothesis that individuals across ecological states keep “fiddling” on climate change issues as a trade-off between environmental and economic considerations. However, the mental well-being of the well-off is being eroded in moderate ecological states compared to good ecological states, which is a call for government to stop “fiddling” and act on climate change issues. © Copyright © 2020 Signoretta, Bracke and Buffel.","ecological state; EQLS; European Union; greenhouse gas emissions; mental well-being; regional analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092551949

The role of international governmental and non-governmental environmental organizations in ensuring environmental human rights was identified. The main international legal treaties governing the reduction of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and the introduction of renewable energy were analyzed. Attention was drawn to the need to strengthen the role of international governmental and non-governmental organizations within the framework of oversight and monitoring functions regarding the possibility of influencing specific states that do not comply with the provisions of signed and ratified international conventions. It was concluded about the necessary adjustment of the vector of development of environmental rights protection instruments in the direction of its world globalization. To date, the process of world globalization must be shifted from a purely economic to a social and environmental one. The current global concept of supporting the development of alternative energy sources needs to undergo some changes. Considering that the environmental problem is universal and, although to varying degrees, it still applies to every individual, regardless of country or nationality of a person, the obligation to protect the environment should be universal and not only provided by government bodies of sovereign states, but also by international governmental organizations. The position of the necessity of establishing of international financing funds which would be implemented by their Member States on a permanent basis as a percentage of their budget is being maintained.

Regional efforts are indispensable for reducing automobile emissions, especially considering the diversity in regional transportation systems. Existing studies of automobile emissions have focused on nationwide transportation systems or differences in city size without considering regionality and long-term changes in vehicle occupancy. In this study, we decomposed national and regional automobile emissions in Japan between 1990 and 2015 by the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method. Statistical data that took vehicle occupancy into account were used. Results showed that nationwide vehicle occupancy increased (due to increased vehicle size and vehicle ownership), which increased emissions by 15.2% compared to 1990 levels. In highly populated regions, fuel efficiency decreased earlier than other regions thanks to the strengthening of ordinances regarding air pollution. In Western Japan, which includes less-populated prefectures, the rising popularity of mini-vehicles resulted in increased vehicle ownership and a decrease in occupancy but also led to improvements in fuel economy. To reduce automobile CO2 emissions, it will be essential to improve fuel efficiency and to increase vehicle occupancy through mechanisms, such as ridesharing and vehicle right sizing. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cross-regional comparison; Index decomposition analysis; Multiplicative decomposition; Transportation sector; Vehicle seating capacity","Carbon dioxide; Efficiency; Fuels; Cross-regional comparison; Divisia index method; Index decomposition analysis; Multiplicative decomposition; Regional transportation; Road transport sectors; Transportation sector; Transportation system; Fuel economy; atmospheric pollution; automobile; carbon emission; comparative study; decomposition analysis; factor analysis; long-term change; road traffic; traffic emission; transportation; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075877930

The ability to quantify agricultural GHG and implement practices to mitigate its emissions is of great significance. Optimal GHG mitigation practices in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, China, have not been well documented. In this study, historical (2000–2014) and projected (2015–2049) methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from paddy-upland crop rotations were simulated at a county scale using the denitrification–decomposition model. The results demonstrated (1) historical mean emissions of CH4, N2O, and global warming potential (GWP) were 158.6 kg-C ha−1 year−1, 0.75 kg-N ha−1 year−1, and 22.15 Tg CO2-eq year−1 in the study area (1 Tg = 1012 g); (2) CH4 emission rates significantly increased, while there was no significant change in N2O under projected RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios, and RCP8.5 induced 10% more CH4 than RCP4.5; (3) marginal flooding coupled with reduced-tillage practice was the optimal strategy to mitigate GHG emissions due to its lowest GWP. This study would provide insight into the agricultural GHG emissions, as well as the impact on climate change. Also, a theoretical basis for policymaking would be provided by this study. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","climate change; conservation tillage; DNDC; greenhouse gas; paddy-upland rotation","Agriculture; Chemical industry; Climate change; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Landforms; Nitrogen oxides; Soil conservation; Agricultural greenhouse; Climate scenarios; Conservation tillage; Decomposition model; DNDC; Global warming potential; Middle and lower reaches of the yangtze rivers; Optimal strategies; Greenhouse gases; agricultural emission; carbon emission; climate change; conservation tillage; crop rotation; emission control; greenhouse gas; policy making; China; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077888461

Low temperature is one of the major abiotic stresses limiting its growth and plantation regions. A protocol for ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS) induced mutations from embryogenic callus and selection of seashore paspalum mutant line with enhanced cold tolerance was established in the study. Treatment of embryogenic callus with 5 h of 0.8% EMS resulted in an approximate 50% survival rate of callus, which was used for inducing mutations from embryogenic callus of seashore paspalum. One mutant line (A6) with enhanced cold tolerance was selected and identified from about 10,000 regenerated plantlets. A6 had lower TEL50 (the temperature resulted in 50% electrolyte leakage) and higher survival rate than its wild type (WT) plants after 7 days of cold acclimation. Antioxidant defense system was responsive to low temperature in both genotypes, while higher CAT activity was maintained in A6 than in WT after 3 days of cold treatment. Among four DREB1/CBF genes induced by cold treatment, higher levels of DREB1A, DREB1D, DREB1E transcripts were observed in A6 than in WT. Free amino acids concentrations in response to cold treatment also showed difference between A6 and WT. The results suggest that the response of DREB1/CBFs expression, CAT activity, and free amino acids concentrations to cold is differentially altered in A6 compared with WT, which is associated with the enhanced cold tolerance in A6. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Cold tolerance; Embryogenic callus; EMS mutagenesis; Seashore paspalum; Turfgrass","Amino acids; Electrolytes; Temperature; Antioxidant defense system; Cold acclimations; Cold tolerance; Electrolyte leakage; Embryogenic callus; Ems mutagenesis; Ethyl methane sulphonate; Turfgrass; Beaches; Amino Acids; Callus; Electrolytes; Low Temperature; Processing; Survival; Tolerance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075053855

The greenhouse gas (GHG) impact and 30-year lifecycle costs (LCC) of a scenario including four primary strategies for transitioning to carbon-neutrality were analyzed; scaling building energy efficiency was determined to reduce GHG emissions by 12% with $10 million LCC savings from business as usual, switching the campus fleet to electric vehicles would reduce GHG emissions by 0.4% with $2 million LCC savings, switching from on-site natural gas combustion to geothermal heat pumps would reduce GHG emissions by 15% with a $15.5 million LCC premium, and procuring renewable electricity through a power purchase agreement with a new-build renewable generator would eliminate the remaining 73% of GHG emissions with a $1.7 million LCC premium. In total, achieving a carbon-neutral campus would increase the 30-year LCC of UD's energy systems by 2.4%, from $211.8 million to $216.9 million.

A two-part analysis is conducted through systematic coding and textual analysis of interview transcripts and policy documents. Firstly, an analysis based on climate justice framings reveals that, whilst national governmental actors predominantly adopt an international framing of climate justice, non-state actors have increasingly adopted vulnerability, human rights and transformational framings of justice, thereby supporting the theory that polycentricity is widening the space for voicing diverse framings. Secondly, a polycentric governance-based analysis reveals that several institutional barriers limit the ability of non-state actors to operationalize these framings, particularly capacity and resource constraints, limits of scale and scope, changing legislation and the unequivocal power held by the state. Hence, Pakistan’s overarching climate change strategy prioritizes justice between countries, while obscuring domestic inequalities, poverty and vulnerability, which are only addressed by non-state actors through isolated activities rather than in a coordinated manner within national policy. This finding suggests that polycentric governance can diversify climate discourse, but also that the intergovernmental climate regime may reinforce the nation state’s international framings of justice at the expense of domestic justice concerns. Key policy insights Non-state actors within the polycentric climate governance regime in Pakistan are increasingly adopting framings of climate justice beyond those of the nation state, thereby bringing attention to issues of domestic poverty, inequality and vulnerability. Differences in power between state and non-state actors limit the extent to which different justice issues can be addressed through nationally and internationally-led climate policy. There are limitations to the ability of national-level polycentric climate governance regimes, when embedded in intergovernmental negotiations, to engage in redistributing power and advocating for different framings and dimensions of justice being raised by local actors. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate justice; framings; international governance; Pakistan; polycentric governance","climate change; environmental justice; governance approach; policy making; Pakistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077861784

Thus, it becomes essential to prevent the excessive emission or to develop new technologies to avoid successive accumulation of CO2. Biological systems in nature have the capability to fix the atmospheric CO2 but in the urban and industrially developed areas where a rate of CO2 emission is very high, the biological system cannot capture and utilize the whole CO2. Various chemicals and synthetic materials with CO2 absorbing property are not eco-friendly or these are very expensive. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is the fastest known enzymes containing zinc in its active site, convert CO2 to bicarbonate ions. It is one of a potent biological catalyst for CO2 conversion. Thus, in order to reduce the level of CO2 the biocatalytic properties of microbial CA can be exploited. Literature survey showed that, more than fifty different microbial CAs have been explored for CO2 sequestration. The major advantages of CA to sequester CO2 are economic viability and carbonation of CO2 at a low concentration. Despite the higher rate of catalysis, the stability of CA is a major challenge for its industrial application. These difficulties have been partly solved by immobilizing the CA onto the bio-inspired surface, biochar, alginate, polyurethane foam and variety of nano-textured materials. A combination of enzyme and material which jointly capture and convert the CO2 into either carbon-rich compound of economic value or reduced carbon derivatives will plausibly energize the CO2 utilization. In this review, we discussed the recent advances in chemical and materials used for CO2 capture, their advantages and limitations, utilization of microbial CA for CO2 conversion, and its various applications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CaCO3; Capture; Carbonic anhydrase; CO2; Global warming; Immobilization","Biological systems; Biomimetics; Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Carbonic anhydrase; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Radioactive waste vitrification; Textures; Absorbing properties; Biocatalytic properties; Biological catalysts; CaCO3; Capture; Low concentrations; Synthetic materials; Textured materials; Carbon dioxide",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075381205

Trees planted on the roadside are known to reduce particulate matter pollution by about 25%. In an urban ecosystem, especially in a metropolitan city such as Delhi, roadside trees are constantly exposed to air pollution. We, therefore, evaluated the effect of air pollution on a common Indian roadside tree, Neem (Azadirachta indica), and its associated microbes in areas with high and low levels of particulate matter (PM) pollution in Delhi. We hypothesized that alteration in the air quality index not only influences plant physiology but also its microbiome. A 100-fold increase in the number of epiphytic and 10–100 fold increase in endophytic colonies were found with 1.7 times increase in the level of pollutants. Trees in the polluted areas had an abundance of Salmonella, Proteus and Citrobacter, and showed increased secondary metabolites such as phenols and tannins as well as decreased chlorophyll and carotenoid. The number of unique microbes was positively correlated with increased primary metabolites. Our study thus indicates that, alteration in air quality affects the natural micro-environment of plants. These results may be utilized as sustainable tools for studying plant adaptations to the urban ecosystem.

Cauvery River, in the southern part of India, has been in the midst of such conflict for the last 130 years. Historically, the conflict has been about the right to use water and the states/provinces in conflict have used the water from the river for agricultural purposes. Due to industrialization in the late 1980s and increasing population, water availability in the region has become stressed. Climate change has exacerbated the region's water availability issues. Faltering rainfall has caused unrest in the region, and the traditional methods of water sharing are dwindling under political pressure. Without a climate change strategy, the governments of these states will never be able to solve this complex issue at hand. The Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) is applied to understand the nuances of this conflict. It models the preferences of the decision-makers (the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka) and the common option (goal) they can reach to potentially solve the conflict.

The multi-scale input-output method is combined with structural decomposition analysis in the present work to analyze the changes and driving forces of a city's consumption-based carbon emissions. It is for the first time to include import as one of the major underlying socioeconomic variables. A case study is carried out to analyze Shanghai's consumption-based carbon emissions in 2007 and 2012. According to the results, the consumption-based carbon emissions of Shanghai have risen by 32.82% since 2007, which grew much faster than the production-based carbon emissions. The carbon emissions trade of Shanghai has almost doubled during the period. While Shanghai's net domestic carbon emissions import has increased by 20%, the net international carbon emissions export has decreased by half. The domestic import change and consumption per capita change were the main drivers for the growth in consumption-based carbon emissions of Shanghai during 2007–2012. At the meantime, technology change and international import change helped a lot to reduce carbon footprint of Shanghai. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint change; Consumption-based carbon emissions; Driving force; Multi-scale input-output analysis; Shanghai; Structural decomposition analysis","Economic analysis; Emission control; Planning; Carbon emissions; Driving forces; Input output analysis; Shanghai; Structural decomposition analysis; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074392725

This paper has an opportunity to investigate the mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of the Permian and Jurassic bituminous coals and associated non-coals from two underground coal mines in the Shanbei Coalfield (Northeast Ordos basin), Shaanxi Province, North China, based on the analysis of X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma atomic-emission spectrometry (ICP-AES/MS), and scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). The Jurassic and Permian coals have similar chemical features excluding ash yield, which is significantly higher in the Permian coals. Major mineral matters in the Jurassic coals are quartz, kaolinite, and calcite. By contrast, mineral assemblages of the Permian coals are dominated by kaolinite; and apatite occurring in the middle section’s partings. The Jurassic coals are only enriched in B, whereas the Permian coals are enriched in some trace elements (e.g., Nb, Ta, Th, and REY). Boron has a mixed inorganic and organic association which may be absorbed by organic matter from fluid (or groundwater) or inherited from coal-forming plants. Additionally, climatic variation also plays an important role. As for the Permian coals, kaolinite and apatite as the major carriers of elevated elements; the former were derived from the sedimentary source region (the Yinshan Oldland and the Benxi formation) and later precipitated from Ca-, and P-rich solutions. We deduced that those elevated elements may be controlled by the source rock and diagenetic fluid input. The findings of this work offered new data to figure out the mechanism of trace element enrichment of coal in the Ordos basin. © 2020 by the authors.

Strategic forest inventories are difficult to compile over large areas and are often quickly outdated or spatially incomplete as a function of their long production cycle. As a consequence, automated approaches supported by remotely sensed data are increasingly sought to provide exhaustive spatial coverage for a set of core attributes in a timely fashion. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the integration of current remotely-sensed data products and pre-existing jurisdictional inventory data to map four forest attributes of interest (stand age, dominant species, site index, and stem density) for a 55 Mha study region in British Columbia, Canada. First, via image segmentation, spectrally homogenous objects were derived from Landsat surface-reflectance pixel composites. Second, a suite of Landsat-based predictors (e.g., spectral indices, disturbance history, and forest structure) and ancillary variables (e.g., geographic, topographic, and climatic) were derived for these units and used to develop predictive models of target attributes. For the often difficult classification of dominant species, two modelling approaches were compared: (a) a global Random Forests model calibrated with training samples collected over the entire study area, and (b) an ensemble of local models, each calibrated with spatially constrained local samples. Accuracy assessment based upon independent validation samples revealed that the ensemble of local models was more accurate and efficient for species classification, achieving an overall accuracy of 72% for the species which dominate 80% of the forested areas in the province. Results indicated that site index had the highest agreement between predicted and reference (R2 = 0.74, %RMSE = 23.1%), followed by stand age (R2 = 0.62, %RMSE = 35.6%), and stem density (R2 = 0.33, %RMSE = 65.2%). Inventory attributes mapped at the image-derived unit level captured much finer details than traditional polygon-based inventory, yet can be readily reassembled into these larger units for strategic forest planning purposes. Based upon this work, we conclude that in a multi-source forest monitoring program, spatially localized and detailed characterizations enabled by time series of Landsat observations in conjunction with ancillary data can be used to support strategic inventory activities over large areas. © 2019","Biomass; Land cover; Landsat; Monitoring; Random forests; Species; Volume","biomass; forest inventory; land cover; Landsat; modeling; monitoring; remote sensing; time series; British Columbia; Canada; Columbia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080943216

Tillman Water Reclamation Plant (DCTWRP) in a 2.5-year pilot study. Six soil columns were operated between February 2016 and November 2018 treating DCTWRP effluent. The goal was to reduce the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the effluent to lower concentrations in order to increase the allowable volumes for reclamation. An integrated part of the study was to evaluate the biodegradability of organics in different waters using biodegradable (BDOC) analyses. BDOC has been used in similar research in the past, and in this research, BDOC was an accurate predictor of column performance in removing organic carbon. The total organic carbon in tertiary DCTWRP effluent was reduced from 7 to 10 mg/L to 0.9 to 2.5 mg/L through a process train beginning with ozonation of the tertiary effluent, followed by biological activated carbon, and finally to the soil column effluents. Additional short-term treatments including reverse osmosis, additional ozonation, and low-pressure UV were also evaluated. The soil columns removed N-nitrosodimethylamine to detection limits. Finally, results from SAT and BDOC were used to develop a kinetic model to predict biodegradation of organic matter of wastewater origin through a soil aquifer system. Practitioner points: Soil aquifer treatment is often used in indirect potable reuse projects to protect aquifers. Soil aquifer treatment was simulated in six pilot columns for 2.5 years. Columns were fed tertiary effluent from a nutrient-removal type-activated sludge plant. Effluent TOC was reduced from 10 mg/L to 0.9 to 2.5 mg/L, and nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) was also removed.

Deploying renewable energy sources in these areas could present an opportunity for a remarkable and rare complementarity between energy security, energy access, and climate change mitigation. This article examines how energy trilemma plays out in mobilizing private climate finance for renewable rural electrification in Indonesia. Analysis of relevant documents combined with interviews at local and national levels reveals that multiple barriers persist constraining the mobilization of private climate finance to support renewable rural electrification in Indonesia. In turn, this has led to difficulties with managing the tensions and reaching the complementarity of the three key energy objectives. The article concludes with some recommendations for moving forward. © 2020 by the authors.","Barriers; Climate finance; Energy access; Energy poverty; Energy trilemma; Indonesia; Renewable energy","alternative energy; electricity; energy planning; energy policy; energy resource; management practice; poverty; rural electrification; Indonesia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081651605

The resulting high degree of chemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO), confirmed by X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, is shown to produce a better electrical double layer (EDL) capacitance, as shown by cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements. Moreover, a good reduction yield of the carbonaceous 3D-scaffold seems to be achievable even when the precursor of molybdenum oxide is added to the pristine slurry in order to get the hybrid rGO-MoO2 compound.

Although these are likely to increase in future due to climate change, households are also taking up various coping measures to deal with these extreme climatic shocks from their past experience. Hence, assessing the impact of these covariate shocks and identifying the determinants of various adaptation options have relevant policy implications in the context of designing a disaster mitigation policy. This study aims to assess farmers' vulnerability to climatic variability and climate change taking both irrigated and rain-fed regions of the country. Vulnerability analysis was done using an econometric method of ‘vulnerability as exposure to uninsured risk’ (VER) in order to test the determinants of household income loss due to covariate and idiosyncratic risk. Based on a survey of 400 farmers in Odisha, India, results show that households that access weather-related information reduce their level of vulnerability to climate change and improve their overall adaptive capacity. To address climatic vulnerability, policymakers need to emphasize farmers’ responses in different regions and can plan climate adaptation strategies based on the vulnerability assessment of entire regions. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptive capacity; Climate change; exposure; India; Odisha; sensitivity; vulnerability","adaptive management; climate change; cyclone; drought; household income; sensitivity analysis; strategic approach; vulnerability; India; Odisha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065661146

These dynamic structural changes accompanied by the emission color changes are governed by distinct π-stacking modes and hydrogen-bonded patterns. The shear-induced luminescent color change from yellow to blue is found to occur above the shear strain of 390 % at which the shear stress is 2.4×105 Pa as determined from dynamic viscoelastic measurements. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this study, we investigate whether compactness as a common urban development strategy, climate regulation as an example for an ecosystem service, and vascular plant species richness as a measure of biodiversity form a synergistic relationship or whether trade-offs exist. We use a genetic algorithm to optimize the spatial allocation of three types of land cover blocks in a stylized urban region. These blocks are categorized as high-, low-density, or park blocks, depending on the proportion of green and built-up cells within each block. We systematically vary landscape composition at the block level, but keep city size constant. Our most important finding is that the relationships of target functions can shift between trade-off and synergy, and this is shaped by landscape composition. For example, we found a trade-off between species richness and urban compactness in landscapes with large proportions of high-density areas and parks, while they have a synergistic relationship in low-density landscapes. Such dependencies of trade-offs and synergies on landscape composition need to be explored further, which may help address the wickedness of urban planning problems. © Copyright © 2020 Schwarz, Hoffmann, Knapp and Strauch.","biodiversity; climate regulation; optimization; trade-off; urban form",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081221615

Seismic geometries coupled with facies and biostratigraphy from the wells are used to delineate mid-Cretaceous (Aptian-Turonian) depositional sequences and paleogeography. Beneath these sequences, 400-1000 m (1300-3300 ft) of Lower Cretaceous sedimentary rocks underlie the modern shelf. They thicken along strike to the southwest, implying a southern sediment source. Aptian to Cenomanian sediments were deposited in shelf to nearshore settings. A landward movement of the depocenter and a shift toward facies indicative of deeper paleodepths marks a 107-yr mid-Cretaceous transgression, within which we identify five sequences. A composite maximum flooding surface (MFS) within the uppermost of these retrogradational units is associated with the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary and ocean anoxic event 2. Shingled, lower Turonian seismic reflections prograde across the outer shelf, downlapping onto the composite MFS, and are truncated by a mid-Turonian sequence boundary. The Upper Cretaceous section thickens seaward and along strike to the northeast, implying a northern source and little Late Cretaceous accommodation beneath the modern shelf. Mid-Cretaceous strata offshore Maryland are likely sand-prone, considering their proximity to the correlative fluvial facies of the onshore Potomac Group.

In modern plants, water availability is the strongest environmental predictor of Δleaf across sites that experience relatively uniform and low concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere (pCO2). Growth chamber experiments show Δleaf of modern plants can also be sensitive to changing pCO2. However, over geologic time, it is uncertain how Δleaf has responded to shifts in pCO2 and precipitation. To address this problem, we collected sediment (rock) samples from fossil leaf sites that represent a range of pCO2 values from ∼200 to 900 ppmV, over 40 degrees of latitude from New Mexico to the High Arctic, and 40 million years spanning the Late Cretaceous to the Oligocene. For each site, the carbon isotope composition of atmospheric CO2 (δ13Catm), pCO2, mean annual precipitation, and mean annual temperature were constrained from independent proxies. From sediment samples, we extracted long-chain n-alkanes (biomarkers derived from plant wax). We then measured the carbon isotope ratios of sediment-derived n-C29 and n-C31 alkanes to calculate Δleaf. Results show a negative correlation between Δleaf and pCO2 even after controlling for mean annual precipitation. The Δleaf response to pCO2 is small (−0.3 ± 0.09‰/100 ppmV), suggesting plants are adjusting internal leaf CO2 concentrations to atmospheric pCO2 concentrations, likely by optimizing leaf gas-exchange to maximize carbon intake and minimize water loss in response to environmental conditions. Similar to previous studies of geologic sediments and living plants, Δleaf was also positively correlated with water availability and, to a lesser extent, sensitive to plant type and possibly altitude. As a result, the Δleaf – pCO2 relationship in the geologic past may be more complex than observed in modern studies and therefore, precludes its use as a pCO2 proxy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Arctic; Cretaceous; Fossil leaves; Leaf waxes; n-Alkanes; North America; Organic geochemistry; Paleobotany; Paleogene","alkane; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; correlation; Cretaceous; fossil; isotopic fractionation; leaf; organic geochemistry; paleobotany; Paleogene; plant; precipitation (chemistry); wax; Arctic; New Mexico; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076401057

Even higher rates of change are projected in CMIP5 climate model ensemble runs for some Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. The speed of ecological processes such as leaf physiology, demography or migration can differ from the speed of changes in environmental conditions. Such mismatches imply lags between the actual vegetation state and the vegetation state expected under prevailing environmental conditions. Here, we used a dynamic vegetation model, the adaptive Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (aDGVM), to study lags between actual and expected vegetation in Africa under a changing atmospheric CO2 mixing ratio. We hypothesized that lag size increases with a more rapidly changing CO2 mixing ratio as opposed to slower changes in CO2 and that disturbance by fire further increases lag size. Our model results confirm these hypotheses, revealing lags between vegetation state and environmental conditions and enhanced lags in fire-driven systems. Biome states, carbon stored in vegetation and tree cover in Africa are most sensitive to changes in CO2 under recent and near-future levels. When averaged across all biomes and simulations with and without fire, times to reach an equilibrium vegetation state increase from approximately 242 years for 200ppm to 898 years for 1000ppm. These results have important implications for vegetation modellers and for policy making. Lag effects imply that vegetation will undergo substantial changes in distribution patterns, structure and carbon sequestration even if emissions of fossils fuels and other greenhouse gasses are reduced and the climate system stabilizes. We conclude that modelers need to account for lag effects in models and in data used for model testing. Policy makers need to consider lagged responses and committed changes in the biosphere when developing adaptation and mitigation strategies. © 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Removing these subsidies would yield local economic and environmental benefits and help implement climate targets set in the Paris Agreement. However, adverse effects on vulnerable households can make subsidy reforms politically difficult. To inform policy design, we assess the distributional impacts of energy subsidy reform using Ecuadorian household data and an augmented input-output table. We find that subsidy removal without compensation would be regressive for diesel and LPG, progressive for gasoline, and approximately neutral for electricity. We then analyze how freed up public revenues could fund in-kind and in-cash compensation schemes to mitigate income losses for poor households. Our results indicate that removing all energy subsidies and increasing the cash transfer program, Bono de Desarrollo Humano (BDH), by nearly US$ 50 per month would increase the real income of the poorest quintile by 10% while leaving more than US$ 1.3 billion for the public budget. Finally, we conduct interviews with local policy makers and experts to identify two reform options that are progressive and considered feasible: eliminating subsidies on gasoline while increasing the BDH and replacing universal LPG subsidies with targeted LPG vouchers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Distributional impacts; Ecuador; Energy subsidy reform; Input-output analysis; Political feasibility; Revenue recycling","Budget control; Economic analysis; Gasoline; Distributional impacts; Ecuador; Energy subsidies; Input output analysis; Political feasibility; Liquefied petroleum gas; demand analysis; energy efficiency; energy market; energy policy; feasibility study; gas trade; input-output analysis; local government; subsidy system; Ecuador",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076860217

The southeastern United States has received elevated Hg deposition, yet no studies have evaluated tree ring Hg in this region. Here, we quantify Hg accumulation and isotopic composition in tree rings collected in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia. Cores were collected from three individuals of three tree species—white oak (Quercus alba), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), and pitch pine (Pinus rigida)—within the northern, central, and southern areas of the Park (n = 27 cores). The cores were analyzed for Hg content in 10-year increments, with some cores dating back to the early 1800s. Overall, tree ring Hg concentrations (ranging from below detection to 4.4 ng/g) were similar to other studies and varied between species, with pitch pine having higher concentrations than the deciduous species. The most notable feature of the tree ring Hg time series was a peak that occurred during the 1930s through 1950s, coinciding with the use of Hg at a local industrial facility. Atmospheric modeling indicates that potential emissions from the plant likely had a stronger impact on the southern region of the Park, consistent with the latitudinal gradient in tree ring Hg concentrations. Mass-dependent and mass-independent fractionation of Hg isotopes suggests contributions from both regional anthropogenic and local industrial sources during this period. This study demonstrates the potential usefulness of tree ring dendrochemistry for identifying historical sources of atmospheric Hg exposure. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

Decarbonizing the electric sector is one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce emissions and can help decarbonize other sectors with increased electrification. While renewable energy and energy efficiency have grown significantly in recent years due to technology cost reductions, state policies, and federal tax incentives, our rate of emissions reduction does not go far enough. Our analysis shows that a well-designed national Low Carbon Electricity Standard (LCES), Renewable Electricity Standard (RES), or increasing carbon price can help get the U.S. on a pathway for decarbonizing the power sector by 2050. The most cost-effective strategy for reducing emissions in the near-term is through the increased deployment of wind and solar, regardless of the policy. How much the generation mix shifts to low-carbon resources is a function of the stringency of the policy. These policies can also spur the development of low-carbon electricity in parts of the country that are not as far along in their transition to a clean energy economy. Allowing a wide range of carbon-free and low-carbon resources to compete against each other could deliver the most low-carbon electricity at the lowest cost and help broaden support for these policies. © 2019","Carbon pricing; Climate change; Coal plant retirements; Electricity modeling; Low carbon electricity standards; Public health",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077662770

Using time-series satellite data products and different unit values, the spatially explicit Ecosystem Service Value (ESV) of six eco-regions of the Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve (SBR), India, has been calculated for four reference years, viz. 1973, 1988, 2002 and 2013. The maximum ESV (million US$ year1) is provided by the mangrove forest (2292–44468), followed by water surface (65–4244), cropland (26–3938), and sparse vegetation cover (0–326). The total ESV (million US$ year1) of Sundarbans is estimated to be 16629.5, 20175.7, 19733.4, and 16761.3 for 1973, 1988, 2002, and 2013 respectively. The regulation of gas and climate, raw material production, and cultural ecosystem services are entirely dependent on the mangrove ecosystem, while the waste treatment, cultural, and water regulation services are found to be highly sensitive to the changes in water bodies. The food production and biodiversity services exhibiting higher sensitivity to the changes in cropland, water regulation and soil formation and retention services show higher sensitivity to the changes in mixed vegetation cover. The current study has thoroughly evaluated the sensitivity and response behavior of six ecoregions of Sundarbans. The outcome of this study will enable the decision-makers, planners, as well as researchers to adopt necessary action plans for strengthening and protecting the natural resources of this biosphere reserve. © 2019 The Authors","Carbon sequestration; Land use change; Mangrove; Remote sensing; Sundarbans",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100683156

The approach to use a high resolution regional ocean model to analyze spawning sites is new and provides more details about crucial physical factors than a global low resolution model can. The model is evaluated with respect to temperature and salinity along the Norwegian coast during the last decades and shows acceptable agreement with observations. However, the model does not take into consideration biological or evolutionary factors which also have impact on choice of spawning sites. Our results from the downscaled RCP4.5 scenario suggest that the spawning sites will be shifted further northeastwards, with new locations at the Russian coast close to Murmansk over the next 50 years, where low temperatures for many decades in the last century were a limiting factor on spawning during spring. The regional model gives future temperatures above the chosen lower critical minimum value in larger areas than today and indicates that spawning will be more extensive there. Dependent on the chosen upper temperature boundary, future temperatures may become a limiting factor for spawning habitats at traditional spawning sites south of Lofoten. Finally, the observed long-term latitudinal shifts in spawning habitats along the Norwegian coast the recent decades may be indirectly linked to temperature through the latitudinal shift of the sea ice edge and the corresponding shift in available ice-free predation habitats, which control the average migration distance to the spawning sites. We therefore acknowledge that physical limitations for defining the spawning sites might be proxies for other biophysically related factors. © Copyright © 2020 Sandø, Johansen, Aglen, Stiansen and Renner.","climate change; downscaling; Northeast Arctic cod; shift; spawning site",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089583463

In global environmental programs and projects aimed at supporting sustainable land use in developing countries, learning is often promoted but without explicit learning goals. The focus may be on capacity building and community participation, and on testing policy tools, rather than on collaborative social learning. In this study, we looked behind the rhetoric of learning in the Kalimantan Forests and Climate Partnership (KFCP), a large demonstration project for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) in Indonesia. The novelty of such mechanisms, linked to international forest carbon outcomes, means that learning lessons provides a rationale for REDD+ pilot activities. We used a qualitative approach to examine the nature and type of learning that occurred in the KFCP. While the stated project aims were to support policy experimentation and apply learning, the project design was highly technical, and project decision-making did not explicitly encourage joint problem solving. Despite the project's shortcomings, we identified that learning did occur by the end of the project in ways that were different to the initial goals. Our findings suggest that flexibility and openness in project design and implementation can enable different local actors to define shared learning agendas in ways that are meaningful for them. Designing and implementing environmental projects, and learning goals within them, should attend to the needs and aspirations of those who will have to live with their long-term consequences. Learning should be integrated into international environmental programs and projects at all levels, including for policy and funding bodies, rather than focusing on local capacity building and similar project ‘benefits’. Interviewees’ eagerness to learn suggests that building approaches to social learning into program design has the potential to yield opportunities for learning beyond REDD+ to other forms of policy experimentation and governance innovations. © 2019 The Authors","Environmental governance; Experimentation; Indonesia; Land use change; Learning; REDD+","capacity building; deforestation; environmental degradation; experimental study; governance approach; land use change; local participation; machine learning; Borneo; Indonesia; Kalimantan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076208480

These are generally conserved in germplasm banks and may pose a useful tool to counteract the effects of climate change. In order to determine the actual resource that such varieties constitute, this research has carried out a genetic identification, a morphological characterization, and an analysis of the grape musts obtained from four autochthonous varieties (Cañocazo, Castellano, Mantúo de Pilas, and Palomino Fino). This genetic analysis has allowed the identification of autochthonous varieties with different genotypes. However, all of them had similar phenotypic characteristics in terms of high hair density in adult leaves. With respect to the physicochemical composition of the musts, significant differences have been observed between the autochthonous varieties, with respect to the control variety of Palomino Fino. Nevertheless, all of them have exhibited an adequate physicochemical composition to produce quality white wines. For all of the above reasons, these local varieties should be considered suitable for cultivation in areas with warmer and drier climates, such as Andalusia (Spain). © 2020 by the authors.","Autochthonous variety; Simple sequence repeat analysis; Vitis vinifera; Warm climate",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078991677

The electrical grid is exposed to an increase in fault probability because its infrastructure was designed considering historical frequencies of extreme events occurred in the past. In this respect, to ensure future energy plans and securing services is of great relevance to determine and evaluate the new zones that may be under risk and its relation to critical infrastructures for such extreme events. In this regard, the electrical distribution system is one of the key critical infrastructures since it feeds the others and with the future plans of zero-emissions (leading to the electrification of transport, buildings, renewable energies, etc.) will become even more important in the short term. In this paper, a novel methodology has been developed, able to analyze flood hazard maps quantifying the probability of failure risk of the electrical assets and their potential impacts using a probabilistic approach. Furthermore, a process to monetize the consequences of the yielded risk was established. The whole method developed was applied to the Barcelona and Bristol case study cities. In this way, two different examples of application have been undertaken by using slightly different inputs. Two main inputs were required: (1) the development of accurate GIS hazard flooding models; and (2) the location of the electrical assets (i.e., Distribution Centers (DCs). To assess and monetize the flood risk to DCs, a variety of variables and tools were required such as water depths (i.e., flood maps), DCs' areas of influence, fragility curves, and damage curves. The analysis was performed for different return periods under different scenarios, current (Baseline) and future (Business As Usual (BAU) rainfall conditions. The number of DCs affected was quantified and classified into different categories of risk, where up to 363 were affected in Barcelona and 623 in Bristol. Their risk monetization resulted in maximums of 815,700 € in Barcelona and 643,500 € in Bristol. Finally, the percentage of risk increases when considering future rainfall conditions (i.e., BAU) when calculated, resulting in a 2.38% increase in Barcelona and 3.37% increase in Bristol, which in monetary terms would be an average of a 22% increase. © 2020 by the authors.","City resiliency; Electrical distribution network; Flooding; GIS model; RESCCUE project; Risk Assessment","accuracy assessment; distribution system; electrification; extreme event; flood frequency; flooding; GIS; infrastructure; probability; rainfall; risk assessment; smart grid; water depth; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Bristol [Bristol (ADS)]; Bristol [England]; Catalonia; England; Spain; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081251823

The reduction of the emissions from the different activities carried out by mankind is crucial to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. One of the most significant activities is users' behaviour within buildings, particularly the use of Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning systems. Modifying users' behaviour patterns to guarantee acceptable thermal conditions inside buildings could lead to considerable energy saving percentages, and adaptive thermal comfort models could be an opportunity to achieve important savings. For this reason, this study analyzes the potential to apply adaptive thermal comfort models to use artificial air-conditioning systems by modifying setpoint temperatures. The analysis was conducted in five major European cities (Barcelona, Berlin, Bern, Rome, and Vienna) and in five climate change scenarios in the year 2050. The results showed that, in general, the energy saving achieved by adaptive strategies was larger in the cities with a greater cooling demand. Also, in both Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) considered, the energy saving were decreased in the cities of Barcelona and Rome, with values lower than those of the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) scenarios considered, whereas in the cities of Berlin, Bern, and Vienna, the saving in the RCP scenarios is greater than those in the other scenarios. © 2020 by the authors.","Adaptive thermal comfort; Building; Climate change; Energy consumption; HVAC system; RCP scenarios; Setpoint temperature; SRES scenarios",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080869682

However, the strategy to achieve thermal comfort in offices tends towards the adaptive approach, since users manually open windows, control the operation of the air-conditioning systems, and perform adaptation actions in order to achieve adequate levels of well-being. This research develops the adaptive comfort control implemented model (ACCIM), which dynamically handles the setpoint temperatures based on the limits of adaptive comfort, in three representative climatic zones of the Spanish territory, in both the present scenario and future scenarios. This is carried out by following a methodology based on the phases of (i) analysis of climatic zones, (ii) model construction, (iii) data collection, (iv) simulations in the present scenario, (v) simulations in future scenarios, and (vi) analysis of the results of a theoretical model and of a real-life model. Not only do the results indicate that it is possible to reduce the energy demand, by using adaptive setpoint temperatures, up to 69.91% for the least restrictive category and of 31.34% in the category that has the highest level of expectation of the users, but they also show the variations in demand that would occur in possible future climatic scenarios. The application of the study in a real-life case achieves minimum differences of between 3% and 10%, thereby validating the prediction model. © 2019, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adaptive comfort; climate change; energy demand; performance simulation","Adaptive control systems; Air conditioning; Energy management; Office buildings; Thermal comfort; Adaptive comfort; Adaptive thermal comfort; Climatic scenarios; Comparative studies; Energy demands; Performance simulation; Set-point temperatures; Theoretical modeling; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068312318

Global environmental change, including land transformation and contamination, is causing concerning insect diversity loss, articulated in the companion review Scientists' warning to humanity on insect extinctions. Yet, despite a sound philosophical foundation, recognized ethical values, and scientific evidence, globally we are performing poorly at instigating effective insect conservation. As insects are a major component of the tapestry of life, insect conservation would do well to integrate better with overall biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. This also involves popularizing insects, especially through use of iconic species, through more media coverage, and more inclusive education. Insect conservationists need to liaise better with decision makers, stakeholders, and land managers, especially at the conceptually familiar scale of the landscape. Enough evidence is now available, and synthesized here, which illustrates that multiple strategies work at local levels towards saving insects. We now need to expand these locally-crafted strategies globally. Tangible actions include ensuring maintenance of biotic complexity, especially through improving temporal and spatial heterogeneity, functional connectivity, and metapopulation dynamics, while maintaining unique habitats, across landscape mosaics, as well as instigating better communication. Key is to have more expansive sustainable agriculture and forestry, improved regulation and prevention of environmental risks, and greater recognition of protected areas alongside agro-ecology in novel landscapes. Future-proofing insect diversity is now critical, with the benefits far reaching, including continued provision of valuable ecosystem services and the conservation of a rich and impressive component of Earth's biodiversity. © 2020 The Authors","Climate change; Conservation action; Conservation strategies; Habitat management; Human well-being; Species extinction","agroecology; alternative agriculture; biodiversity; climate change; environmental risk; metapopulation; spatiotemporal analysis; stakeholder; transformation; Hexapoda",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079430114

Therefore, optimization methods based on the application of computational algorithms are essential to determine solutions that meet multi-objective criteria and so highly optimized to be on the Pareto frontier. In this work, a procedure for the optimization of existing buildings using genetic algorithms is presented. Building energy simulations conducted in the dynamic regime using EnergyPlus are coupled with an Active Archive Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (aNSGA-II type). Using a residential building as a benchmark, this procedure is employed to evaluate the best retrofitting interventions for 19 European cities with different climates. The criteria taken into account in the optimization procedure are: the reduction in the annual specific energy demand, the decrease in the construction and installation costs, the reduction in the annual energy operating costs and the reduction in the greenhouse gas emissions. The results show the most advantageous energy retrofitting interventions fulfilling the criteria for the different geographical sites. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate conditions; Energy efficiency; EnergyPlus; Genetic algorithm; Multi-objective optimization; nZEB","Climate change; Cost reduction; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Gas emissions; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Operating costs; Retrofitting; Building energy simulations; Climate condition; Computational algorithm; EnergyPlus; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; nZEB; Optimization procedures; Residential building; Multiobjective optimization; algorithm; containment; energy efficiency; genetic algorithm; greenhouse gas; installation; multiobjective programming; optimization; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076002994

The concept of ECVs, developed by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) program of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), has been broadly adopted in worldwide science and policy circles Besides being a climate change indicator, the global SST field is an essential input for atmospheric models, air-sea exchange studies, understanding marine ecosystems, operational weather, and ocean forecasting, military and defense operations, tourism, and fisheries research. It is, therefore, critical to understand the errors associated with SST measurements from both in situ measurements and satellite observations. The customary way of validating a satellite SST is to compare it with in situ measured SSTs. This method, however, will have inaccuracies due to uncertainties involving both types of measurements. A triple collocation (TC) error analysis can be implemented on three mutually independent error-prone measurements to estimate the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of each measurement. In this study, the error characterization for the Pathfinder SST version 5.3 (PF53) dataset is performed using an extended TC (ETC) method and reported to be in the range of 0.31 to 0.37 K. These values are reasonable, as is evident from corresponding very high (~0.98) unbiased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. © 2020 by the authors.","Error characterization; Pathfinder SST; Root-mean-square error; Sea surface temperature; Triple collocation","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Climate models; Ecosystems; Errors; Mean square error; Signal to noise ratio; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Uncertainty analysis; Error characterizations; Pathfinder SST; Root mean square errors; Sea surface temperature (SST); Triple collocation; Oceanography",Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080855147

Programs and policies at different levels are continuing to promote new RES farms, posing a relevant challenge to regional planners and administrators: how to manage landscape transformation and territorial fragmentation to find a really effective sustainable arrangement for these kinds of technologies? Most effects induced by RES (land-use change, land take, diminishing aesthetic values, loss of habitat quality), without a doubt, depend on the location and the spatial pattern of the plants, the relative distance between them, the extension of secondary infrastructures and their technical characteristics. This work takes part in the debate, originating from the need to establish a monitoring system for this kind of new territorial transformation and discusses the implementation of a sprinkling fragmentation index (SPX) in order to assess the current regional settlement structure of RES farms. Our case study concerns the Basilicata region (in Southern Italy), a very low-density area which over the last decade has undergone a relevant increase in the installation of RES technologies, not supported by an effective planning framework. The evolution of the regional energy system has been strongly influenced both by incentive policies and by (weak) urban and territorial planning policies. This approach could be a valuable contribution both in identifying a fragmentation threshold beyond which the expected negative impacts outweigh the benefits, and in providing a useful procedure for the management of future installations. © 2020 by the authors.","Basilicata region; Fragmentation; Low density; RES; Sprinkling","agricultural management; alternative energy; analytical framework; climate change; energy crop; infrastructural development; territorial planning; Basilicata; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082830672

The adsorption isotherms of the ACFs studied differ widely in terms of adsorption affinities as well as maximum loadings. Cation and anion exchange capacities (CEC and AEC) at pH 7, as well as point of zero net proton charge (PZC), were identified as good indicators for understanding of each adsorbent's behavior towards the perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) in their anionic state. Maximum loadings of the two PFAS are in all cases equal to or lower than the AEC of the ACFs. The superposition of hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic attraction between PFAS anions and positively charged sites of ACF leads to exceptionally high adsorption affinity (Kd up to 108 L/kg). In this respect, positive charges created by proton adsorption to π-electron-rich regions on the basal plane of carbon are more important than basic oxygen-containing groups. The effect of inorganic ions on adsorption of PFAS is variable and is also influenced by the surface chemistry of the ACFs. Dissolved natural organic matter did not significantly affect PFAS adsorption most likely due to size exclusion exerted by the micropores of the ACFs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Activated carbon felts; Anion exchange capacity; PFOA; PFOS; Surface chemistry","Activated carbon; Adsorption isotherms; Felt; Felts; Hydrophobicity; Negative ions; Polyvinyl alcohols; Surface chemistry; Activated carbon felt; Anion exchange capacity; Dissolved natural organic matters; Electrostatic attractions; Hydrophobic interactions; Perfluorinated alkyl substances; PFOA; PFOS; Adsorption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072014856

The levels of SO2, NO, NO2, O3, H2S, benzene, PM10, PM2.5, CO, benzo(a)pyrene and metals, obtained between 2005 and 2017 from the air quality monitoring network across Camp de Tarragona County, were temporally and spatially determined. Health impacts were evaluated using the AIRQ+ model. Finally, the burden of disease was assessed through the calculation of Years of Lost life (YLL) and Years Lost due to Disability (YLD). In general terms, air quality was good according to European quality standards, but it did not fulfil the WHO guidelines, especially for O3, PM10 and PM2.5. Several decreasing (NO, NO2, SO2, PM10 and benzene) and an increasing (O3) temporal trend were found. Correlation between unemployment rate and air pollutant levels was found, pointing that the economic crisis (2008–2014) was a factor influencing the air pollutant levels. Reduction of air pollutant levels (PM2.5) to WHO guidelines in the Camp de Tarragona County would decrease the adult mortality between 23 and 297 cases per year, which means between 0.5 and 7% of all mortality in the area. In this County, for lung cancer, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to levels of PM2.5 above the WHO threshold limits, DAYLs were 240 years. This means around 80 DALYs for 100,000 persons every year -between 2005 and 2017. Population attributable fraction (PAF) and burden of disease (DALYs) methodologies are suitable tools for regional and national policymakers, who must take decisions to prevent and to control air pollution and to analyse the cost-effectiveness of interventions. © 2019","Air quality; AIRQ+ model; Burden of disease; Camp de Tarragona County; DALYs; Population attributable fraction","Air pollution control; Benzene; Cost effectiveness; Disease control; Nitrogen oxides; Population statistics; Pulmonary diseases; Air quality monitoring networks; Camp de Tarragona County; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; DALYs; Disability adjusted life years; Ischemic heart disease; Population attributable fractions; Spatial and temporal trends; Air quality; benzene; benzo[a]pyrene; nitrogen oxide; ozone; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); health impact; health risk; particulate matter; pollution exposure; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; air quality standard; Article; cerebrovascular accident; chronic obstructive lung disease; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; health impact assessment; ischemic heart disease; long term exposure; lung cancer; mortality; particulate matter; pollutant; priority journal; remote sensing; Spain; spatiotemporal analysis; unemployment; adult; air pollution; cerebrovascular accident; chronic obstructive lung disease; cost of illness; environmental exposure; female; heart muscle ischemia; human; lung tumor; male; Catalonia; Spain; Tarragona [Catalonia]; Tarragona [Tarragona (PRV)]; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cost of Illness; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Myocardial Ischemia; Particulate Matter; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Spain; Stroke",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075860288

The environmental conditions, such as the air temperature and solar radiation, have a complex relationship with the heating and cooling power requirements of residential buildings. In this study, the power consumption of climate control systems (air conditioners, fans, electric heaters) in all locations in Mexico were determined (187,719 rural and 4,525 urban locations), which were classified into three climate regions (extremely hot, mild, and tropical). Subsequently, the optimal insulation thickness of the walls and roofs was determined, and occurrence maps of five different insulation materials (expanded polystyrene, extruded polystyrene, glass wool, rock wool, and polyurethane) were established. Moreover, spatial data mining was conducted with the Geographic Information System (GIS) and databases of the main construction materials; the method includes the heating degree day and cooling degree day parameters (HDD and CDD, respectively). The results show that 19% of the power consumption in the residential sector is intended for climate control systems (13% for urban and 6% for rural households), whereas 95% of households in Mexico do not have thermal insulation. The estimated electrical power consumption of climate control systems is 4.5 times the electricity consumption of the entire residential sector. Finally, an insulation system for all existing and projected houses until 2030 is presented that could realize an accumulated power savings of 94.72 TWh, which correspond to 44.67 MM tons CO2. © 2019","Building material; Cooling degree day; Energy saving; Heating degree day; Insulation; Mexico","Air conditioning; Building materials; Control systems; Data mining; Electric power utilization; Energy conservation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Housing; Insulation; Mineral wool; Oil field equipment; Polystyrenes; Potential energy; Power control; Thermal insulation; Wool; Yarn; Complex relationships; Cooling (heating) degree day; Electrical power consumption; Electricity-consumption; Environmental conditions; Extruded polystyrenes; Heating degree-days; Me-xico; Electric power system control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076860869

In the scope of energy resource consumption, e.g., the intense use of fossil fuels has contributed to the acceleration of climate changes on the planet, and the overriding need to increase energy efficiency in all sectors is now widely recognized, aiming to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions by 69% in 2030. Largely due to climate changes, water has also become a critical resource on the planet and hydric stress risk will rise significantly in the coming decades. Accordingly, several countries will have to apply measures to increase water efficiency in all sectors, including at the building level. These measures, in addition to reducing water consumption, will contribute to the increase of energy efficiency and to the decrease of GHG emissions, especially of CO2. Therefore, the nexus water energy in buildings is relevant because the application of water efficiency measures can result in a significant contribution to improve buildings’ energy efficiency and the urban water cycle (namely in abstraction, treatment, and pumping). For Mediterranean climate, there are few studies to assess the extent and impact of this nexus. This study presents the assessment of water-energy nexus performed in a university building located in a mainland Portugal central region. The main goals are to present the results of the water and energy efficiency measures implemented and to assess the consequent reduction of water, above 37%, and energy (30%) consumption, obtained because of the application of water-efficient devices and highly efficient light systems in the building. The water efficiency increase at the building level represents at the urban level an energy saving in the water supply system of 406 kWh/year, nearly 0.5% of the building energy consumption, with a consequent increase in the energy efficiency and in the reduction of GHG emissions. Complementarily, other energy-efficient measures were implemented to reduce the energy consumption. As the building under study has a small demand of domestic hot water with no hydro pressure pumps and has a small water-energy nexus, it was concluded that the significant reduction of the building energy consumption did not influence the indoor comfort. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Buildings; Sustainability; Water efficiency; Water-energy nexus","building; climate change; energy efficiency; energy resource; hydrological cycle; university sector; water supply; water use efficiency; Portugal; water; climate change; energy conservation; greenhouse gas; Portugal; procedures; university; water conservation; Climate Change; Conservation of Energy Resources; Conservation of Water Resources; Greenhouse Gases; Portugal; Universities; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064648021

Numerous technological alternatives are available for waste treatment, each with different costs and environmental footprints. For sustainable waste management, both economic and environmental aspects should be considered. Therefore, this study addresses the systematic design of processing routes for the sustainable management and utilization of MSW under economic and environmental criteria. To address this, a generic superstructure-based multiobjective optimization framework is developed. MSW superstructure composes of the potential processing routes for the waste management where MSW can be utilized for energy generation and other valuable waste-based products. On the basis of superstructure, we develop a multiobjective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model that simultaneously maximizes the net profit and minimizes the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The developed optimization model is coded and solved in GAMS to determine the optimal most promising routes for the sustainable processing of MSW. A case of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi is employed to test the applicability of the developed framework. The optimization results emphasize that pathway 2 shows a decent trade-off between economic and environmental objectives, whereas the two most environmentally sustainable processing pathways have the potential to reduce GHG emissions by 58% and 80%, compared with business as usual (BAU) scenario, and also possess potential economic benefits. The insights gained from this analysis guide the municipality planners to devise a promising and sustainable waste management strategy. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","economic analysis; environmental analysis; multiobjective optimization; municipal solid waste; sustainable management","Ecodesign; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Integer programming; Multiobjective optimization; Nonlinear programming; Sustainable development; Waste treatment; Environmental analysis; Environmental footprints; Environmental objectives; Mixed integer nonlinear programming models; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Sustainable management; Sustainable waste management; Technological alternatives; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076093295

The increase in temperature will also increase evapotranspiration therefore, future water balance on Ecuadorian coast will have a slight variation. Changes in precipitation patterns and evapotranspiration will produce an increase in the water requirements for current crops, so an imbalance in the water resources systems between natural resources and water demands is expected. This study presents water resources management as an adaptation measure to climate change for reducing vulnerability in tropical areas. Twelve bias-corrected climate projections are used, from: two AR5 General Circulation Models (GCMs), two Representative Concentration Pathways, 4.5–8.5 scenarios, and three time periods, short-term (2010–2039), medium-term (2040–2069) and long-term (2070–2099). These data were incorporated into the Lumped Témez Hydrological Model. Climate change scenarios predict for the long-term period both a mean rainfall and temperature increases up to 22%-2.8 °C, respectively. Besides, the potential evapotranspiration will increase until 12% by Penman-Monteith method and 60% by Thornthwaite method. Therefore, natural water resources will finally have an increase of 19% [8–30%]. Additionally, water requirements for crops will increase around 4% and 45%. As this research shows, in tropical regions, currently viable water resources systems could become unsustainable under climate change scenarios. To guarantee the water supply in the future additional measures are required as reservoir operation rules and irrigation efficiency improvement of system from 0.43 to 0.65, which it involves improving the distribution and application system. In study area future irrigation areas have been estimated for 13,268 ha, which under climate change scenarios is unsustainable, only 11,500 ha could be expanded with a very high irrigation efficiency of 0.73. Therefore, in tropical areas the effect of climate change on expansion projects for irrigated areas should be considered to ensure the functioning systems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Hydrological simulation; RCP; Tropical climate; Water requirements; Water resources management","Climate models; Crops; Efficiency; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Rain; Reservoirs (water); Tropics; Water supply; Climate change scenarios; General circulation model; Hydrological simulations; Potential evapotranspiration; Tropical climates; Water requirements; Water resources management; Water resources systems; Climate change; climate change; coastal zone; evapotranspiration; hydrological modeling; tropical region; water demand; water management; water resource; Ecuador",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076046732

Explored are two options for the United States petroleum industry for lowering carbon emissions 80% by 2050. One option examines voluntary reduction in emissions and the other uses a United States federal carbon tax to diminish coal usage and incentivize carbon capture and storage. Also examined are economic implications for the industry following BAU with an average global temperature rise of approximately 2°C by 2050. By correlating drops in United States petroleum consumption and production with declines in global gross domestic product during the Great Recession of 2008-2009, projections are made for economic declines modeled by Burke et al. (2015) coinciding with BAU warming. Consumption of NG and oil in the United States suffered minor decreases from 2008 to 2009, but production levels did not. This indicates economic repercussions to United States petroleum caused by global warming are minor compared to the 80% drop needed to meet the COP21 goal. It is unlikely the United States petroleum industry will suffer major economic losses following a BAU path, discounting the potential costs of disasters and international or political conflicts resulting from climate change. Because of the range of potential positive to negative impacts resulting from climate change, however, the membership of AAPG should debate how to address this issue. © 2020.

Background: In conventional hadron therapy, the goal is to create a homogenous dose in the tumour area and, thus, achieve a uniform cell survival level. Since the induction of a specific damage to cells is directly influenced by the level of hypoxia in the tissue, the varying oxygen pressure in the different regions of hypoxic tumours would disrupt the uniformity of the cell survival level. Materials and methods: Using the Geant4 Monte Carlo Code, the physical dose profile and dose-averaged linear energy transfer were calculated in the tumour. Then, the oxygen enhancement ratio in different areas of the tumour were compared with different pressures. Results: Modulations of radiation intensities as well as energies of ion beams were calculated, both considering and disregarding the effect of hypoxia, and the required dose profiles were compared with each other. Cell survival levels were also compared between the two methods. An equation was obtained for re-modulating the beams in the presence of hypoxia, and radiation weighting factors were extracted for the beam intensities. Conclusion: The results show that taking the effect of hypoxia into account would cause the reduction of average doses delivered to the tumour tissues up to 1.54 times. In this regard, the required dose is reduced by 1.63 times in the healthy tissues before the tumour. This will result in an effective protection of healthy tissues around the tumour. © 2019 Greater Poland Cancer Centre","Hadron therapy; Hypoxic tumour; Monte Carlo; OER","animal cell; Article; cancer radiotherapy; cell survival; CHO-K1 cell line; female; intensity modulated radiation therapy; ion therapy; linear energy transfer; Monte Carlo method; neoplasm; nonhuman; oxygen enhancement ratio; radiation beam; radiation dose; radiosensitivity; treatment planning; tumor hypoxia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076670212

Such high-field interactions can be resolved, for example, in above-threshold multiphoton photoemission (ATP) spectroscopy. In this work, we interrogate the nonlinear photoelectric responses of the pristine copper, silver, and gold noble metal surfaces in (111) and (100) crystal orientations in the perturbative regime. Using multiphoton photoemission spectroscopy (mPP) excited by finely tuned optical fields, we characterize enhancement of the mPP and ATP yields from (111) surfaces in selected k||-momentum ranges when the occupied Shockley surface (SS) states are (near-)resonantly coupled by multiphoton transitions to image potential (IP) intermediate states in the excitation process. The ATP signal from the IP states of (111) surfaces is largely defined by their formation through polarization of SS electrons; this observation is contrasted with ATP experiments from the Ag(100) surface, for which the SS becomes an unoccupied resonance and the IP states can only be excited from bands with significantly more bulk character. In addition, based on the optical power and nonlinear order-dependent mPP spectra, we provide evidence for ATP being a one-step, rather than a sequential process, as previously postulated. © 2020 American Physical Society.",,"Crystal orientation; Image enhancement; Kinetic energy; Laser pulses; Multiphoton processes; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Photons; Precious metals; Silver compounds; Excitation process; High order harmonics; Intense femtosecond laser pulse; Intermediate state; Multi-photon photoemission; Multiphoton transitions; Photoelectric response; Sequential process; Nonlinear optics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079796036

With an average of 4.07 ± 0.68 Mg C ha−1 and Shannon diversity index of 3.06, farm carbon stocks were significantly associated with farm size (r = 0.453, p &lt; 0.05), tree density (r = − 0.58, p = 0.05) and the average size of trees on farm (r = − 0.42, p = 0.05), but not by Shannon diversity index (r = 0.36, p = 0.080), species richness (r = − 0.044, p = 0.833) or the number of land use categories (r = − 0.192, p = 0.356). Timber was considered the most important use of on-farm trees before firewood and construction material. The results suggest that gaining self-sufficiency in firewood is the most important benefit with on-farm carbon accumulation. The focus on exotic species for timber production presents a considerable trade-off between livelihood options and environmental goals.

The question is, how high the ammonia concentrations in the air are, whether they are “dangerous to health, hygiene and the environment”. In addition to these questions, there are also technological questions, i.e. the quality of such fly ash in terms of its impact on the properties of fresh and hardened concrete. This results in uncertainty regarding the safe use of such fly ash by the concrete manufacturer. Ultimately, the use of such fly ash is being reduced, because the potential risk (absence of limits) in using fly ash as a partial cement substitute outweighs the potential savings resulting from the lower price of this pozzolanic admixture (which contaminated fly ash certainly still is). In 2016, new legislative measures regulating emission limits of produced flue gases [1] were introduced. Demands on the quality of produced flue gases have been constantly tightened in recent years, which is why mainly producers of electricity in coal-fired power units are forced to introduce additional greening technologies. The new legislation tightens the inspection of the production of nitrogen oxide emissions the most, which was completely out of interest in recent times. Therefore, several methods of new greening technologies have been developed in order to improve the reduction of nitrogen oxides, which differ fundamentally in particular due to the need to intervene in the combustion process or in the construction of the entire combustion unit. However, due to economic reasons, most thermal power plants and incineration plants in the Czech and Slovak Republics follow a unified path by introducing selective non-catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides (hereinafter referred to as SNCR). © 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Soil water chemistry is one component with important implications for understanding climate feedbacks, plant growth, microbial turnover and net greenhouse gas emissions. Here we assess the contrasting growing season soil water chemistry in a Low arctic Greenlandic mesic tundra heath and a fen, which have been subjected to factorial treatments of summer warming using open top chambers (OTCs), snow addition using snow fences, which increase soil temperature in late winter, and shrub removal mimicking herbivory attack. Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) and plant nutrients, including NO3 −, NH4 +, PO4 2+ and total dissolved N were measured during multiple growing seasons (2013–2016) to quantify the treatment effects on nutrient availability in two dominating, but contrasting, vegetation types. Ambient nutrient concentrations in the mesic tundra heath decreased throughout the growing season and increased during senescence, while concentrations were highest during peak growing season in the fen. The content of NH4 + and DOC were highest in the fen, whereas NO3 − was highest in the mesic tundra heath. The fen had no seasonal pattern. Summer warming in the mesic tundra heath did not change the availability of nutrients, but in combination with shrub removal, both NO3 − and DOC concentrations increased, likely due to reduced plant uptake. Shrub removal alone increased NO3 − in one growing season, and, combined with snow addition, increased DOC. Significant effects of shrub removal were mostly found in 2016. Snow addition combined with summer warming increased DOC and total N concentrations and highlights the potential loss of dissolved C from the ecosystem. In the fen, shrub removal alone and combined with summer warming decreased DOC. Snow addition alone and in combination with summer warming similarly decreased DOC. In the mesic tundra heath, shrub removal caused higher soil water contents in all years. In the dry and warm 2016, it meant &lt;10% soil water content in controls and 15–20% in shrub removal plots during the peak growing season, which may have relieved soil moisture limitation on mineralization rates in the latter. We conclude that soil water chemistry is vegetation-specific, and that treatment effects are surprisingly limited when comparing multiple years with contrasting precipitation patterns. Herbivory may have larger impact in very dry, warm summers and, together with extreme weather events, exert similar or larger effects than four years of temperature manipulations. The effects of summer warming or increased winter snow depend on ecosystem type and moisture status of the soil. The combination of multi-year and multi-site studies therefore seem important for understanding future biogeochemical dynamics in Arctic landscapes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Arctic; Extreme weather; Gradual climate change; Herbivory; Snow fence; Soil water chemistry","Climate change; Dissolution; Ecosystems; Fences; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrochemistry; Nutrients; Organic carbon; Snow; Vegetation; Water content; Wetlands; Arctic; Extreme weather; Herbivory; Snow fences; Soil water chemistry; Soil moisture; arid region; extreme event; herbivory; snow accumulation; soil water; tundra; water chemistry; wet deposition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075507995

The effect of sodium bicarbonate on kidney fibrosis and injury markers in individuals with diabetic kidney disease and normal serum total CO2 is unknown. Design, setting, participants, &amp; measurements We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 74 United States veterans with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, eGFR of 15–89 ml/min per 1.73 m2, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥30 mg/g, and serum total CO2 of 22–28 meq/L. Participants received oral sodium bicarbonate (0.5 meq/kg lean body wt per day; n535) or placebo (n539) for 6 months. The primary outcome was change in urinary TGF-b1-to-creatinine from baseline to months 3 and 6. Secondary outcomes included changes in urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1)-to-creatinine, fibronectin-to-creatinine, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)-to-creatinine, and UACR from baseline to months 3 and 6. Results Key baseline characteristics were age 7268 years, eGFR of 51618 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and serumtotal CO2 of 2462 meq/L. Sodium bicarbonate treatment increased mean total CO2 by 1.2 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.3 to 2.1) meq/L, increased urinary pH by 0.6 (95% CI, 0.5 to 0.8), and decreased urinary ammonium excretion by 5 (95% CI, 0 to 11) meq/d and urinary titratable acid excretionby 11 (95% CI, 5 to 18) meq/d.

Previous studies in the oceanic regions adjacent to the Indian subcontinent providing evidence of aerosol impacts on cloud properties were mostly confined in the winter season. Here we analyze 15 years (March 2000–February 2015) of MODIS aerosol and cloud products and 10 years (October 2004–February 2015) of OMI absorbing aerosol index (AI) over the Arabian Sea (AS), Bay of Bengal (BoB) and South Indian Ocean (SIO) to examine the sensitivity of marine water cloud characteristics to changing aerosol loading. Amidst a monotonous increase in Reff (cloud effective radius) with an increase in LWP (liquid water path) in clean and polluted conditions (an indicator of the meteorological influence), a smaller Reff at higher AOD (aerosol optical depth) bins demonstrates that aerosol signal is detectable and consistent in LWP range of 150–350 g m−2. Furthermore, a faster rate of Reff growth with increasing LWP in clean condition and the pattern of change in cloud fraction (fc) with an increase in AOD that cannot be explained by meteorology alone also provide evidence of the consistency of aerosol indirect effect. Evidence of aerosol semi-direct (decrease of LWP with an increase in AI) is also conspicuous in the AS and BoB.

While mitigation strategies for climate warming and other anthropogenic disturbances are implemented, coral restoration programmes are being established worldwide as an additional conservation measure to minimise coral loss and enhance coral recovery. Current restoration efforts predominantly rely on asexually produced coral fragments - a process with inherent practical constraints on the genetic diversity conserved and the spatial scale achieved. Because the resilience of coral communities has hitherto relied on regular renewal with natural recruits, the scaling-up of restoration programmes would benefit from greater use of sexually produced corals, which is an approach that is gaining momentum. Here we review the present state of knowledge of scleractinian coral sexual reproduction in the context of reef restoration, with a focus on broadcast-spawning corals. We identify key knowledge gaps and bottlenecks that currently constrain the sexual production of corals and consider the feasibility of using sexually produced corals for scaling-up restoration to the reef- and reef-system scales. © The authors and the Australian Institute of Marine Science 2020.

In order to cope with the widespread effects of these emissions—in addition to improving technology and the use of green energy—it is necessary to reduce the volume of emissions with the help of green spaces at the point of origin. Green spaces provide extensive ecosystem services that improve the quality of life and urban ecosystem livability. Due to the expansion of urban areas, the volume of ecological resources has declined and these resources have become more disconnected. The ongoing reduction of these ecological resources makes their management and planning a critical necessity. We need to evaluate the multiple benefits of urban ecosystem services for appropriate ecosystem management and integrate those ecological benefits with the social characteristics of neighborhoods. This paper provides some analysis, as the first step, to assess the ecosystem services (ES) provided by the green spaces (supply analyses) and the social-ecological needs in these spaces (needs analyses). Next, these assessments are used to find the urban areas with the highest social-ecological needs and with the lowest supply of green spaces in order to provide a reliable basis for the multi-functional planning of green spaces. These assessments are also used to analyze the status of services provided in the environment and the services needed to respond to the people's cultural and ecological needs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem services; Green infrastructure; Multi-functionality; Tehran; Urban green planning","Urban planning; Ecosystem services; Green infrastructure; Green planning; Multifunctionality; Tehran; Ecosystems; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; greenspace; infrastructure planning; mapping; urban area; urban planning; article; environmental management; human; neighborhood; urban area; Iran; Tehran [Iran]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075816116

A plant operating according to the concept can vary its production of heat and electricity by utilising steam on different pressure levels. It is also connected to a district heating system and utilises a large-scale heat storage. France has set long-term targets to increase the share of solar and wind power in the power mix, consequently reducing the share of nuclear power. The flexible co-generation can help the nuclear fleet cope with this change while potentially reducing emissions from the heating sector. High utilisation rate, efficiency and more stable reactor output is targeted. The concept is studied with an optimisation model within the French operational environmental in three case studies of Paris, Lyon and Dunkirk. Total efficiencies of 70%, 54% and 34% are reached, respectively. Cases represent systems with different heat loads and distances from nearby DH systems. Result indicate that both operational flexibility and large-scale storages are heavily utilised.

To this end, Air Pollution Tolerance Indices (APTI) are of paramount importance as they help study effects/interactions of air pollution on plants, with possible eco-control implications for environmental management. The present study measured the APTI of certain common roadside plant species in India (at sites E and NE) to assess the impact of air pollutant and particulate matter concentrations on their biochemical/physiological parameters. The maximum concentrations of SO2, NO2, and suspended particulate matter (SPM) were found at site E during the study period of November 2011 to February 2012. APTI, ascorbic acid, and relative water content (RWC) were higher at site E compared to NE, whereas total chlorophyl content and pH were lower at site E, which was characterized by manmade roadside plantations and more industrial sites unlike the biodiversity-rich site NE. Thus, although both sites E and NE grew common plants, they showed variations in physiology as well as stress tolerance indices. Henceforth, screened potent plants from this study may be used to investigate plant-PM interactions, resulting effects/tolerance, with possible implications for environmental/air pollution amelioration, namely, assisting eco-sustainable strategies for particulate pollution control. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Eco-sustainable; green belt; human health; Indo-Burma hotspot; magnetic particles; particulate deposition","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Ascorbic acid; Biodiversity; Environmental management; Health risks; Nanomagnetics; Roadsides; Sustainable development; Tropics; Eco-sustainable; Green belts; Hot spot; Human health; Magnetic particle; Particulate deposition; Particles (particulate matter); ascorbic acid; chlorophyll; nitrogen; oxide; sulfur; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; air pollution tolerance index; air quality; ambient air; Article; biodiversity; maximum concentration; nonhuman; particulate matter; pH; plant; plantation; priority journal; stress; suspended particulate matter; water content",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061251681

By its geographical position, Nicaragua is one of the countries most affected by climate change, and coffee production is expected to vastly shrink in some critical areas, suitability being reduced by up to 40% in the country. This paper analyses farmer's perceptions and vulnerability indicators to find which indicators are linked to farmers’ perceived capacity to adapt to climate change, paying special attention to the issue of whether farmers perceive they have any capacity at all to adapt. The analysis was conducted through a survey to 212 representative farmers jointly with an analysis of vulnerability indicators. A Heckman selection model was estimated to jointly analyse the probability of being able to cope with climate change and the level of adaptive capacity that farmers perceive. We have simulated different policy scenarios considering the sustainable development goals of United Nations in terms of poverty reduction and education concerns. We also analysed the effects of specific programs on education about climate change awareness. Finally, we extend our analysis to a geographical evaluation of the farmer's perceived vulnerability. The analysis shows that aspects such as farm size or education levels are relevant for modulating farmers’ perceptions on their own adaptive capacity. Large farm managers find themselves more often able to cope with climate change impacts though they find their capacity to be limited. Farmers that could not rely on rainfall water for their plantations also reported being less able to cope with climate change impacts. Poverty was also found to be correlated to perceptions, as regions lower proportions of inhabitants under poverty levels showed higher levels of confidence in adaptive capacity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Behavioral economics; Climate change adaptive capacity; Coffee production; Heckman selection model; Mesoamerica; Vulnerability indicators","adaptive management; climate change; coffee; farmers attitude; numerical model; perception; vulnerability; Mesoamerica; Nicaragua",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074248288

Anaerobic granular sludge (AGS), as a special microbial granule, demonstrates a strong potential to reduce Pd(II) and precipitate Bio-Pd in the sludge body. The problem how the Bio-Pd precipitates would influence the function and microbial community of the Pd hosting AGS (Pd-AGS) remains unknown. In this study, Pd-AGS with different Bio-Pd loadings (1.7, 3.0, 4.4 and 8.0 wt% of Pd) was obtained through bio-reduction at different Na2PdCl4 concentrations. Effects of Bio-Pd precipitates on acidogenesis and methanogenesis of AGS were assayed. Response of bacterial and archaeal community of AGS towards Bio-Pd precipitation were also revealed based on high-throughput sequencing data on Illumina Miseq platform. Results showed that Bio-Pd precipitates affected the acidogenesis and methanogenesis process of the Pd-AGS, as the produced total volatile fatty acids (VFA) and methane were reduced by 25.8–53.0% and 33.9–87.7%, respectively, comparing to the native AGS. Bio-Pd precipitation resulted in microbial community shift and a decrease in the microbial diversity. The bacterial community suffered more influence than the archaeal community. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens were more sensitive to the toxicity of Pd(II)/Bio-Pd than acetotrophic methanogens. Overall, when the heterogeneous Pd-AGS catalyst is designed to possess both the function of microbial metabolism and Pd catalysis, it is necessary to control a suitable Pd(II) concentration during reduction process and the final Bio-Pd loading in AGS (&lt;4.4 wt% of Pd). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Anaerobic granular sludge; Biogenic nanopalladium; Methanogenic process; Microbial community","Catalysts; Chlorine compounds; Granular materials; Metabolism; Methanogens; Sodium compounds; Volatile fatty acids; Anaerobic granular sludge; Biogenic nanopalladium; High-throughput sequencing; Hydrogenotrophic methanogens; Microbial communities; Microbial community structures; Microbial metabolism; Total volatile fatty acids; Palladium compounds; methane; palladium nanoparticle; volatile fatty acid; catalyst; experimental study; lead; metabolism; methanogenesis; microbial community; nanoparticle; precipitation (chemistry); sludge; anaerobic granular sludge; archaeon; Article; biomass; catalyst; community structure; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental management; environmental monitoring; high throughput sequencing; methanogen; methanogenesis; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; precipitation; priority journal; reduction kinetics; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; microflora; sewage; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Methane; Microbiota; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077736486

Afterwards, we analyzed the contribution rate of sectors' energy intensity effect and sectors' economic structure effect to the entire energy intensity. The results showed that the influencing factors have different effects on carbon emissions under different stages. During 1990-2000, economic development and population were the main factors contributing to the increase in carbon emissions, and energy intensity was an important factor to curb the carbon emissions increase. The energy intensity of industry and the economic structure of agriculture were the main factors to promote the decline of entire energy intensity. During 2001-2010, economic growth and emission coefficient were the main drivers to escalate the carbon emissions, and energy intensity was the key factor to offset the carbon emissions growth. The economic structure of transportation, and the energy intensity of industry and service were the main factors contributing to the decline of the entire energy intensity. During 2011-2016, economic growth and energy intensity were the main drivers of enhancing carbon emissions, while the coefficient was the key factor in curbing the growth of carbon emissions.

In recent years, the deviant behavior of employees has been increased noticeably. The purpose of this study is to explore the influence of paternalistic leadership on employee deviant behavior in workplace. To have a deep understanding of the relationship between paternalistic leadership and employee deviant behavior, the author’s design rule oriented ethical climate and self-interest oriented ethical climate as two mediators in this research model. Design/methodology/approach: Based on social learning theory and stressor-emotion model, this study conducts an investigation of influence mechanism between paternalistic leadership and workplace deviant behavior. Time-lagged data was collected from 226 employees from six cities in China. To test the hypothesis that the authors developed in this paper, the authors use empirical models from the existing literature about paternalistic leadership on employee deviant behavior. They establish multiple linear regressions to test the hypotheses. Findings: This study reveals the direct effect of authoritarian leadership on employee deviant behavior and the moderated roles of benevolent leadership and moral leadership, also analysis the mediated mechanism of self-interest oriented ethical climate and rule oriented ethical climate. The results show that the higher the degree of authority leaders show in the organization, the easier to stimulate workplace deviance of employee, self-interest oriented ethical climate and rule oriented ethical climate play mediated role between authoritarian leadership and workplace deviant behavior. The interaction of benevolent leadership and moral leadership with authoritarian leadership can weaken the self-interest oriented ethical climate but has nothing to do with rule oriented ethical climate. Originality/value: This study has three main contributions to the previous literature. First, this study explores the relationship between authoritarian leadership and employee workplace deviance, which could enrich the research on these negative behaviors in the Chinese context. Second, this study unpacks the “black box” in which authoritarian leadership influences employee workplace deviant behavior. Third, this study further examines the impacts of different combinations of the three factors of paternalistic leadership. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Authoritarian leadership; Benevolent leadership; Employee workplace deviant behaviour; Moral leadership; Team ethical climate",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077546279

Membrane wetting has a noteworthy effect on CO2 capture efficiency. A smaller amount of wetting can cause a huge resistance in CO2 transport through the membrane. The separation efficiency was enhanced by using membranes with high porosity and low tortuosity and decreased by enhancing the gas flow rate and absorbent flow rate reduction.

A sustainability team of the four student coauthors developed a comprehensive sustainable alternative transportation plan in 2018 for Furman University. The plan assessed the current status of Furman's transportation system by collecting and tracking necessary, relevant data to help form a vision for a more sustainable campus transportation system and lay out strategies for attaining it. The team focused on ways to reduce carbon emissions from private car use, provide education related to sustainable transportation, and create a campus culture centered on well-being. The team interviewed more than 20 key stakeholders throughout the campus and the community and conducted a comprehensive transportation survey that had 474 student respondents. The team also gathered information and data from the wide array of existing campus transportation components and reviewed 17 other university transportation plans. The plan creates a comprehensive and integrated approach to improve mobility at Furman University. It offers a series of concrete recommendations for improving the sustainability of university transportation, which includes establishing a sustainable transit fund, transportation board, and building infrastructure improvements.

The method of forecasting energy consumption is presented, taking into account the level and dynamics of energy consumption in general, as well as the use of individual energy resources with differentiation by countries and regions. In the present study, when forming the energy forecast, the key indicators determining the global energy demand are the dynamics of the energy intensity of GDP and per capita energy consumption. It is shown that in the total volume of world consumption of primary energy resources, oil will continue to occupy a leading position. Among fossil fuels, the demand for natural gas will increase most intensively. The share of coal in the structure of consumption of primary energy carriers will decrease, which is associated with the replacement of coal with natural gas in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The greatest growth rates of demand among non-fossil fuels will be observed in renewable energy sources. The main growth in atomic energy consumption will be in the developing countries of the Asia-Pacific Region. © 2019","Energy consumption; Europe; Forecast; Renewable energy; Trends; World","Carbon dioxide; Developing countries; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Gas emissions; Global warming; International trade; Natural gas; Renewable energy resources; Carbon dioxide emissions; Europe; Global energy demand; Primary energy resources; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Trends; World; Fossil fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081161147

Soil microorganisms are central to the conversion of plant organic matter into SOC, yet the relationship between plant diversity, soil microbial growth, turnover as well as carbon use efficiency (CUE) and SOC accumulation is unknown. As heterotrophic soil microbes are primarily carbon limited, it is important to understand how they respond to increased plant-derived carbon inputs at higher plant species richness (PSR). We used the long-term grassland biodiversity experiment in Jena, Germany, to examine how microbial physiology responds to changes in plant diversity and how this affects SOC content. The Jena Experiment considers different numbers of species (1–60), functional groups (1–4) as well as functional identity (small herbs, tall herbs, grasses, and legumes). We found that PSR accelerated microbial growth and turnover and increased microbial biomass and necromass. PSR also accelerated microbial respiration, but this effect was less strong than for microbial growth. In contrast, PSR did not affect microbial CUE or biomass-specific respiration. Structural equation models revealed that PSR had direct positive effects on root biomass, and thereby on microbial growth and microbial biomass carbon. Finally, PSR increased SOC content via its positive influence on microbial biomass carbon. We suggest that PSR favors faster rates of microbial growth and turnover, likely due to greater plant productivity, resulting in higher amounts of microbial biomass and necromass that translate into the observed increase in SOC. We thus identify the microbial mechanism linking species-rich plant communities to a carbon cycle process of importance to Earth's climate system. © 2019 The Authors.

Policymakers have argued that the transition towards a low-carbon energy system has sound economic and social reasoning, since generates economic growth and employment. This central premise has not, however, been consensual in literature, which requires additional research. In this context, the goal of this paper is to analyze and provide empirical evidence of the relationship between renewable energy deployment and job creation, by employing econometric methods from panel data analysis. The research is focused on European Union's 28 member states, analyzing the relationship between historical values of renewable power generation installed capacity and employment over the period 2000–2016. Results suggest a positive relationship between these two variables, showing an increase of 0.48% in employment for each 1% increase in renewable power generation capacity. The outcomes of the present analysis enable better understanding of the social context of renewables, providing relevant insights that can constitute an auxiliary instrument to support decision-making. © 2019","Econometric analysis; Employment; European union; Panel data regressions; Renewables","Climate change; Decision making; Economic analysis; Climate change mitigation; Econometric analysis; European union; Low-carbon energy systems; Panel data; Renewable energy deployments; Renewable power generation; Renewables; Employment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072569311

The survival of inherited molecules, as well as the disk in situ chemistry depends on the local temperature, density and irradiation environment, which can change over time due to stellar and disk evolution, as well as transport in the disk. We address one aspect of this coupling between the physical and chemical evolution in disks by following accretion streamlines of gas and small grains in the disk midplane, while simultaneously taking the evolving star into account. This approach is computationally efficient and enables us to take into account changing physical conditions without reducing the chemical network. We find that many species are enhanced in the inner disk midplane in the dynamic model due to inward transport of cosmic-ray driven chemical products, resulting in, e.g., orders of magnitude hydrocarbon enhancements at 1 au, compared to a static disk. For several other chemical families, there is no difference between the static and dynamic models, indicative of a robust chemical reset, while yet others show differences between static and dynamic models that depend on complex interactions between physics and chemistry during the inward track. The importance of coupling dynamics and chemistry when modeling the chemical evolution of protoplanetary disks thus depends on what chemistry is of interest. © 2020.

Currently, there are large gaps in understanding how fire affects understory forest structure and composition, interactions with fire recurrence, and long-term impacts. Understanding these changes is critical to evaluate the present and future response of tropical forests to fire. We studied post-fire changes in understory regeneration in forests in Mato Grosso State, southern Amazonia, Brazil, aiming to answer the following questions: (i) does forest structure (basal area) and tree community composition vary with fire frequency and time since the last fire? (ii) does the response differ among strata (e.g., sapling, larger trees)? (iii) are changes in diversity associated with changes in forest structure? We surveyed trees and lianas in previously structurally intact forests that underwent selective logging, followed by different fire histories, including 5 and 16 years after once-burned, 5 years after three times burned, and unburned (control). Overall, species composition (abundance, richness, and number of families) and diversity were highest for the unburned treatment and lowest for the recurrent burned areas. Fire frequency negatively affected plant structure and basal area; basal area of small, medium, and large plants declined significantly by more than 50% in the most frequently burned areas. Richness was positively related to basal area in the three times burned sites and in the 16 years regenerating site for all strata. Our results demonstrate the negative influence of frequent fires on both the composition and structure of small trees in Amazonian forest. These changes to the cohort of small-sized trees may persist and have long-term impacts on forest structure, affecting the capacity, and direction of forest recovery. With wildfire widespread across the region and increasing in frequency, fire may negatively affect tree diversity in remaining selectively logged forests, and affect regional carbon cycling with consequences for the global vegetation carbon sink. © Copyright © 2020 Prestes, Massi, Silva, Nogueira, de Oliveira, Freitag, Marimon, Marimon-Junior, Keller and Feldpausch.","basal area; carbon; diversity; regeneration; resilience; richness; seedling; selective logging",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092144628

Recently, coastal “blue carbon” habitats⁠—mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass meadows—have received attention for their ability to capture CO2 and store organic carbon (OC), primarily in their sediments. Across habitat types and regions, however, information about the sequestration rates and sources of carbon to local sediments remains sparse. Here we compiled recently obtained estimates of sediment OC stocks and sequestration rates from 139 cores collected from temperate seagrass (Zostera marina) meadows in Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. Across all cores sediment OC content averaged 0.75%. Organic carbon stocks in the top 25 cm and 1 m of the sediment averaged 1,846 and 7,168 g OC m−2, respectively. Carbon sequestration rates ranged from 4.6 to 93.0 g OC m−2 yr−1 and averaged 24.8 g OC m−2 yr−1. Isotopic data from this region suggest that OC in the sediments is largely from noneelgrass sources. In general, these values are comparable to those from other temperate Z. marina meadows, but significantly lower than previously reported values for seagrasses globally. These results further highlight the need for local and species-level quantification of blue carbon parameters. While temperate eelgrass meadows may not sequester and store as much carbon as seagrass meadows elsewhere, climate policy incentives should still be implemented to protect existing sediment carbon stocks and the other critical ecosystem services associated with eelgrass habitats. ©2020.

Tea is an evergreen perennial plant and cultivated worldwide under subtropical humid climatic condition for harvesting its tender shoots. Tea bushes of different cultivars and ages are grown in combination to minimize possible adverse effect of biotic and abiotic stresses; hence distribution of tea plantation in a tea garden is complex in nature. Large shade trees are also an integral part of tea garden. Those plantations in tea garden have huge potential to capture atmospheric CO2; however, ability of tea bushes to mitigate global warming while producing tea shoots is not quantified before. The objective of this study was to quantify the potential of tea plantation to mitigate greenhouse effect (global warming mitigation potential, GWMP) due to assimilation of atmospheric CO2 gas. High yielding TV23 cultivar assimilated significantly higher amount of CO2 as compared to quality tea producing cultivars (S3A/3) and mature 25–30 years old tea bushes absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere as compared to younger tea bushes. Considering the mixed population of cultivars in tea gardens, overall, tea bushes sequestrated 5134.4 ± 831.6 kg CO2 ha−1 yr−1 in their biomass and had GWMP 3.47 ± 0.64 kg CO2 KMTH−1 yr−1. Shade trees sequestrated 4037.4 ± 589.9 kg CO2 ha yr−1 from the atmosphere. Hence, the GWMP of whole plantation ((both tea bushes and shade trees) was 6.19 ± 1.7 kg CO2 KMTH−1 yr−1. In this study, tea bushes sequestrated 52.7–61.3% of the total CO2 sequestrated by the plantations in tea garden. This study enabled to understand that tea bushes play significant role in mitigating global warming by assimilating and sequestrating atmospheric CO2 and the estimated value of global warming mitigation potential may be used for direct estimation of C sequestration by plantations in tea garden using its productivity value. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","C sequestration; CO2 capture; Global warming mitigation potential (GWMP); Shade trees; Tea bushes","carbon dioxide; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; cultivar; evergreen tree; garden; global warming; greenhouse gas; humid environment; plantation; subtropical region; tea; Article; biomass; Camellia sinensis; carbon dioxide fixation; controlled study; cultivar; greenhouse effect; India; land use; nonhuman; plantation; greenhouse effect; tea; India; Carbon Dioxide; Gardens; Greenhouse Effect; India; Tea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076016131

By tracking recolonization of vegetation, we estimated that it took 5 years for 51% vegetation recovery and 10 years for 69% recovery, with complete recover (100%) not expected for more than 50 years. This suggests that efforts to extend the lifespan of drowning coastal wetlands through sediment additions might disrupt carbon dioxide assimilation, as effects of disturbance persist. Focusing on greenhouse gas exchange, our work found that areas of marsh vegetation contribute to carbon assimilation (−42 g C · m−2 · year−1), while ponds and areas of bare peat created by pond excavation were associated with carbon emissions (44 and 125 g C · m−2 · year−1, respectively). These results suggest that the conversion of wetlands to ponds—which is a significant driver of coastal wetland loss worldwide—may convert coastal wetlands from greenhouse gas sinks to sources. Additionally, quantifying the area of vegetation within a marsh (vs. bare ground or open water) is important for quantifying their greenhouse gas mitigation function. ©2020.

The environmental and economic problems are among the challenges in municipal solid waste management (MSWM). Integrated solid waste management (ISWM) is a comprehensive method which deals with these problems through different combinations of technologies like anaerobic digestion (AD), composting and landfill. In this study, life cycle assessment (LCA) has been used to optimize the solid waste management of the city of Tehran. The primary objective of this study is finding the most optimal case with minimum carbon dioxide (CO2) production and energy consumption by considering economic data. Two different scenarios have been defined to do the investigations. In the first scenario, the current status of waste management in Tehran has been considered while in the second scenario, the system is upgraded by implementing state-of-the-art technologies like AD and landfill gas recovery. An LCA software, called IWM-2 was used for calculating the environmental load of each scenario and writing life cycle inventory. Both scenarios are once optimized by considering two objectives and once with three objectives, in order to find the optimal amount of waste entering each unit of waste management system being identified. It was concluded that utilizing newer technologies (second scenario) not only has less cost but also their saving of CO2 and the consumed energy is 901 t and 3,389 GJ less than the first scenario. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Life cycle assessment; Optimization; Total cost; Waste management","Anaerobic digestion; Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Land fill; Life cycle; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Waste management; Comprehensive method; Environmental loads; Integrated solid waste managements; Integrated waste management; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life Cycle Inventory; State-of-the-art technology; Waste management systems; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075883120

However, in the Cerrado region (savannah grasslands in northeastern Brazil), satellite observations reveal increases in fire activity and tropospheric column nitrogen dioxide (an ozone precursor) during the burning season (August-October, 2005–2016), which have partially offset these air quality benefits. Simulations from a 3-D global chemistry transport model (CTM) capture this increase in NO2 with a surface increase of ~1 ppbv per decade. As there are limited long-term observational tropospheric ozone records, we utilize the well-evaluated CTM to investigate changes in ozone. Here, the CTM suggests that Cerrado region surface ozone is increasing by ~10 ppbv per decade. If left unmitigated, these positive fire-sourced ozone trends will substantially increase the regional health risks and impacts from expected future enhancements in South American biomass burning activity under climate change. ©2019.

First, we use the magnetic special quasirandom structure (M-SQS) method for simulation of the paramagnetic state in Fe-Mn alloys without impurity. Here, Fe and Mn atoms are randomly distributed at the sites of a supercell following the chemical SQS method. Next, to calculate the energies for various magnetic realizations around the interstitial carbon impurity, we vary the position of the impurity within the SQS.

The current study simulates transport and modal distribution effects for several scenarios in which modal shift policy measures are strengthened, expanded, combined, and harmonized across borders in the Nordics. Found transport effects were then used in an environmental model to assess implications for energy use and emissions of CO2, eq, NOx, and particulate matter, gaining insights into which policy measures are more effective or complement each other, and whether international harmonization might increase effectiveness, and modal shift. From our simulations, a Norwegian ecobonus scheme for rail yields larger modal shift away from road than a similar ecobonus for sea transport. Facilitating longer freight trains yields more modal shift but has high policy costs. Effects of harmonizing policies across Nordic countries vary but can be strengthened by combining different measures. However, even for scenarios with strong policy measures, reductions in CO2, eq emissions do not exceed 3.6% in 2030 while sometimes increasing local air pollution. Modal shift policy should therefore not exclusively be regarded as environmental strategy, although it may contribute to other policy objectives. © 2020 by the authors.","Emissions; Environment; Freight transport; Harmonization; Intermodal; Modal shift; Policy measures; Truck","carbon emission; energy use; environmental policy; freight transport; harmonic analysis; maritime transportation; travel behavior; travel demand; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081282037

The optimization model, formulated as mixed integer linear programming problem, incorporates dynamic operating conditions through time-dependent local climatic data, energy resources, energy demands, electricity prices, and electricity CO2 emission factors. The methodology is applied to a case study of a residential building in Spain. First, the single-objective solutions are obtained, highlighting their fundamental differences regarding the installation of cogeneration (included in the optimal total annual cost solution) and solar-based technologies (included in the optimal total annual CO2 emissions solution). Then, the Pareto curve is generated, and a decision-making approach is proposed to select the preferred trade-off solutions based on the marginal cost of CO2 emissions saved. Additionally, sensitivity analyses are performed to investigate the influence of key parameters concerning energy resources prices, investment costs, and rooftop area. The analyses of the trade-off solutions verify the enormous potential for CO2 emissions reduction, which can reach 32.3% with only 1.1% higher costs by displacing cogeneration in favor of the heat pump and the electric grid.

A linear programming optimisation framework is developed to schedule the operation of behind-the-meter energy storage such that costs are minimised, while keeping peak demands within allowable limits. This is also extended to model generation-integrated energy storage systems, where the storage is located in the flow of energy from primary source (e.g. wind) to a usable form (e.g. electricity). To demonstrate the potential of energy storage within a real community energy scheme, we present a case study of a community hydro scheme in North Wales, considering both battery storage and a reservoir-based storage system. It is found that either system can be used to substantially increase the membership of the scheme while avoiding impacts on the electricity network, but that storage remains prohibitively expensive when used for self-consumption of renewables and arbitrage. We also investigate the impacts of energy storage on the community's carbon emissions, showing that storage operation appears to provide very little additional reduction in emissions when grid average emissions factors are used. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Battery storage; Linear programming; Micro hydro; Scheduling","Carbon; Cost reduction; Linear programming; Scheduling; Carbon emissions; Community energy; Electricity networks; Emissions factors; Integrated energy storages; Micro hydros; Model generation; Storage operations; Battery storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076608432

The essential nature of the subject is confirmed by the following figures: transport is responsible for almost 25% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and is the main cause of air pollution in cities, almost 90% of city dwellers in the EU are exposed to levels of air pollutants deemed harmful by the WHO, and approximately 95% of vehicles on European roads still use fossil fuels. Therefore, the implemented transport policy, both in the international and domestic aspect of particular countries, is facing the need to significantly reduce the negative influence of transport on people and the environment. Electromobility has become one of the concepts that makes it possible to achieve this goal. Its main objective is to reduce emissions of harmful substances into the environment by deploying electric vehicles (EVs). Research conducted by the authors showed that public transport, apart from the obvious effect of decreased number of private vehicles and decreased congestion, can contribute to reduced air pollutant emissions and become a significant driver for the implementation of electromobility in cities. However, the achievement of this goal depends on taking appropriate actions not only in the transport branch but also in other sectors of economy.

We assessed the impact of long-term conservation tillage and N fertilization in wheat-soybean rotation on soil aggregate distribution, nutrients stocks and functions of soil microorganisms related to C, N, P and S cycles at different aggregation scales in the Mediterranean area. A long-term field experiment was set up in a silt loam soil comparing two tillage intensities to bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) - soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) rotation: conventional tillage (CT) and minimum tillage (MT). Two N fertilization levels were applied on bread wheat: 0 and 200 kg N ha−1 (N0 and N200, respectively). Under CT, almost 100% of the crop residues were incorporated in the 0–25 cm soil layer, whereas under MT approximately 50% were incorporated at 0–15-cm depth. Tillage was the most discriminant factor explaining 72% and 60% of total variance of soil parameters at 0–15 cm and 15–30 cm soil depth, respectively, whereas N fertilization explained 22% and 29% of total variance, respectively. All enzyme activities were higher under MT, whereas the majority of soil chemical parameters were higher under N200. Under MT a higher proportion of free microaggregates (+51%) was recorded compared to CT suggesting that in a silt loam soil MT had a greater potential to form macroaggregates. The proportion of small macroaggregates was not changed by tillage, but when this fraction was fractionated a higher proportion of occluded microaggregates was found under MT at 15–30 cm (+21%). In the occluded microaggregates, interaction of tillage x N fertilization explained 52% of total variance of soil parameters at 0–15 cm. The most discriminant parameters were the biochemical ones and SOC. All those parameters were higher in MT-N200. Specifically, SOC in occluded microaggregates was increased by N fertilization under MT (+16% at 0–15 cm; +84% at 15–30 cm), whereas it was decreased under CT (-46% at 0–15 cm; -15% at 15–30 cm). In addition, the synthetic indexes for enzymatic activities and for those involved in C-cycle were reduced by N fertilization under MT up to 37% and increased up to 87% under CT. In the Mediterranean area, maintaining or even increasing SOC conservation may require both reduced tillage systems and N fertilization, shifting microbial community towards toward taxa more effective in contrasting soil degradation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Conservation agriculture; Soil organic carbon; Soil quality","Aggregates; Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Amino acids; Food products; Greenhouse gases; Microorganisms; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen fixation; Nutrients; Organic carbon; Silt; Chemical and biologicals; Conservation agricultures; Greenhouse gases emissions; Long-term field experiments; Nitrogen fertilization; Reduced tillage systems; Soil organic carbon; Soil quality; Soil conservation; conservation tillage; enzyme; enzyme activity; microaggregate; microbial activity; microbial community; organic carbon; soil aggregate; soil carbon; soil nutrient; soil quality; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074628119

The objective of this research is to show the opportunity that implementation of zero emission ferry lines offers in the framework of 100% RES smart island energy systems and demonstrate their ability to supply the fuel for zero emission ferry lines. A method is presented for modelling supply of ferry lines, which are fuelled from excess energy produced by local renewable energy sources. Case study analyses show that operation costs of hydrogen and electric ferry differ depending on the island size and route.

The aim of the paper is to demonstrate that an integrated reading of urban and rural land uses in relation to GHG emissions is feasible and useful at the regional level in order to reach emissions reduction. The Po Valley in Italy is an emblematic case study because its features are unique in Europe for high population density, urban sprawl, intensive agriculture, livestock management and consequently high emission levels. The methodology examines the total GHG emissions in relation to urban and rural areas. Between 2000 and 2010, the trend of CO2-equivalent emissions for the macro-regions of Italy shows a national decrease in contrast to the area of our case study which has seen a steady increase and growth trend over time. The paper analyzes some possible reasons linked to this anomaly, and it presents an estimation of the CO2-equivalent emissions related to the use of agricultural land.

Biogas production from various renewable feedstocks has positive socioeconomic and environmental impact. In Europe, biogas is mainly used for generating heat and electricity. It consists of methane (55-70% by volume), carbon dioxide (30-45% by volume), and small amounts of other compounds. In some cases, biogas is upgraded to pure biomethane and utilized as vehicle fuel, instead of fossil fuels, thus reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. Biomethane can also serve as a platform chemical in chemical and biochemical synthesis to produce value-added products. The additional positive effects of anaerobic digestion of animal manure and slurries are organic waste degradation, reducing odors, and pathogens. Digestate, obtained as a by-product of anaerobic digestion, is rich in nutrients and therefore is applied as fertilizer in agriculture. Biogas production in Croatia is mainly based on manure and by-products from agriculture, food industry, and slaughterhouses. The obtained biogas is mostly used for electricity and heat generation. Potential for large-scale biogas production in Croatia is still insufficiently used, although various renewable feedstocks are available. More rational and focused management of lignocellulosic residues, animal excrements, food processing by-products, and biodegradable fraction of municipal waste could contribute to the development of Croatian biogas sector. Biogas production in Croatia can be affected by the changes of animal breeding capacity due to the struggle to cope with the European Union (EU) standards and prices. Concerning large unused agricultural areas, great potential lies in their rational exploitation for fast-growing biomass, e.g., for energy crops or perennial grasses. This review will discuss the potential of biogas in the industrial and farming sector, current state of biogas production, and various key drivers and barriers influencing biogas production in Croatia. © 2020 The Author(s).","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Digestate; Feedstocks; Renewable energy","Anaerobic digestion; Animals; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Feedstocks; Fertilizers; Food processing; Food waste; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Manures; Biochemical synthesis; Biodegradable fraction; Digestate; Fast growing biomass; Industrial by-products; Lignocellulosic residues; Renewable energies; Value added products; Electric power generation; anaerobic digestion; biochemistry; biogas; byproduct; carbon dioxide; cellulose; electricity generation; energy crop; environmental impact; exploitation; fossil fuel; grass; manure; methane; municipal solid waste; renewable resource; silage; slurry; socioeconomic impact; Croatia; Animalia; Poaceae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079288177

There are several technologies to reduce emissions on animal farms including manure additives; however, few have been proven effective and easy to apply to dairy lagoon systems. The present research aimed at testing the ability of the commercial additive ""SOP LAGOON"" to reduce emissions of GHGs (i.e., carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as ammonia (NH3) and odors from lagoon stored liquid manure. Emissions of GHGs, NH3 and odors were measured in the laboratory from barrels filled with 65 L of manure treated with SOP LAGOON or left untreated as a control. Manure was collected from a commercial dairy that is located in Solano County, California. Emissions of GHGs and NH3 were continuously measured for one week using flux chambers placed on top of the barrels and connected to a mobile air emissions laboratory. The effects of the untreated control, versus the two respective treatment additive doses of 30.8 and 61.6 g/m3 of manure were compared to each other. The low dose was selected based on the manufacturer recommendation and the high dose was selected by doubling the low dose. Results showed that SOP LAGOON applied at the high dose (61.6 g of SOP LAGOON per m3 of manure) versus the control greatly reduced (p &lt; 0.05) emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O and NH3 by 14.7%, 22.7%, 45.4% and 45.9%, respectively. Furthermore, the high dose of SOP LAGOON treated samples versus the control samples showed less odor intensity (p &lt; 0.05). There was no significant effect of the low dose of SOP LAGOON on the emissions of different gases. The HIGH dose of SOP LAGOON might decrease the number of methanogens and hydrolytic microorganisms and their excreted enzymes during manure storage. Further studies are needed to investigate the mechanism of emission reduction using SOP LAGOON. © 2020 by the authors.","Ammonia; Dairy; GHG; Liquid manure; Manure additive; Odor; SDG; Sustainability","dairy farming; emission; emission control; greenhouse gas; manure; odor; sustainability; sustainable development; California; Solano County; United States; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081662115

In Capital in the XXI Century, Thomas Piketty's argument is that the r > g inequality determines an increase in the capital-income ratio; if the elasticity of substitution in production is above one, the profit share rises. We provide a contrasting explanation that draws from the Post Keynesian approach to differential saving propensities between classes and the Classical-Marxian theory of induced technical change. In a simple model of “capitalists” and “workers,” we show that institutional changes that lower the labor share—declining unionization, increasing monopsony power in the labor market, the global ‘race to the bottom' in unit labor costs or the exhaustion of path-breaking scientific discoveries—can reduce labor productivity growth because of the lessened incentives to innovate to save on labor costs. A falling labor share reduces workers' total savings, and wealth concentrates in the capitalists' hands. A higher profit share and wealth share both put pressure on accumulation: but the long-run growth rate, which is anchored to labor productivity growth, has fallen. To restore balanced growth, the capital-income ratio must rise, independent of the elasticity of substitution. These tendencies are not inevitable: taxation can be used to implement any wealth distribution targeted by policymakers, while worker-crushing institutional arrangements can also in principle be reversed through policy. Neither change appears likely given the current institutional and global policy climate. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","capital-income ratio; factor shares; secular stagnation; wealth inequality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075712553

However, the role that some relevant functional traits involved in resource uptake and/or stress tolerance could play on these inter-specific differences in phenological sensitivity remains largely unknown. In this study we evaluated experimentally how five co-occurring herbaceous species with contrasting functional strategies respond to current and ongoing climatic scenarios of increased temperature, decreased water availability and both abiotic changes acting interactively. To decompose the direct effect of climate change and the indirect effect of neighbors on plant performance and reproductive phenology, each of the five species was exposed to a density gradient of competitor species. Although the study species were more sensitive to changes in temperature than in water availability, the combined effect of both abiotic cues triggered very heterogeneous responses. Species with higher SLA values were particularly sensitive to climate change, delaying their reproduction and lengthening their flowering period under warmer scenarios while maintaining a high plant growth rate. In contrast, the species with the lowest SLA values exhibited less phenological variability to climate alterations, but they were more strongly affected by neighbor density compared to species with opposite trait values. These species-specific responses to climatic shifts altered the synchrony of phenological events at the community level. The most important changes appeared under the two scenarios of increased temperature, where 4 out of 5 species overlapped their flowering periods. Our findings indicate that the ongoing scenarios of increasing temperature and aridity could disrupt the phenological asynchrony within communities, and highlight the necessity of considering the interactive effects of temperature and precipitation to obtain an overall picture of climate change predictions on plant phenology and population dynamics. © 2019","Flowering; Functional traits; Mediterranean ecosystems; Neighborhood effects; Phenological synchrony; Warming","aridity; climate change; community dynamics; flowering; growth rate; Mediterranean environment; phenology; reproduction; tolerance; water availability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070875677

Part of this has been the way that the forest controls regional climate including precipitation important for the ecosystem as well as agroforestry and farming. In addition, the Amazon also affects the global weather systems, so cutting down the rainforest significantly increases the effects of climate change, threatening the world's biodiversity and causing local desertification and soil erosion. The current fire activities and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest therefore have consequences for global sustainability. In the light of this, the current decisions made in Brazil regarding an increase in Amazon deforestation require policy changes if the global ecosystems and biodiversity are not to be set to collapse. There is only one way to move forward and that is to increase efforts in sustainable development of the region including limitation in deforestation and to continuously measure and monitor the development. The G7 countries have offered Brazil financial support for at least 20 million euros for fighting the forest fires but the president denies receiving such financial support and says that it is more relevant to raise new forests in Europe. In fact, this is exactly what is happening in Denmark and China in order to reduce climate change. Such activities should be global and include South America, Europe, Africa and Asia where deforestation is important issue. Forest restoration reduces climate change, desertification, and preserves both the regional tropical and global environment if the wood is not burned at a later stage but instead used in e.g. roads as filling material. Changes are therefore needed through improved international understanding and agreements to better avoid the global climate changes, from cutting down the precious rainforest before it is too late as rainforest cannot be re-planted. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Amazon; Carbon foot print; Climate change; Forest; Policy; Tree; Trophic","Africa; Asia; biodiversity; Brazil; China; climate; climate change; deforestation; Denmark; Europe; global climate; priority journal; rain forest; South America; sustainable development; tree; ecosystem; environmental protection; human; tropic climate; Africa; Asia; Brazil; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Europe; Humans; Rainforest; Trees; Tropical Climate",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075471661

Many studies have reported that a green facade can noticeably reduce the building surface temperature and cooling loads in summer. However, little is known about the extent to which large-scale facade greening cools the ambient air or the relationship between the cooling effects and urban form. This research employed the ENVI-met model to evaluate the summer cooling effects of block-scale facade greening and their relationship with urban form in Nanjing City in China. Six idealized urban blocks (IUBs) representing typical urban forms in Nanjing combined with five hypothetical facade-greening ratios generated 30 scenarios for simulation. The results revealed a distinct spatial pattern of cooling effects in each IUB. The cooling intensity decreases with increasing elevation, and it is strongest in ground spaces on the downwind side. The maximum cooling intensity is 0.96 °C and observed in the high-rise high-density site (HH). Among the six IUBs, the low-rise high-density block (LH) appears to be optimal for facade greening since it ranks in the top 1–3 for the four cooling-effect indicators. The threshold values were evaluated to further estimate the minimum greening ratios required to achieve corresponding energy-saving targets in each IUB. The findings can provide insights into the cool air dispersion process in urban canyons that have varying geometries. Furthermore, the results can inform vertical greening practices for the determination of appropriate sites and coverage ratios. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Energy saving; Urban design; Urban green space; Urban heat island; Vertical greening","Energy conservation; Facades; Urban planning; Climate change adaptation; Cooling intensity; Energy saving targets; Spatial patterns; Urban design; Urban green spaces; Urban heat island; Vertical greening; Climate change; climate change; cooling; greenspace; heat island; multistorey building; street canyon; temperature effect; urban design; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075479504

Method: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched for all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published before June 30, 2019 that investigated the efficacy of intracuff lidocaine, with or without sodium bicarbonate, in reducing coughing and other complications related to endotracheal intubation. A random-effects model was used to conduct a meta-analysis to assess the relative risks (RRs) of the incidence of these intubation-related side effects. Results: 11 studies involving 843 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with control groups (i.e., saline or air), intracuff lidocaine groups (alkalinized or non-alkalinized) had a significantly reduced incidence of coughing on tube. Similarly, intracuff lidocaine groups were more effective than control groups in reducing the incidence of other intubation-related complications.

The response of groundwater to drought effect is investigated by analyzing the historical groundwater level (GWL) data series with the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and RDI severity values and the trend is examined using parametric and non-parametric statistical tests. During moderate, severe, and extreme drought it is found that the increase in IWR of irrigated crops is 8%, 11%, and 16%, respectively. Overall, the mean increase in IWR during dry years of drought is approximately 12%.

Furthermore, PM2.5 is associated with cardiopulmonary diseases and premature mortality. Here, we use seven models to assess the response of PM2.5 to end of the twenty-first century climate change under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5, and the corresponding impact on premature mortality. The majority of models yield an increase in both PM2.5 and premature mortality associated with lung cancer and cardiopulmonary disease in all world regions except Africa. These results are robust across five different future population projections, although the magnitude of premature deaths can vary by up to a factor of two. Much larger uncertainty is related to uncertainty in model physics and the representation of aerosol processes. Although our analysis requires several assumptions related to future population estimates, as well as the concentration-response function, results suggest that future emission reductions are necessary to avoid the likely health risks associated with increasing PM2.5 in a warmer world. © 2020, The Author(s).","Climate change; Fine particulate matter; GHG-induced warming; Premature mortality","atmospheric pollution; cancer; cause of death; climate change; future prospect; global warming; greenhouse gas; mortality; particulate matter; respiratory disease; Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077598179

In parallel, energy is also a focal point for water supply, since, in many places, it is amongst the main limiting factors for adopting alternative water supply methods. As an example, mature desalination methods with competitive water production costs are not yet widely introduced to Greek islands. This is due to certain characteristics of local electricity grids, such as the very small power reserve margins or the large production cost variation of the available thermal engines, which require additional expenditures for upgrading the energy infrastructure. In this context, it has become obvious that water supply chain problems are inherently linked to the energy quality and availability of an area, leading to the so-called water-energy nexus (WEN) considerations. In that respect, the integrated approach for the solution of water and energy problems has become a topic of increasing attention for the scientific community and for practitioners in the field. With special emphasis on Aegean Sea Islands, i.e. an island region with significant water and energy shortages that jeopardize the local economy development, the present work introduces a framework for applying efficient solutions that integrate water supply with clean energy supply. To that end, the desired island characteristics and critical factors necessary for the successful implementation of the suggested solutions are identified and discussed, while the proposed framework is demonstrated using as case study the small island of Anafi. In more detail, a Linear Programming (LP) model is developed and applied in Anafi island, with results obtained showing that reliable and renewable-based energy and water supply are achievable at feasible cost, contributing at the same time to the considerable reduction of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs). Τhe theoretical modeling framework introduced aims at explaining the path of the research of the integrated water and energy supply for islands from a high-level decision-making perspective; thus not qualifying solutions into the detailed level of implementation (i.e. siting issues and local infrastructure characteristics are not taken into account). © 2019","Integrated solutions; Islands; Water resources management; Water-energy nexus","Costs; Decision making; Desalination; Energy resources; Greenhouse gases; Linear programming; Supply chains; Water conservation; Water supply; Water supply systems; Energy infrastructures; Integrated solutions; Islands; Linear programming models; Sustainable water supply; Water energy; Water resources availability; Water resources management; Water resources; infrastructure; integrated approach; limiting factor; local economy; production cost; sustainability; water availability; water management; water resource; water supply; Aegean Sea; Mediterranean Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071225428

The current treatment procedure has certain concerns including emissions or accumulation of odors, pathogens, nutrients, metals, and pharmaceutical products. An alternative method, the Slurry Injection technique, enables the digestion of biosolids in the deep earth and can replace the current practice of wastewater treatment or disposal in a much more environmentally friendly and cost-efficient manner. By completely sequestering methane and CO2into deep geologic formations which are produced as biosolids breakdown, reduces the greenhouse gas emissions and enables the operator to create greenhouse gas emission offset credits which can be marketed to offset the operating costs. The economic, environmental, and technical aspects of building a new biosolids slurry injection facility in DFW, includes both the surface construction requirements as well as the subsurface strata evaluation for containment assurance. For the subsurface aspects, a geomechanical and stress analysis is performed on the Atoka formation (near the city of Fort Worth) and it confirms a confining layer above and below the injection zone to keep the waste contained for permanent storage. © 2020 Widener University School of Civil Engineering.

Understanding and estimating the characteristics of carbon emissions for transit buses are critical in achieving a low-carbon transportation system. In this study, the changes in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions generated from new-energy buses as well as traditional diesel buses at bus stations, intersections, and road segments are compared using statistical analysis approaches; then the factors significantly affecting the emission rates are identified based on correlation analysis and feature selection methods. Finally, a gradient boosted regression tree (GBRT) model is proposed to conduct estimations for CO2 emission rates of buses. The results indicate that different sensitivities to various influencing factors exist in the carbon dioxide emissions of different types of buses. In addition, the VT-Micro regression method and Random forest technique were utilized to compare with the developed GBRT model. According to the comparison results, the estimation errors of GBRT fluctuate in a smaller range, suggesting that the GBRT model outperforms traditional approaches in emission estimation of carbon dioxide.

The results indicate that (1) the energy efficiency level of each province will be improved continuously under the influence of technology progress, and CO2 emissions in most provinces will reach the peak during the forecast period. (2) CO2 emissions of metal-manufacturing industries are the highest in all provinces, and the emissions of transportation service industries, construction industries, and other service industries show a trend of gradual increase from west to east. (3) Under the influence of the capital and technology, CO2 emissions caused by transportation service industries in eastern provinces will reach the peak earlier than those in central and western regions.

Here we use a one-dimensional energy balance model modified to include a simple runaway greenhouse (RGH) parameterization to explore the effects of these two parameters on the climate of Earth-like aqua planets - completely ocean-covered planets - orbiting F-, G-, K-, and M-dwarf stars. We find that the range of instellations for which planets exhibit habitable surface conditions throughout an orbit decreases with increasing eccentricity. However, the appearance of temporarily habitable conditions during an orbit creates an eccentric habitable zone (EHZ) that is sensitive to orbital eccentricity and obliquity, planetary latitude, and the spectral type of the host star. We find that the fraction of a planet's orbit over which it exhibits habitable surface conditions is larger on eccentric planets orbiting M-dwarf stars, due to the lower broadband planetary albedos of these planets. Planets with larger obliquities have smaller EHZs, but exhibit warmer climates if they do not enter a snowball state during their orbits. We also find no transient RGH state on planets at all eccentricities. Rather, planets spend their entire orbits either in an RGH or not. For G-dwarf planets receiving 100% of the modern solar constant and with eccentricities above 0.55, an entire Earth ocean inventory can be lost in 3.6 Gyr. M-dwarf planets, due to their larger incident X-ray and extreme ultraviolet flux, can become desiccated in only 690 Myr with eccentricities above 0.38. This work has important implications for eccentric planets that may exhibit surface habitability despite technically departing from the traditional habitable zone as they orbit their host stars. © 2020.

They are leached into building runoff and contribute to diffuse contamination of receiving waters. This review aimed at summarizing the current state of knowledge concerning the impact of biocides from buildings on the aquatic environment. The objectives were (i) to assess the key parameters influencing the leaching of biocides and to quantify their emission from buildings, (ii) to determine the different pathways from urban sources into receiving waters and (iii) to assess the associated environmental risk. Based on consumption data and leaching studies, a list of substances to monitor in receiving water was established. Literature review of their concentrations in the urban water cycle showed evidences of contamination and risk for aquatic life, which should put them into consideration for inclusion to European or international monitoring programs. However, some biocide concentration data in urban and receiving waters is still missing to fully assess their environmental risk, especially for isothiazolinones, iodopropynyl carbamate, zinc pyrithione and quaternary ammonium compounds, and little is known about their transformation products. Although some models supported by actual data were developed to extrapolate emissions on larger scales (watershed or city scales), they are not sufficient to prioritize the pathways of biocides from urban sources into receiving waters during both dry and wet weathers. Our review highlights the need to reduce emissions and limit their transfer into rivers and reports several solutions to address these issues. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biocides; Building materials; Leaching; Review; Risk assessment; Stormwater; Surface water; Wastewater","aquatic environment; climate conditions; concentration (composition); construction material; emission control; environmental risk; hydrological cycle; leaching; literature review; pesticide; pollutant source; runoff; stormwater; surface water; wastewater; wastewater treatment; Europe; disinfectant agent; building material; chemistry; city; water pollutant; weather; Cities; Construction Materials; Disinfectants; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Weather",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074526065

Fluent code is utilised as the simulation tool. In the first part of the study, four experiments were conducted using natural gas as fuel. A non-premixed burner and a back-pressure boiler were utilised as the experimental setup. The natural gas fuel consumption rate was changed between 22 Nm3/h and 51 Nm3/h. After the experimental studies, the numerical simulations were performed. The non-premixed combustion model with the steady laminar flamelet model (SFM) approach was used for the calculations. The methane-air extinction mechanism was utilised for the calculation of the chemical species. The numerical results were verified with the experimental results in terms of the flue gas emissions and flue gas temperature values. In the second part of the study, four different hydrogen-enriched methane combustion cases were simulated using the same methane-air extinction mechanism, which included the hydrogen oxidation mechanism as a sub mechanism. The same energy input (432 kW) was supplied into the boiler for all the studied cases. The obtained results show that the hydrogen addition to methane significantly change the diffusion flame structure in the combustion chamber. The hydrogen-enriched flames become broader and shorter with respect to the pure methane flame. This provides better mixing of the reactants and combustion products in the flame regions due to the use of a back-pressure boiler. In this way, the maximum flame temperature values and thermal NO emissions are reduced in the combustion chamber, when the hydrogen addition ratio is less than 15% by mass. The maximum temperature value is calculated as 2030 K for the case with 15% hydrogen addition ratio by mass, while it is 2050 K for the case without hydrogen enrichment. Therefore, it is determined that the hydrogen-enriched methane combustion in a back-pressure combustion chamber has the potential of reducing both the carbon and thermal NO emissions. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Diffusion flame structure; Hydrogen addition; Thermal NO emission","Boilers; Combustion chambers; Diffusion; Flame research; Flue gases; Gas emissions; Hydrogen; Methane; Natural gas; Diffusion Flame; Flue gas temperatures; Hydrogen addition; Laminar flamelet model; Maximum flame temperature; Maximum temperature value; NO emissions; Non-premixed combustion models; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074357895

Among these are achieving ambitious renewable energy targets at the lowest cost, reducing CO2-emissions and promoting technology improvement through learning-by-doing. Using a detailed country-level model of generation markets, we address the question of how policies that subsidize renewable energy (feed-in premia and renewable portfolio standards (RPSs)) versus capacity (investment subsidies) impact the mix of renewable investments, electricity costs, renewable share, the amount of subsidies, and consumer prices in the EU electric power market in 2030 and how they interact with other policies such as the EU ETS. Our analysis shows that subsidies of energy output are cost-effective for achieving renewable energy targets in the short run, whereas policies tied to capacity installation yield more investment and might be more effective in reducing technology costs in the longer term. The difference in costs between these two policy options diminish with higher CO2-prices. Although the differences are significant, they are smaller than cost impacts of other renewable policy design features, namely the effect of not allowing EU members to meet their individual targets by trading renewable credits with other member states. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity subsidy; Electricity markets; Energy subsidy; Renewable policy; Renewable target","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Gas emissions; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Benefits and costs; Capacity installation; Capacity subsidy; Electric power markets; Energy subsidies; Renewable policy; Renewable portfolio standard; Technology improvement; Investments; alternative energy; cost-benefit analysis; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy policy; European Union; investment; subsidy system; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076859406

Here, we measure a range of air pollutants in front and behind a hedge during the dormancy, greenup and part of the maturity vegetation cycle along with auxiliary variables. This is the first time a long time-series measuring multiple pollutants on both sides of a hedge is presented. This time-series allows assessing the influence of the annual vegetation cycle, wind direction and high versus low concentrations of both gaseous and particulate matter pollutants across a hedge. A marked jump in concentrations of particles happens after the hedge is greening up; this jump was not seen for gases. For example, a concentration difference for CO and PM1 of −8 %, −1 % for PM2.5 and −3 % for NO2 and +10 % for PM10 during dormancy and greenup was measured. At the beginning of the maturity phase, all three PM fractions experience a rapid increase in concentration difference, not seen for gases, to −52 % for PM1, −44 % for PM2.5 and −35 % for PM10. The effect of wind direction is shown to be minor.

Accelerated technological progress and policy implementations are required to deliver emissions reductions at rates sufficiently fast to avoid crossing dangerous tipping points in the Earth’s climate system. Here, we discuss and evaluate the potential of social tipping interventions (STIs) that can activate contagious processes of rapidly spreading technologies, behaviors, social norms, and structural reorganization within their functional domains that we refer to as social tipping elements (STEs). STEs are subdomains of the planetary socioeconomic system where the required disruptive change may take place and lead to a sufficiently fast reduction in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The results are based on online expert elicitation, a subsequent expert workshop, and a literature review. The STIs that could trigger the tipping of STE subsystems include 1) removing fossil-fuel subsidies and incentivizing decentralized energy generation (STE1, energy production and storage systems), 2) building carbon-neutral cities (STE2, human settlements), 3) divesting from assets linked to fossil fuels (STE3, financial markets), 4) revealing the moral implications of fossil fuels (STE4, norms and value systems), 5) strengthening climate education and engagement (STE5, education system), and 6) disclosing information on greenhouse gas emissions (STE6, information feedbacks).

Traditionally, the search for a compliant design is carried out in a manual one-at-a-time (OAT) approach where one design parameter is optimized before attention is shifted to the next one. In contrast, the Monte Carlo method makes it possible to combine many design parameters simultaneously and consider numerous input combinations. This paper presents a comparison of design approaches and their ability to optimize the performance of an office room with respect to energy demand and indoor climate. The test case is an office space with eight discretized inputs resulting in 93,750 possible designs. Bootstrapping is used to vary the baseline and fixing order for two systematic OAT approaches and to assess an increasing number of Monte Carlo samples. Summarily, OAT optimization depends heavily on the baseline and reveals only few, local optima close to this baseline, which are potentially far from the best solutions.

Previously, we showed that differences in tree species composition and canopy foliar nitrogen (N) concentrations correlated with differences in soil N availability in a mature Costa Rican rainforest. Here, we investigate potential mechanisms explaining this correlation. We used imaging spectroscopy to identify study plots containing 10–20 canopy trees with either high or low mean canopy N relative to the landscape mean. Plots were restricted to an uplifted terrace with relatively uniform parent material and climate. In order to assess whether canopy and soil N could be linked by litterfall inputs, we tracked litter production in the plots and measured rates of litter decay and the carbon and N content of leaf litter and leaf litter leachate. We also compared the abundance of putative N fixing trees and rates of free-living N fixation as well as soil pH, texture, cation exchange capacity, and topographic curvature to assess whether biological N fixation and/or soil properties could account for differences in soil N that were, in turn, imprinted on the canopy. We found no evidence of differences in legume communities, free-living N fixation, or abiotic properties. However, soils beneath high canopy N assemblages received ~ 60% more N via leaf litterfall due to variability in litter N content between plot types. The correlation of N in canopy leaves, leaf litter, and soil suggests that, under similar abiotic conditions, litterfall-mediated feedbacks can help maintain soil N differences among tropical tree assemblages in this diverse tropical forest. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Canopy chemistry; Carnegie airborne observatory; Imaging spectroscopy; Plant functional traits; Soil","cation exchange capacity; fertility; leaf litter; legume; nitrogen fixation; nutrient cycling; parent material; soil nutrient; tropical forest; Costa Rica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079453207

The frequency and intensity of WDR exposure are modified by climate change. Current approaches to exposure assessment emphasise prolonged exposure. Here, we propose indices to represent the exposure of cultural heritage to extreme WDR events. The indices are derived in two stages: (1) time-binning of long-term exposure, and (2) statistical representation of the occurrence of infrequent but intense events by fitting to the Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. A comparison to an existing exposure assessment procedure demonstrates that the proposed indices better represent shorter, more intense, and more consistent WDR events. Indices developed for seasons had greater statistical confidence than those developed for annual exposure. One index is contextualised within a model of a gutter on a terraced building: this converts the index from a measure of exposure to potential impact. This evaluation demonstrated the importance of maintenance to reduce the potential impact of WDR events. This work has direct and indirect implications for developing robust assessment procedures for cultural heritage exposure to extreme weather events. © 2020 by the authors.","Extreme value analysis; Historic buildings; Resilience; Risk assessment; Sustainability; WDR","Climate change; Extreme weather; Historic preservation; Rain; Sustainable development; Building performance; Extreme value analysis; Extreme weather events; Historic buildings; Resilience; Statistical confidence; Statistical representations; Wind-driven rain (WDR); Risk assessment; climate effect; extreme event; historic building; precipitation intensity; risk assessment; structural response; sustainability; wind velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081158905

Our current model of development poses significant challenges when it comes to achieving a more just society based on respect for nature and human rights, and demands a sustainable economy supported by a new circular model supporting the UN sustainable development goals. Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) accordingly have developed Master programs that are responsible for providing fundamental services in the joint effort towards sustainability. Meanwhile, leading Universities around the world have developed other very relevant programs. The open and unstructured challenge of sustainability poses an obstacle to existing academic structures. Specifically, the built environment is one of the leading contributors to challenges addressed in the programs such as: Anthropogenic climate change, resource depletion, waste generation and pollution, poverty, and inequity. The Interdisciplinary Sustainable Architecture lab (ISAlab) explores these issues as part of a multidisciplinary approach involving the collaboration of leading Universities from different areas on the world through an innovative initiative. This paper explores the experiences of the ISAlab workshop, which has been taking place yearly in Valencia since 2017. The workshop draws together students from a range of disciplines from across engineering and science, law and the social sciences and from a range of countries and backgrounds, including North and South America, Europe, and Asia. Its purpose is to facilitate a rich co-creative learning environment led by (engineering) academic faculties from across Europe (Spain, the UK, France, Germany, Netherlands and Ireland) as well as North America (the US and Canada), as well as local experts who helped provide participants with appropriate context and guidance. The objective is educating future engineers that are capable of finding robust ways to implement sustainability at a practical level on the built environment, taking account of the multidisciplinary perspective and with the incentive of solving real-life problems. © 2020 by the authors.","Multidisciplinary education; Project based learning; Sustainability education; Transdisciplinary education","academic research; anthropogenic effect; climate change; education; future prospect; human rights; learning; resource depletion; sustainability; sustainable development; United Nations; Asia; Canada; France; Germany; Ireland; Netherlands; North America; South America; United States; Valencia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081258616

The demo-scale plant is capable of treating 23.5 t d−1 of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) and is composed by the following main units: i) six SSBM reactors; ii) a hybrid reactor that can be operated either as SSBM or as thermal-drying reactor; iii) a completely mixed anaerobic reactor for leachate stabilization and inoculum production; and iv) units for biogas conditioning, treatment and utilization. The biogas produced in the TMethar system will be primarily used as fuel to run the combined heat and power (CHP) engine for electricity generation, but its use for biomethane production was also considered in this study. Much higher economic gains could be achieved with the use of biogas for biomethane production (€43.t−1OFMSW against €19.t−1OFMSW when used for electricity generation), the same occurs in terms of GHG reductions. The overall avoided GHG emissions achieved by replacing diesel by biomethane in the waste transportation trucks (537 kgCO2eq.t−1OFMSW) is over 14% higher than the GHG mitigation achieved by replacing electricity from the power grid to renewable electric energy produced in the CHP engine fuelled on biogas (462 kgCO2eq.t−1OFMSW). Overall, it can be concluded that both strategies for energy recovery from biogas produced in the TMethar would enable considerable environmental and economic benefits for the city of Rio de Janeiro. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biogas; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Organic fraction municipal solid waste (OFMSW); Renewable energies; Solid state anaerobic digestion (SSAD)","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Cogeneration plants; Economics; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Engines; Greenhouse gases; Leachate treatment; Recovery; Combined heat and power engines; Electricity generation; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Organic fraction of municipal solid wastes; Organic fractions; Renewable energies; Solid-state anaerobic digestions; Waste transportation; Municipal solid waste; alternative energy; anaerobic digestion; anoxic conditions; biogas; combined heat and power; economic conditions; electrical power; electricity; electricity generation; greenhouse gas; leachate; municipal solid waste; Brazil; Rio de Janeiro [Brazil]; Chandipura virus",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070725601

While other sources of PM have been regulated intensively during the past decades, RWC has been subject to only minor regulation despite of its impact on climate and health. This review covers recent research publications on RWC contributions to ambient PM in different regions of Europe, North America and Australasia, and on key species associated with RWC. Furthermore, factors governing emissions from wood stoves (as the typical appliance used in residential heating) are evaluated. State-of-the-art methods for estimating RWC as a source of ambient PM are discussed.

To assess the effects of air pollution, spatially explicit information of pollutants is needed. Atmospheric chemistry transport models are the best option to estimate concentrations and deposition of pollutants, from local to regional scales. However, concentration and deposition maps derived from available regional and global models are typically given at spatial resolutions of 10–50 km and do not contain information at sufficiently high spatial resolution (i.e. ≤ 5 km × 5 km) to identify risks and to develop solutions to protect the ecosystems and human health. Here, we provide deposition and concentration of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) at a 5 km × 5 km resolution for the western Iberian Peninsula. The new maps are a major improvement over existing information due to the higher spatial resolution. Comparison with measurements indicates that all maps for N compounds are fit for purpose. Nitrogen deposition in W Iberia ranged from 3 to 38.6 kg N·ha−1·year−1, averaging 8.2 kg N·ha−1·year−1 with a higher contribution from reduced N forms (62%). Deposition of oxidized forms mainly prevailed in urban and industrial areas and in coastal locations. The contribution of wet deposition was slightly higher (55%) than dry deposition and more important in the North, following the pattern of precipitation. Dry deposition is higher closer to emission sources. Due to their high spatial resolution, these maps can be used for policy development to support ecosystem protection, through the identification of areas at greater risk due to high N deposition. National policy efforts to reduce N pollution must, foremost, target ammonia (NH3) emissions in rural areas and oxidized nitrogen (NOx) emissions in urban and industrialized areas. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Acidification; Eutrophication; FRAME; High resolution; Iberian peninsula; Mediterranean","Acidification; Air quality; Ammonia; Atmospheric movements; Ecosystems; Eutrophication; Forestry; Health risks; Image resolution; Chemical transport models; Chemistry transport model; Comparison with measurements; Deposition and concentration; FRAME; High resolution; Iberian Peninsula; Mediterranean; Atmospheric chemistry; ammonia; nitrogen; sulfur; acidification; air quality; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); dry deposition; eutrophication; industrial emission; nitrogen; policy development; pollutant source; spatial resolution; urban pollution; air pollution; air quality; Article; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric transport; climate change; dry deposition; ecosystem; Europe; industrial area; nitrogen deposition; priority journal; risk assessment; urban area; wet deposition; Iberian Peninsula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078144524

To date, the literature covers mostly how aboveground (i.e. plant community structure) and belowground (i.e. plant-associated soil microbes) biota separately influence denitrification in isolation of each other. We here present a mesocosm experiment where we combine a manipulation of belowground biota (i.e. addition of Rhizophagus irregularis propagules to the indigenous mycorrhizal community) with a realized gradient in plant diversity. We used a seed mix containing plant species representative of mesophytic European grasslands and by stochastic differences in species establishment across the sixteen replicates per treatment level a spontaneously established gradient in plant diversity. We address mycorrhizal-induced and plant-diversity mediated changes on denitrification potential parameters and how these differ from the existing literature that studies them independently of each other.

This study uses process and heat integration methods in combination with a supply chain evaluation to analyse full value chains of biomass-based gases for fossil gas replacement within the iron and steel industry. The study is carried out as a specific case study in order to understand the implications of utilizing bio-syngas/bio-SNG as heating fuels in iron- and steel-making, and to provide insights into the most sensitive parameters involved in fuel switching. The results show a significant cost difference in the fuel production of the two gas products owing to higher capital and biomass use in the bio-SNG value chain option.

Attempts were made to demonstrate the progress of the soil cover restoration process about 200 years after the landslides and associated with changes in vegetation and soil microarthropod biodiversity and occurrence pattern associated with the restoration of soil cover. Material and methods: The study covered mountain fen of the Caltho-Alnetum in the Babiogórski National Park in Outer Flysch Carpathians, Poland, where ancient landslide deposits are causing disturbance in fen hydrologic regime and over time related to various rate of fen area natural restoration processes. The drill test has been used to assess changes in layering and thickness of the fen soils. The following soil parameters, such as pH and total organic carbon content, were determined at each distinguish layer. The diversity and distribution pattern of soil microarthropods, represented by Collembola, was examined in two parts of the fen: restored and not-restored. The soil parameters, such as pH, electrical conductivity, total exchangeable base, total organic carbon, and nitrogen content, were determined in the soil samples simultaneously. The assessment of the vegetation structure recovery within studied mountain fen after landslide was referred to average parameters of the community completed for other natural mountain fens under the Caltho-Alnetum community. The research results were statistically verified. Results and discussion: The test drillings showed that landslides change soil layering, site-specific soil properties of mountain fen such as chemistry (the statistically significant differences were noted only in the case of total organic carbon content), vegetation structure, and soil microarthropod communities. By changing site-specific conditions, landslides influence on the biodiversity and peatland ecosystems functioning. Conclusion: Our results clearly demonstrate that the landslide itself initiated a complex and lengthy process of changes in biological aspects of peatlands including the biodiversity of the underground fauna and plant community. Soil microarthropod communities represented by Collembola can be used as a good indicator of mountain fen restoration process. © 2019, The Author(s).","Mass movements; Mountain peatlands; Springtails; Vegetation","antipredator defense; biodiversity; community composition; fen; insect; landslide; mountain environment; peatland; soil cover; soil fauna; vegetation structure; Carpathians; Poland [Central Europe]; Collembola; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072118553

Climate risks on agriculture can be managed by moving production to other areas, but this may be costly and reduce profitability if climatic conditions are dynamic. Here, we test whether integrating spatial diversification and climate information could minimize climate risk, while not sacrificing profitability. We use 27 years of farm business profit and climate data (1991–2018) from four of Australia’s most climatically diverse regions where grazing underpins socioeconomic activity. We show that spatial diversification coupled with seasonal climate information from El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) provides better estimates of optimized risk-profit tradeoffs in different ENSO years compared to estimates without climate information. Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) (a measure of financial risk) is lower when climate information is used in El Niño (1.23 $/ha), La Niña (1.19 $/ha), and Neutral years (1.22 $/ha), compared to when no climate information (1.57 $/ha) is used. When targeting high profits, CVaR is reduced by 15, 86, and 22% in El Niño, La Niña, and Neutral years, respectively, compared to a 5% reduction when no climate information is used. When aiming to minimize CVaR in drought (El Niño), profit is higher using climate-informed spatial diversification (expected profits of 2.71 $/ha), relative to when it is not (expected profits of 2.30 $/ha). Climate-informed spatial diversification also provides options to graziers to achieve much higher gains (expected profits of up to ~ 4.13 $/ha) under La Niña versus 2.62 $/ha when no climate information is used. Here, we show for the first time that seasonal climate information coupled with spatial diversification can provide strategies to help graziers reduce risk and increase profitability. Our approach is applicable to other parts of the world and could be used to decrease climate risk and increase profitability for other agricultural sectors exposed to variable climatic conditions. © 2020, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Agricultural risk management; Australia; Conditional value-at-risk; Copula; ENSO; Geographical diversification; Grazing; Portfolio optimization","drought; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; geographical distribution; geographical variation; grazing; optimization; profitability; risk assessment; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078495143

Plant response to climate through time is commonly investigated with leaf physiognomy, but anatomical response has not been well studied. Here, we use Metasequoia (Cupressaceae) to investigate leaf anatomical response to climate over geologic time. We establish the link between leaf anatomy and climate for extant Metasequoia and apply the results to the fossil Metasequoia milleri to examine climatic niche shift through time. Methodology. Leaves of extant Metasequoia glyptostroboides collected across climate gradients in North America, Asia, and Europe and leaves of extinct M. milleri from the Eocene Princeton Chert locality were studied. Leaf anatomical traits—cross-sectional area, resin canal area, vascular bundle area, and leaf thickness and width—of extant and extinct Metasequoia were measured, analyzed using principal components analysis (PCA), and tested for relationships with 19 bioclimatic variables in a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Fossil climate variables estimated from CCA results were compared with independent paleoclimate proxy estimates. Pivotal results. All measured anatomical traits statistically differ between extinct and extant Metasequoia, and the two species do not overlap in leaf anatomical morphospace. Measured traits of extant Metasequoia were found to correlate with several climate variables grouped into six climate groupings. Leaf width and cross-sectional area correlated with high cold-season precipitation, vascular bundle area with high warm-season precipitation, leaf thickness with mild cold-season temperatures and high mean annual temperatures, and resin canal area with daily temperature fluctuations and mild cold-season temperatures. Estimated paleoclimates based on the leaf anatomy–climate model were similar to independent proxy estimates. Conclusions. A relationship between leaf traits and climate was found that supports different leaf anatomical morphospaces and climatic niches for both species of Metasequoia that were tested, despite previous hypotheses of static morphology within Metasequoia. Testing interactions between climate and anatomy could improve paleoenvironmental inferences from fossil conifers. © 2020 by The University of Chicago.

In anoxic sediments of a sulfate-impacted wetland-stream system in Minnesota (USA), a reactive transport model calibrated to geochemical observations predicted sulfate reduction to be the major terminal electron accepting process, and it showed that anaerobic oxidation of methane predominantly coupled with sulfate reduction attenuated methane concentrations near the sediment-water interface. Consistent with model results, 16S rRNA microbiome analysis revealed a high relative abundance of taxa capable of dissimilatory sulfate reduction. It further supported the conclusion that high simulated sulfate reduction rates could be maintained by a “cryptic” sulfur cycle coupled to iron and methane. Low relative abundance of known iron reducing bacteria raised the possibility of abiotic ferric iron (Fe) reduction driving sulfide reoxidation to intermediate-valence sulfur forms; widespread potential for microbially mediated disproportionation, oxidation, and reduction of sulfur intermediates provided mechanisms for completing redox cycles; and archaea comprising up to 25% of the microbial community could include consortia capable of anaerobic oxidation of methane. These biogeochemical processes were found to be controlled by hyporheic fluxes. Lower-magnitude fluxes in wetland compared to channel sediments created sharper geochemical gradients that generated greater heterogeneity in microbial distributions and reaction rates. Changes in upward flux caused fluctuations in sulfate concentrations that led to alternating simulations of methane production and transport. Our work supports the importance of hyporheic flux-driven iron-sulfur-methane cycling in sulfate-impacted wetlands and prompts further investigations under freshwater conditions. ©2020.

New Hydrological Insights for the Region: The results indicate that the future catchment water balance for KRB under RCP4.5 will have insignificant variation from the current catchment water balance as annual statistics show that rainfall will reduce by 1 % while water yield and runoff will increase by 5 % and 6 % respectively. Meanwhile under RCP8.5, annual statistics show that rainfall will increase by 19 % while water yield and runoff will increase by 40 % and 65 % respectively and resulting in a significant increase in catchment water balance. © 2019 The Authors","Catchment Water balance; Global climate models; KRB; Simulations; Water resources",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076400519

Two vehicle test cycles, the congested urban (NIER03) and rural modes (NIER09), which reflect vehicle driving patterns in Korea, were tested with varying ethanol contents of gasoline (E0), and low- (E10), medium- (E30 and E50), and high-ethanol blended fuels (E85). The particle number (PN) concentration from E0 was substantially reduced by one or two orders of magnitude with medium- or high-ethanol blended fuels, respectively. The E10 fuel showed the highest PN concentration because of the physicochemical mixture properties of the azeotropic characteristics. As the ethanol fraction increased, the particle sizes shifted to smaller sizes that were dependent on the vehicle test modes and oxygen proportions in the fuels. The regulated and unregulated emissions showed close relationships with the vehicle test modes and ethanol blends. Vehicle running with frequent idle-stops at an extremely low speed and dynamic transient driving under NIER03 showed higher BTEX emissions than the NIER09 mode, and produced lower emission levels due to the higher oxygen and lower aromatic proportions of the ethanol blends. Compared to the NIER03 mode, the CO2 emissions and FEs under the NIER09 mode were substantially improved, with a higher vehicle speed and more energy efficient engine operation points. The low energy contents of the E85 fuel resulted in slight increases in the CO2 emissions and reductions in the FEs of the NIER modes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","BTEX compounds; Ethanol-gasoline blends; Gasoline direct injection; In-use vehicle test modes; Particle number","Carbon dioxide; Dynamometers; Energy efficiency; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Fuel economy; Gasoline; Oxygen; Particulate emissions; Physicochemical properties; BTEX compounds; Ethanol gasoline blend; Gasoline direct injection; Particle numbers; Vehicle tests; Direct injection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074500843

Unlike prior well-studied group VII catalysts, Mn(CO)3CNCBnX is extraordinarily active, while the new Re(CO)3CNCBnX complex surprisingly does not exhibit catalytic response. DFT calculations shed light on this puzzling behavior and show that the redox-active pyridine-2,6-bis-N-heterocyclic carbene ligand facilitates the reduction of the ground-state complexes; however, the extent of electronic delocalization in the reduced intermediates differs in the degree of metalloradical character. The highly-active Mn(CO)3CNCBnX complex proceeds through an intermediate with nucleophilic metalloradical character in which 66% of the unpaired electron spin resides on Mn. In contrast, Re(CO)3CNCBnX reduction proceeds through an intermediate with less metalloradical character in which only 38% of the unpaired spin is localized on Re with the remainder delocalized over the ligand. The energetic penalty of the electron delocalization of an electron on the ligand affects the M-CO bond strengths and related kinetic barriers. We discuss these observations in the context of turnover-enabling effects in CO2 reductions mediated by group VII NHC pincer molecular electrocatalysts.

The aim of this study has been to investigate the use of green roofs as a strategy to reduce the urban heat island effect and to improve the thermal comfort of indoor and outdoor environments. The effects of the built-up environment, the presence of vegetation and green roofs, and the urban morphology of the city of Turin (Italy) have been assessed considering the land surface temperature distribution. This analysis has considered all the information recorded by the local weather stations and satellite images, and compares it with the geometrical and typological characteristics of the city in order to find correlations that confirm that greenery and vegetation improve the livability of an urban context. The results demonstrate that the land-surface temperature, and therefore the air temperature, tend to decrease as the green areas increase. This trend depends on the type of urban context. Based on the results of a green-roofs investigation of Turin, the existing and potential green roofs are respectively almost 300 (257,380 m2) and 15,450 (6,787,929 m2). Based on potential assessment, a strategy of priority was established according to the characteristics of building, to the presence of empty spaces, and to the identification of critical areas, in which the thermal comfort conditions are poor with low vegetation. This approach can be useful to help stakeholders, urban planners, and policy makers to effectively mitigate the urban heat island (UHI), improve the livability of the city, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and gain thermal comfort conditions, and to identify policies and incentives to promote green roofs. © 2020 by the authors.","3D city model; Energy savings; Geographic information system; Green roofs; Satellite images; Thermal comfort; Urban heat island; Urban morphology","3D modeling; Energy conservation; Gas emissions; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Image enhancement; Land surface temperature; Landforms; Morphology; Roofs; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Thermal comfort; Thermal pollution; Urban planning; Vegetation; 3D city modeling; Green roof; Satellite images; Urban heat island; Urban morphology; Atmospheric temperature; energy conservation; GIS; heat island; roof; satellite imagery; temperature effect; urban morphology; vegetation structure; weather station; Italy; Piedmont [Italy]; Torino [Piedmont]; Turin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081158925

This points to a potential bistability of Earth's climate that can have at least two different (statistical) equilibrium states for the same external forcing (i.e. solar radiation). Here, we explore the probability of finding bistable climates in Earth-like exoplanets and consider the properties of planetary climates obtained by varying the semimajor orbital axis (thus, received stellar radiation), eccentricity and obliquity, and atmospheric pressure. To this goal, we use the Earth-like planet surface temperature model (ESTM), an extension of one-dimensional Energy Balance Models developed to provide a numerically efficient climate estimator for parameter sensitivity studies and long climatic simulations. After verifying that the ESTM is able to reproduce Earth climate bistability, we identify the range of parameter space where climate bistability is detected. An intriguing result of this work is that the planetary conditions that support climate bistability are remarkably similar to those required for the sustenance of complex, multicellular life on the planetary surface. The interpretation of this result deserves further investigation, given its relevance for the potential distribution of life in exoplanetary systems. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society","Astrobiology; Planets; Planets and satellites:physical evolution; Satellites:terrestial planets",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082694015

We assess how mercury emissions and deposition reductions from national climate policy in China under the Paris Agreement could contribute to the country's commitments under the Minamata Convention. We examine emissions under climate policy scenarios developed using a computable general equilibrium model of China's economy, end-of-pipe control scenarios that meet China's commitments under the Minamata Convention, and these policies in combination, and evaluate deposition using a global atmospheric transport model. We find climate policy in China can provide mercury benefits when implemented with Minamata policy, achieving in the year 2030 approximately 5% additional reduction in mercury emissions and deposition in China when climate policy achieves a 5% reduction per year in carbon intensity (CO2 emissions 9.7 Gt in 2030). This corresponds to 63 Mg additional mercury emissions reductions in 2030 when implemented with Minamata Convention policy, compared to Minamata policy implemented alone. Climate policy provides emissions reductions in sectors not considered under the Minamata Convention, such as residential combustion. This changes the combination of sectors that contribute to emissions reductions.

The study focuses on the Deep Dip campaigns of the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN mission (MAVEN) and used the in-situ measurements of neutral density profiles, solar flux and electron temperatures from instruments onboard MAVEN as input to the model. An energy deposition model is employed for calculating the attenuated photon flux and photoelectron flux at different altitudes in the ionosphere. The Analytical Yield Spectrum approach is used for calculating the photoelectron fluxes. Volume production rates of major primary ions, CO2 +, CO+, O+, C+, N2 +, and N+, due to photon and photoelectron impact are calculated and used as input to the model in which ion-neutral chemistry in the dayside ionosphere is simulated. The modeled ion profiles are compared with the ion mode observations of Neutral Gas Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) and electron density estimates from Langmuir Probe and Waves (LPW). The model could reproduce the observed structure of the major ion profiles O2 +, CO2 +, and electron density reasonably well. However, when the magnitudes are compared, the modeled values are roughly a factor of 2 larger than observation. By reducing the neutral CO2 density, the model outputs and the observed ion profiles and electron density profile can become closer. The model also calculated the densities of 11 other ions, viz. N+, C+, O+, NO+, N2H+, HCO+, N2 +, CO+, OCOH+, HNO+, and OH+. Profiles of each of these ions are compared with the NGIMS observations during the respective orbits and are discussed in detail. Such a comparison for the deep dip periods is reported for the first time, which showcases the level of the current understanding of the ion chemistry in the Martian ionosphere. © 2019",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073817932

Climate extremes have been linked to adverse economic outcomes. Hence, adaptation is a key component of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreements and development assistance. Effective climate adaptation policy requires an understanding of how temperature and rainfall variability affect migration patterns. Yet, how individuals in developing countries manage climate variation is poorly understood, especially in Africa. Combining high-resolution climate data with panel micro-data on migration, labor participation, and demographics, we employ regression analysis to assess temporary migration responses to local temperature and precipitation anomalies in four East African countries. We find that climate impacts are most pronounced in urban areas, with a standard deviation temperature increase and rainfall decrease leading to respective 10 and 12 percent declines in out-migration relative to mean values. Evidence from other labor market outcomes suggests that urban out-migration is not associated with reduced local employment opportunities. Instead, declines in urban out-migration appear to coincide with negative local climate employment impacts. These results challenge the narrative that temporary out-migration serves as a safety valve during climate extremes and that climate change will most strongly affect out-migration rates from rural areas in developing countries. © 2019 The Authors","Adaptation; Africa; Climate; Temporary migration","climate variation; developing world; labor migration; migration determinant; nature-society relations; regression analysis; rural area; twenty first century; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; East Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073973982

In addressing this challenge, Tanzania has embarked on ambitious program to expand the sugar industry by establishment of new sugar estates. In view of climate change challenges, the program should be aligned to the future conditions which will have bearing on the profitability of investments. A study was conducted to assess the effect of climate change on agricultural droughts in terms of water deficit index (WDI), throughout the near-term (2010–2039) at the newly established Mkulazi II Sugar Estate at Dakawa, Mvomero District Tanzania, under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Baseline climate indicates serious drought risk for sugarcane crop for months of July through November when WDI ≥ 0.75, and low risk during rainy season (March–May). Near-term period will become drier than the baseline climate for months of May–December while drought will subside during January–April with respect to the baseline climate. The projected changes in water deficit at the study site point to two facts: One is that rainfed production will not be possible, considering the projected decline in short rains (October–December), and the other is that water demand, in terms of crop water requirement, will increase due to increased drought conditions. In order to sustain sugarcane yields in the future, there will be a need to design an irrigation system that accounts for the climate change challenges. © 2019, Society for Sugar Research & Promotion.","AgMIP; Climate change; Drought; Sugarcane; Tanzania",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069200063

Climate change is bringing about shifts in flowering time caused by adaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity, but their relative contributions and effects are poorly understood. This is especially critical in Mediterranean alpine species, which experience steep environmental gradients at short distances characteristic of alpine environments and an intense summer drought period derived from the Mediterranean climate. Moreover, tracking climate change through migration to higher elevations is not always possible for alpine species since many already find their optimal niche at mountain summits. In this study, we aimed to determine if flowering phenology is genetically differentiated among populations inhabiting contrasting environmental conditions and ascertain if it has been subjected to past selection. This knowledge is crucial to understanding adaptation of alpine plants to current environmental gradients and to provide insight about what adaptations may be necessary to cope with future and ongoing climate warming. We used a common garden experiment to analyze genetic differentiation in phenological traits of nine populations of Silene ciliata Pourret (Caryophyllaceae) distributed at two environmentally differentiated areas (optimal and marginal habitat suitability) in three mountain ranges of Central Spain. Environmentally optimal areas for this species are close to the mountain tops, whereas marginal areas are found at the lower distribution edge. We also studied the relation between neutral genetic differentiation (FST) and quantitative trait differentiation (PST) to infer past selection on characters under contrasting environmental conditions. We found genetic differentiation for the onset, peak and end of flowering between populations in optimal and marginal areas in the presence of substantial gene flow. This finding highlights the strong diverging selection pressures between the different Mediterranean alpine environments. We also found evidence of past diversifying selection for flowering peak and end of flowering. This evidence of past adaptation in addition to adaptive phenotypic plasticity to advance flowering dates under warmer temperatures suggest that adaptation of flowering phenology to current and future warming should be feasible, especially for populations inhabiting optimal areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Alpine ecosystems; Environmental gradients; Local adaptation; Past selection; Phenology","alpine environment; climate change; drought; environmental conditions; environmental gradient; phenology; phenotypic plasticity; warming; Spain; Caryophyllaceae; Silene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073003459

These systems require a higher material supply than conventional ones. Particularly, they require more copper. The production of this metal, however, is intensive in energy consumption and emissions. Therefore, renewable energy systems must be used to improve the environmental performance of copper production. We cover the current state of research and develop recommendations for the design of renewable energy systems for copper production. To complement our analysis, we also consider studies from other industries and regional energy systems. We provide six recommendations for future modeling: (a) current energy demand models for copper production are overly simplistic and need to be enhanced for planning with high levels of renewable technologies; (b) multi-vector systems (electricity, heat, and fuels) need to be explicitly modeled to capture the readily available flexibility of the system; (c) copper production is done in arid regions, where water supply is energy-intensive, then, water management should be integrated in the overall design of the energy system; (d) there is operational flexibility in existing copper plants, which needs to be better understood and assessed; (e) the design of future copper mines should adapt to the dynamics of available renewable energy sources; and (f) life cycle impacts of the components of the system need to be explicitly minimized in the optimization models. Researchers and decision-makers from the copper and energy sector will benefit from this comprehensive review and these recommendations. We hope it will accelerate the deployment of renewables, particularly in the copper industry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Copper production; Energy systems design; Optimization; Renewable energy systems; Renewables in mining","Climate change; Copper metallurgy; Copper mines; Copper smelting; Decision making; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Systems analysis; Water management; Water supply; Climate change mitigation; Copper production; Energy systems; Environmental performance; Methodological approach; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy systems; Renewables; Life cycle",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075435575

Lake Road, Merced, CA  95343, United States","Many studies have examined the impact of dispersal on local adaptation, but much less attention has been paid to how local adaptation influences range shifts. The aim of this study was to test how local adaptation might affect climate-driven range shifts in plants, and if this might differ between plants with different life histories. Simulated range shift dynamics were compared for hypothetical annual, perennial and tree species, each comprised of either one plastic genotype or six locally adapted genotypes. The landscape consists of shifting climate bands made up of 20 × 20 m patches containing multiple individuals. Effects of seed dispersal, breadth of the plastic species' tolerance, steepness of the climate gradient and rate of the climate shift are also examined. Local adaptation increased the equilibrium range size and aided range shifts by boosting fitness near range edges. However, when the rate of climate change was doubled on a steep gradient, locally adapted trees exhibited a higher percent loss of range during the climate shift. The plastic annual species with short dispersal was unable to recover its range size even after the climate stabilized, while the locally adapted annuals tracked climate change well. The results suggest that in most situations local adaptation and longer dispersal distances will be advantageous, though not necessarily sufficient, for tracking suitable climates. However, local adaptation might put species with long generation times at greater risk when climate shifts are very rapid. If confirmed by empirical tests, these results suggest that identifying variation between species in how fitness varies along climate gradients and in these key demographic rates might aid in prioritizing management actions. © 2020 The Author(s).

Electric transport technology presents more efficient means of energy conversion in vehicles: electric (EV), hybrid (VH), and hybrid electric (HEV) vehicles. For example, the energy storage system in the latter can be made up of ultracapacitors (UCs), batteries (Bs), and fuel cells. This work focuses on HEVs powered by batteries and ultracapacitors. In particular, the multiple converter configuration (C-CM) for the HEV powertrain system is analyzed using electric models of the vehicle powertrain components. To analyze the multiple converter configuration, parameters of a vehicle taken from the literature and the electrical model of the configuration were developed. With the above, the proposed configuration was evaluated before driving cycles (CITY II and ECE) and the configuration performance was compared with respect to other configurations. In the C-CM model, limitations in the choice of the number of Bs and UCs were observed in the powertrain depending on the maximum power of both energy sources and vehicle load demand. The results show that more energy is extracted from the batteries in the ECE cycle than in the CITY taking into account that the batteries are used as the main power source. C-CM results compared to other configurations show that energy extracted from batteries in the CITY is the same across all configurations. While energy consumption is lower in the ECE, C-CM results were not very significant compared to other configurations. However, the C-MC has the advantage of having better power flow control due to having two converters, thus improving HEV safety. © 2020 by the authors.","Batteries; Electric vehicle; Multiple converter configuration; Powertrain; Ultracapacitors",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081275258

However, due to the complexity of its intrinsic characteristics, there are still several factors to bear in mind when selecting the appropriate carbon support. In this work we demonstrate that the remaining sulfur impurities in one type of commercial carbon nanofibers (CNFs) drastically alter the catalytic properties of palladium by triggering electro-deficient active sites. Two as-received CNFs thermally processed at different severity degrees, namely PS and HHT, were used to support Pd nanoparticles through the wet impregnation technique using palladium nitrate as precursor. The proof of principle is demonstrated through two transformation reactions of biomass platform molecules: the hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, performed in a batch-type reactor, and the ethanol dehydrogenation/decarbonylation reaction, carried out in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor. In both reactions, Pd/PS was substantially more selective than its sulfur-free counterpart Pd/HHT, and one of the most selective in comparison with the state-of-the-art Pd catalysts. This finding makes available a simple, easy and green strategy to design carbon-supported Pd catalysts for selective hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"Bioethanol; Carbon nanofibers; Catalyst selectivity; Chemical reactors; Dehydrogenation; Fixed platforms; Hydrogenation; Nanocatalysts; Palladium compounds; Sulfur; 5 hydroxymethyl furfurals; Carbon-supported Pd; Catalytic properties; Dehydrogenation reactions; Ethanol dehydrogenation; Intrinsic characteristics; Selective hydrogenation; Transformation Reactions; Catalyst supports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073268717

This review paper considers the physiological importance of the more abundant CA isoforms in photosynthesis, through their effects on CO2 diffusion and other processes in photosynthetic organisms. In plants, CA has multiple isoforms in three different families (α, β and γ) and is mainly known to catalyze the CO2 ↔ HCO- 3 equilibrium. This reversible conversion has a clear role in photosynthesis, primarily through sustaining the CO2 concentration at the site of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). Despite showing the same major reaction mechanism, the three main CA families are evolutionarily distinct. For different CA isoforms, cellular localization and total gene expression as a function of developmental stage are predicted to determine the role of each family in relation to the net assimilation rate. Reaction–diffusion modeling and observational evidence support a role for CA activity in reducing resistance to CO2 diffusion inside mesophyll cells by facilitating CO2 transfer in both gas and liquid phases. In addition, physical and/or biochemical interactions between CAs and other membrane-bound compartments, for example aquaporins, are suggested to trigger a CO2-sensing response by stomatal movement. In response to environmental stresses, changes in the expression level of CAs and/or stimulated deactivation of CAs may correspond with lower photosynthetic capacity. We suggest that further studies should focus on the dynamics of the relationship between the activity of CAs (with different subcellular localization, abundance and gene expression) and limitations due to CO2 diffusivity through the mesophyll and supply of CO2 to photosynthetic reactions. © 2019 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","carbonic anhydrase families; chloroplast; CO2 conductance; g m; gene expression; metalloenzyme; photosynthetic capacity; Populus","Carbon dioxide; Diffusion; Gene expression; Photosynthesis; Biochemical interactions; chloroplast; Metalloenzymes; Photosynthetic capacity; Photosynthetic organisms; Photosynthetic reaction; Populus; Subcellular localizations; Carbonic anhydrase; Conductivity; Diffusion; Paper; Photosynthesis; Plants; Processes; Review; Supply; carbon dioxide; carbonate dehydratase; plant protein; genetics; mesophyll cell; metabolism; multigene family; photosynthesis; physiology; Populus; Carbon Dioxide; Carbonic Anhydrases; Mesophyll Cells; Multigene Family; Photosynthesis; Plant Proteins; Populus",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077923599

Grounded in these direct links between sustainability and energy use, this paper evaluates energy efficiency at TSU. The aim of the applied case study is to inventory current (business as usual) energy consumption levels at TSU, and to understand how those levels might change under a regime of more sustainable energy technology. The paper performs financial analysis to show that selected sustainable energy projects can not only reduce energy use at TSU, and thereby strengthen the University's commitment to sustainability. Sustainable energy projects will also save the University money in the long run. The case study draws on a sample of the 13 on-campus buildings with the highest current levels of energy consumption. The approach of the paper is to determine the level of attractiveness of investing in new technology by calculating the Net Present Value (NPV) in terms of financial savings every year (simple payback) or a more extended period (cash flow model). The environmental impact is calculated in terms of CO2 emission based on Scope 2 methodology. We find that TSU could achieve annual electricity savings of 15,391,436 kWh (17% of its annual energy costs) from implementing selected projects and save more than $1,000,000 in annual costs. Overall, TSU could reduce CO2 emissions by 12,561.81 metric tons. The shortest payback period belongs to the pump replacement, and the most significant annual kWh saving is represented by the replacement of the lighting system. Solar panel installation has the highest upfront investment reaching more than $7 million, while its implementation will bring the highest environmental impact by avoiding 2926.81 metric tonnes of CO2 every year. However, the recommended minimum cost of energy at 14–16 (¢/kWh) for solar panel implementation cannot compete with the 8 cents per kWh paid for the electricity at San Marcos. The findings have immediate practical relevance for campus planning at TSU, and the methods are replicable and extendable for use by practitioners and researchers at other Universities or large institutions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emission; Energy efficiency; Financial analysis; Scope 2; Sustainability; Sustainability in higher education; University energy consumption","Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Sustainable development; CO2 emissions; Energy efficiency assessment; Financial analysis; Higher education; Scope 2; Sustainable energy projects; Sustainable energy technology; The net present value (NPV); Investments; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; energy efficiency; higher education; renewable resource; sustainability; university sector; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075506372

People's perception of urban air pollution can verify policy effectiveness and gauge acceptability of policies. As a serious health issue in Asian cities, population may express concern or uncertainty for air pollution risk by performing search on the web to seek answers. A g€ social sensing' approach that monitors such search queries, may assess people' perception about air pollution as a risk. We hypothesize that trend and volume of searches show impact of air pollution on general population. The objectives of this research are to identify those atmospheric conditions under which relative search volume (RSV) obtained from Google Trends shows correlation with measured fine aerosol concentration, and to compare search volume sensitivity to rise in aerosol concentration in seven Asian megacities. We considered weekly relative search volumes from Google Trends (GT) for a four year period from January, 2015 to December, 2018 representing diverse PM2.5 concentrations. Search volumes for keywords corresponding to perception of air quality (air pollution') and health effects (cough' and asthma') were considered. To represent PM2.5 we used fine aerosol indicator developed in an earlier research. The results suggest that tendency to search for air pollution' and cough' occurs when AirRGB R is in excess and temperature is below the baseline values. Consistent with this, in cities with high baseline concentrations, sensitivity to rise in AirRGB R is also comparatively lower. The result of this study can used as an indirect measure of awareness in the form of perception and sensitivity of population to air quality. Such an analysis could be useful for forecasting health risks specially in cities lacking dedicated services. © 2020 Authors.","AirRGB; developing countries; MODIS AOD; perception of air pollution; sensitivity; time series","Aerosols; Air quality; Developing countries; Health; Health risks; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Time series; Aerosol concentration; AirRGB; Atmospheric conditions; Base-line concentrations; MODIS AOD; Remote sensing satellites; sensitivity; Urban air pollution; Remote sensing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081568921

Since wind power is not fully dispatchable, the accuracy of wind forecasts is a key element for the electric system operators, as it strongly affects the decision-making processes. The planning horizon can be short term (1 -3 months) and long-term (6–12 months) depending on the process. The objective of this paper is to conduct a performance comparison of five deep learning models each combined with three types of data pre-processing and used for short term and long-term multi-variate predictions. The input data are time series of the wind power capacity factor and the temperature. In addition, this paper sets out to demonstrate and review the state-of-the-art deep learning models for prediction with a secondary objective to present the reader a reference point to better understand which model to choose and what factors are significant. The first contribution of this paper is to apply, assess and compare a selection of the novel and cutting-edge deep learning models for multi-variate prediction. Multi-variate predication is achieved through a proposed multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) architecture. Compared to traditional prediction models, machine learning techniques have the advantage of generalization. Among various techniques deep learning is particularly getting more attention due to the applicability to various dataset such as numerical and character. This investigation focuses on five models — Deep Feed Forward (DFF), Deep Convolutional Network (DCN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Attention mechanism (Attention) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM). The second contribution is to propose a novel approach to transform the time series dataset to signal for input and reconstruct the model predictions through inverse transformation, by means of the so-called discrete wavelet transformation and fast Fourier transformation. The different models are assessed also by comparing their performance with and without the input dataset manipulation through wavelet and FFT transformation. Beyond that, the model performances are outlined in detail, to give the reader an overview of the models to choose from for short-term or long-term prediction. The results demonstrate that the Attention and DCN perform best with Wavelet or FFT signal, whereas some other models perform better with no data preprocessing. © 2019","Multi-variate prediction; Performance evaluation and comparison; Short and long term prediction; Time series to frequency transformation; Unsupervised machine learning; Wind power forecasting","Climate change; Convolutional neural networks; Data handling; Decision making; Discrete wavelet transforms; Electric power generation; Fast Fourier transforms; Feedforward neural networks; Fourier series; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Signal reconstruction; Time series; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Frequency transformations; Long-term prediction; Performance evaluation and comparison; Unsupervised machine learning; Wind power forecasting; Deep learning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080072375

Ultrafine particles, like those in diesel exhaust emissions, are a major source of nanoparticles in urban environments, and it is these particles that have the capacity to induce the most significant health effects. Research has shown that diesel exhaust exposure can have many detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system both acutely and chronically. This review provides an overview of the cardiovascular effects on PM in air pollution, with an emphasis on ultrafine particles in vehicle exhaust. We consider the biological mechanisms underlying these cardiovascular effects of PM and postulate that cardiovascular dysfunction may be implicated in the effects of PM in other organ systems.

Initial conditions and very early stages of star formation can be probed through spectroscopic observations of deuterated molecular species Aims. We aim to determine the ortho-H2D+ properties (e.g. column density and fractional abundance with respect to H2) in a sample of dense cores in the Orion B9 star-forming filament, and to compare those with the previously determined source characteristics, in particular with the gas kinetic temperature, [N2D+]/[N2H+] deuterium fractionation, and level of CO depletion. Methods. We used the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope to observe the 372 GHz o-H2D+(JKa, Kc = 11, 0-11, 1) line towards three prestellar cores and three protostellar cores in Orion B9. We also employed our previous APEX observations of C17O, C18O, N2H+, and N2D+ line emission, and 870 μm dust continuum emission towards the target sources. Results. The o-H2D+(11, 0-11, 1) line was detected in all three prestellar cores, but in only one of the protostellar cores. The corresponding o-H2D+ abundances were derived to be ∼ (12-30) × 10-11 and ∼ 6 × 10-11. Two additional spectral lines, DCO+(5-4) and N2H+(4-3), were detected in the observed frequency bands with high detection rates of 100 and 83%, respectively. We did not find any significant correlations among the explored parameters, although our results are mostly consistent with theoretical expectations. Also, the Orion B9 cores were found to be consistent with the relationship between theo-H2D+ abundance and gas temperature obeyed by other low-mass dense cores. The o-H2D+ abundance was found to decrease as the core evolves. Conclusions. The o-H2D+ abundances in the Orion B9 cores are in line with those found in other low-mass dense cores and larger than derived for high-mass star-forming regions. The higher o-H2D+ abundance in prestellar cores compared to that in cores hosting protostars is to be expected from chemical reactions where higher concentrations of gas-phase CO and elevated gas temperature accelerate the destruction of H2D+. The validity of using the [o-H2D+]/[N2D+] abundance ratio as an evolutionary indicator, which has been proposed for massive clumps, remains to be determined when applied to these target cores. Similarly, the behaviour of the [o-H2D+]/[DCO+] ratio as the source evolves was found to be ambiguous. Still larger samples and observations of additional deuterated species are needed to explore these potential evolutionary indicators further. The low radial velocity of the line emission from one of the targeted prestellar cores, SMM 7 (∼ 3.6 km s-1 versus the systemic Orion B9 velocity of ∼ 9 km s-1), suggests that it is a chance superposition seen towards Orion B9. Overall, as located in a dynamic environment of the Orion B molecular cloud, the Orion B9 filament provides an interesting target system to investigate the deuterium-based chemistry, and further observations of species like para-H2D+ and D2H+ would be of particular interest. © ESO 2020.","Astrochemistry; ISM: individual objects: Orion B9; Stars: formation; Stars: protostars","Giant stars; Kinetic theory of gases; Atacama pathfinder experiments; Continuum emission; Deuterium fractionation; Dynamic environments; High detection rate; Initial conditions; Kinetic temperatures; Source characteristics; Deuterium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088636591

Five typical residential open spaces in Xi'an, China were investigated using physical measurements, questionnaires and activity records to determine how thermal comfort relates to outdoor activities. Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) was applied to quantitatively determine the outdoor thermal benchmarks in Xi'an, and variation in thermal benchmarks was compared with other climatic zones. Finally, a ‘research for design’ approach for climate‒responsiveness of residential open spaces was proposed based on thermal benchmarks. Results demonstrated that: 1) Except for air temperature and relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, globe temperature, mean radiative temperature and PET differed significantly among spaces. 2) Residents preferred activities in sunlit spaces in winter, tended to prefer activities in shaded spaces in summer, but activity time and space selections were inconspicuous in spring. 3) Residents can better endure “cold stress” in winter than “hot stress” in summer when conducting specific activities. 4) The neutral PET, neutral PET range and acceptable PET range were identified as 19.7 °C, 12.4–26.9 °C and 9.8–30.7 °C, respectively; adaptation to the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD) relation for Xi'an was also adjusted. 5) Optimum design strategies for open spaces were proposed within implement of shelterbelts, shaded facilities and deciduous trees.

The number of buildings inundated by 2050 is equivalent to 40% of the average number of new constructed buildings in Fiji Islands in a single year. Overall, the amount of materials present in buildings which will be inundated by 2050 is 900,000 metric tons (815,650 metric tons of concrete, 52,100 metric tons of timber, and 31,680 metric tons of steel). By 2100, this amount is expected to grow to 1,151,000 metric tons (1,130,160 metric tons of concrete, 69,760 metric tons of timber, and 51,320 metric tons of steel). The results shall contribute in enhancing urban planning, climate change adaptation strategies, and the estimation of future demolition flows in small island developing states. © 2020 by the author.","Climate change; Demolition of buildings; GIS; Global warming; Island metabolism; Material stock analysis","ArcGIS; building; climate change; construction material; GIS; global warming; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; sea level change; small island state; Fiji",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081224550

The current ways of managing waste, such as refuse collection and recycling, are failing to minimise waste in cities. With urban populations growing worldwide, there is the challenge of increased pressure to import food from rural areas. Urban agriculture not only presents an opportunity to explore other means of sustainable food production, but for managing organic waste in cities. However, this opportunity is not taken advantage of. Besides, there is a challenge of mixed reactions from urban planners and policymakers concerning the challenges and benefits presented by using organic waste in urban agriculture. The current paper explores the perceived challenges and opportunities for organic waste utilisation and management through urban agriculture in the Durban South Basin in eThekwini Municipality in KwaZulu‐Natal (KZN) Province of South Africa. It is anticipated that this information will be of use to the eThekwini Municipality, policymakers, researchers, urban agriculture initiatives, households and relevant stakeholders in the study areas and similar contexts globally. Two hundred (200) households involved in any urban farming activity and ten (10) key informants (six (6) staff from the Cleaning and Solid Waste Unit of the eThekwini Municipality and four (4) from the urban agricultural initiative) were selected using convenient sampling. Descriptive statistics and inductive thematic analysis were used to analyse data. The significant perceived challenges and risks associated with the utilisation of organic waste through urban agriculture included lack of a supporting policy, climatic variation, lack of land tenure rights, soil contamination and food safety concerns. Qualitative data further showed that the difficulty in segregating waste, water scarcity, difficulty in accessing inputs, limited transportation of organic waste, inadequate handling and treatment of organic waste, and being a health hazard were some important challenges. On the other hand, the significant perceived benefits associated with the utilisation of organic waste through urban agriculture were enhanced food and nutrition security, and opportunities for business incubation. Other important benefits established through qualitative data were an improved market expansion for farmers and improved productivity. Overall, despite the perceived challenges and risks, there is an opportunity to manage organic waste through urban agriculture. It is imperative for an integrated policy encompassing the food, climate and waste management to be developed to support this strategy. All stakeholders—the government, municipal authorities and urban agricultural initiatives should also, guided by the policy, support urban farmers, for example, through pieces of training on how to properly manage and recycle organic waste, land distribution, inputs availability and water usage rights among other things. © 2020 by the authors.

This systematic review work analyzed existed knowledge and research gaps on MES at the global level. The study used databases of science direct, Scopus and google scholar using searching, appraisal, synthesis, and analysis (SALSA) framework. Using specific keywords for the searching engine, the number of publications linked with MES were about 1252 which published between 1992 and June 2019. But, only 74 publications fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The analysis highlighted the existence of gaps in the literature including case studies from a limited geographical areas, focus on regulating and provisioning services, and lack of studies that explore the kinds of interlink between ecosystem services, and occurrence of limitation linked with data and methodology. From the 74 publications used for analysis, only seven of them were addressed mainly trade-offs and synergies, but most of them focus on quantification, qualification and economic valuation of the services. From the total case studies, the services addressed were summed up to 317 services, and the services such as climate regulation, food and fodder, fresh water, recreation and ecotourism, and erosion regulation studied more. On the contrary, photosynthesis, ornamental resources, net primary production, disease regulation, genetic resources, water purification and waste treatments were the least studied. Therefore, future research works should focus on mountainous areas of no and least studied of its ecosystem services. Critical studies are also required that indicate the link between a human being with MES, the trade-offs and synergies between MES and the influence of human beings on the quality and accessibility of ecosystem services. Besides, priority should be given by researches for methodological development and proposing management option for the mountain ecosystem and resource. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Gaps; Mountain ecosystem; Mountain ecosystem services; Systematic literature review; Trade-offs and synergies","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Landforms; Publishing; Waste treatment; Gaps; Management options; Mountain ecosystems; Mountainous regions; Net primary production; Systematic literature review; Trade off; Water purification; Ecosystems; conceptual framework; ecosystem service; knowledge; literature review; mountain region; research; trade-off; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; cultural factor; environmental management; environmental sustainability; geographic and geological phenomena; geographic distribution; human; landscape; mountain; mountain ecosystem services; priority journal; process development; publication; Review; search engine; systematic review; water supply; wellbeing; Scopus",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074887027

Two experimental apparatuses, including a DPF regeneration bench and a diesel engine bench, were built to investigate the particle emission characteristics of DPF during the regeneration process in this work. The purpose of study is to explore the formation mechanism and influence factors of emitted particle. The DPF regeneration test bench measurements showed that some 10 nm nuclei model particles were blown out by high temperature inlet flow during DPF heating-up stage for each test regeneration temperatures. The particle concentration increased by 2–3 orders of magnitude due to this hot spot, and the mean diameter of the emitted particle rose from 10 to 20 nm to 300 nm. The diesel engine bench measurements indicated that the 10 nm nuclei model particle mainly came from the penetration of the inlet initial exhaust particles of diesel engine, and some of them originated from the blow-out of deposited soot layer during heating-up stage. The 10 nm nuclei model particle during regeneration process mainly originated from the oxidization of deposited soot layer inside DPF channels, and 100 nm aggregated model particle) were formed during this process simultaneously. The 8 g/L soot loading and the 575 °C regeneration temperature led to large total amount of emitted particles in the downstream of the DPF. Both 4 g/L and 8 g/L DPFs had moderate regeneration efficiencies and relative low total particle emission, when the regeneration temperature was 550 °C. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Diesel particulate filter; Particle emission; Penetration; Regeneration; Secondary generated particle","Fuel filters; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Soot; Diesel particulate filters; Particle concentrations; Particle emissions; Penetration; Regeneration; Regeneration efficiency; Regeneration temperature; State-of-the-art devices; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075357903

However, its regulatory implications have not been examined. To investigate the effective regulation of wastewater systems with this technology, two permitting approaches are developed and assessed in this work: upstream-based permitting (i.e., environmental outcomes as a function of upstream conditions) and means-based permitting (i.e., prescription of an optimal RTC strategy). An analytical framework is proposed for permit development and assessment using a diverse set of high performing integrated RTC strategies and environmental scenarios (rainfall, river flow rate, and water quality). Results from a case study show that by applying means-based permitting, the best achievable, locally suitable environmental outcomes (subject to 10% deviation) are obtained in over 80% of testing scenarios (or all testing scenarios if 19% of performance deviation is allowed) regardless of the uncertain upstream conditions. Upstream-based permitting is less effective as it is difficult to set reasonable performance targets for a highly complex and stochastic environment.

This paper analyses the technical and economic feasibility of using mine water from flooded underground coal mines in Spain to provide renewable thermal energy to buildings located in surrounding areas. High efficiency heat pump system is proposed to provide sustainable energy for district heating and cooling, leading to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. The results obtained show that 20 MW of thermal energy is available for heat recovery from mine waters, compared to 4 MW of electrical power committed for pumping from inside the mines and heat pump consumption. The economic model that has been developed indicates that the feasibility of the geothermal plants depends on the amount of thermal energy demanded, the efficiency of the system and the distance from the abandoned mines to potential users. A mine water geothermal plant with 10 MW of power provides energy for about 1,700 households at a distance of 2 km with an investment cost of 3.25 M€.

In tropical climates, although rooftops are ideal for photovoltaic (PV) module integration, the available area may be insufficient to meet building energy demand due to the recent high-rise nature of urban buildings, causing a requirement for the utilisation of facades. However, the high angle of solar elevation means that facades are unfavourably oriented towards receiving incident solar irradiation. In addition, the issue exists of high solar heat gains into built spaces. This paper proposes a method to utilise horizontally inclined photovoltaic modules integrated on solar shading devices in order to combat these issues of unfavourable inclination and solar heat gains in commercial office buildings in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Various strategies are introduced and evaluated in terms of their inclination angles and the distance between installations. The results are analysed in terms of economic potential in order to determine which strategies are capable of producing the most electricity and reducing building cooling loads for the lowest installation costs. The results show that horizontal inclinations of PV on facades are capable of generating nearly 8% more electricity as a percentage of the building energy consumption when compared with traditional vertical PV facade installations. © 2019, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","building integrated photovoltaics; facades; office building; optimisation; photovoltaic integrated shading systems","Economic analysis; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Facades; Office buildings; Photovoltaic cells; Solar heating; Tropics; Building cooling load; Building energy consumption; Building energy demands; Building integrated photovoltaic system; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Optimisations; Photovoltaic modules; Shading systems; Solar power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074575575

This study proposes an integrated approach for characterizing and modeling large-scale fractures within deeply buried fractured karst carbonates of the Yingshan Formation (Ordovician in age) located at the Tahe oilfield, Tarim Basin (western China). This investigation implements a promising workflow to stochastically model the fracture sets interpreted from borehole image logs and compute both fracture porosity and permeability tensor in karsted carbonates. For this case study, we have constructed a Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) by combining two structural seismic attributes (i.e. local structural dip and ant-tracking). We have also applied the automatic fault extraction (AFE) algorithm. The results indicate that this method detects a greater number of discontinuities associated with fractures compared to the conventional methods employed in this kind of reservoir (e.g. seismic coherence and curvature). The fracture set with higher values of fracture porosity and permeability coincided with the orientation of maximum horizontal stress, WSW-ENE. In the model, the highest values of fracture intensity correspond to the most productive oil wells. Finally, this study highlights the importance of fracture modeling for evaluating the distribution of the most favorable production areas, so-called sweet-spots, in karsted carbonates reservoirs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Fracture modeling; Fracture rock properties prediction; Karsted carbonate reservoirs; Structural seismic attributes; Tahe oilfield","Boreholes; Carbonates; Carbonation; Oil fields; Oil well logging; Petroleum reservoirs; Porosity; Seismology; Well logging; Carbonate reservoir; Fracture model; Fracture rock; Seismic attributes; Tahe Oilfield; Fracture; algorithm; carbonate rock; fracture network; hydrocarbon reservoir; karst; oil field; permeability; porosity; rock mechanics; seismicity; China; Tahe Oilfield; Xinjiang Uygur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074369291

In addition to the issue of water scarcity that several regions of the world already face or are forecasted to face in the near future due to demand increase and availability reduction (e.g. pollution, climate changes), water consumption in buildings entails substantial energy consumption. In most cases, part of this energy is produced from non-renewable sources, encompassing greenhouse gas emissions. The present research effort presents a generic methodology to assess the cascade impact of water efficiency measures in buildings in terms of water, energy and emissions reduction. The methodology is applied to the Mediterranean climate zone context for two different types of non-residential buildings: university buildings and hotels, with very distinct water end use and consumption patterns. Lastly, are performed sensitivity analyses between the proposed methodology and simplified approaches. Is observed that assuming a linear relationship between flow rate and water consumption can lead to overestimations of up to 64% in water savings. Is also explored the relevance of the water consumption and energy mix seasonality typical of climates with marked dry and wet seasons, such as the Mediterranean region. The importance of the seasonality is discussed in terms of the time scale considered to apply the methodology, revealing that adopting a simplified (annual) approach, instead of the proposed approach, can lead to relative differences between − 62 and 233% in the presented case studies. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Buildings; Carbon emissions; Energy consumption; Greenhouse gas emissions; Urban water cycle; Water conservation; Water consumption; Water efficiency","assessment method; building; carbon emission; emission control; greenhouse gas; hydrological cycle; methodology; seasonality; water use efficiency; water; climate change; environmental monitoring; greenhouse gas; pollution; procedures; water conservation; Climate Change; Conservation of Water Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Greenhouse Gases; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073946569

During wildfires, government agencies monitor PM2.5 mass concentrations providing information and actions needed to protect affected communities; this requires continuously measuring instruments. This study assessed the performance of seven candidate instruments: (1) Met One Environmental beta attenuation monitor (EBAM), (2) Met One ES model 642 (ES642), (3) Grimm Environmental Dust Monitor 164 (EDM), (4) Thermo ADR 1500 (ADR), (5) TSI DRX model 8543 (DRX), (6) Dylos 1700 (Dylos), and (7) Purple Air II (PA-II) in comparison with a BAM 1020 (BAM) reference instrument. With the exception of the EBAM, all candidates use light scattering to determine PM2.5 mass concentrations. Our comparison study included environmental chamber and field components, with two of each candidate instrument operating next to the reference instrument. The chamber component involved 6 days of comparisons for biomass combustion emissions. The field component involved operating all instruments in an air monitoring station for 39.5 days with hourly average relative humidity (RH) ranging from 19% to 98%. Goals were to assess instrument precision and accuracy and effects of RH, elemental carbon (EC), and organic carbon (OC) concentrations. All replicate candidate instruments showed high hourly correlations (R2 ≥ 0.80) and higher daily average correlations (R2 ≥ 0.90), where all instruments correlated well (R2 ≥ 0.80) with the reference. The DRX and Purple Air overestimated PM2.5 mass concentrations by a factor of ~two. Differences between candidates and reference were more pronounced at higher PM2.5 concentrations. All optical instruments were affected by high RH and by the EC/OC ratio. Equations to convert candidate instruments data to FEM BAM type data are provided to enhance the usability of data from candidate instruments. Implications: This study tested the performance of seven candidate PM2.5 mass concentration measuring instruments in two settings - environmental chamber and field. The instruments were tested to determine their suitability for use during biomass combustion events and the effects of RH, PM mass concentrations, and concentrations of EC and OC on their performance. The accuracy and precision of each monitor and effect of RH, PM concentration, EC and OC concentrations are varied. The data show that most of these candidate instruments are suitable for measuring PM2.5 concentration during biomass combustions with a proper correction factor for each instrument type. © 2019, © 2019 A&WMA.",,"Air pollution; Biomass; Data handling; Environmental chambers; Fires; Health risks; Light scattering; Organic carbon; Smoke; Accuracy and precision; Aerodynamic diameters; Air monitoring stations; Beta attenuation monitors; Measuring instruments; PM2.5 concentration; Reference instruments; Wildfire frequencies; Combustion; carbon; organic carbon; air monitoring; air quality; biomass; combustion; comparative study; humidity; light scattering; particulate matter; priority journal; smoke; wildfire; air pollutant; air pollution; devices; environmental monitoring; procedures; smoke; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Smoke",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078548371

Our ability to interpret observed methane fluxes in reflooded peatlands and make predictions about future flux trends is limited due to a lack of detailed studies of methanogenic processes. In this study we investigate methanogenesis in a reflooded agricultural peatland in the Sacramento Delta, California. We use the stable-and radio-carbon isotopic signatures of wetland sediment methane, ecosystem-scale eddy covariance flux observations, and laboratory incubation experiments, to identify which carbon sources and methanogenic production pathways fuel methanogenesis and how these processes are affected by vegetation and seasonality. We found that the old peat contribution to annual methane emissions was large (~30%) compared to intact wetlands, indicating a biogeochemical legacy of drainage. However, fresh carbon and the acetoclastic pathway still accounted for the majority of methanogenesis throughout the year. Although temperature sensitivities for bulk peat methanogenesis were similar between open-water (Q10 = 2.1) and vegetated (Q10 = 2.3) soils, methane production from both fresh and old carbon sources showed pronounced seasonality in vegetated zones. We conclude that high methane emissions in restored wetlands constitute a biogeochemical trade-off with contemporary carbon uptake, given that methane efflux is fueled primarily by fresh carbon inputs. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate feedback; flux; isotope; methane; methanogenesis; peatland; radiocarbon","agricultural land; biogeochemical cycle; carbon isotope; climate change; climate feedback; methane; methanogenesis; peatland; seasonality; California; Sacramento Delta; United States; carbon dioxide; methane; California; ecosystem; soil; wetland; California; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Methane; Soil; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077365564

Northern Australia is the world leader in Indigenous savanna burning, delivering social, cultural, environmental and economic benefits. In 2016, a greenhouse gas abatement fire program commenced in the savannas of south-eastern Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, managed by the Indigenous Yugul Mangi rangers. We undertook participatory action research and semi-structured interviews with rangers and Elders during 2016 and 2019 to investigate Indigenous knowledge and obtain local feedback about fire management. Results indicated that Indigenous rangers effectively use cross-cultural science (including local and Traditional Ecological Knowledge alongside western science) to manage fire. Fire management is a key driver in the production of bush tucker (wild food) resources and impacts other cultural and ecological values. A need for increased education and awareness about Indigenous burning was consistently emphasized. To address this, the project participants developed the Yugul Mangi Faiya En Sisen Kelenda (Yugul Mangi Fire and Seasons Calendar) that drew on Indigenous knowledge of seasonal biocultural indicators to guide the rangers' fire management planning. The calendar has potential for application in fire management planning, intergenerational transfer of Indigenous knowledge and locally driven adaptive fire management. © 2020 by the authors.","Cross-cultural; Ecological calendar; Fire ecology; Fire management; Indigenous; Indigenous fire; Traditional ecological knowledge; Wildfire; Wildland fire","action research; burning; fire management; greenhouse gas; indigenous knowledge; intergenerational transfer; participatory approach; questionnaire survey; savanna; wildfire; Arnhem Land; Australia; Australia; Northern Territory; Northern Territory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081267867

Such long-term records are required to reconstruct and better understand the likely regional impacts of a poleward shift and intensification of the SWWs predicted under global warming scenarios. Deglaciation at Punta Burslem occurs sometime before c. 17,000 cal a BP, and the post glacial landscape is dominated by cold tolerant pioneer species. Nothofagus woodland is established by c. 12,250 cal a BP, this moisture sensitive vegetation type retreats in the early to mid-Holocene from c. 9700 to 7050 cal a BP reflecting an intense and sustained drier phase associated with a prolonged poleward contraction of the SWWs. After c. 6000 cal a BP there is a regional trend to cooler and wetter climate. However, we identify at least five periods of rapid climate change (RCC) leading to drier conditions at this southern extreme of Patagonia: c. 5350-4750 cal a BP, c.4300-3300 cal a BP, c. 2600-1850 cal a BP, c. 1350-1100 cal a BP and c. 550-350 cal a BP. From a synthesis of our Isla Navarino records and a latitudinal spread (34°-64°S) of multiproxy records it is proposed that these periods of RCC and relatively drier conditions indicate latitudinal shifts in the location and intensity of the SWWs in response to climatic warming leading to reduced precipitation at the southern margins of Patagonia. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Holocene; Palaeogeography; Pollen analysis; Pollen preservation; Rapid climate change; South America; Southern westerly winds; Vegetation dynamics","Driers (materials); Global warming; Vegetation; Holocenes; Palaeogeography; Pollen analysis; Rapid climate change; South America; Southern westerly winds; Vegetation dynamics; Glacial geology; climate change; climate variation; global warming; Holocene; landscape; late glacial; latitudinal gradient; paleoecology; paleogeography; palynology; peatland; Postglacial; precipitation (climatology); proxy climate record; vegetation dynamics; vegetation type; westerly; woodland; Magallanes; Navarino Island; Patagonia; Tierra del Fuego [(ISG) South America]; Nothofagus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076349353

Deforestation, forest degradation, and illegal logging are critical issues in forest management in many forest-rich countries around the world. In attempt to curtail illegal logging, global forest governance in the past few years has witnessed the development of a number of timber legality regimes including FLEGT. In the same light, the international community has recently seen the emergence of the REDD+ regime to fight against global warming and climate change. Based on sixty-eight interviews in Cameroon with representatives of NGOs and IDAs, government officials, the timber industry, and members of forest communities, as well as eleven informal conversations, and more than sixty documents, the paper finds that NGO and IDA influence on the FLEGT and REDD+ regimes in Cameroon has been growing in three areas: stakeholder participation, project development, and institutional development. Thus, the increasing influence of NGOs and IDAs will pave the way for future interventions on social, cultural, economic, and environmental issues, including land tenure, carbon rights, benefit distribution, equity, Free, Prior and Informed consent, legality, and stakeholder process, related to the FLEGT and REDD+ regimes in Cameroon. © 2020 by the author.","Cameroon; Congo basin; FLEGT; Forest governance; International development agency; Nongovernmental organization; REDD+","Crime; Deforestation; Environmental regulations; Global warming; Timber; Cameroon; Congo basins; FLEGT; Forest governance; International development; Nongovernmental organizations; REDD; Logging (forestry); deforestation; emission control; global warming; governance approach; law enforcement; nongovernmental organization; stakeholder; trade agreement; Cameroon; Deforestation; Degradation; Development; Environmental Regulations; International; Logging; Paper; Cameroon; Congo Basin; Idas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081140812

This limits the potential to model household consumption and lifestyles as mitigation options through their impact on economy-wide energy demand. We present a framework to estimate the economy-wide energy requirements and carbon emissions associated with future household consumption, by linking Industrial Ecology tools and Integrated Assessment Models (IAM). We apply the framework to assess final energy and emission pathways for meeting three essential and energy-intensive dimensions of basic well-being in India: food, housing and mobility. We show, for example, that nutrition-enhancing dietary changes can reduce emissions by a similar amount as meeting future basic mobility in Indian cities with public transportation. The relative impact of energy demand reduction measures compared to decarbonization differs across these services, with housing having the lowest and food the highest. This framework provides complementary insights to those obtained from IAM by considering a broader set of consumption and well-being-related interventions, and illustrating trade-offs between demand and supply-side options in climate stabilization scenarios.

We investigate this ‘drought paradox’ for the European Alps using a 1,212-station database and hyper-resolution ecohydrological simulations to quantify blue (runoff) and green (evapotranspiration) water fluxes. During the 2003 heatwave, evapotranspiration in large areas over the Alps was above average despite low precipitation, amplifying the runoff deficit by 32% in the most runoff-productive areas (1,300–3,000 m above sea level). A 3 °C air temperature increase could enhance annual evapotranspiration by up to 100 mm (45 mm on average), which would reduce annual runoff at a rate similar to a 3% precipitation decrease. This suggests that green-water feedbacks—which are often poorly represented in large-scale model simulations—pose an additional threat to water resources, especially in dry summers. Despite uncertainty in the validation of the hyper-resolution ecohydrological modelling with observations, this approach permits more realistic predictions of mountain region water availability. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"air temperature; climate change; ecohydrology; evapotranspiration; heat wave; mountain region; precipitation (climatology); runoff; summer; water flux; Alps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078421765

In order to provide practitioners with lessons learned for future applications and boost future method development efforts, the paper discusses those challenges. Methods: The challenges included in this paper were mainly identified from a survey administered to the road testers and from experiences during the piloting process. These are complemented with case studies from literature. The focus of the paper is on challenges exclusive to the organizational approach, although some additional issues common to product LCA but intensified in organizational LCA are also included. Each issue is characterized and exemplified, recommendations of reference standards are analyzed, and possible solutions discussed. Results and discussion: With the goal and scope of O-LCA, some challenging issues were to select part of an organization as the reporting organization, and the operability of the reporting flow. Regarding the system boundary, the challenges were which parts of the supply chain should be included in the study, problems when setting the system boundary for the service sector, how to include supporting activities, and how to prepare the right system boundary diagrams. Regarding the inventory stage, the discussion starts with alternatives to the categorization of the inventory into activities and the aggregation of those activities into groups. It includes an equivalence table for an easier transfer from other organizational frameworks (ISO 14069 and the GHG Protocol). Some challenges during impact assessment and interpretation were the assessment of local impacts, scoping performance tracking, and the use of O-LCA results for an organization’s strategy. Conclusions: The review of challenges is not meant as a complete overview of all possible challenges—new challenges may arise in future case studies. Further application testing is needed, along with research to support a future revision of the O-LCA Guidance, in line with the issues highlighted in this paper and new challenges may arise in future case studies. O-LCA has the potential to contribute in the future implementation of the life cycle concept in environmental management systems, in the development of organizational footprint metrics for region-specific impacts, and in the social dimension of life cycle assessment. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Case studies; Footprinting; Gaps; Indirect impacts; O-LCA","article; controlled study; environmental management; human; life cycle assessment; standard",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074870412

Nonetheless, a large share of biofuels, and raw materials used to produce the fuels, are imported from regions outside Sweden. This paper reviews the environmental implications of consumption of biofuels in Sweden 2000–2014 to identify and provide a comprehensive assessment of the environmental impacts that imports of fuels have both in Sweden and abroad using life cycle assessment (LCA). The results suggest that while greenhouse gas emissions may have been reduced in Sweden by the use of biofuels, the origin of the emissions has shifted from Sweden to Europe and other countries abroad, due in part to an increased use of biofuels and raw materials from abroad. This has important implications for local impacts, as this may increase acidification and eutrophication potential and ecotoxicity created abroad. Thus, although policy has been designed to promote sustainable transportation fuels, in addition to the generation goals set by the Swedish Parliament, the implications on regions exporting fuels and raw materials for Swedish consumption should be reviewed and followed in further detail in order to avoid problem shifting. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Biofuel; consumption; ethanol; hybrid; LCA","Environmental impact; Ethanol; Eutrophication; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Materials handling; Comprehensive assessment; consumption; Ecotoxicity; Environmental implications; Eutrophication potentials; hybrid; Local impacts; Sustainable transportation; Biofuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026417345

The classical models of water worlds considered layered structures determined by the phase boundaries of pure water. However, water worlds are likely to possess comet-like compositions, with between ∼3 and 30 mol% CO2 relative to water. In this study, we build an interior structure model of habitable (i.e., surface liquid ocean-bearing) water worlds using the latest results from experimental data on the CO2-H2O system to explore the CO2 budget and localize the main CO2 reservoirs inside of these planets. We show that CO2 dissolved in the ocean and trapped inside of a clathrate layer cannot accommodate a cometary amount of CO2 if the planet accretes more than 11 wt% of volatiles (CO2 + H2O) during its formation. If the atmosphere holds more than a negligible amount of the CO2 (&gt;0.01% of the planet mass), the planet will not have a habitable surface temperature. We propose a new, potentially dominant, CO2 reservoir for water worlds: CO2 buried inside of the high-pressure water ice mantle as CO2 ices or (H2CO3 • H2O), the monohydrate of carbonic acid. If insufficient amounts of CO2 are sequestered in either this reservoir or the planet's iron core, habitable-zone water worlds could generically be stalled in their cooling before liquid oceans have a chance to condense. © 2020.

The aim of this work is to evaluate the carbon footprint related to MSW in Luanda. The methodologies used to quantify the carbon footprint were based on the guidelines of the IPCC and the GHG Protocol of greenhouse gases emissions associated with MSW anaerobic decomposition, from the daily operations of the landfill site.

The lack of data and information to support the planning process is often mentioned as a factor hampering the adaptation processes in cities. In this paper, we developed and tested a methodology for heat stress vulnerability and risk assessment at the neighborhood scale to support designers, planners, and decision makers in developing and implementing adaptation strategies and measures at the local level. The methodology combines high-resolution spatial information and crowdsourcing geospatial data to develop sensitivity, adaptive capacity, vulnerability, exposure, and risk indicators. The methodology is then tested on the urban fabric of the city of Padova, Italy. Our results show that different vulnerability and risk values correspond to different typologies of urban areas. Furthermore, the possibility of combining high-resolution information provided by the indicators and land use categories is of great importance to support the adaptation planning process. We also argue that the methodology is flexible enough to be applied in different contexts. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate adaptation planning; Climate change; Vulnerability and risk assessment","adaptive management; climate change; crowdsourcing; decision making; heating; land use; neighborhood; planning process; risk assessment; urban planning; Italy; Padova; Veneto",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081258909

Despite this attention we have surprisingly few studies that have actually mapped the distribution and diversity of quantitative plant traits on continental scales and quantified the drivers of these spatial patterns. This limitation has been largely due to the inherent patchiness in trait and spatial databases. Here we analyze the distribution and diversity of plant maximum height in relation to climatic gradients for ~ 19,000 Angiosperm species across China. First, we quantify the relationship between the mean maximum height with climatic variables to test the prediction that precipitation and temperature both should restrict the maximum heights possible in a region. Second, we used null model analysis to address the fundamental question of whether gradients in plant species richness coincide with an increased trait range as expected under limiting similarity theory or whether more species are simply packed into the same range of trait values. The results show that the mean maximum height in a plant assemblage is highest in regions with higher temperatures and annual precipitation indicating that increases in precipitation are enough to offset the concomitant increase in temperature, which was expected to limit plant height. The range and packing of height space were found to increase with species richness and in less climatically variable environments. Null modeling results also show that the deviation of the observed results from expected has a distinct spatial signature for herbaceous and woody plants. Our results highlight plant height diversity, including the range and packing of plant height space, are sensitive to environment, and the mechanisms driving the range and packing of height space in the two growth forms may be different. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Biogeography; Functional diversity; Functional traits; Herbs; Macroecology; Woody plants","angiosperm; growth response; patchiness; species richness; temperature effect; vegetation classification; China; Magnoliophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074856260

Broad bioenergy technology portfolios and generations provide flexibility to allocate bioenergy to supply a specific final energy mix and to remove carbon dioxide by combining bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS). The paper aim is to perform a detailed and focused analysis of the availability of biomass gasification and methanisation and the role of these green gas energy carriers in the decarbonisation strategies using a model based approach to see how some countries technology appropriation evolves through the XXIst century. The results show that the future of bioenergy depends mostly on countries bioenergy supply and demand that are partly triggered by climate policies. Besides, very diverse local biomass end use patterns are highlighted depending on local resource availability, economic growth and climate policies. The majority of modern uses will be possible with a biomass transformation through the gas vector thanks to methanisation and gasification processes. Technology maturities and efficiencies are also essential for bioenergy development for the field competitiveness. In presence of climate policies, the deployment of biomass methanisation and gasification increases two or three times faster due to higher competitiveness compared to highly taxed fossil fuel.

These buildings face tough challenges concerning building energy consumption and the thermal environment due to their stack effect. The stack effect is greatly influenced by air infiltration, but current guidance on component airtightness is often neither specific nor consistent for different buildings. This paper presents field measurements and numerical simulations of airtightness performance and stack pressure distribution for a a 106.7-m high-rise residential building in Harbin, Northeast China. An airtightness field test was performed using the fan pressurisation method, and measured values were utilised as the input data for predictions. The numerical analysis was implemented by applying CONTAMW, and the simulation results were compared to measurement data. The results demonstrated that the measured components were all leakier than the current standards allow. The greatest stack pressure difference on the ground floor reached 51.5 Pa, considered a severe stack effect. Furthermore, the influences of the location and airtightness of different staircase doorways on the stack effect were studied and analysed. This research assists in clarifying the significance of building airtightness in cold climates and in reducing the stack effect of high-rise buildings. © The Author(s) 2019.","Airtightness; CONTAMW; Field test; High-rise residential building; Severe cold region; Stack effect","article; China; cold climate; cold stress; computer simulation; prediction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068082916

Namely, this is the ""A"" field with ""L"" reservoir that currently produces hydrocarbons using a secondary recovery method, i.e., water injection (in fact, re-injection of the field waters). Three regional reservoir variables were analysed: Porosity, permeability and injected water volumes. The quantity of data was small for porosity reservoir ""L"" and included 25 points; for permeability and injected volumes of water, 10 points each were measured. This study defined selection of mapping algorithms among methods designed for small datasets (fewer than 20 points). Namely, those are inverse distance weighting and nearest and natural neighbourhood. Results were tested using cross-validation and isoline shape recognition, and the inverse distance weighting method is described as the most appropriate approach for mapping permeability and injected volumes in reservoir ""L"". Obtained maps made possible the application of the modified geological probability calculation as a tool for prediction of success for future injection (with probability of 0.56). Consequently, it was possible to plan future injection more efficiently, with smaller injected volumes and higher hydrocarbon recovery. Prevention of useless injection, decreasing number of injection wells, saving energy and funds invested in such processes lead to lower environmental impact during the hydrocarbon production. © 2020 by the author.","Croatia; Efficiency; Neogene; Sandstones; Water injection","energy efficiency; environmental impact; flooding; fluid injection; hydrocarbon reservoir; Neogene; permeability; porosity; probability; recognition; sandstone; Croatia; Sava Depression",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081262154

The Himalayan Mountains are experiencing a higher warming than average global warming, which can significantly impact their biodiversity, vegetation distribution and ecosystem structure. There is a need to study the process of wood formation in Himalayan conifers to have a better understanding of their growth responses to predicted climate change. Variations in the climatic factors regulating cambial activity would result in changes in the timing of cambial phenology. In this study, the variations in the timing of different stages of cambial phenology (cell enlargement stage, wall-thickening stage and cell maturation stages) in pindrow fir (Abies pindrow) were investigated from anatomical observations of wood microcores collected during 2014-15 along an elevation range of c.2300−3000 m asl in the north-western Himalaya. The onset of all three cambial phenological stages was significantly correlated with elevation, with onset of cambial activity happening more than a week earlier at the lowest elevation than at the highest elevation site. Although the termination of wall-thickening and maturation stage appeared minimally related to elevation, the cell-enlargement stage showed significant correlation with elevation, with tracheid formation ceasing approximately three weeks earlier in trees at the highest elevation. The timing of these phenological stages did not show strong variations between the two study years. Our findings provide new data on the timings of cambial phenophases and help to understand tree growth response to ongoing changing climate in the Himalayan region. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Abies pindrow; Cambial phenology; Cell enlargement; Cell-maturation; Climate change; Himalaya; Wall-thickening","cell component; climate change; coniferous tree; elevation; environmental gradient; global warming; growth response; maturation; phenology; Himalayas; Abies; Abies pindrow; Coniferophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077003791

Kolkata Metropolitan City (KMC) is one of the Indian metro cities urgently requiring policy interventions to ensure breathable air in the near future. We developed a detailed emissions inventory of key air pollutants for 2015 in KMC, considering both particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5, BC, OC) and gaseous pollutants (SO2, NOx, CO, VOC and NH3). We estimated the emissions in a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario for the year 2030, while accounting for the impacts of current and planned policies. Our results reveal that current policies/measures are not sufficient to reduce PM2.5 emissions substantially in KMC by 2030. We thus explored three alternative policy scenarios considering various emission control strategies and non-technical city-specific control measures, along with associated cost implications. Our results indicate that significant emission reductions can be achieved (35% for PM2.5 and 45% for NOx) by spending €1.15 billion for advanced control measures across various sectors, compared with the business-as-usual scenario, are expected to cost €0.78 billion by 2030. Advanced control measures, coupled with the control of non-technical emission sources, may prove to be the most effective solution, yielding a significant reduction of key air pollutants (51% for PM2.5 and 54% for NOx) with a cost implication of €1.18 billion by 2030. Low carbon policies may also be able to substantially reduce key air pollutants with the additional co-benefit of reduced emissions of greenhouse gas, CO2 by 24% in 2030, with a running cost of €0.70 billion. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollutants; Co-benefits; Emissions inventory; GAINS model; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Kolkata","Air quality; Ammonia; Cost reduction; Emission control; Fog; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Health risks; Nitrogen oxides; Air pollutants; Co benefits; Emissions inventory; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Kolkata; Quality control; ammonia; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; air quality; atmospheric modeling; cost analysis; emission control; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; megacity; metropolitan area; pollution policy; scenario analysis; air analysis; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; carbon footprint; combustion; greenhouse gas; India; particulate matter; priority journal; India; Kolkata; West Bengal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075872402

In this paper, we present a mathematical model to evaluate the operational and financial analysis on DERs such as CHP, PV systems, and thermal/electrical energy storage installed at the behind-the-meter (BTM) customers' premises considering both energy and ancillary services markets. The objective is to drive the financial and resiliency value of DERs and determine the key factors such as DER portfolios, and the pricing structures of electricity and natural gas distribution companies (EDCs and GDCs).

At identical frequencies of RF signals that control the filters and ensure compensation for the Doppler frequency shift of light passing through the AOTFs, the steady-state laser emission linewidth can be reduced to about 25 MHz, which is almost three orders of magnitude smaller than that in the case of one filter (20 GHz). The position of the emission line, which remains narrow, slowly fluctuates within a spectral range about 3 GHz wide, which seems to be due to the large length of the external cavity and insufficient thermal stabilization of its components. This does not prevent us from obtaining light with a large coherence length. In emission wavelength sweep mode, the instantaneous emission linewidth increases with tuning rate, reaching 0.022 nm (8.8 GHz) at the highest tuning rate: 104 nm s-1. In the case of automatic control over the output optical power at a level of 3 mW, the tuning range is 815-875 nm.

The perceived annoyance caused by particulate matter is related mainly to the increase of settled dust in urban and residential environments. PM can originate from many sources, i.e., paved and unpaved roads, buildings, agricultural operations and wind erosion represent the largest contributions beyond the relatively minor vehicular and industrial sources emissions. The aim of this paper is to quantify the relationship between perceived annoyance and particulate matter concentration and to estimate the relative risk (RR). The data was collected in the Metropolitan Region of Vitoria (MRV), Brazil. For this purpose, the variables of interest were modelled using vector time series model (VAR), principal component analysis (PCA), and logistic regression (LOG). The combination of these techniques resulted in a hybrid model denoted as LOG-PCA-VAR which allows to estimate RR by handling multipollutant effects. This study shows that there is a strong association between the perceived annoyance and different sizes of PM. The estimates of RR indicate that an increase in air pollutant concentrations significantly contributes in increasing the probability of being annoyed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Annoyance; Logistic regression; Principal component analysis; Relative risk","Agricultural robots; Air pollution; Houses; Industrial emissions; Logistic regression; Particles (particulate matter); Principal component analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Time series; Value engineering; Agricultural operations; Air pollutant concentrations; Annoyance; Metropolitan regions; Multivariate time series techniques; Relative risks; Residential environment; Time series modeling; Time series analysis; atmospheric pollution; metropolitan area; multivariate analysis; particulate matter; principal component analysis; probability; regression analysis; risk assessment; time series analysis; wind erosion; air pollutant; annoyance; article; Brazil; human; particulate matter; principal component analysis; probability; risk assessment; risk factor; time series analysis; Brazil; Espirito Santo; Vitoria [Espirito Santo]; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075889215

Aerosols were predominantly internally mixed, with an average effective density of 1.30–1.63 g cm−3 for 50–230 nm particles, increasing with size. Externally mixed, relatively fresh black carbon (BC) was only episodically observed, with a second mode peaking at 0.51–0.91 g cm−3. For particles of 110, 140, 185 and 230 nm, BC accounted for 1.7 ± 1.2%, 4.8 ± 3.0%, 5.3 ± 3.3%, and 5.1 ± 3.3% of the particle mass, while being present in 26.4 ± 5.3%, 58.1 ± 27.7%, 59.8 ± 25.4%, and 62.4 ± 27.9% of the particle number concentration, indicating that BC was heavily coated and may contribute significantly to atmospheric aerosol population. Substantial BC absorption enhancement was observed with Eabs of 1.41 ± 0.39, 1.42 ± 0.40 and 1.35 ± 0.38 at 405, 532 and 781 nm, respectively. High volatile aerosol components, in particular nitrate, were found to play vital roles in BC's absorption enhancement. High Eabs values were associated with elevated NOx and RH. A clear diurnal pattern was observed for Eabs supporting a significant impact from traffic emissions, which stood in contrast with previous studies reporting very thin coating and negligible absorption enhancement for traffic emitted BC. High concentrations of NOx co-emitted with BC from traffic sources and its conversion to particulate nitrate likely contributed to the aging and increased absorption of BC particles, which was even enhanced under high RH above the deliquescence point of ammonium nitrate. Therefore, our results indicated that the mitigation of NOx emissions from traffic was critical for reducing the positive radiative forcing induced by BC, especially under high RH conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Absorption enhancement; Black carbon; Mixing state; Particulate nitrate; Yangtze river delta","Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric radiation; Carbon; Fog; Light absorption; Mixing; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Optical properties; Absorption enhancement; Black carbon; Mixing state; Particulate nitrate; Yangtze river delta; Particles (particulate matter); ammonia; ammonium nitrate; black carbon; nitrate; absorption; aerosol; black carbon; chemical composition; concentration (composition); light intensity; nitrate; radiative forcing; summer; traffic emission; aerosol; China; circadian rhythm; environmental temperature; light absorption; meteorology; particle size; priority journal; radiative forcing; visibility; China; Nanjing [Jiangsu]; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076523395

However, the achievement of efficient bulk monolithic electrocatalysts still remains a challenge. Herein, a facile oxidative etching of the Au20Cu80 alloy was developed for the synthesis of a monolithic nanoporous core-shell structured AuCu3@Au electrode, which showed a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 97.27% with a partial current density of 5.3 mA cm-2 at -0.6 V vs. RHE for the production of CO. The FE value is about 1.45 times higher than that over the Au nanocatalyst. Unlike single nanoporous Au, AuCu3@Au maintained an excellent performance in a broad potential window. Furthermore, a 23 cm long nanoporous AuCu3@Au bulk electrode with good ductility was prepared, over which the active current reached up to 37.2 mA with a current density of 10.78 mA cm-2 at -0.7 V vs. RHE, pushing the reduction of CO2 to industrialization. The unsaturated coordination environment with a coordination number of 8.2 over the shell gold and curved interface determined this high electrocatalytic performance. Density functional theory calculations suggested that the double-dentate adsorption structure in the AuCu3@Au catalyst effectively improves the stability of the ∗COOH intermediate. The density of states indicates that the introduction of Cu causes the d-band-centre of AuCu3@Au to move toward the Fermi level, directly bonding with ∗COOH. Therefore, the adsorption of ∗COOH on the surface of the AuCu3@Au catalyst is strengthened, facilitating the formation of CO. This work opens an avenue to achieve self-supported porous electrodes for various useful catalytic conversions. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Binary alloys; Carbon dioxide; Chemical bonds; Density functional theory; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Etching; Nanocatalysts; Shells (structures); Adsorption structures; Catalytic conversion; Coordination environment; Coordination number; Electrocatalytic performance; Electrochemical reductions; Faradaic efficiencies; Renewable energies; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079485149

In response to CO2 emissions reduction in China, this study integrated the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) stable nighttime light (SNL) data and Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) composite data, and established the integrated nighttime light datasets from 1992 to 2016. The estimated CO2 emissions model utilizing the integrated nighttime light datasets and statistical CO2 emissions at the provincial level from 1995 to 2016 were established. Finally, spatiotemporal dynamics of CO2 emissions were simulated from multiscale. The results clearly showed that: (1) The fitting results of regression relationship between DMSP-OLS SNL data and NPP-VIIRS composite data met the accuracy requirements. The CO2 emissions estimated model was valid. (2) The total amount of energy consumption CO2 emissions in China had increased from 1889.3340 Mt in 1995 to 4683.3165 Mt in 2016, with a total growth of 2.47 times. (3) The high CO2 emissions regions were clearly agglomerated in eastern coastal China from the pixel scale, the highest CO2 emissions provinces were concentrated in Hebei and Shandong, the high CO2 emissions prefecture cities were concentrated in Around Bohai Gulf area, eastern coastal China and some developed cities, and the high CO2 emissions counties were concentrated in eastern coastal China and western energy intensive counties. (4) The relatively-slow growth accounted for the highest proportion among the five growth types, and the CO2 emissions rapid growth regions were concentrated in eastern China at provincial, prefectural and county scale. The western regions accounted for the largest area proportion in five growth types at prefectural scale.

By means of the TD-DFT method, the absorption and emission spectra were calculated based on the optimized ground-state and the excited-state geometries, respectively. It is found that the absorption and emission transition character can be altered by adjusting the electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups or expanding the aromatic conjugation on salicylaldehyde. These results indicate that both absorption and emission properties are governed by the HOMO–LUMO gap (∆H–L) which is usually considered as the basis of the experimental design. In addition, the charge transport quality has been estimated approximately by the calculated reorganization energy (λ). The calculated results also show that the species of the substitute groups and the expanded aromatic ring affect the charge transfer rate and balance.

Using a system dynamics modeling approach, this paper investigates the impacts of an e-carsharing scheme in carbon emissions and in electric vehicle adoption. We study the VAMO scheme located in Fortaleza, Brazil, as the first e-carsharing scheme in the country. We study two policies combined: a VAMO planned growth policy and a retirement policy for conventional vehicles. Our results show that the VAMO incentive policy is an important factor to reduce emissions and to increase awareness of electric vehicles, highlighting the role of the government as an institutional entrepreneur, stimulating and sustaining the VAMO scheme. The retirement policy in combination with the VAMO incentive policy obtained the best results in our simulations, reducing 29% of CO2 emissions and increasing 36% electric vehicle adoption, when compared to the business-as-usual scenario. The main conclusions are that such e-carsharing schemes offer direct and indirect benefits to urban mobility (specially to electric vehicle adoption) and that they depend on how the government supports them. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; E-carsharing; Electric vehicles; Shared mobility; Simulation; System dynamics","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Electric vehicles; System theory; Carsharing; CO2 emissions; Emerging economies; Government supports; Simulation; Sustainable mobility; System Dynamics; System dynamics model; Electric automobiles; carbon emission; electric vehicle; policy approach; sustainability; transportation planning; transportation policy; urban transport; Brazil; Ceara; Fortaleza",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077780661

However, systematic studies on the scale-dependency system-specificity remain largely lacking. Here, we selected 32 major Chinese cities as cases and used Landsat 8 images to retrieve land surface temperature (LST) and quantify natural surface variables using point of interest (POI) data as a measure of the human activity variable and using multiple regression and relative weight analysis to study the contribution and relative importance of these factors to LST at a range of grain sizes (0.25-5 km) and spatial extents (20-60 km). We revealed that the contributions and relative importance of natural surfaces and human activities are largely scale-dependent and system-specific. Natural surfaces, especially vegetation cover, are often the most important UHI determinants for a majority of scales, but the importance of non-surface human activities is increasingly pronounced at a coarser spatial scale with respect to both grain and spatial extent. The scaling relations of the UHI determinants and their relative importance were mostly linear-like at the city-collective level, but highly diverse across individual cities, so reducing non-surface heat emissions could be the most effective measure in particular cases, especially at relatively large spatial scales. This study advances the understanding of UHI formation mechanisms and highlights the complexity of the scale issue underpinning the UHI effect. © 2020 by the authors.","Human activity; Land surface temperature; Multi-scale analysis; Natural surface; Point of interest; Scaling; Urban heat island","Land surface temperature; Landforms; Remote sensing; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Thermal pollution; Human activities; Multi scale analysis; Natural surface; Point of interest; Scaling; Urban heat island; Atmospheric temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079537786

Using the government expenditure data from the GFG in Yunnan Province from 2001 to 2015 and the MODIS Land Cover Type (MCD12Q1) time-series datasets, we calculated the forest carbon sequestration of various counties (cities or districts). The impacts of GFG government expenditure on forest carbon sequestration were empirically evaluated by the least squares dummy variables method (LSDV). The research results indicate that a 1% increase in government expenditure on the GFG yielded a 0.0364% increase in forest carbon sequestration. However, the effects of GFG government expenditure on forest carbon sequestration differed greatly in different areas because of the diversity of the natural environments, forest resource endowment, and government policies. If the initial forest endowment was not considered, the effectiveness of government expenditure on the GFG in providing forest carbon sequestration would have been overestimated. This study argues that, to improve the efficiency of GFG government expenditure in Yunnan Province, more investment should be made in regions with positive regression coefficients that have passed the significance t-test, such as Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in the northwest, Baoshan City in the west, Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture in the south, andWenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in the east. © 2020 by the authors.","Forest carbon sequestration; Government expenditure; Grain for Green; Least squares dummy variables method",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080963234

FeCl2 could both improve the accumulative methane production and reduce the abundance of total ARGs, i.e., the maximum increase of CH4 production of 21.5% at FC5, and the maximum ARGs reduction of 33.3% at FC25. The reduction of pathogenic bacteria and metal resistance genes (MRGs) was enhanced. Acetate and propionate utilization were intensified by enhancing H2 utilization and direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET), where DIET was further enhanced by the reaction of the FeCl2 and acetic acid. The bacterial community played important role in the evolution of ARGs (68.26%), which were also affected by MRGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and environmental factors. Therefore, FeCl2-based AD is a feasible and attractive way to improve methane production and ARG reduction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; ARGs; Ferrous chloride; High-throughput quantitative PCR; Swine manure","Antibiotics; Bacteria; Chlorine compounds; Fertilizers; Genes; Iron compounds; Manures; Methane; Polymerase chain reaction; Volatile fatty acids; Antibiotic resistance genes; ARGs; Bacterial community; Environmental factors; Ferrous chloride; Pathogenic bacterium; Quantitative PCR; Swine manure; Anaerobic digestion; acetic acid; ferrous chloride; hydrogen; methane; propionic acid; RNA 16S; antiinfective agent; ferrous chloride; ferrous ion; methane; anaerobic digestion; antibiotic resistance; biological production; chemical compound; gene; manure; methane; polymerase chain reaction; anaerobic digestion; antibiotic resistance; Article; bacterial gene; controlled study; electron transport; environmental factor; hydrolysis; methanogen; methanogenesis; microbial community; mobile genetic element; nonhuman; pH; physical chemistry; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; reduction (chemistry); swine manure; anaerobic growth; animal; antibiotic resistance; bacterial gene; manure; pig; Bacteria (microorganisms); Suidae; Anaerobiosis; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Ferrous Compounds; Genes, Bacterial; Manure; Methane; Swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076424165

Yet, the understanding of carbon emissions in the construction industry remains limited. As one of the first few attempts, this paper contributes to the literature by identifying the determinants of carbon emissions in the Chinese construction industry from the perspective of spatial spillover effects. A panel dataset of 30 provinces or municipalities from 2005 to 2015 was used for the analysis. We found that there is a significant and positive spatial autocorrelation of carbon emissions. The local Morans I showed local agglomeration characteristics of H-H (high-high) and L-L (low-low). The indicators of population density, economic growth, energy structure, and industrial structure had either direct or indirect effects on carbon emissions. In particular, we found that low-carbon technology innovation significantly reduces carbon emissions, both in local and neighboring regions. We also found that the industry agglomeration significantly increases carbon emissions in the local regions. Our results imply that the Chinese government can reduce carbon emissions by encouraging lowcarbon technology innovations. Meanwhile, our results also highlight the negative environmental impacts of the current policies to promote industry agglomeration. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon emissions; Spatial analysis; Spillover effects; The construction industry","carbon emission; construction industry; environmental impact; industrial emission; industrial structure; spatial analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; spillover effect; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081533674

The experiment involved five varieties of spring durum wheat as B 200, B 205, B 209, B Niva, and Luch 25 taken from Russian Middle Volga regions. Indicators of the best productive bushiness were noted in varieties B Niva and B 209. It was found that the number and weight of seeds in the ear, depending on the variety, varied proportionally to the length of the ear. The best indicators of the structure of the crop were established in varieties B 209 and B Niva. The weight of 1000 seeds was 42.32 to 53.3 g for different varieties of durum wheat. Taking into account the biological yield, the advantage of the variety B Niva over the control variant was revealed. The best formation of grain gluten was observed in agroclimatic conditions in 2015 and 2016: for three years the best indicators of gluten was on average 30.4 %and 29.95%, respectively, for varieties B Niva and B 200. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Quality control; Continental climate; Durum wheats; Grain quality; Technological adaptation; Grain (agricultural product)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079610347

We examined the usefulness of two related communication strategies: proximising climate change with news focussing on local impacts, and bridging psychological distance by raising the salience of people's global identity as part of humanity. We first examined the often implicitly assumed process underlying proximising, namely reducing the psychological socio-spatial distance of climate change, which in turn might make the issue more relevant for people, which in turn might promote behavioural engagement. Second, we argued that when people consider themselves as part of a global society, proximising may not be necessary as people perceive the relevance of distant impacts. We conducted an experiment with UK residents (N = 400) with two between subjects factors: proximity of communication on climate change (proximal or distant) and global identity salience (communicated or not). Communicating proximity (vs. distance) via a news text on climate change consequences for either the UK or Bangladesh reduced the psychological socio-spatial distance of climate change and indirectly predicted climate protective behaviour through lower psychological socio-spatial distance and higher relevance attribution. While these indirect relations were small, stronger relations might arise if people repeatedly receive local information. Participants for whom global identity was made salient (using a video showing a man dancing with people all over the world) exhibited no decreases in evaluating the relevance of the news text as their psychological socio-spatial distance of climate change increased (compared to those who viewed a control video). This indicates that global identity salience can bridge the psychological socio-spatial distance of climate change. We conclude that it is useful to report local consequences of climate change, or to communicate global connectedness if global consequences of climate change are described. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Communication; Global identity; Psychological distance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078194467

A SR consists of two physically distinct domains, designated as the reactor domain and the storage domain, which are allowed to communicate with each other through a semipermeable boundary. It is envisioned that the SR is operated in a dynamic (periodic) manner, that enables the loading and unloading of the storage domain. In this introductory work, a 0-D first principle SR model is developed that quantifies SR dynamic behavior. The resulting governing equations are nondimensionalized, and two dimensionless groups are shown to uniquely determine SR performance, which is quantified through the use of several proposed metrics. An illustrative case study on Steam Methane Reforming is then carried out, involving parametric studies on the two aforementioned dimensionless groups. It is established that the SR outperforms an equivalent Steady-State Reactor (SSR), in regard to the outlined performance criteria © 2019",,"Methane; Unloading; Dimensionless groups; Dynamic behaviors; First principles; Governing equations; Loading and unloading; Methane steam reforming; Performance criterion; Process intensification; Steam reforming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075305777

Controversy has arisen around the research community behind integrated assessment modeling (IAM) scenarios used in the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This regards the role played by an unproven component in projected energy systems—a coupling of bioenergy generation with carbon capture and storage techniques (BECCS)—that allows IAMs to achieve ambitious temperature targets since adopted by the Paris Agreement. We engage members of the IAM community and a multidisciplinary range of critical experts to interrogate how the ‘feasibility’ of BECCS—or other novel technologies—is assessed within modeling, and use ‘boundary work’ to show how the kind of expertise—and by extension, the authority—held by the IAM community is being challenged. We find that the competing judgments of BECCS's feasibility, between the IAM community and its critics, reflect and reinforce different understandings of the freedom of scientific inquiry, the mutual influences of science and policy, the shape of science communication, and the necessity of reform. We ask what these claims signal for future activity in this space, and conclude with a call for ‘reflexive’ modeling approaches to bridge perspectives. © 2019 The Authors","Authority; Bioenergy carbon capture and storage; Boundary work; Feasibility; Integrated assessment modeling; Scientific assessment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073189381

Based on CMAQ simulations using emissions appropriate for 2002 and 2011, we estimate that emission reductions since 2002 likely prevented 10– 15 ozone exceedance days (using the 2011 maximum 8-hr average ozone standard of 75 ppbv) throughout the Ohio River Valley and 5– 10 ozone exceedance days throughout the Washington, DC–Baltimore, MD metropolitan area during this extremely hot month. CMAQ results were fed into the BenMAP-CE tool to determine the health and health-related economic benefits of anthropogenic emission reductions between 2002 and 2011. We estimate that the concomitant health benefits from the ozone reductions were significant for this anomalous month: 160–800 mortalities (95% confidence interval (CI): 70–1,010) were avoided in July 2011 in the Eastern U.S, saving an estimated $1.3–$6.6 billion (CI: $174 million–$15.5 billion). Additionally, we estimate that emission reductions resulted in 950 (CI: 90–2,350) less hospital admissions from respiratory symptoms, 370 (CI: 180–580) less hospital admissions for pneumonia, 570 (CI: 0–1650) less Emergency Room (ER) visits from asthma symptoms, 922,020 (CI: 469,960–1,370,050) less minor restricted activity days (MRADs), and 430,240 (CI: −280,350–963,190) less symptoms of asthma exacerbation during July 2011. Implications: We estimate the benefits of air pollution emission reductions on surface ozone concentrations and ozone-related impacts on human health and the economy between 2002 and 2011 during an extremely hot month, July 2011, in the eastern United States (US) using the CMAQ and BenMAP-CE models. Results suggest that, during July 2011, emission reductions prevented 10-15 ozone exceedance days in the Ohio River Valley and 5-10 ozone exceedance days in the Mid Atlantic; saved 160-800 lives in the Eastern US, saving $1.3 - $6.5 billion; and resulted in 950 less hospital admissions for respiratory symptoms, 370 less hospital admissions for pneumonia, 570 less Emergency Room visits for asthma symptoms, 922,020 less minor restricted activity days, and 430,240 less symptoms of asthma exacerbation. © 2020, © 2020 A&WMA.",,"Air quality; Diseases; Economics; Emergency rooms; Emission control; Ozone; River pollution; Anthropogenic emissions; Community multi-scale air qualities; Confidence interval; Emergency room visits; Hospital admissions; Pollution emissions; Respiratory symptoms; Surface ozone concentrations; Economic and social effects; ozone; ozone; air pollution control; asthma; disease exacerbation; heat; hospital admission; human; mortality; pneumonia; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; simulation; United States; air pollutant; air pollution; hospital emergency service; hospitalization; Maryland; Ohio; prevention and control; respiratory tract disease; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Baltimore; Emergency Service, Hospital; Extreme Heat; Hospitalization; Humans; Ohio; Ozone; Respiratory Tract Diseases; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077885689

Herein, a facile strategy has been provided for synthesizing hexagonal Fe2N nanocrystals dispersed on nitrogen-doped carbon (NC), through direct pyrolysis of a mixture of carbon black, ferric chloride (FeCl3), and melamine in an argon atmosphere, followed by ammonia activation at 700 °C. The obtained Fe2N/NC catalyst exhibits both ultrahigh ORR activity and favorable long-term durability in alkaline solutions, which exceeds the state-of-the-art Pt/C even in Zn-air batteries. Acid etching and KSCN poisoning experiments confirm that the remarkable performances are mainly attributed to the hexagonal nitride with special crystal facets that existed in this hybrid. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results reveal that the oxygen adsorption energy of the exposed Fe2N(1 1 1) plane is -1.14 eV, very close to that of Pt(111). More importantly, at 0.85 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the free energy diagram of the ORR on this exposed crystal facet is closer to the ideal path than that of the Fe-N4 bonds that existed in this hybrid, suggesting that the ORR process over Fe2N is easier than that over Fe-N-C catalysts.

However, the current platform requires pretreatment of real samples to extract targets, which may induce false signals due to complicated collection and addition processes. Although nanopore electrodes or nanopipettes have been successfully utilized in the detection of intracellular redox-active species without sample preparation processes, the insertion of nanoprobes to living cells is inevitable. Here, a strategy is reported to monitor H2O2 released from living cells based on functionalized solid-state nanochannels without an insertion procedure. In this strategy, aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) with enzyme-responsive linkage properties are combined in solid-state nanochannels. When H2O2 released from cervical cancer cells (HeLa), Tyr-containing AIEgens (TT) will form horseradish peroxidase-modulated (HRP-modulated) linkages in the nanochannels. The formation of linkages can result in the effective blockade of nanochannels, hence via transmembrane ionic current. Owing to the aggregation of linkage products, a fluorescence signal can be observed. By using these dual-signal-output nanochannels, in situ and noninvasive detection of H2O2 is able to be achieved. Together with molecular dynamic (MD) simulations results, solid surface zeta potential and contact angle experiments, it is concluded that the blockage of nanochannels is the dominate factor for ionic currents as well as fluorescence change. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Quantitative hydrogenation was observed when 1.0 mol % of a methyl-substituted phosphetane oxide was employed as the catalyst. The procedure is highly selective towards activated double bonds, tolerating a variety of functional groups that are usually prone to reduction. In total, 25 alkenes and two alkynes were hydrogenated to the corresponding alkanes in excellent yields of up to 99 %. Notably, less active poly(methylhydrosiloxane) could also be utilized as the terminal reductant.

Deep burrowing and deposit feeding mollusks, in particular, may incorporate old carbon resulting in apparently older ages than their contemporary environment. In this study, we present paired 14C and stable isotope (δ13C and δ18O) measurements for nine species of known-age bivalves having different feeding strategies and collected in six localities around the NE Atlantic. We exclude potential old carbon contamination in these known-age mollusk shells, acquire a better understanding of local ecology and provide an improved context for the environmental interpretation of 14C ages. Our results indicate that, in the NE Atlantic, marine mollusk-derived 14C ages provide a reliable basis for environmental and archaeological investigation, independently of vital effects and differences in microhabitats, feeding strategies and sample location- A ll of which are apparent from stable isotopes. © 2019 by the Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of the University of Arizona.","diet; mollusks; paleoecology; radiocarbon","age determination; coastal water; deposit feeding; marine environment; microhabitat; paleoenvironment; radiocarbon dating; stable isotope; thermochronology; type locality; wage determination; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northeast); Bivalvia; Mollusca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078928096

They allow authoritarian centralized control to strengthen, while making room for decentralization and business engagement. This article explores a mechanism that accommodates these contradictions. Our objective is to elaborate on the dynamic between centralizing and decentralizing forces. In China, the ongoing process of neoliberalizing climate change policies is organized around an institutionalized practice of policy experimentation. This practice has created conditions for stabilizing the existing structure of hierarchy. Primarily based on semi-structured interviews, our analysis reveals a number of system vulnerabilities linked to the uncertain and fragmented carbon markets, policies, and institutions. They problematize existing practices and allow the state to negotiate priorities and relations of power across scale. Pragmatic considerations about feasible solutions legitimize further intervention by the state and centrally coordinated policy measures. Key system vulnerabilities and the prospects for national-level action put these local policy experiments under a shadow of hierarchy. This article discusses one way in which local policy initiatives gain legitimacy while reinforcing hierarchical control. It advances the knowledge about China’s attempt to neoliberalize its climate change policies. © The Author(s) 2019.","China; Climate change policy; emission trading; environmental politics; policy experiment","climate change; emissions trading; environmental policy; environmental politics; neoliberalism; policy implementation; vulnerability; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064563089

Emission reduction in metropolises considerably contributes to air quality improvement. In this study, the predictions and driving factors of production-based CO2 emissions in Beijing are analyzed based on regional spatial differentiation. The results show that production-based CO2 emissions in Beijing increased from 12.78 million tons in 1980 to 45.91 million tons in 2015, and the growth rate of CO2 emissions decreased from 2010 to 2015. Moreover, it is probable that the total CO2 emission will rapidly increase by approximately 27 million tons in the following decade. By 2025, the carbon emissions are projected to reach approximately 69.66 million tons with an increase of approximately 23.75 million tons compared with that in 2015. For every 1 % growth in the secondary industry scale, which is the main carbon emission driving factor, CO2 emissions increase by 0.51 %. Population increase and economic development lead to increasing emissions, whereas employment expansion, public transportation system improvement, reduction in household electricity consumption, and waste reduction contribute to emission reduction. This research can be used by policymakers as reference to appropriately target management policies for air pollution control and emission reduction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing; Economic efficiency; Emission control; Production-based CO2 emissions; STIRPAT model; Urban development","Air quality; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Urban growth; Beijing; CO2 emissions; Economic efficiency; Stirpat models; Urban development; Growth rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074802391

Here, we conducted a large-scale sampling event across two contrasting croplands (rice and wheat-corn crop rotation) to identify specific soil microbial phylotypes and functional genes associated with soil respiration rates. The results of structural equation modeling indicated that bacterial community composition had a strong link with C respiration rates in the two contrasting cropland types; however, this link was weaker for fungal communities. More importantly, we found that the relative abundances of bacterial Solirubrobacterales_480-2, Myxococcales_mle1-27 and fungal Westerdykella had consistently negative correlation with respiration rates across paddy and upland soils. We also identified taxa that are significantly correlated to C respiration in the paddy (e.g. Methylocaldum) and upland soils (e.g. Kribbella), respectively. Further, we found multiple associations between functional genes involved in microbial C metabolism and soil respiration rates. Our findings provide novel insights into understanding microbial predictors of soil CO2 emissions in diverse croplands, which have important implications for improving C emission predictions in terrestrial ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bacteria; Carbon cycling; Functional gene; Metagenome; Microbial community; Prediction","Bacteria; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Forecasting; Forestry; Genes; Bacterial community composition; Carbon cycling; Functional genes; Metagenomes; Microbial communities; Soil respiration rates; Structural equation modeling; Terrestrial ecosystems; Soils; carbon dioxide; internal transcribed spacer; RNA 16S; carbon dioxide; agricultural land; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; ecosystem function; genomics; prediction; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil respiration; taxonomy; amplicon; Article; bacterial gene; bacterium; carbon footprint; climate; controlled study; crop rotation; cropland; fungal community; fungus; gene sequence; Kribbella; maize; Methylocaldum; microbial community; microbiological examination; Myxococcales; nonhuman; phylogeny; population abundance; prediction; priority journal; rice; sampling; soil microflora; soil respiration; Solirubrobacterales; species composition; structural equation modeling; taxonomy; Westerdykella; wheat; biodiversity; chemistry; crop; metabolism; microbiology; soil; Bacteria (microorganisms); Kribbella; Methylocaldum; Myxococcales; Triticum aestivum; Westerdykella; Zea mays; Bacteria; Biodiversity; Carbon Dioxide; Crops, Agricultural; Fungi; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074689171

Based on the microwave remote sensing soil moisture data released by the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative program (ESA CCI SM), flash droughts were identified by focusing on the attenuation rate of weekly soil moisture percentile. On this basis, the spatiotemporal patterns of flash drought frequency, their evolution process combined with meteorological conditions, and the relationship with seasonal droughts were analyzed. Results showed that the frequency of flash drought occurrence over China during 2000–2016 mainly varied between 6% and 20%. Spatially, such events were most likely to occur in the northern and southern region, and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau showed the lowest frequency of occurrence. Influenced by the complex roles of negative anomalies of precipitation and relative humidity, along with positive anomalies of potential evapotranspiration (PET) and temperature, the southwest region suffered three severe drought attacks in summer 2006. In addition, a coexisting relationship was also observed between flash droughts and seasonal droughts. Initiated by the rapid reduction of soil moisture, the northern, northeastern, southern, and southwestern areas were more vulnerable to droughts with duration no more than 12 weeks. In contrast, the southern China were likely to suffer longer periods of droughts (more than 12 weeks) in spring (April to May), while for southwestern regions such type of droughts were mainly concentrated in summer (June and July). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Evolution process; Flash droughts; Seasonal droughts; Soil moisture; Spatiotemporal pattern","Climate change; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Evolution process; Meteorological condition; Microwave remote sensing; Potential evapotranspiration; Qinghai Tibet plateau; Rapid intensification; Seasonal droughts; Spatiotemporal patterns; Drought; drought; evapotranspiration; precipitation intensity; remote sensing; seasonal variation; soil moisture; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; article; drought; evapotranspiration; humidity; meteorology; precipitation; soil moisture; spring; summer; Tibet",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076615851

Understanding the role of psychological and demographic factors in the context of energy-conservation behaviors is critical to promote energy-saving behaviors in buildings. This study first proposes a theoretical framework built on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Based on the collected survey data from 207 families (553 residents) in three communities in Xi'an, a typical city in northwest China, the research examines how three standard TPB predictors, namely attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control, as well as their interactive effects and three socio-demographic factors (i.e., house ownership, education and household income) influence building occupants' energy-saving intention at home. Through structural equation modeling and keyword analysis, this study reveals that two interaction terms, namely attitude and subjective norms, as well as attitude and perceived behavior control, significantly influence building occupants' energy-saving intention. Furthermore, this study implies that household income may positively associate with occupants' energy-saving intention.

In order to classify PM10 air pollution and to investigate the population exposure to the distribution of PM10, daily and monthly PM10 concentrations of 379 air pollution monitoring stations were obtained for a period from 01/01/2017 to 31/12/2017. Firstly, PM10 concentrations were classified using the head/tail break clustering algorithm to identify locations with elevated PM10 levels. Subsequently, population exposure levels were calculated using population-weighted PM10 concentrations. Finally, the power-law distribution was used to test the distribution of PM10 polluted areas. Our results indicate that the head/tail break algorithm, with an appropriate segmentation threshold, can effectively identify areas with high PM10 concentrations. The distribution of the population according to exposure level shows that the majority of people is living in polluted areas. The distribution of heavily PM10 polluted areas in Germany follows the power-law distribution well, but their boundaries differ from the boundaries of administrative cities; some even cross several administrative cities. These classification results can guide policymakers in dividing the country into several areas for pollution control. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Germany; Head/tail; PM10 air pollution; Population exposure; Power-law distribution; Spatio-temporal distribution","atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); particulate matter; pollution control; pollution exposure; pollution monitoring; power law; research work; segmentation; spatiotemporal analysis; urban pollution; Germany; air pollutant; air pollution; city; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; Germany; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Germany; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077147786

In this study, aiming at the gas-phase transportation mode of CO2, first, a new prediction model of temperature, pressure as well as hydrate formation risk in buried CO2 transmission pipelines is established. Second, the model solving methods of differential discretization and piecewise iteration are introduced in detail. Third, model validation and sensitivity analysis of typical transmission parameters are performed. The results show that: (a) there is good agreement between the model prediction results and software simulation results. (b) The subcooling and the length of the hydrate formation region increase with the increase in the transmission rate. Appropriate increase in the CO2 transmission rate can reduce the risk of hydrate formation in CO2 transmission pipelines. (c) The subcooling and the length of the hydrate formation region decrease as the transmission temperature increases. In order to prevent hydrate risk in the CO2 transmission process, low transmission temperatures should be avoided. (d) The subcooling and the length of the hydrate-formation area increase first and then decrease as the transmission pressure increases. Appropriate increase in CO2 transmission pressure is conducive to avoiding hydrate formation risk.

Thus, it is very important to assess the response of crop growth and water productivity to climate change projections, which in turn can help devise adaptive strategies to mitigate their impact. An agro-hydrological model with well consideration of CO2 effects on both the stomatal conductance and leaf area was established. The model was well calibrated and validated using the data collected from the middle oasis of Heihe River basin, northwest China, which was selected as a typical arid region. Simulations of soil water contents and crop growth matched well with observations. Then various scenarios were designed with considering three climate change alternatives (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) and three agricultural water-saving alternatives in the context of irrigation water availability being constant. Responses of crop growth and water productivity were predicted for thirty years from 2018 to 2047. As compared to current situation, there would be a reduction of 3.4–8.6% in crop yield during the period of 2018–2027 and an increase of 1.5–18.7% in crop yield during the period of 2028–2047 for seed corn, and an increase of 7.4–26.7% in crop yield during the period of 2018–2047 for spring wheat, respectively. Moreover, results showed an increase in water productivity ranged from 14.3% to 44.5% for seed corn and from 34.7% to 52.0% for spring wheat, respectively. Furthermore, adaptive strategies to climate change were recommended for the seed corn and spring wheat, respectively. Our results are expected to provide implications for devising adaptive strategies to changing environments in other arid and irrigation-fed areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural water-saving; Arid region; Elevated CO2 concentration; Rising temperature; Water productivity","Arid regions; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Irrigation; Plants (botany); Productivity; Soil moisture; Water conservation; Water resources; Agricultural productions; Agricultural water; Arid and semi-arid regions; Climate change projections; Elevated CO2; Hydrological modeling; Rising temperatures; Water productivity; Climate change; arid region; carbon dioxide; climate change; concentration (composition); crop yield; high temperature; hydrological modeling; leaf area; soil water; stomatal conductance; water resource; agricultural waste; agriculture; algorithm; Article; calculation; China; climate change; controlled study; crop production; geography; harvest; leaf area; mathematical model; nonhuman; priority journal; river basin; stomatal conductance; water supply; crop; irrigation (agriculture); China; Gansu; Hei River; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; water; Agricultural Irrigation; China; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075900392

However, upon lung cancer carcinogens stimulation, there were no reports on the relationship between TCTP and lung cell carcinogenic epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This study was designed to investigate the molecular mechanism of regulation of TCTP expression and its role in lung carcinogens-induced EMT. Methods: To study the role of TCTP in lung carcinogens [particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) or 4-methylnitrosamino-l-3-pyridyl-butanone (NNK)]-induced EMT, PM2.5/NNK-treated lung epithelial and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells were tested. Cell derived xenografts, human lung cancer samples and online survival analysis were used to confirm the results. MassArray assay, Real-time PCR and Reporter assays were performed to elucidate the mechanism of regulation of TCTP expression. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.0 or SPSS version 20.0. Results: Translationally controlled tumor protein and vimentin expression were up-regulated in PM2.5/NNK-treated lung cells and orthotopic implantation tumors. TCTP expression was positively correlated with vimentin in human NSCLC samples. Patients with high expression of TCTP displayed reduced overall and disease-free survival. TCTP overexpression could increase vimentin expression and promote cell metastasis. Furthermore, PM2.5/NNK stimulation brought a synergistic effect on EMT in TCTP-transfected cells. TCTP knockdown blocked PM2.5/NNK carcinogenic effect. Mechanically, PM2.5/NNK-induced TCTP expression was regulated by one microRNA, namely miR-125a-3p, but not by methylation on TCTP gene promoter. The level of TCTP was regulated by its specific microRNA during the process of PM2.5/NNK stimulation, which in turn enhanced vimentin expression and played a permissive role in carcinogenic EMT. Conclusions: Our results provided new insights into the mechanisms of TCTP regulatory expression in lung carcinogens-induced EMT. TCTP and miR-125a-3p might act as potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for NSCLC. © 2020 The Author(s).","Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT); Lung carcinogens PM2.5/NNK; microRNA; Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP); vimentin","4 methylnitrosamino 3 pyridylbutanone; carcinogen; microRNA; microRNA 125a 3p; translationally controlled tumor protein; unclassified drug; vimentin; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bioassay; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; cancer tissue; carcinogenesis; cell migration; cell stimulation; controlled study; correlation analysis; disease free survival; disease marker; DNA methylation; drug targeting; epithelial mesenchymal transition; epithelium cell; gene knockdown; gene overexpression; Hong Kong; human; human cell; human tissue; lung; lung cancer; lung epithelium; lung non-small cell carcinoma cell line; MassArray assay; mouse; nonhuman; orthotopic transplantation; overall survival; particle size; particulate matter; promoter region; protein expression; protein function; real time polymerase chain reaction; reporter assay; survival analysis; upregulation; xenograft; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene expression regulation; genetics; lung; lung tumor; non small cell lung cancer; particulate matter; toxicity; tumor cell line; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Lung; Lung Neoplasms; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079334905

However, previous studies have focused on economic impacts, and on trade liberalization, while little is known about the equilibrium effects of trade barriers on the environment. Using a global computable general equilibrium model and taking the recent anti-trade policies of the Trump administration as an example, this study investigates the possible socio-economic and environmental effects of trade friction. Specifically, this study explores how the implemented six rounds of China–US trade friction and its different long-term development trends affect regional economic output, GHG and air pollutant emissions. Results show that trade barriers harm both countries’ economies and such losses have a certain permanence, while non-participants can benefit indirectly. Trade friction decreases participants’ GHG emissions, modifies global GHG emission distribution patterns, and leads to improved air quality in most countries. If governments continue to impose tariffs, global GHG emissions could counterfactually decrease by up to 5%. However, the change in trade patterns is not conducive to clean energy development in the less-developed regions, including the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America, and emission reductions from trade friction are insufficient to avoid catastrophic climate change. © 2019","Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Pollutant emissions; Tariff increase; Trade barrier","Air quality; Climate change; Commerce; Economic analysis; Emission control; Friction; Greenhouse gases; Regional planning; Air pollutant emission; Computable general equilibrium model; Economy and environmental; Environmental and economic impacts; Less-developed regions; Pollutant emission; Tariff increase; Trade barriers; Economic and social effects; climate change; economic impact; emission control; environmental economics; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; international trade; tariff structure; Africa; China; Latin America; Middle East; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076750603

NG-dedicated conversion can be achieved by the addition of a gas injector in the intake manifold and of a spark plug in place of the diesel injector. Previous studies indicated that lean-burn NG inside the traditional diesel chamber (i.e., a bowl-in-piston geometry) is a two-stage combustion (i.e., a fast burn inside the bowl followed by a slower burn inside the squish). However, a triple-peak apparent heat release rate (AHRR) was seen at specific operating conditions (e.g., advanced spark timing (ST) at medium load and engine speed), suggesting that one of the two combustion stages may separate again. Specifically, the burn inside the squish region divided in two events before and after top dead center (TDC). This was due to the different flow motion inside the squish during the compression stroke compared to the one in the expansion stroke, which affected the combustion environments. The result was the apparition of two close peaks in pressure trace, which suggest larger gradients in pressure and temperature than at a more delayed ST. In addition, the phasing and magnitude of three peaks of the heat release changed cycle-to-cycle. As an advanced ST is the usual strategy used in lean-burn SI combustion, understanding phenomena such as the one presented here can be important for reducing engine-out emissions and increase engine efficiency. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Despite its importance for regional and global ecological security, it is vulnerable because of human activities and climate change. Local government is trying to identify a more efficient way to conserve the delta thereby reducing a potential environmental crisis. The framework of hydrological connectivity provides a new perspective to study hydrological related ecological processes, while the method is highly exclusive because of environment and scale heterogeneity. This study collaborated with managers to develop a new algorithm to parameterize the hydrological connectivity on plot, point and landscape scales. Then the interspecific and conspecific structures of two dominate species (Phragmites communis and Suaeda salsa) are linked to these indices. The results show: (1) According to the point and plot scale results, AP (semi-artificial pond) and IF (intertidal flat) has the strongest hydrological connectivity followed by TM (tidal marsh). The average positive point-scale index values in AP, IF RS (river side wetland) and TM are 0.610, 0.495, 1.162 and 1.217 and the average plot-scale index values in AP, IF RS and TM are 1.53, 0.87, 0.48 0.55. At the landscape scale, index values show high collinearity with plot density and lack of hydrological significance because of low data resolution and scale effects.

We strengthen the robustness by constructing three different DEA models. For this purpose, we develop and compare three new measures, i.e. the biennial weight modified Russell model (BWMRM), the biennial bounded adjusted model (BBAM), and the biennial range adjusted model (BRAM). We further propose a related Luenberger productivity indicator and decompose green growth with two different methods, namely, the tradition-decomposition view (TDV) and the factors-decomposition view (FDV). We apply the proposed methodology to China's provincial data between 1999 and 2013. The main findings are as follows: First, China's green productivity has exhibited measurable improvements between 1999 and 2013, and technological progress is the main driving force, while efficiency deterioration has a weak negative effect. Second, the energy conservation and emission reduction performance are also the critical drivers of green productivity. Specifically, the performance of emission reduction is larger than that of energy conservation. Third, energy conservation and emission reduction improve the green productivity through promoting technical progress, which supports the Porter hypothesis. Fourth, the East and Central areas achieved win-win situation and the effect attained in the East is more remarkable, while the West encountered the “double deterioration” effect. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biennial bounded adjusted model; Biennial weight modified Russell model; China; Green growth; Green technology","Deterioration; Emission control; Energy conservation; China; Emission reduction; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Green growths; Green technology; Technical progress; Technological progress; Total factor productivity; Productivity; data envelopment analysis; economic growth; emission control; energy conservation; environmental economics; green economy; regional economy; technology adoption; total factor productivity; article; China; decomposition; deterioration; energy conservation; human; productivity; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075138777

In this study, three halophytic plant communities of Phragmites australis, Suaeda salsa, and Tamarix chinensis, were selected in two sites (sites 1 and 2) on the west coast of Bohai Sea. The net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), stomatal conductance (Gs), leaf vapor pressure deficit (VPDleaf) and their influencing factors were studied to test the possible carbon assimilation strategies of the halophytes. P. australis had higher Pn, Tr, and Gs than S. salsa and T. chinensis in both sites. Similar trends were found for leaf P and photosynthetic N and P efficiency (PNUE and PPUE, respectively) in one or both sites. By contrast, the leaf dry mass per area (LMA) increased in the order of P. australis &lt; S. salsa &lt; T. chinensis in both sites. For identical species in different sites, Pn, leaf P, and PNUE were lower but Tr, VPDleaf, leaf N, leaf N:P, and PPUE were higher in site 1 than in site 2 for one or more halophytes. Although soil physicochemical properties in different sites explained several variations among the halophytes, two-way ANOVA indicated that the species can explain most of the leaf traits compared with the site. LMA also had significant nonlinear relationships with Pn, Tr, Gs, and VPDleaf. PNUE and PPUE showed positive correlation with Pn in both sites, but they decreased in the power-law function with increasing LMA. Overall, the redundancy analysis showed that the gas exchange capacity of the halophytic plant communities was significantly affected by PPUE (60.0% of explanation), PNUE (57.1%), LMA (35.0%), leaf P (22.0%), and soil N (15.8%). © 2020 Liu et al.

Sixteen target PFCs, including perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs, C5–C14, C16, and C18) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs, C4, C6, C8, and C10), were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-negative electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS/MS). Concentrations of total PFCs (∑PFCs) ranged from 2.19 to 98.5 μg kg−1 (dry weight, dw), with an average of 5.97 μg kg−1 dw. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the dominant PFC, accounting for 23.9% of ∑PFCs. The highest ∑PFCs was found in the soil sample collected from Dongguan with a large number of manufacturing industries. There were no significant differences of ∑PFCs among unban, industrial, and agricultural soils, indicating similar pollution sources in soil of the PRD. More than 70% of ∑PFCs in soil of the PRD could be attributed to the four principal components, represented by PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) and perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUdA). Ecological risk assessment indicated that PFOA had low risk to soil plants and animals.

The main sources of agricultural GHGEs are fuel use, land use change, soil cultivation, and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, whereas animal waste and enteric fermentation are the most important GHGEs from animal husbandry. Carbon footprint (CF; CO2-equivalent kg?1 of product) determination through life cycle analysis (LCA) enables the quantification of the contribution of different methods of production to GHGEs. It allows for a comparison of CF among different products, as well as production optimization that typically results in production costs reduction. Research results highlight that the CF of agricultural products can be reduced through lowering inputs (e.g., fertilizers, fuel) for production, using varieties well adapted to the local environment, increasing carbon storage in soil, and minimizing transportation distance to the markets. Changing from intensive (high-input) to low-input agriculture reduces emissions. However, research should be conducted to explore if low-input agriculture maintains productivity at the required levels to feed an increasing global population. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Since PM2.5 is one of Taiwan's major air-pollution issues, Environmental Protection Administration of Taiwan (TEPA) promoted a policy that the sale of cars powered by fossil fuels would be banned in 2040, which means all the pollutants emitted by petrol-engine vehicles will be reduced. But at the same time the electric vehicles require additional power consumption, therefore, it is important to investigate the effect of air quality and health benefit when mobile emission reduces but power plant emission increases. To evaluate this clean air policy, Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) - Community Multi-scale Air Quality model (CMAQ) and Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP) were applied in scenarios discussion. The location of power plants to generate additional electric power and the seasonal variation were adapted in scenarios for considering the atmospheric transportation effects. The results showed if additional power supply was generated in northern, central, or southern Taiwan, the average annual PM2.5 concentration would be reduced by 2.88, 2.90, and 2.92 μg/m3, respectively. The associated health benefits would be 43.35 billion, 43.40 billion, and 43.54 billion USD. This evaluation presents adopting electric vehicles would improve the air quality of Taiwan significantly. The analysis of seasonal scenarios also indicates the location to generate additional electric power is important when adopting electric vehicles policy. The prevailing wind of different season will transport the air pollutant to diverse downwind area. The additional electricity demand generated by northern power plants in summer and autumn but switched to southern power plants in spring and winter would reduce 2.95 μg/m3 PM2.5 and lead to the best air quality and health benefits across Taiwan among the considered options. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CMAQ; Electric vehicle; Health benefits; PM2.5; Power plants; WRF","Air quality; Electric automobiles; Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Electric power utilization; Electric vehicles; Fossil fuels; Health; Power plants; Quality control; Weather forecasting; CMAQ; Community multi-scale air quality models; Environmental protection administrations; Health benefits; PM2.5; Pollution reduction; Power-plant emissions; Weather research and forecasting models; Electric power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075422938

Rehabilitating a wetland’s water table has the potential to restore the natural process of wetland soil carbon sequestration and storage. Further, little is known about the role of microbial communities that mediate carbon cycling during wetland rehabilitation practices. Here, we examined the carbon emissions and microbial community diversity during a wetland rehabilitation process known as “environmental watering” (rewetting) in an Australian, semi-arid freshwater floodplain wetland. By monitoring carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions during dry and wet phases of an environmental watering event, we determined that adding water to a degraded semi-arid floodplain wetland reduces carbon emissions by 28–84%. The watering event increased anoxic levels and plant growth in the aquatic zone of the wetland, which may correlate with lower carbon emissions during and after environmental watering due to lower anaerobic microbial decomposition processes and higher CO2 sequestration by vegetation. During the watering event, areas with higher inundation had lower CO2 emissions (5.15 ± 2.50 g CO2 m–2 day–1) compared to fringe areas surrounding the wetland (11.89 ± 4.25 g CO2 m–2 day–1). CH4 flux was inversely correlated with CO2 emissions during inundation periods, showing a 38% (0.013 ± 0.061 g CO2-e m–2 day–1) increase when water was present in the wetland. During the dry phases of environmental watering, there was CH4 uptake within the fringe and aquatic zones (−0.013 ± 0.063 g CO2-e m–2 day–1). A clear succession of soil microbial community was observed during the dry-wet phases of the environmental watering process. This suggests that wetland hydrology plays a large role in the microbial community structure of these wetland ecosystems, and is consequently linked to CO2 and CH4 emissions. Overall, the total carbon emissions (CO2 + CH4) were reduced within the wetland during and after the environmental watering event, due to increasing vegetative growth and subsequent CO2 sequestration. We, therefore, recommend environmental watering practices in this degraded arid wetland ecosystem to improve conditions for wetland carbon sequestration and storage. Further use of this management practice may improve wetland carbon storage across other arid freshwater wetland ecosystems with similar hydrologic regimes. © Copyright © 2020 Limpert, Carnell, Trevathan-Tackett and Macreadie.","16S diversity; carbon sequestration; environmental watering; floodplains; greenhouse gas emissions; microbial communities; soil organic carbon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079636941

Past efforts in understanding whether, and to what extent, adaptation improves household welfare have faced some key challenges including: 1) endogeneity of adaptation; 2) localized results that are difficult to generalize; and 3) understanding whether the efficacy of adaptation depends on the reasons for adaptation (e.g. market conditions vs climate change). In this study we estimate effects of smallholder agricultural adaptation on food security, while addressing each of these three challenges. First, we identify and test instrumental variables based on neighbor networks. Second, we use a dataset that contains information from 5159 households located across 15 countries in Africa, Asia, and Central America. Third, we investigate whether adaptation that is motivated by changes in market conditions influences the efficacy of adaptation differently than adaptation motivated by climate change. Across our global sample, an average household made almost 10 adaptive changes, which are responsible for approximately 47 days of food security yearly; an amount nearly 4 times larger than is indicated if endogeneity is not addressed. But these effects vary depending on what is motivating adaptation. Adaptation in response to climate change alone is not found to significantly affect food security. When climate adaptation is paired with adaptation in response to changing market conditions, the resulting impact is 96 food secure days. These results suggest the need for further work on the careful design of climate change interventions to complement adaptive activities. © 2019, International Society for Plant Pathology and Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptation; Food security; Global dataset; Instrumental variables; Smallholder agriculture","adaptive management; agricultural application; data set; environmental impact assessment; food security; global change; smallholder; Africa; Asia; Central America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076852244

To do so, we employ a recently developed local linear dummy estimation method to estimate the trend and coefficient functions. We find that the price elasticity for energy demand is either insignificant or positive and small. While the income elasticity for energy demand behaves in a non-linear fashion over-time, it is always less than unity and is generally within 0.6–0.8. A GDP elasticity of less than one suggests that these middle-income countries are on the right-hand-side of an inverted-U energy intensity-GDP path that is consistent with the dematerialization process.

In view of this, CsPbBr3–Au nanocomposite is fabricated and further employed as a concept model to study the electronic interaction between perovskite NC and Au NP for the first time. It has been found that the excitation-wavelength dependent carrier transfer behavior exists in CsPbBr3–Au nanocomposite. Upon illumination with visible light (λ &gt;420 nm), photo-generated electrons in CsPbBr3 can inject into Au with an electron injection rate and efficiency of 2.84 × 109 s−1 and 78%, respectively. The boosted charge separation is further translated into a 3.2-fold enhancement in CO2 photocatalytic reduction activity compared with pristine CsPbBr3. On the other hand, when solely exciting Au NP with longer wavelength light (λ &gt;580 nm), the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) induced hot electrons in Au NPs can transfer to CsPbBr3 NC and further participate in photocatalytic reaction towards CO2 reduction.

Mulberry is an important cash crop. Thus, establishing a standardized accounting method for the carbon footprint of mulberry production and analyzing its carbon emission scenarios is important in correctly understanding the impact of mulberry production on the environment. Using the life cycle assessment method and on the basis of the statistical data of mulberry production of urban farmers in Haining City, China, in 2014–2016, this study calculates and evaluates the carbon footprint of mulberry production. Results show the following. (1) Indirect carbon emissions is the main part of total carbon emissions, accounting for 85%–88% of total carbon emission, and industrial inputs (fertilizers and pesticides) are the main cause of carbon emissions. (2) The total carbon emissions per hectare in 2016 (6550.73 kgce/hm2) rose relative to the 2015 data (5617.92 kgce/hm2 at least in 2014) (5729.64 kgce/hm2). The output value of mulberry in spring was greater than that in summer and autumn, and the production efficiency of mulberry carbon in spring was higher than that in summer and autumn. The ecological environment of the mulberry production industry can be improved by increasing the resources of carbon sequestration and reducing the source of production input. (3) In general, the photosynthetic carbon sink of mulberry is greater than the total carbon emission and presents a positive externality to the ecological environment. © 2020 by the authors.

Reliable air quality modeling of PM2.5 is essential to future air quality projection, which serves as a critical source of information for policy-making. Although various evaluation methods have been suggested to assess the capability of air quality models in reproducing PM2.5, most of studies were focused on the mean behaviors of air quality models, with little emphasis on extreme conditions, which may be more crucial for human health and climate change. To address this need, we proposed an evaluation framework in this study to characterize both mean and extreme conditions of PM2.5 and applied it to the WRF-CMAQ simulations over contiguous United States for the period of 2001–2010. Results from statistical, spatiotemporal, and extreme quantile evaluation methods show consistent good performance of the model in the Eastern U.S. However, PM2.5 mean variations and extreme trends in the western U.S. are not well represented by the model attributable to the existence of complex terrains and active fire activities. In addition, the magnitude of decreasing trends for extreme events is smaller than that for the mean PM2.5. Strong correspondence is found between PM2.5 extremes and meteorological extremes that are associated with a stagnant condition. More extreme PM2.5 pollution episodes are expected in a warming climate, with rural regions and the western U.S. suffering the most. Our results highlight the urgency for proper forest management and joint-control of air quality and carbon emissions in order to combat extreme air pollution events in the future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Extreme quantile analysis; Fine particulate matter; Model performance; WRF-CMAQ","Air pollution control; Air quality; Climate change; Climate models; Particles (particulate matter); Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Quality assurance; Aerodynamic diameters; Air quality modeling; Evaluation framework; Extreme quantiles; Fine particulate matter; Meteorological extremes; Model performance; WRF-CMAQ; Quality control; air quality; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric pollution; climate change; correlation; extreme event; forest management; performance assessment; policy making; prediction; public health; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollution; air quality; air temperature; bootstrapping; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; correlational study; forecasting; forest management; human; particulate matter; priority journal; seasonal variation; secondary organic aerosol; spatiotemporal analysis; United States; wind speed; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075853847

Many studies have been conducted on the effects of forest fires on physical and chemical properties of topsoil, while the research on the fire-induced changes in carbon and other nutrients of soils has received much less attention, particularly that of soils in the active layer and near-surface permafrost. Here, using soil samples from two representative areas (Mangui and Alongshan), we investigated the effects of fires on soil nutrients of larch forest soils in the discontinuous permafrost zone in the northern Da Xing'anling (Hinggan) Mountains, Northeast China. The results showed that soil pH increased with fire severity due to the burning of soil organic matter by more severe fires and leaching of base elements in the residual ash into the soil, and; forest fires resulted in a weakly acidic post-fire soil environment. Soil total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus declined with increasing fire severity. A severe burn led to a substantial reduction of soil carbon and nitrogen, which were not recovered seven years after fire. However, there was no substantial change in the C/N ratio. For the two chosen areas, soil C/N ratios decreased with depth. In the first post-fire year, total potassium content increased and were similar at the sites affected by fires of different severity in the area burned seven years ago. There was no significant change in available phosphorus and available potassium. These changes were notable in the active layer and/or organic layers, but not so in the near-surface permafrost layer. Our results suggest that, in permafrost regions, forest fires have important effects on the distribution of soil carbon and other nutrients. This study on the feedback mechanisms between forest fires and nutrients in discontinuous permafrost regions in the northern Da Xing'anling Mountains is of importance for understanding the boreal carbon pool and cycling. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biogeochemical processes; Fire severity; Forest fire; Permafrost degradation; Soil chemical properties; Soil organic matter","active layer; biogeochemistry; forest fire; forest soil; permafrost; physicochemical property; soil carbon; soil chemistry; soil degradation; soil nutrient; soil organic matter; spatial distribution; topsoil; China; Da Hinggan Mountains; Larix",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074649960

However, despite substantial efforts in recent decades, large-scale 30-m land cover maps still suffer from relatively low accuracy in terms of land cover type discrimination (especially for the vegetation and impervious types), due to limits in relation to the data, method, and design of the workflow. In this work, we improved the land cover classification accuracy by integrating free and public high-resolution Google Earth images (HR-GEI) with Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery. Our major innovation is a hybrid approach that includes three major components: (1) a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classifier that extracts high-resolution features from Google Earth imagery; (2) traditional machine learning classifiers (i.e., Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) that are based on spectral features extracted from 30-m Landsat data; and (3) an ensemble decision maker that takes all different features into account. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 84.40% on the entire validation dataset in China, improving the previous state-of-the-art accuracies obtained by RF and SVM by 4.50% and 4.20%, respectively. Moreover, our proposed method reduces misclassifications between certain vegetation types, and improves identification of the impervious type. Evaluation applied over an area of around 14,000 km2 confirms little improvement for land cover types (e.g., forest) of which the classification accuracies are already over 80% when using traditional machine learning approaches, yet improvements in accuracy of 7% for cropland and shrubland, 9% for grassland, 23% for impervious and 25% for wetlands were achieved when compared with traditional machine learning approaches. The results demonstrate the great potential of integrating features of datasets at different resolutions and the possibility to produce more reliable land cover maps. © 2019","30-m land cover mapping; Data fusion; Deep learning; High-resolution Google Earth imagery; Landsat","Classification (of information); Climate change; Data fusion; Decision making; Decision trees; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Land use; Machine components; Machine learning; Mapping; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Vegetation; Classification accuracy; Convolutional neural network; Enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+); Google earths; Land cover classification; Land cover mapping; LANDSAT; Machine learning approaches; Image enhancement; accuracy assessment; algorithm; artificial nest; artificial neural network; climate change; data acquisition; integrated approach; land cover; land use; Landsat; machine learning; mapping method; satellite data; satellite imagery; support vector machine; vegetation type; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075775137

From the view of thermodynamics, the adsorbed-bulk gas phase equilibrium system should be well developed for accurately elaborating the mechanism of CO2 adsorption. Since thermodynamic properties of the adsorbed CO2 plays a significant role in the cyclic analysis of carbon capture technology, in this work, the Gibbs’ thermodynamic graphical method was extended to the expression of thermodynamic properties of the adsorbed CO2 as a specific case study. The 3-dimensional (3D) thermodynamic surface was established to determine the thermodynamic properties of the adsorbed CO2 in the thermodynamic equilibrium state. The temperature and pressure were treated as the individual variables to calculate the thermodynamic properties of the adsorbed CO2, including the adsorption capacity, chemical potential, entropy, and internal energy. Finally, the internal energy-adsorption capacity-entropy 3D thermodynamic surface of the adsorbed CO2 was obtained by the Gibbs’ thermodynamic graphical method. The thermodynamic surface established in this work will contribute and/or accelerate the research of the actual adsorption thermodynamic cycle and new findings are encouraged to be updated to our database to enhance the development on thermodynamic characteristics of the adsorption technology. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adsorbed phase; CO2 adsorption; Graphical method; Thermodynamic properties","Adsorption; Carbon capture; Entropy; Graphic methods; Thermodynamic properties; Adsorbed phase; Adsorption thermodynamics; CO2 adsorption; Gas phase equilibrium; Graphical methods; Temperature and pressures; Thermodynamic characteristics; Thermodynamic equilibria; Carbon dioxide; adsorption; carbon sequestration; database; Gibbs free energy; graphical method; pressure field; thermodynamics; three-dimensional modeling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076679839

In recent years, the research on household consumption and its environmental impact has become a research hotspot in the field of sustainable development. Taking 2000–2014 as the research period, this paper studies the indirect CO2 emissions of household consumption (ICEs-HC) in China by using the Multi-region Input-Output model. Then the structural decomposition analysis method is used to analyze the driving factors of ICEs-HC. The results show that: (1) During the study period, ICEs-HC in China showed an increasing trend. The total ICEs-HC increased by 1.90 times, and the per capita ICEs-HC increased by 1.76 times. (2) ICEs-HC in China are concentrated mainly in Commercial and Public Services (CPS), Electricity, Gas, Steam and Air Conditioning Supply (EGSA), and Manufacture of Food and Tobacco (MFT), which accounted for 26.63%, 17.69% and 13.52%, respectively, of the total emissions in 2014.

This study shows that ICEs-HC in China are likely to rise, and the government should not only constantly improve the level of household consumption, but also actively adjust the industrial structure and optimize the consumption structure to alleviate CEs effectively. © 2019","Household consumption; Indirect CO2 emissions; Multiregional input–output; Structural decomposition analysis","Air conditioning; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Environmental impact; Sustainable development; CO2 emissions; Consumption structure; Global climate changes; Household Consumption; Industrial structures; Mitigation strategy; Multi-region input-output models; Structural decomposition analysis; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; comparative study; decomposition analysis; emission control; environmental impact; input-output analysis; sustainable development; Article; carbon footprint; China; consumer; controlled study; data processing; growth rate; household; household consumption; human; limit of quantitation; population research; priority journal; quantitative analysis; time series analysis; China; Nicotiana tabacum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076783385

However, it is time-consuming and laborious to conduct sampling analysis, and it is also difficult to analyze the variation of potential sequestration of various ecosystems for greenhouse gases in China. This study used six 5-year periods of land use data for China between 1990 and 2015 to analyze the changes of three natural ecosystems (forest, grassland, and wetland). Correspondingly, the potential sequestration of the three ecosystems for three major greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide) during the 25 years were simulated through a greenhouse gas value (GHGV) model. The GHGV model was found to be a reliable alternative to calculating the carbon sequestration of natural ecosystems in China. The total greenhouse gas sequestration of China's natural ecosystems remained at around 267 Pg CO2-equivalent; however, the greenhouse gas sequestration had decreased by 3.3 Pg CO2-equivalent between 1990 and 2015. Comparison of the simulation results of the GHGV model based on the localized parameters and the model default parameters revealed that the simulated potential sequestration of the greenhouse gases for forest and wetland ecosystems (but not the grassland ecosystem) were smaller when run with localized parameters than the model default parameters. Moreover, the carbon sequestration of natural ecosystems was greater than the amount of anthropogenic carbon emissions, but the potential sequestration of natural ecosystems for greenhouse gas has become increasingly limited. Our study reveals the model can act as an important supplement for assessing the potential sequestration of the greenhouse gases for ecosystems at a regional scale. © 2020 by the authors.","CH4; Climate regulation; CO2; Ecosystem; GHGV model; Greenhouse gases; N2O","Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Nitrogen oxides; Wetlands; Anthropogenic carbon; Carbon sequestration; Climate regulation; Default parameters; Global carbon cycle; Grassland ecosystems; Natural ecosystem; Wetland ecosystem; Ecosystems; carbon cycle; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen dioxide; Carbon Dioxide; Forestry; Greenhouse Gases; Land Use; Nitrogen Oxides; Wetlands; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081136097

To address these challenges, based on the coexistence of crystalline and amorphous structures within cellulose, we coupled supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) and cellulase to utilize cellulose subregions. This approach is taken into consideration from the structure of cellulose. Cellulose amorphous regions were enzymatically hydrolysed into reducing sugar, and crystalline regions were converted to nanocellulose, representing efficient use of available raw material. This nanocellulose exhibited different properties with these derived from the traditional method. The smallest effective diameter almost was approximately 5nm, suggesting good uniformity and stability of the nanocellulose.

A new construction of double-layer buried pipes was adopted to enhance heat transfer and save land use. Annual performance of system from January to December 2017 was evaluated by analyzing inlet/outlet air parameters, thermal capacity, and power consumption variation. Different operation modes were adopted to simulate use patterns of various building styles. Results show that during heating operation, the maximum temperature produced by EAHE was 22.2 °C and its maximum heating capacity was 7718 W. The average temperature drop during the cooling operation was 13.6 °C. The system can provide fresh air with sufficient temperature independently. Both heat and mass transfer exist inside the buried pipes when operated under the cooling mode. Latent cooling capacity occupied 32.1% of total cooling capacity averagely, which reveals the importance of mass transfer. From the correlation analysis, it is clear that the heating capacity and sensible cooling capacity have the strongest correlation with inlet air temperature and the latent cooling capacity reacts to the moisture content. The average annual COP¯ of the system is 8.5. Compared to an air-source heat pump handling unit, the dynamic payback period is only 2.38 years and proposed system can further provide an 82.5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Earth-air heat exchanger; Economic analysis; Fresh air; Greenhouse gas emission; Performance evaluation; Severe cold region","Cooling; Economic analysis; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Land use; Mass transfer; Waste heat; Earth-air heat exchangers; Earthair heat exchanger (EAHE); Fresh air; Heat and mass transfer; Performance evaluation; Performance of systems; Power consumption variations; Severe cold regions; Air source heat pumps; air temperature; cold region; cooling; economic conditions; emission; equipment; experimental study; greenhouse gas; operations technology; performance assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068093576

Yet the limited spatiotemporal sampling capacities of current satellites result in considerable uncertainties in fire observation and emissions estimation. The mitigation of these uncertainties mainly relies on new remote-sensing technology. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-R) Series observes fires across North and South Americas at an unprecedentedly spatiotemporal resolution of nominal 2 km every 5–15 min. This study evaluated the GOES-16 (the first GOES-R satellite) ABI active fire product using active fire data derived from the 30-m Landsat-8 and the 375-m and 750-m Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and ground-based burning data across the southeastern Conterminous United States (CONUS) during the 2018 peak fire season. Specifically, we characterized the overall fire detection performance of the ABI active fire detections, estimated omission and commission errors, and evaluated ABI fire radiative power (FRP). The results showed that the ABI fire detection probability and its omission and commission errors were highly related to fire size and temporal period. ABI detection probability was higher than 95% for the fire pixel that contained over 114 Landsat-8 (30 m) fire detections or 11 VIIRS (375 m) detections. During a period of ±8 h, ABI detected 19% and 29% more fires observed by Landsat-8 and 375-m VIIRS, respectively. Correspondingly, the omission error could reduce by up to 33%. Further, ABI was able to detect 6–22% and 31–42% more ground-recorded fires than VIIRS in Georgia and Florida States, respectively, but ABI still missed many very small fires because ABI was hard to detect fires smaller than ~34.5 MW. Additionally, compared with 750-m VIIRS FRP, ABI FRP was ~30–50% larger in individual fire events but was overall similar at a regional scale. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Active fire product evaluation; GOES-16; Landsat8; Southeastern CONUS; VIIRS","Air quality; Errors; Fire detectors; Geostationary satellites; Image sensors; Remote sensing; Thermography (imaging); Weather satellites; Active fires; GOES-16; Landsat8; Southeastern CONUS; VIIRS; Fires; baseline survey; biomass burning; EOS; image analysis; Landsat; monitoring system; satellite imagery; uncertainty analysis; VIIRS; Florida [United States]; Georgia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076563880

We currently know very little about the combined effects of these changes on the links between the community structure, dynamics and the resulting in situ CO2 concentrations in freshwater ecosystems. Here we aimed to determine both individual and combined effects of temperature and non-resource diversity (species inedible for a given consumer) on CO2 concentration. Our analysis further aimed to establish both direct effects on CO2 concentrations and potential indirect effects that occur via changes to the phytoplankton and zooplankton biomasses. Our results showed that there were no interactive effects of changes in temperature and diversity on CO2 concentration in the water. Instead, independent increases in either temperature or non-resource diversity resulted in a substantial reduction in CO2 concentrations, particularly at the highest non-resource diversity. The effects of non-resource diversity and warming on CO2 were indirect, resulting largely from the positive impacts on total biomass of primary producers. Our study is the first to experimentally partition the impacts of temperature and diversity on the consumer–resource dynamics and associated changes to CO2 concentrations. It provides new mechanistic insights into the role of diverse plankton communities for ecosystem functioning and their importance in regulating CO2 dynamics under ongoing climate warming. © 2020, The Author(s).","Biodiversity; Climate warming; Consumer–resource interactions; Ecosystem functioning; Indirect effects; Trophic interactions","carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); ecosystem function; freshwater ecosystem; global warming; species diversity; trophic conditions; zooplankton; carbon dioxide; fresh water; animal; biodiversity; biomass; ecosystem; temperature; zooplankton; Animals; Biodiversity; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Fresh Water; Temperature; Zooplankton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078599170

One method to assign weight to each model is the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) in which posterior probability is used. For the cases of extreme climate, the generalized extreme value distribution (GEVD) is typically used. We applied the approach of GEV-embedded BMA to a series of 35 years of the annual maximum daily precipitation data (both historical data and data gathered from simulation experiments for future periods) over the Korean peninsula as simulated by the models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Simulation data under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios, namely RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, were used. Observed data and 17 CMIP5 models for 12 gird cells in Korea have been examined to predict future changes in precipitation extremes. A simple regional frequency analysis of pooling observations from three stations in each cell was employed to reduce the estimation variance and local fluctuations. A bias correction technique using the regression-type transfer function was applied to these simulation data. Return levels spanning over 20 and 50 years, as well as the return periods relative to the reference years (1971–2005), were estimated for two future periods, namely Period 1 (2021–2050) and Period 2 (2066–2095). From these analyses, relative increase observed in the spatially averaged 20-year (50-year) return level was approximately 23% (16%) and 45% (36%) in the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 experiments, respectively, by the end of the 21st century. We concluded that extreme rainfalls will likely occur two times and four times more frequently in the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, as compared to in the reference years by the end of the 21st century. © 2020 The Authors.

In such scenarios, heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing problem (HFVRP) is generally applied to plan an optimal delivery. However, in many downtown cores of large and rapidly developing Southeast Asian cities, HFVRP is neither viable nor reliable because of road usage restrictions. The purpose of this article is to develop and test a different approach that accurately takes these restrictions into account and provides viable and more sustainable results. Restrictions in this paper refer to situations of urban areas in Vietnam where (i) certain vehicle types are prohibited in specified areas or where narrow alleyways limit the utilization of vehicles that exceed the road capacity and (ii) certain roads are exclusive to certain vehicle types. In networks, limited access and exclusive lanes are represented as links, or arcs, exclusive to one or another. Taking these limitations into consideration, we have developed a unique model, which we have termed Vehicle Routing Problem with Exclusive Links (VRP-EL). The model was validated and tested for its performance on scenarios with varying ratios of exclusive links. Scenarios up to 500 customers were tested on a meta-heuristic algorithm, simulated annealing. VRP-EL produces realistic outcomes. Limiting certain links to be selected according to vehicle types increases overall travel distance. However, this increase outweighs the cost of re-planning and rerouting had they not been constrained initially. The reduction in traveling distance leads to fossil fuel reduction for the overall system. The estimation of reduced carbon emissions through applying the proposed model is presented. Considering the severe traffic congestion and carbon emissions caused by motorcycles in Vietnam, the proposed model leads to a sustainable road environment. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon emissions reduction; Courier services; Exclusive lanes; Exclusive motorcycle lanes; Motorcycle delivery; Simulated annealing; Urban logistics; Vehicle routing problems","automobile; carbon emission; developing world; emission control; fossil fuel; heterogeneity; heuristics; logistics; performance assessment; road; sustainability; traffic congestion; urban area; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081220438

FBN1 and FBN2 are involved in photoprotection of photosystem II, and FBN4 and FBN5 are thought to be involved in plastoquinone transport and biosynthesis, respectively. The functions of the other FBNs remain largely unknown. To gain insight into the function of FBN6, we performed coexpression and Western analyses, conducted fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy, stained reactive oxygen species (ROS), measured photosynthetic parameters and glutathione levels, and applied transcriptomics and metabolomics. Using coexpression analyses, FBN6 was identified as a photosynthesis-associated gene. FBN6 is localized to thylakoid and envelope membranes, and its knockout results in stunted plants. The delayed-growth phenotype cannot be attributed to altered basic photosynthesis parameters or a reduced CO2 assimilation rate. Under moderate light stress, primary leaves of fbn6 plants begin to bleach and contain enlarged plastoglobules. RNA sequencing and metabolomics analyses point to an alteration in sulfate reduction in fbn6. Indeed, glutathione content is higher in fbn6, which in turn confers cadmium tolerance of fbn6 seedlings. We conclude that loss of FBN6 leads to perturbation of ROS homeostasis. FBN6 enables plants to cope with moderate light stress and affects cadmium tolerance. © 2019 The Authors.

The system efficiency of the cogeneration system is 75–85 %, which is very high compared to existing only power generation facilities, so it is very useful for energy conservation and environmental protection. For this reason, interest in the cogeneration system is increasing worldwide. Generally, a cogeneration plant consists of a steam turbine alone or the combined power generation of a gas turbine and a steam turbine depending on the scale. The steam turbine is divided into a back-pressure type turbine and a condensing type turbine depending on the operational methodology of the steam turbine. In both cases, the shift in the return temperature of the district heating users influences the performance of the cogeneration plant, thus affecting the power generation costs of the power plant. It is possible to accurately estimate the change in the unit cost of the power generation caused by these changes, and to inflict it on the user, thereby changing the usage pattern of the user and reducing the energy consumption accordingly. In this study, the commercial combined cycle cogeneration system using back - pressure type turbine was simulated, and the change of performance of the combined heat and power plant was analyzed while changing the user facility’s total return temperature. Based on the results of this analysis, a possible loss in the plant according to the change of return temperature was predicted. Also the effect of each user’s return temperature on the plant loss was analyzed using an actual user’s return temperature data. The economic-mechanical approach, such as this study, can alleviate dissatisfaction with the user’s charge and to consume energy in a more rational way. It eventually can play a role in reducing carbon emissions. © 2020, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Back pressure turbine; Combined heat and power; District heating; Return temperature","Cost benefit analysis; District heating; Energy utilization; Power generation; Steam; Steam turbines; Thermal energy; Back-pressure turbines; Cogeneration systems; Combined heat and power; Combined heat and power system; Combined-cycle cogeneration; Energy conservation and environmental protections; System efficiency; Temperature data; Cogeneration plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079190628

Whilst the remote location of the small MEA has provided some protection from anthropogenic pressures due to distance and low population, we showed that from 26 to 27 November 2018, high temperatures along with a hypoxic event and a low tide led to the mass mortality of several Anaa's marine species. The mass mortality in the MEA (area: 27,000 m2) included &gt;14,000 juvenile fish, 1300 adult fish, 5100 juvenile crustaceans, and 260 juvenile octopus. This finding is particularly concerning because despite the creation of a MEA to protect marine resources, impacts from the warming waters associated with climate change limited the local efforts in Anaa atoll. This small, focused study demonstrates that local intervention may not be enough to mitigate the large-scale impacts of global climate change. It notes that local intervention can directly improve the fisheries resource but must be placed within a context of national and global interventions on climate change. © 2019","Dead zone; Global environmental change; Local management; Nursery areas","Fish; Fisheries; Marine biology; Anthropogenic pressures; Dead zones; Global climate changes; Global environmental change; High temperature; Large-scale impacts; Local management; Nursery areas; Climate change; atoll; crustacean; environmental change; finfish; global change; global warming; juvenile; marine ecosystem; mortality; population decline; adult; article; climate change; Crustacea; ebb tide; environmental change; fingerling; fishery; global climate; high temperature; marine species; mortality; nonhuman; nursery; octopus; warming; animal; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; fish; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (South); Crustacea; Octopus; Animals; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Fishes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076563703

As an indisputable fact, the combustion of the mixture of fuel and air in the combustion chamber is always accompanied by the oxidation of nitrogen; nitrogen oxide products will always accompany the combustion product. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is increasingly tightening emission regulations with shipping fleets, especially NOx emissions. For marine diesel engines, the NOx emission limit is set by Article 13 of Annex VI of MARPOL 73/78 and takes effect as of January 1, 2000. There are many solutions to reduce NOx emissions at the generating source, such as reducing early injection timing, exhaust air recirculation, water injection into the cylinder, ⋯ NOx adjustment solutions for diesel engines have been applied since MARPOL Article 13 came into effect. These solutions can be achieved by increasing the compression ratio, slowing the injection delay, and modifying the distribution phase of the exhaust. Emission circulation is a technique used to reduce emissions of nitrous oxide (NOx) on various types of marine engines. This EGR emissions system is used in conjunction with other emission control devices, such as exhaust catalytic converters to help minimize environmental emissions from marine engines.

These are considered the regional response to cooling during Heinrich events in the North Atlantic realm and several mechanisms have been suggested to explain this hemisphere-scale climatic teleconnection. In particular, reductions in Indian Ocean sea surface temperature (SST) have been proposed as the linking element between Heinrich events and WMIs. However, the validity of this relationship has only been demonstrated for the last ~20 kyr, leaving unresolved whether it also holds on longer time scales. Here we present a new paired record of planktonic foraminifera-based δ18Osw-ivc and UK' 37-based SST from the northern Bay of Bengal, covering the last ~130 kyr. The δ18Osw-ivc record clearly reflects orbitally paced changes of Indian Summer Monsoon intensity superimposed by centennial- to millennial-scale WMIs that occurred synchronously to North Atlantic Heinrich events. Comparison with the UK' 37-based SST reconstruction reveals, however, that WMIs in most cases were not paralleled by ocean surface cooling, questioning whether Indian Ocean SST lowering was the linking element between Heinrich events and reductions in monsoon precipitation in Asia also during the last glacial period. © 2020.

Demonstration projects are required to show technical feasibility and give confidence to investors in large commercial-scale deployments. Most previous literature focuses on assessing future commercial-scale systems, for which performance and costs will differ considerably from demonstration projects. Here, a detailed analysis is presented for a first-of-a-kind demonstration plant that would be built in the Southeastern US. The plant, which cogasifies biomass and lignite and captures CO2 prior to Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, was designed and simulated using Aspen Plus. The process heat recovery system was designed using a systematic optimization method. Lifecycle analysis was used to assess net greenhouse gas emissions. Capital and operating cost estimates were developed in collaboration with a major engineering firm. The plant produces 1252 barrels per day (80% jet fuel), exports 15 MWe (net), and has a net energy efficiency of 35.8% (lower heating value). Captured CO2 (1326 t/d) is sold for use in enhanced oil recovery. With biomass coming from sustainably-managed pine plantations, net lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions are well below those for petroleum jet fuel. The estimated range of capital required to build the plant is 3875–5762 $/kWth of feedstock input (2015$). As expected for a small demonstration designed to minimize technological risks, subsidies are required for the jet fuel product to compete with petroleum jet fuel. Technology innovations, learning via construction and operating experience, and larger plant scales will improve the economics of future commercial plants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Demonstration; Economics; Greenhouse gas emissions; Jet fuel; Lignite","Biomass; Calorific value; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Computer software; Cost benefit analysis; Cost engineering; Cost estimating; Demonstrations; Economics; Energy efficiency; Enhanced recovery; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Jet fuel; Life cycle; Lignite; Petroleum industry; Synthetic fuels; Waste heat; Capital and operating costs; Demonstration plants; Demonstration project; Enhanced oil recovery; Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions; Operating experience; Systematic optimization; Technology innovation; Gas emissions; biomass; carbon; design method; emission; feasibility study; fuel; greenhouse gas; lignite; optimization; performance assessment; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077652258

In order to ensure the system reliability, the auxiliary heater is required and the capacity is determined by the maximum heating load in conventional design. But solar energy not only contains energy value but also capacity value, which provides a chance for reducing auxiliary heater capacity. If ignored, it will lead to over-design and over-invest of the system. Furthermore, this value varies in different regions, so applicability analysis is needed. This paper proposes a reliability-based optimization method for auxiliary heater capacity. Based on the weather data of 16 capital cities in China, hourly heating load of a reference building and energy supply are simulated by EnergyPlus and TRNSYS. The optimal capacity is obtained by dichotomy optimization considering the temporal match of energy supply and demand. Compared with the conventional design results, the auxiliary heater capacity, cost and CO2 emissions can be reduced by 7.10 %–21.53 %, 1.97 %–4.33% and 1.68 %–5.83 %. The comprehensive benefit is higher in low latitude regions, especially in Tibet with abundant solar energy resources and lower heating load. Such distribution characteristics are helpful to guide the application of SHS in different regions and optimize the existing energy design scheme. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Applicability analysis; Auxiliary heater; Optimization; Reliability; Solar heating system","Economics; Heating equipment; Optimization; Reliability; Solar buildings; Solar energy; Solar heating; Applicability analysis; Auxiliary heater; Comprehensive benefit; Conventional design; Distribution characteristics; Reliability based optimization; Solar heating system; System reliability; Reliability analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075517584

Application of novel proxies in loess research could improve the state of knowledge of the past climatic changes. In order to examine the feasibility of cyanobacterial pigments to be used as biomarkers in paleoclimate reconstruction and thereby substantiate the presence of cyanobacterial community during loess accumulation, geochemical evidence of cyanobacteria-specific biomarkers in the sediment is required. In this study structurally different cyanobacterial metabolites were examined for their potential to be used as biomarkers. These compounds included scytonemin wavelength equivalent (SWE) and mycosporine wavelength equivalent (MWE) compounds. The effect of various physico-chemical factors (pH value, temperature and light source) on the production of SWE and MWE compounds in correlation with the nitrogen content of the growth medium was studied. SWE compounds were observed in 8 out of 15 soil and aquatic cyanobacterial strains, while MWE compounds were found in all 15 strains. The results show that exposure to UV light induced a higher synthesis of both pigments.

Improving traffic control at an intersection is another way to reduce vehicular emissions and creating a positive impact on the environment. Roundabout intersection excepted to reduce the CO2 emissions as a result of reducing the vehicle idling time and delays. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the CO2 emissions in a roundabout intersection using a cellular automata model. The roundabout system is composed of the circulating lane and entry/exit lanes, where the entry/exit lanes are controlled by a set of traffic signals (Sn) operating in a fixed-time T. We explore numerically the dependence of the total CO2 emission rate on the injection and extraction rates. Surprisingly, even a small number of vehicles that break the rules of entrance to the circulating lane can affect the CO2 emissions on the roundabout system. Furthermore, we found that the variation of the number Sn, as well as the cycle time play an important role in the variation of the CO2 emissions. Macroscopic and microscopic analyses are conducted to understand the effect of the various parameters on the CO2 emissions in the roundabout system. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cellular automata; CO2 emissions; Roundabout intersection; Traffic lights strategies","Cellular automata; Particulate emissions; Street traffic control; Traffic signals; Cellular automata modeling; CO2 emissions; Impact on the environment; Macroscopic and microscopic; Model and simulation; Number of vehicles; Traffic light; Vehicular emission; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077311020

Firstly, a process-oriented biogeochemical model (Denitrification Decomposition, DNDC) was calibrated and validated on representative MF, TG and BF hillslopes. To upscale the simulations, hydropedological function (HPF) units were generated by overlapping maps of land use, soil organic carbon, rock fragment content and slope, which were recognized as critical factors affecting soil N cycle. The calibrated DNDC models were then adopted to simulate the soil N cycles in different HPF units and assess temporal and spatial variations of NO3 −-N leaching and N2O emission risks. Lastly, spatial allocations of TG were determined respectively for minimizing NO3 −-N leaching (MLN_LU) and N2O emission (MEN_LU), and balancing the reductions of both (BRN_LU). Results showed that the DNDC model had acceptable accuracies on these representative hillslopes (R2 &gt; 0.50, NSE &gt; 0.30). Land use of TG had the greatest N loss risks, the mean annual NO3 −-N leaching and N2O flux in TG HPF units (72.11- and 3.63- kg N ha−1, respectively) were respectively 2.61 and 2.50 times of those of the entire study area. Temporal variations of NO3 −-N leaching and N2O flux were both controlled by the timing of precipitation, and their spatial patterns were both primarily controlled by land use and then respectively by soil hydraulic properties (NO3 −-N leaching) and soil carbon and N concentrations (N2O flux). Due to the relatively small spatial variations of soil and terrain properties and rational land use spatial patterns in this study area, the MLN_LU only reduced 7.6% of NO3 −-N leaching, the MEN_LU only reduced 6.0% of N2O flux, and the BRN_LU reduced both by 3.3% and 4.1%, respectively. This study emphasized the role of land use pattern optimization in reducing the non-point N losses in mountainous area, and could provide scientific guidelines for future agricultural land developments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","DNDC model; Hydropedological function; Nitrogen cycles; Taihu basin; Tea garden","Forestry; Leaching; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Risk assessment; Soil pollution; Soil surveys; Soils; Biogeochemical modeling; DNDC models; Land use pattern optimizations; Nitrogen cycles; Soil hydraulic properties; Taihu basins; Tea gardens; Temporal and spatial variation; Land use; agricultural land; hydrogeology; land use; model; mountain region; nitrogen cycle; optimization; soil nitrogen; China; Taihu Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075100603

To rapidly evaluate outdoor thermal features, this paper presents a three-dimensional integrated numerical model to assess building surface temperature and mean radiant temperature (MRT) in typical outdoor industrial environments of Singapore. For proper accounting of solar irradiance and radiant heat fluxes, Perez all-weather model and finite volume discrete ordinates method (fvDOM) are integrated into numerical code. Under the climate conditions of Singapore, i.e., light wind and intense solar irradiance, the model adopts a daily-average convection coefficient to simplify air dynamics to solve the surface energy balance equation so that the model efficiency can be significantly improved. Surface thermal load computed using the model has been validated by the on-site measurement for a contemporary and a matured industrial building on two sunny days. By comparing simulated and measured results, the corresponding coefficient of determination (R2) and the refined index of agreement (RIA) are respectively &gt; 0.99 and &gt; 0.8 to indicate that the model agrees well with the measurement. Also, the model is used to predict the MRT map around the industrial environment and to demonstrate that tree shading reduces mean MRT of 6.3 °C for daily-average and 13.29 °C at noon in a street canyon under a 25% greenery coverage ratio. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Industrial; Mean radiant temperature; Solar irradiance; Surface temperature; Surface thermal load; Tropical urban","Atmospheric temperature; Energy utilization; Numerical methods; Office buildings; Radiant heating; Solar radiation; Surface properties; Thermal load; Tropics; Industrial; Mean radiant temperature; Solar irradiances; Surface temperatures; Tropical urban; Climate models; air temperature; heat flux; irradiance; numerical model; solar radiation; surface temperature; three-dimensional modeling; tropical environment; urban area; Singapore [Singapore (NTN)]; Singapore [Southeast Asia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076243755

Here, we show how varying pH conditions (5.0–8.5, phosphate buffered) and the application of a phosphate buffer per se induce shifts in the microbial community composition and the carbon flow during nine weeks of thermophilic batch digestion. Beside monitoring the methane production as well as volatile fatty acid concentrations, amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was conducted. The presence of 100 mM phosphate resulted in reduced CH4 production during the initial phase of the incubation, which was characterized by a shift in the dominant methanogenic genera from a mixed Methanosarcina and Methanoculleus to a pure Methanoculleus system. In buffered samples, acetate strongly accumulated in the beginning of the batch digestion and subsequently served as a substrate for methanogens. Methanogenesis was permanently inhibited at pH values ≤5.5, with the maximum CH4 production occurring at pH 7.5. Adaptations of the microbial community to the pH variations included shifts in the archaeal and bacterial composition, as less competitive organisms with a broad pH range were able to occupy metabolic niches at unfavorable pH conditions. © 2020 by the authors.

Herein, we report oxidative methane conversion to ethane using gaseous O2 at low temperatures (&lt;400 °C) and atmospheric pressure in a continuous reactor. A highly oxidized Pd deposited on ceria could produce ethane with a productivity as high as 0.84 mmol gcat−1 h−1. The Pd−O−Pd sites, not Pd−O−Ce, were the active sites for the selective ethane production at low temperatures. Density functional theory calculations confirmed that the Pd−O−Pd site is energetically more advantageous for C−C coupling, whereas Pd−O−Ce promotes CH4 dehydrogenation. The ceria helped Pd maintain a highly oxidic state despite reductive CH4 flow. This work can provide new insight for methane upgrading into C2 species. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Large orbitally forced wet/dry extremes occur during interglacial time, ∼130 to 80 ka, and conditions between these two extremes prevail during glacial time, ∼70 to 15 ka. Orbital precession causes high seasonality in Northern Hemisphere (NH) insolation at ∼125, 105, and 83 ka, with stronger and northward extended summer monsoon rains in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula and increased winter rains in the Mediterranean Basin. The combined effects of these two seasonally distinct rainfall regimes increase vegetation and narrow the width of the Saharan–Arabian desert and semidesert zones. During the opposite phase of the precession cycle (∼115, 95, and 73 ka), NH seasonality is low, and decreased summer insolation and increased winter insolation cause monsoon and storm track rains to decrease and the width of the desert zone to increase. During glacial time (∼70 to 15 ka), forcing from large ice sheets and lowered greenhouse gas concentrations combine to increase winter Mediterranean storm track precipitation; the southward retreat of the northern limit of summer monsoon rains is relatively small, thereby limiting the expansion of deserts. The lowered greenhouse gas concentrations cause the near-equatorial zone to cool and reduce convection, causing drier climate with reduced forest cover. At most locations and times, the simulations agree with environmental observations. These changing regional patterns of climate/vegetation could have influenced the dispersal of early humans through expansions and contractions of well-watered corridors. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

In this review, we discuss fundamental factors controlling emissions of major GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N2O) from tropical peatlands and their contribution to global climate change. Classifying peatlands in tropical and subtropical regions can aid in understanding their emission characteristics. The applicability of existing GHG emission factors to land use categories in SEA is discussed. We find that rewetting peatland can increase CH4 emissions, and therefore more studies are needed to establish whether peatlands act as a net sink or net sources of GHGs. Few studies have investigated the effectiveness of liming towards reducing peat soil acidity. The review also finds that there is limited data on CO2 concentrations in drainage and wildfire areas, N2O fluxes in agriculture areas, and the impact and reduction of CH4 in tropical peatlands. Addressing these research gaps could support the development of a framework for GHG emission measurements and abatement in tropical peatlands. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Emission fluxes; Global climate change; Greenhouse gases; Peatsoil; Water management system","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Gas emissions; Land use; Soils; Tropics; Water management; Wetlands; CO2 concentration; Emission characteristics; Emission fluxes; Global climate changes; Peatsoil; Southeast Asia; Subtropical regions; Water management systems; Greenhouse gases",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074390228

According to this SQM hypothesis, strange planets can also stably exist. The density of normal matter planets can hardly be higher than 30 g cm-3. They will be tidally disrupted when the orbital radius is less than ∼5.6 × 1010 cm, or when the orbital period (P orb) is less than ∼6100 s. However, an SQM planet can safely survive even when it is very close to the host, due to its high density. This feature can help us identify SQM objects. Here, we have tried to search for SQM objects among close-in exoplanets orbiting around pulsars. It is found that four pulsar planets (XTE J1807-294 b, XTE J1751-305 b, PSR 0636 b, PSR J1807-2459A b) completely meet the criterion of P orb &lt; 6100 s, and are thus good candidates for SQM planets. The periods of two other planets (PSR J1719-14 b and PSR J2051-0827 b) are only slightly larger than the criterion value. They could be regarded as potential candidates. Additionally, we find that the periods of five white dwarf planets (GP Com b, V396 Hya b, J1433 b, WD 0137-349 b, and SDSS J1411+2009 b) are less than 0.1 day; they might also be SQM planets.

Many cities are rolling out bike share programs. However, few studies have evaluated how bike share systems (BSS) are used to quantify their sustainability impacts. This study proposes a Bike Share Emission Reduction Estimation Model (BS-EREM) to quantify the environmental benefits from bike share trips and compare the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions from BSS in eight cities in the United States, including New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle. The BS-EREM model stochastically estimates the transportation modes substituted by bike share trips, considering factors such as trip distance, trip purpose, trip start time, the accessibility of public transits, and historical distributions of transportation mode choices. Based on average life cycle emission factors of different transportation modes, our analysis reveals that the annual GHG emission reductions contributed by the eight BSSs in year 2016 range from 41 tons of CO2-eq (Seattle) to 5417 tons of CO2-eq (New York City), while the emission reductions per trip range from 283 to 581 g CO2-eq. The total annual emission reduction is linearly correlated to the number of trips, bikes, and docks. The bike share stations located in the center of a city contributed to more total GHG emission reductions due to the high trip volumes, while the stations that are further away have higher emission reductions on a per trip basis due to longer trips and higher car substitution rate. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bike share; Environmental benefit; Greenhouse gas reduction; Mode replacement; Shared economy","Bicycles; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Gas emissions; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Bike share; Environmental benefits; Greenhouse gas reductions; Mode replacement; Shared economy; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; accessibility; commuting; cycle transport; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; quantitative analysis; transportation mode; transportation system; travel behavior; Article; bike share system; carbon footprint; correlational study; environmental protection; exhaust gas; human; life cycle; mathematical model; traffic and transport; United States; Boston; California; Chicago; District of Columbia; Illinois; Los Angeles [California]; Massachusetts; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; Pennsylvania; Philadelphia; San Francisco [California]; Seattle; United States; Washington [District of Columbia]; Washington [United States]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074222519

The objective was to identify the highest emitters and assess whether PN focus should be extended to engine and fuel types other than diesel and gasoline direct injection (GDI). Results (under the cold-start RDE-compliant route) show that a Euro 6b gasoline vehicle equipped with port fuel injection (PFI) engine, comprised the highest PN emitter (4.5 times higher than the Euro 6 limit of 6 × 1011 p/km), while similar emission levels (up to 3.7 times higher than this limit) were detected in the older-technology (Euro 3 and 4) gasoline and (retrofitted) LPG PFI vehicles. This limit was also exceeded (by 1.7 times) by one gasoline direct injection (GDI) Euro 6b non-GPF vehicle. PN emissions from the hybrid-electric vehicle (equipped with gasoline PFI engine) were lower than the other Euro 6b PFI vehicle, but still high compared to typical PFI engines found in literature. The lowest emissions were detected in diesel and CNG engines (as low as 7.8 × 109 and 2.4 × 1010 p/km respectively). Euro 6b LPG vehicle was found to be a low emitter (3.3 times lower than the 6 × 1011 p/km limit), while similar emission levels were detected in the other Euro 6b non-GPF GDI vehicle. Among the different driving sections (urban, rural, motorway), urban and especially the cold phase had the highest contribution in most cases. Finally, a significant PN reduction potential was observed with LPG and CNG over gasoline (up to 93% and 90% respectively), although the opposite trend was detected in an old-technology retrofitted LPG vehicle. These results indicate that close attention should be focused on other engine and fuel types, apart from diesel and GDI. Regulatory initiatives towards air pollution reduction should include measures for the reduction of high-emission old-technology gasoline and LPG vehicles, while modern gasoline PFI engines should also be further scrutinized. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Alternative fuels; Bi-fuel; Hybrid powertrain; On-road tests; Solid particle number","Alternative fuels; Compressed natural gas; Diesel engines; Direct injection; Electric lighting; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Hybrid powertrains; Hybrid vehicles; Liquefied natural gas; Powertrains; Bi-fuels; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Gasoline direct injection; Hybrid-electric powertrain; Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); Port fuel injection engines; Road tests; Solid particles; Liquefied petroleum gas; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; diesel fuel; gasoline; liquefied petroleum gas; natural gas; nitrogen oxide; nitrous oxide; alternative fuel; biofuel; diesel; emission; engine; experimental study; liquefied petroleum gas; natural gas; testing method; air pollution; combustion; exhaust gas; highway; oxidation; priority journal; temperature; velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075434787

The main objective of the current research is to introduce an innovative methodological framework which can effectively assess adaptation measures in basins with severe water deficits by coupling hydrology, climate change and management scenarios, leading to accurate decision making. In this paper, both supply and demand adaptation measures were proposed in line with various regional, national and European policies in order to improve the severe water problem of the Mygdonia basin. The overexploitation of the surface water systems (Lakes Koronia and Volvi) and groundwater resources of the Mygdonia basin during the previous decades, along with the projected decrease of the future water availability, due to climate change, accentuate the need for concerted action towards adaption to climate change. The measures include the increase of a stream diversion towards Lake Koronia, the increase of the embankment elevation at the outfall point of Lake Volvi, the restructuring of crops and their combinations. The measures were examined in terms of their sustainability and effectiveness in the short-term (2020–2050) and long-term (2050–2080) future periods under the most reliable climatic model. The results indicate that the application of demand management measures is more efficient compared to supply oriented solutions for addressing the future water deficit of the Mygdonia water system. The combination of crop restructuring and the decrease of agricultural land proved to be the most efficient and sustainable solution. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptation measures; Climate change; Lake Koronia; Lake Volvi; Mygdonia basin; Water resources management","Crops; Decision making; Economics; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Lakes; Plants (botany); Surface water resources; Water management; Waterworks; Adaptation measures; Adaptation to climate changes; Integrated water management; Lake Koronia; Management scenarios; Methodological frameworks; Mygdonia basin; Water resources management; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; decision making; efficiency measurement; sustainability; water management; water resource; water stress; water supply; Central Macedonia; Greece; Lake Koronia; Lake Volvi; Mygdonian Basin; Thessaloniki [Central Macedonia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079481751

Explaining this variation in climate change response is critical for accurate global change modeling. Here we quantify how closely assemblages track changes in climate (match/mismatch) and how broadly climate niches are spread within assemblages (narrow/broad ecological tolerance, or “filtering”) using data for the past 21,000 years for 531 eastern North American fossil pollen assemblages. Although climate matching has been strong over the last 21 millennia, mismatch increased in 30% of assemblages during the rapid climate shifts between 14.5 and 10 ka. Assemblage matching rebounded toward the present day in 10%–20% of assemblages. Climate-assemblage mismatch was greater in tree-dominated and high-latitude assemblages, consistent with persisting populations, slower dispersal rates, and glacial retreat. In contrast, climate matching was greater for assemblages comprising taxa with higher median seed mass. More than half of the assemblages were climatically filtered at any given time, with peak filtering occurring at 8.5 ka for nearly 80% of assemblages. Thus, vegetation assemblages have highly variable rates of climate mismatch and filtering over millennial scales. These climate responses can be partially predicted by species’ traits and life histories. These findings help constrain predictions for plant community response to contemporary climate change. © 2019 by The University of Chicago.","Climate matching/mismatching; Community assembly; Community ecology; Macroecology; Paleoecology","biostratigraphy; fossil assemblage; paleobotany; paleoecology; palynology; plant community; proxy climate record; seed dispersal; anatomy and histology; classification; climate change; fossil; ice cover; North America; physiology; plant seed; pollen; tree; vascular plant; Climate Change; Fossils; Ice Cover; North America; Pollen; Seeds; Tracheophyta; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077248558

Parallel with these efforts is the utilization of terminology, such as ‘ocean acidification’ (OA) and ‘ocean deoxygenation’ (OD), that can foster rapid comprehension of complex processes driving carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2) concentrations in the global ocean and thus, are now widely used in discussions within and beyond academia. However, common usage of the terms ‘acidification’ and ‘deoxygenation’ alone are subjective and, without adequate contextualization, have the potential to mislead inferences over drivers that may ultimately shape the future state of marine ecosystems. Here we clarify the usage of the terms OA and OD as global, climate change-driven processes and discuss the various attributes of elevated CO2 and reduced O2 syndromes common to coastal ecosystems. We support the use of the existing terms ‘coastal acidification’ and ‘coastal deoxygenation’ because they help differentiate the sometimes rapid and extreme nature of CO2 and O2 syndromes in coastal ecosystems from the global, climate change-driven processes of OA and OD. Given the complexity and breadth of the processes involved in altering CO2 and O2 concentrations across marine ecosystems, we provide a workflow to enable contextualization and clarification of the usage of existing terms and highlight the close link between these two gases across spatial and temporal scales in the ocean. These distinctions are crucial to guide effective communication of research within the scientific community and guide policymakers responsible for intervening on the drivers to secure desirable future ocean states. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; coastal acidification; coastal deoxygenation; definition(s); hypoxia; ocean acidification; ocean deoxygenation; terminology","Anthropocene; biome; carbon dioxide; climate change; concentration (composition); global ocean; hypoxia; marine ecosystem; ocean acidification; oxygen; carbon dioxide; oxygen; sea water; climate change; ecosystem; human; pH; sea; syndrome; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Oceans and Seas; Oxygen; Seawater; Syndrome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075335860

Among different carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, quantum dots etc., the hybrid between single-walled carbon nanohorn aggregates (SWCNH) and photochromic molecules is the least explored in photoinduced conductance switching. Here, we report the synthesis of a hybrid between nanohorn aggregates and the cardanol-derived photochromic azobenzene system. The hybrids are constructed by covalent and noncovalent functionalization between azobenzene and SWCNH. Upon UV irradiation, the yields of the cis isomer at a photostationery state for covalent and noncovalent hybrids are 47% and 62%, respectively. Similarly, the rates of trans-cis photoisomerization for covalent and noncovalent hybrids are 0.04923 and 0.08684 min-1, respectively. The peculiar morphology of carbon nanohorns accommodates more azobenzene in the noncovalent hybrid and retains the photoisomerization capacity of azomolecule. However, similar isomerization is less feasible when azomolecule is covalently functionalized with SWCNH-F. It also influences the photoinduced conductance switching performance of hybrid materials. The trans-cis isomerization of azobenzene in noncovalent hybrids imparts better photoinduced conductance switching with electrically conducting carbon nanohorns. In comparison to carbon nanotubes and reduced graphene oxides, a prepared hybrid system displays better phototuned conductance switching. This hybrid material is a potential candidate for sustainable molecular electronics. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","Bioresources; Conductance tuning; Nanohorn; Sustainable chemistry","Aggregates; Azobenzene; Carbon Quantum Dots; Graphene; Graphene quantum dots; Hybrid materials; Hybrid systems; Irradiation; Isomerization; Isomers; Molecules; Nanohorns; Photochromism; Reduced Graphene Oxide; Semiconductor quantum dots; Switching; Bioresources; Carbon nano-materials; Non-covalent functionalization; Photochromic azobenzene; Photochromic molecules; Single walled carbon nanohorns; Sustainable chemistry; Trans-cis isomerization; Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081018474

The device adsorbs CO2 and a small amount of moisture in the CO2 capture process. To activate a CO2 capture device for air recirculation in a building or connect it to an air handling unit to minimize the ventilation rate, the air needs to be controlled to have a steady-state humidity ratio below 12 g/kg, which is the maximum humidity ratio allowed in a room according to international standards. This study exhibits the moisture performance of an implemented CO2 capture device in the operation of an air ventilation system and its ability to recirculate indoor air via experimentation and numerical modeling for saving energy in buildings. Moreover, this research also evaluates the humidity performance using the strategy of connecting the CO2 capture device with an air handling unit and recirculating the air in the breathing zone based on an occupancy diversity factor. Based on these results, the study indicates that the air recirculation achieved by either using the CO2 capturing unit itself or connecting it to an air handling unit reduces not only the thermal energy load but also the energy load of dehumidifying the air in buildings.

The present study surveyed nine Japanese deep freshwater lakes to show the pattern and mechanisms of such aerobic CH4 production and subsurface methane maximum (SMM) formation. The field survey observed the development of SMM around the metalimnion in all the study lakes. Generalized linear model (GLM) analyses showed a strong negative nonlinear relationship between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), as well as a similar curvilinear relationship between DIN and dissolved CH4, suggesting that the availability of organic carbon controls N accumulation in lake waters thereby influences the CH4 production process. The microbial community analyses revealed that the distribution of picocyanobacteria (i.e., Synechococcus), which produce CH4 in oxic conditions, was closely related to the vertical distribution of dissolved CH4 and SMM formation. Moreover, a cross-lake comparison showed that lakes with a more abundant Synechococcus population exhibited a greater development of the SMM, suggesting that these microorganisms are the most likely cause of methane production.

While physical infrastructure is important, cities can gain important insights through information about human behavior, as people are the end users of buildings, transportation, and other physical assets. In this paper, we present a simplistic, pilot agent-based model (ABM) for New York City with projections about the city's potential for reaching the 80 × 50 goal in the building sector. Importantly, the ABM models occupant choices about technology adoption to predict the prevalence of green buildings in coming years. We find that even though traditional building types are slow to transition, CO2 production still decreases substantially over the forecast interval. Traditional buildings begin to slow their dominance in the model pathways by approximately 10 years into the forecast. Although the ABM presented here relies on simplistic assumptions about human agents and brings a high level of uncertainty, it presents a useful pilot tool to begin to understand system-level impacts from micro-level actions of households and individuals, and provides vast potential for future use of ABMs for this task. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based model; Buildings; Energy efficiency; Greenhouse gas emissions; New York City; Occupant behavior","building; carbon emission; emission control; energy efficiency; greenhouse gas; modeling; technology adoption; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074750757

Accordingly, a large amount of energy, particularly fossil fuels, should be supplied annually to this important sector of the industry, thereby increasing environmental hazards for human health and ecosystems. Therefore, the hotspots of energy consumption and environmental impacts of food production systems should be accurately identified in order to improve their efficiency and sustainability. To this end, energy consumption and environmental impacts of apple juice production in West Azarbaijan province of Iran was analyzed in the present study from farm gate to end of packaging of bottled juice using energy flow and life cycle assessment (LCA) approaches. According to the results of energy analysis, the specific energy consumption of apple juice production was found to be 28.33 MJ/bottle. More specifically, diesel fuel, natural gas, and polyethylene terephthalate bottles had the greatest contributions to the specific energy consumption of apple juice production. Based on the outcomes of the LCA approach, the corresponding life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of the resources consumed in apple juice production were 1.83 kg CO2 eq, mainly caused by the combustion of diesel and natural gas. The damages to ecosystem quality due to acidification and eutrophication were respectively found to be 1.69 × 10−2 kg SO2 eq and 4.54 × 10−3 kg PO4 −3 eq, mainly because of resources utilization in the agricultural production step. The emissions released due to the consumption of chemical fertilizers and farmyard manure in the agricultural production step had the highest impacts in acidification and eutrophication impact categories. The emissions arisen from the production and consumption of pesticides were the hotspots in abiotic depletion, ozone layer depletion, human toxicity, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, and terrestrial ecotoxicity. Overall, it could be concluded that using bio-fertilizers and biological control approaches in the agricultural production step as well as implementing renewable energy technologies in the juicing step could potentially mitigate the environmental burdens of apple juice production. © 2019","Apple juice; Apple production; Energy consumption; Environmental analysis; Juice processing; Life cycle assessment","Acidification; Climate change; Diesel engines; Ecosystems; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Fossil fuels; Fruit juices; Fruits; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Health hazards; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Ozone layer; Plastic bottles; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Apple juice; Apple production; Environmental analysis; Juice processing; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075370411

Urban vegetation experienced various changes due to biotic and natural interference which alter the vegetation structure, function and ecology. The present study deals with the assessment of shrub species structure, diversity, biomass, volume, C storage and CO2 mitigation potential in an urban setup. Total four sites were selected, viz., east, west, north and south directions of Ambikapur City. A sum of eight shrub species representing seven families was recorded in Ambikapur City area. The highest representatives were recorded towards east direction (seven species with six families) and lowest towards south direction (five species with five families). The total density of shrubs ranged between 230 and 570 individual ha− 1 being highest at east direction and least at south direction. The higher diversity was found at east direction. The shrub biomass was ranged between 0.999 and 2.603 t/ha being highest at north direction and lowest at east direction. The shrub volume, C storage and CO2 mitigation values reflected similar trend as in case of shrub biomass. The shrub volume, C stock and CO2 mitigation values were ranged from 0.141 to 0.250 m3/ha, 0.437 to1.132 t/ha and 1.597 to 4.156 t/ha, respectively, among the various sites. The species like Cestrum nocturnum and Nerium oleander are found to be potential in terms of various ecological services such as biomass, C storage and CO2 mitigation in different sites. However, Lantana camara was also found to be potential species under urban setup which can be utilized for its various ecological functions. Further, it was found that the contribution of the non-native species was higher over native species in terms of stand density, basal area, biomass, C stock, volume and CO2 mitigation potential among different study sites. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biomass; Carbon storage; Diversity indices; Shrub; Volume","basal area; carbon sequestration; ecological impact; ecosystem service; native species; population density; shrub; species diversity; volume; Chhattisgarh; India; Cestrum nocturnum; Lantana camara; Nerium oleander; carbon; biomass; chemistry; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; India; Lantana; Biomass; Carbon; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; India; Lantana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076901695

This study determines the farmers’ risk perception, risk attitude, adaptation measures and various aspects of vulnerability to climate change (e.g. floods, droughts, heavy rainfalls, pests and disease) at farm level in rural Pakistan. The risk perception and attitude of farm households are crucial factors that influence farm productivity, investment and management decisions at this level. A well-designed questionnaire was used to interview 720 farm households from six districts of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. A binary logit model was used to determine the main factors that affect the choice of adaptation strategies of the farm household. The findings revealed that crop diversification, changing crop varieties, altering the crop calendar, varying the fertilizer used, mulching and farm insurance were the main adaptation strategies followed by farm households. The results of the binary logit model revealed that age, education, farm size, household size, credit accessibility, annual income and the perception on the increase in temperature and decrease in rainfall had significant influence on the selection of the adaption strategies. The findings of this study can provide guidance, policy recommendations and reference for future researchers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation measures; Climate variability; Flood and drought risks; Risk attitude; Risk perception","climate change; drought; family farm; farmers attitude; flood; regression; risk perception; rural area; vulnerability; Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa; Pakistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075800837

We evaluated the small mammal assemblages in eight distinct vegetation types across an elevational gradient in southern California, the Deep Canyon Transect, to determine how assemblage composition changes across the gradient and to identify species with similar habitat associations. Livetrapping efforts (4,800 trap-nights) yielded 1,097 captures of 713 individuals, representing 14 heteromyid and cricetid species. Heteromyids dominated the six lower-elevation vegetation types (< 1,300 m a.s.l.), whereas cricetids dominated the upper end of the gradient. Richness and diversity exhibited bimodal responses to elevation, which do not conform to mid-domain effect null predictions. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that 75% of the variation in small mammal abundances was explainable by habitat characteristics, and cluster analysis grouped small mammals into three ecologically distinct groups based on their habitat associations. One contained only Chaetodipus penicillatus, while the others were comprised of low- and high-elevation species, respectively. The low-elevation species exhibit unusual levels of sympatry (and syntopy) among closely related species of pocket mice (Chaetodipus). Further efforts should investigate the mechanisms of coexistence for Chaetodipus species with nearly identical associations and seasonal effects on richness and diversity.

Although there is comprehensive knowledge about methanol metabolism, there are other mechanisms in P. pastoris that have not been investigated yet, such as ethanol metabolism.

However, nutrients are concurrently used by plants and microbes, and the dynamics of this interaction during ecosystem development have seldom been studied. The aim of our study, thus, was to describe the dynamics of nutrient availability in soil and, at the same time, the nutrient accumulation in plant and microbial biomass along an unassisted primary succession heading toward broadleaf forest. The growth of the understory plant Arrhenatherum elatius on soils originating from three (16, 22, and 45 years' old) successional stages of a post-mining area and the development of the microbial community in the presence or absence of this plant were studied in a pot experiment. Both, the plant biomass and carbon (C) in microbial biomass in intermediate and late middle successional stages were higher than those in the early stage. In soil, extractable organic C, extractable organic nitrogen (N), and inorganic N increased with proceeding succession, but Olsen phosphorus (P) peaked in the intermediate successional stage. The amounts of N and P in plant and microbial biomass increased during succession. In the late middle successional stage, the amount of P in microbial biomass exceeded that of plant bound P approximately twice, and this increase was higher in pots with plants than without. The results imply that the competition between plants and microbes for available P may increase microbial P uptake and, thus, hinder plant growth in later successional stages. © 2020 by the authors.","Forest restoration; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Plant-microbial interactions; Post-mining area","Bacteria; Biomass; Conservation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Restoration; Soils; Ecosystem development; Forest restoration; Microbial communities; Microbial interactions; Mining areas; Nutrient accumulation; Nutrient availability; Soil microbial community; Nutrients; biomass; broad-leaved forest; environmental restoration; forest soil; interspecific interaction; microbial community; nitrogen; nutrient availability; nutrient uptake; phosphorus; succession; understory; Bacteria; Biomass; Conservation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Nitrogen; Arrhenatherum elatius",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081129698

In particular, we aim to distribute the traffic flow more evenly through a city, by developing a flow algorithm that computes multiple solutions, each of which accommodates the maximum flow. The paper makes the following contributions to build such a transportation policy: (a) Develops a Pareto-optimal Max Flow Algorithm (PMFA) to suggest multiple max flow solutions.

Here, we evaluate the contribution of atmospheric aerosol loading from biomass burning and its relationship to the air pollution control policy. We focused on Shandong province, China because it has the highest level of agriculture burning pollution in October. Satellite-based data related to biomass burning including aerosol optical depth (AOD) and fire pixel counts from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), carbon monoxide (CO) from Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT), aerosol index (AI) and tropospheric NO2 from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and aerosol layer depths from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO). These metrics were synthetically utilized to evaluate spatial and temporal variation of atmospheric aerosols during the agriculture crop residue burning month from 2006 to 2017. Carbonaceous aerosol emission reduction and the impact of the air pollution control policy can be found in the CALIPSO aerosol types and MODIS fire pixel counts data. The AOD, NO2, CO, and AI over three different land covers (cropland, forest and impervious surfaces) were further obtained according to the land cover data set. The results indicated that there was an obvious decrease in all carbonaceous aerosol-related quantities after year 2012 when the local government began to enact and implement strict air pollution control policies, although a period (2–3 years) of transition after the policy implementation time was identified. We also found that CO is stable and low over the cropland versus forest and impervious surfaces; NO2 exhibits a continuously high value in the northern areas of the oil field. The impact of industry activity rather than straw burning should be also considered for NO2 and CO in certain areas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution control policy; Atmospheric aerosol; Biomass burning; Shandong province; Synthetic satellite data","Agricultural robots; Agricultural wastes; Air quality; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Biomass; Carbon monoxide; Crops; Deterioration; Emission control; Forestry; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Oil fields; Optical radar; Pixels; Radiometers; Satellites; Troposphere; Ultraviolet spectrometers; Biomass-burning; Cloud-aerosol lidar and infrared pathfinder satellite observations; Measurements of pollution in the tropospheres; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Ozone monitoring instruments; Satellite data; Shandong province; Spatial and temporal variation; Atmospheric aerosols; carbon; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; aerosol; air quality; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; CALIPSO; carbon monoxide; MODIS; nitrogen dioxide; optical depth; pollution control; pollution policy; satellite data; aerosol; agriculture; air monitoring; air pollution control; atmospheric deposition; biomass; China; combustion; environmental policy; fire; optical depth; plant residue; priority journal; radiometry; satellite imagery; spectroscopy; troposphere; China; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076527887

The sandstone reservoirs of the Permian Aldebaran Sandstone, Freitag Formation and Catherine Sandstone of the Northern Denison Trough (NDT) were evaluated for their CO2 storage potential as part of the Queensland Government's ZeroGen CO2 Capture and Storage Project, which found that diagenetic processes acting on the sandstones have resulted in poor permeability and reduced porosity, making them unsuitable for large scale injection and storage in this area. To better understand the factors acting to degrade these reservoirs, the purpose of the current study was to establish a thermal maturity framework for the Permian sandstone reservoirs of the Northern Denison Trough based on vitrinite reflectance measurements of coals and Rock-Eval analysis of coals and shales from the Aldebaran Sandstone through to the Catherine Sandstone. Mean maximum vitrinite reflectance of coals (Rmax) ranges from 0.55% to 0.93%, and estimated maximum burial temperatures calculated from vitrinite reflectance fall between 83 oC – 125 oC. Calculation of palaeotemperatures from vitrinite reflectance data has been hampered by inversions of depth-reflectance profiles at the top of the Aldebaran Sandstone and scatter in vitrinite reflectance data. This has been attributed to depositional effects (including the major marine flooding surfaces at the top of the Aldebaran Sandstone) that have affected vitrinite reflectance evolution in the NDT, producing low reflecting, fluorescing, perhydrous vitrinite near marine flooding surfaces, and subhydrous vitrinite when oxidising conditions prevailed. A vitrinite reflectance difference of up to 0.2% Rmax is detected in an isometamorphic coal, an equivalent palaeotemperature difference of approximately 19 oC. The abundance of perhydrous vitrinite has resulted in largely suppressed vitrinite reflectance throughout the examined Permian interval in the Northern Denison Trough, and the presence of both perhydrous and subhydrous vitrinite introduces an error in palaeotemperature calculation in high volatile bituminous coals. Rock-Eval analysis provides supporting and calibrating maturity data. Tmax over the studied interval ranges from 421 oC to 447 oC, generating a positive, broadly linear correlation between Rmax and Tmax that is applicable specifically to the NDT. Tmax suppression was also detected in perhydrous coals. Hydrogen index serves to evaluate the level of vitrinite reflectance suppression through an inverse relationship between the two parameters. The Rock-Eval data confirms the oil generation potential of coals in the NDT while shales associated with the same stratigraphic intervals have lower hydrocarbon generation potential. This study brings new insights into the thermal maturity framework in the NDT and highlights the importance of reliable vitrinite reflectance data for calculation of maximum burial temperatures, particularly in underexplored or frontier areas. © 2019","Bowen Basin; Depositional effects; Palaeotemperature; Perhydrous vitrinite; Tmax suppression; Vitrinite reflectance","Bituminous coal; Carbon dioxide; Deposition; Digital storage; Floods; Hydrocarbons; Nondestructive examination; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Sandstone; Stratigraphy; Bowen Basin; Depositional effects; Palaeotemperature; Tmax suppression; Vitrinite reflectance; Vitrinites; Reflection; coal; depositional environment; paleotemperature; Permian; sandstone; shale; thermal maturity; vitrinite reflectance; Australia; Bowen Basin; Denison Trough; Queensland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077078855

Previous studies have generated paleotemperature records based on the analysis of shell mounds along the coast of Tokyo Bay and pollen from terrestrial borehole cores. However, a continuous, high time-resolution, quantitative paleotemperature record does not exist. A piston core was recovered from Tokyo Bay from which 22 mollusk shells were extracted. An age model for the core, determined via accelerator mass spectroscopy (AMS) 14C dating of the shells and a scoria layer from the Hoei eruption (1707 CE), showed that the core contains continuous record from ca. 2400 BCE. We analyzed the alkenone unsaturation ratios (UK’ 37) to reconstruct the variations in the paleotemperature. The temperature during the Meghalayan was generally warmer than that at present exhibiting a declining trend, which roughly matches the changes in the orbital-forcing summer insolation and the millennial-scale latitudinal shift of the subarctic front in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The largest cold period, which occurred ca. 2300 BCE and had a minimum temperature of 19.5 °C, interrupted the warm conditions. This cold period may correspond to the global cooling/drying “4.2 ka BP event,” which marks the boundary between the Northgrippian and Meghalayan. Our results also revealed that several cold periods occurred, which may have been caused by decreases in solar activity or large volcanic eruptions. Particularly, large decadal to centennial-scale cold periods were observed ca. 440 BCE and 100 CE during the Yayoi era (ca. 900 BCE–300 CE). The coldest period after the establishment of a centralized system of government (ca. 300 CE–present) was recorded ca. 1050 CE, which may have been caused by the combination of a strong El-Niño mode and reduced solar activity. These climate change events can all be linked and, therefore, may be the potential causes of significant periods of famine and civil war in Japanese history, which eventually led to major shifts in Japanese social systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Alkenone biomarker; Meghalayan; Paleoclimatology; Tokyo Bay","Food supply; Mass spectrometry; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Volcanoes; Accelerator mass spectroscopy; Alkenones; High-time resolution; Meghalayan; Minimum temperatures; North-eastern Pacific; Paleoclimatology; Tokyo Bay; Climate change; alkenone; biomarker; paleoclimate; paleotemperature; Honshu; Japan; Kanto; Tokyo Bay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078504353

Fungi rely on soil carbon inputs and play an active role in carbon mobilization and stabilization. Future climate change scenarios predict increases in temperature and lower water tables, which may lead to functional shifts in fungal communities growing in peatlands. Despite their abundance, the impact of fungi on carbon cycling in peatlands is still poorly understood. Therefore, it is crucial to study the dynamics and distribution of fungal communities in pristine peatlands in order to predict the potential changes in peatland ecosystems more accurately. Here, we review the current knowledge about fungal communities in peatlands, including the influence of peatland type, abiotic factors, and temporal and spatial dynamics on fungal diversity. Our overview shows that fungal diversity in peatlands of certain regions such as tropical areas is severely understudied. Furthermore, we examine the ecological roles and the relative contribution to carbon cycling of functional guilds of fungi in peatlands, showing that saprotrophs are the key guild in organic matter decomposition, and ericoid- and ectomycorrhizal fungi have the ability to act as decomposers and vectors of plant carbon input to soil. We suggest that the application of a combination of methodological approaches for taxonomic and functional characterisation of peatland fungal communities is needed to build better understanding about the diversity-functioning relationships in peatland ecosystems. Overall, this review shows that fungi must be considered as important drivers of mechanistic processes underlying biodiversity, plant nutrient uptake and carbon losses in peatlands. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Abiotic factors; Climate change; Fungal guilds; Organic matter decomposition; Peatland type; Pristine peatlands",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074211541

High-voltage direct-current (HVDC) links and series-compensated ac lines are frontrunners in these developments. Although series capacitor installations can lead to subsynchronous resonance (SSR), HVDC links based on voltage source converters (VSCs) can be used to effectively damp SSR upon occurrence. An active damping technique to mitigate torsional interactions (TIs), a form of SSR, is presented. The damping scheme considers an active wideband filter to ensure positive damping in a wide range of subsynchronous frequencies. A state-space representation of the system has been formulated and eigenanalyses have been performed to assess the impact of the HVDC link on the TIs. A damping torque study for SSR screening is carried out, with results complemented with time-domain simulations to assess the accuracy of the small-signal models. The test system is implemented in a real-Time digital simulator and connected to a VSC-HVDC scaled-down test rig to validate the damping scheme through hardware-in-The-loop experiments.

However, the potential magnitude and stability of this carbon sink is poorly quantified as previous studies address a limited range of conditions and short durations. Furthermore, the suitability of carbonate-sequestering soils for construction has not been investigated. To address these issues we measured total inorganic carbon, permeability and ground strength in the top 20 cm of soil at 20 brownfield sites in northern England, between 2015 and 2017. Across all sites accumulation occurred at a rate of 1–16 t C ha−1 yr−1, as calcite (CaCO3), corresponding to removal of approximately 4–59 t CO2 ha−1 yr−1, with the highest rate in the first 15 years after demolition. C and O stable isotope analysis of calcite confirms the atmospheric origin of the measured inorganic carbon. Statistical modelling found that pH and the content of fine materials (combined silt and clay content) were the best predictors of the total inorganic carbon content of the samples. Measurement of permeability shows that sites with carbonated soils possess a similar risk of run-off or flooding to sandy soils. Soil strength, measured as in-situ bearing capacity, increased with carbonation. These results demonstrate that the management of urban brownfield land to retain fine material derived from concrete crushing on site following demolition will promote calcite precipitation in soils, and so offers an additional CO2 removal mechanism, with no detrimental effect on drainage and possible improvements in strength. Given the large area of brownfield land that is available for development, the contribution of this process to CO2 removal by urban soils needs to be recognised in CO2 mitigation policies. © 2019 The Authors","Carbon precipitation; CO2 removal; Permeability; Stable isotope; Strength; Urban brownfield land","Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Demolition; Isotopes; Mechanical permeability; Risk assessment; Soils; Brownfield land; Carbon precipitation; CO2 removal; Stable isotopes; Strength; Urban growth; carbon dioxide; brownfield site; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; permeability; precipitation (chemistry); soil carbon; stable isotope; agricultural land; Article; brownfield land; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; flooding; priority journal; sandy soil; soil pollution; urban area; England; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077309927

Isomer 9 also contains a ptC atom, which turned out to be a transition state at all levels. Though all isomers are polar (μ ≠ 0), rotational spectrum is available only for 4. Using matrix isolation, three isomers (1, 2, and 5) have been trapped in the laboratory at 10 K. Considering the astrochemical relevance of silicon-carbide clusters in the interstellar medium, the current theoretical data demand new molecular spectroscopic studies on SiC4H2. Surprisingly, unlike the isovalent C5H2 isomers, where the bent carbenes are yet to be identified in the laboratory, the bent silylidenes (2 and 5) have been trapped in the case of SiC4H2. In both the cases, molecules with transannular C-C and/or Si-C bonds remain elusive, though they lie in the low-lying region. Using suitable precursors, whether these peculiar geometries (especially 3 and 6) would be identified or not in the laboratory needs to be addressed by molecular spectroscopists.

In this paper, a two-dimensional numerical study is carried out to investigate the flow and mixing characteristics of CI-14/air in combustor with different injection structures. On this basis, the effect of CHair mixing on the critical ignition energy for forming detonation is theoretically analyzed in detail. The numerical results indicate that injection strategies of CH4 and air can obviously affect the flow filed characteristic, pressure loss, mixing uniformity and local equivalence ratio in combustor, which further affect the critical ignition energy for forming detonation. In the study for three different mass flow rates (the mass flow rates of air are 12.01 kg/s,8.58 kg/s and 1.72 kg/s, respectively), when air is radially injected into combustor (fuel/air are injected perpendicular to each other), although the mixing quality of CH4 and air is improved, the total pressure loss is also increased. In addition, the comparative analysis also shows that the increase of mass flow rate of CH4/air can decrease the difference of the critical ignition energy for forming detonation at a constant total equivalence ratio. The ignition energy decreases with the decrease of the total flow rate and then increases gradually. © 2020 by the authors.","Equivalence ratio; Flow filed characteristic; Mixing characteristic; Numerical simulation; Rotating detonation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081272512

In this paper, the extended linear expenditure system model and the CO2 emission accounting method were applied to measure the values of the poverty alleviation as well as CO2 emission reduction, and then decoupling analysis model was introduced to identify the relationship between CO2 emissions and poverty alleviation within Hubei Province, a poverty-stricken area in China. The results show that the poverty indices all remain small although poverty line within Hubei Province is much higher than two dollars per day. Maximum values for head count, poverty gap, and squared poverty gap indices are all lower than 0.25, 0.10, and 0.05 respectively, implying that there are good realistic bases for poverty alleviation. At the same time, CO2 emission and energy intensities within this region are characterized by inverted U-shaped curves and are currently in a declining phase, but CO2 emissions have significantly increased. Results derived from multi-period data analysis show that the decoupling relationship have switched from ‘expansive negative decoupling’ to ‘weak decoupling’, indicating that there is a decoupling relationship between CO2 emission reduction and poverty alleviation. The data and results can be used to provide further references for clarifying the relationship between the two and arranging the plan of policy implementation. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","CO2 emission reduction; Decoupling analysis; Poverty alleviation; Poverty-stricken area","Emission control; Accounting methods; CO2 emission reduction; Decoupling analysis; Energy intensity; Policy implementations; Poverty alleviation; Poverty-stricken area; System modeling; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; expenditure; policy implementation; poverty alleviation; China; Hubei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075765889

The quantitative information of reaction kinetics was also evaluated using canonical variational transition-state theory in the temperature range of 500-1800 K. The analysis of the associated adsorption energies indicates that the affinity of the carbon active site toward NO and CO is stronger than that at the Fe site, and the NO adsorption on the carbon site in the N-down mode is the most energetically favorable. Following the chemisorption step, the reactions proceed for N2O, N2, and CO2 desorption by different reduction mechanisms, depending on whether CO exists. The FeO group formed and transformed during the NO reduction is of significant importance for the whole catalytic process. The results show that the heterogeneous reduction of NO is promoted much more dramatically with the help of CO, which brings about a decrease in the activation energies accompanied by an increase in the reaction rate constants. The effectiveness of the Fe-adsorbed model derives from its prominent effect on NO-CO reaction and becomes more realistic than the original metal-free structure.

In this paper, two accelerated carbonation approaches, applied during granulation and post-curing respectively, are investigated for their influences on the properties of the aggregates made by 100 % basic oxygen furnace slag (BOFS). The result shows that carbonation during post-curing significantly enhances the overall properties of the granulated BOFS, such as increasing the strength by 220 %. In contrast, synchronized carbonation applied simultaneously during the granulation process yields considerable property degradation, though a CO2 uptake of ∼16 % can be achieved. It contradicts with the common understanding that carbonation is beneficial to the strength enhancement. This is because synchronized carbonation of BOFS is found to release extensive heat and vaporize a great amount of bridging water for agglomeration, thus causing a very loose structure. In general, synchronized and post-granulation carbonation result in two notably different influences on the properties of BOFS aggregates. The integrated approach of granulation and post-granulation carbonation creates a promising cement-free alternative to the local natural aggregates; while the synchronized carbonation shows significant potential for the production of lightweight aggregates. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.","Accelerated carbonation; Artificial aggregates; Granulation; Steel slag","Aggregates; Basic oxygen converters; Cements; Curing; Granulation; Slags; Steelmaking; Synchronization; Accelerated carbonation; Artificial aggregates; Basic oxygen furnace slag; Granulation process; Light weight aggregate; Property degradation; Steel slag; Strength enhancement; Carbonation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075749901

In this study, anticipated guilt is introduced into model of the Theory of Planned Behavior to compensate for neglect of emotional factors. Meanwhile, cultural values are taken as antecedent variables of the extended model to further explore the driving mechanism of residents’ intention of low carbon consuming behavior. By establishing structural equation model and using Mplus7.4 to analyze the data of 848 questionnaires from Jiangsu Province, it is found that: (1) when incorporated into the model of Theory of Planned Behavior, anticipated guilt has a positive and direct impact on intention of low carbon consuming behavior along with attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control; (2) attitude, perceived behavioral control and anticipated guilt play a positive and parallel multiple mediating role between collectivist value and intention of low carbon consuming behavior; (3) attitude and anticipated guilt play parallel multiple mediating role between man-to-nature orientation value and intention of low carbon consuming behavior. Among them, attitude plays a positive mediating role and anticipated guilt plays a negative mediating role.

However, potential climate change impact on GHG emissions from tile-drained fields is poorly documented. Accordingly, climate change impacts on GHG emissions, N losses to drainage and crop production in a subsurface-drained field in Southern Quebec, Canada were assessed using calibrated and validated RZWQM2 model. The RZWQM2 model was run for a historical period (1971–2000) and for a future period (2038 to 2070) using data generated from 11 different GCM-RCMs (global climate models coupled with regional climate models). Under the projected warmer and higher rainfall conditions mean drainage flow was predicted to increase by 17%, and the N losses through subsurface drains increase by 47%. Despite the negative effect of warming temperature on crop yield, soybean yield was predicted to increase by 31% due to increased photosynthesis rates and improved crop water use efficiency (WUE) under elevated [CO2]atm, while corn yield was reduced by 7% even with elevated [CO2]atm because of a shorter life cycle from seedling to maturity resulted from higher temperature. The N2O emissions would be enhanced by 21% due to greater denitrification and mineralization, while CO2 emissions would increase by 16% because of more crop biomass accumulation, higher crop residue decomposition, and greater soil microbial activities. Soil organic carbon storage was predicted to decrease 22% faster in the future, which would result in higher global warming potential in turn. This study demonstrates the potential of exacerbating GHG emissions and water quality problems and reduced corn yield under climate change impact in subsurface drained fields in southern Quebec. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural system models; CO2 emission; Denitrification; Mineralization,; N2O emission; Water quality","Agricultural wastes; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Cultivation; Denitrification; Digital storage; Drainage; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Mineralogy; Organic carbon; Productivity; Soil pollution; Water quality; Agricultural productivity; Agricultural system; Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration; CO2 emissions; Global warming potential; Mineralization; Soil microbial activities; Soil organic carbon storages; Climate models; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; crop production; denitrification; drainage; environmental assessment; greenhouse gas; mineralization; nitrogen; nitrogen dioxide; soybean; water quality; Article; bioaccumulation; Canada; carbon footprint; carbon mineralization; carbon storage; climate change; concentration (parameter); crop production; decomposition; denitrification; environmental impact assessment; environmental temperature; harvest; humidity; maize; nonhuman; photosynthesis; plant water use; priority journal; seedling; solar radiation; soybean; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076246144

An economic alternative with capacity of simultaneous mitigation of nitrate and heavy metals is urgently needed. This study explored the incorporation of iron scraps and biochar into constructed wetlands (CWs) for enhancing purification performance and investigated interactions of effective nitrate reduction and heavy metals mitigation. The results showed that nitrate reduction performance could reach 87% in iron and carbon-based (Fe–C) CWs through Fe–C micro-electrolysis process, with lower nitrous oxide (N2O) emission (4.6–11.75 μg m−2 h−1) due to the complete denitrification process. Moreover, efficient heavy metals mitigation of 75–97% total chromium (Cr) and total lead (Pb) was obtained from Fe–C systems. However, the occurrence of heavy metals (Cr and Pb) in the influent posed an adverse impact on nitrate removal with the reduction rate of 19–43%. Biochemical characteristics of wetland plants indicated that the plants also suffered from the stress which induced from heavy metals. Overall, although the addition of iron and biochar in CWs enhanced nitrate and heavy metals removal in low carbon groundwater, further investigation is still needed to reveal the complex relationships between the removal of nitrate and heavy metals in CWs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Constructed wetlands; Groundwater; Heavy metals; Iron-carbon micro-electrolysis; Nitrate removal","Electrolysis; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Heavy metals; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Potable water; Wetlands; Biochemical characteristics; Constructed wetlands; Constructed wetlands (CWs); Contaminated groundwater; Denitrification process; Drinking water sources; Iron carbon; Nitrate removal; Chemicals removal (water treatment); carbon; chromium; drinking water; ground water; heavy metal; iron; lead; nitrate; nitrogen; carbon; iron; biochar; chlorine nitrate; constructed wetland; denitrification; drinking water; electrokinesis; groundwater; groundwater pollution; heavy metal; nitrate; nitrous oxide; pollutant removal; Article; China; constructed wetland; gas; heavy metal removal; hydraulic retention time; microbial community; microcosm; plant; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); waste water management; water analysis; water contamination; water sampling; sewage; water pollutant; wetland; China; Carbon; China; Groundwater; Iron; Metals, Heavy; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074595376

Moreover, the outstanding electrochemical sensing behaviors of the Nafion/rGO/CSF-based OECT sensor are retainable under bent states and in artificial urine, which will greatly facilitate its application in flexible electronics. The abovemenitoned results indicate that OECT sensors with carbon-based gate electrodes can also obtain high sensitivity comparable to that of precious metal gate electrodes, which, therefore, provides an unprecedented strategy for manufacturing flexible OECT sensors with high performance and low cost. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbonized silk fabric; Dopamine sensor; Flexible sensor; Organic electrochemical transistor; Precious metal-free gate electrode","Amines; Flexible electronics; Graphene; Graphene transistors; Neurophysiology; Precious metals; Reduced Graphene Oxide; Refractory metal compounds; Silk; Detection capability; Electrochemical sensing; Flexible sensor; Gate electrodes; Hierarchical structures; Metal gate electrodes; Organic electrochemical transistors; Silk fabrics; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075793718

This empirical approach implicitly assumes that any spatial covariation of factors across the landscape would remain fixed in time, that is, the “covariance-stationarity” assumption. A better understanding of this assumption, in terms of what it means and how it affects predictions, is needed to assess the implications of STS predictions. To address this, we examined the influence of the covariance-stationarity assumption on STS predictions of long-term ET in response to warming. We did this by simulating changes in ET resulting from elevational transfers of factors in ways that emulate STS. This approach was applied to the upper San Joaquin River, a snow-influenced watershed in the Sierra Nevada, USA. Predicted increases in ET from STS including the covariance-stationarity assumption were 3–7 times greater than STS treating air temperature as an independent factor, over most of the higher elevations. Based on results from a factorial analysis, these differences were attributed primarily to the pedologic gradient across elevation, which transitions from loamy Alfisol soils at lower elevations to sandy Entisol/Inceptisol soils and exposed bedrock at upper elevations. The covariance-stationarity assumption does not seem realistic for soil and air temperature over timescales of projected climate. Therefore, the confounding of these factors in the STS approach can substantially overestimate the sensitivity of long-term ET to air temperature. © 2019. American Geophysical Union.

Most previous studies focused on optimization problems of infrastructure adaptation for climate change in a single urban district, but multiple key variables of an adaptation plan - investment target, amount, and timing - should be developed simultaneously for interconnected urban districts. Thus, there is a knowledge gap regarding optimization for infrastructure adaptation in interconnected urban districts. This study suggests a model for establishing an infrastructure adaptation plan in urban areas under various climate change scenarios using an optimization method. The proposed model derives the infrastructure investment plan, which includes the key decision variables of investment amount, location, and timing.

This study quantifies the climate change impacts of production, use, and disposal of NMC batteries and compares the impacts with provision of electricity from grids of six European countries to calculate their carbon handprints, a measure of positive climate impacts. The study also develops a general cycle life model for NMC batteries to show the impact of various stress factors on the lifetime of the battery, which was then used to show the impact of battery management on its climate change impacts due to varying energy throughput. Of the countries studied, the carbon handprint was the highest in Bulgaria at 13,450 kg CO2-eq. per energy throughput of the battery during its life cycle of 25.3 MWh. The lowest handprint achieved was in Finland at 2000 kg CO2-eq., while no handprint was achieved in Norway. Uncertainty in the data on Li-ion battery production and recycling was found to be of minor importance when the entire life cycle of the batteries was studied and compared with the baseline scenario. Operating temperature, cycle depth and average state of charge during cycling have significant impact on the lifetime of Li-ion batteries and hence on their carbon handprint. The longest lifetime with NMC batteries can be achieved by cycling the battery at low cycle depth at an average state of charge of around 50% and an operating temperature close to 25 °C. Operating the battery at 50% cycle depth instead of 90% cycle depth more than doubled the carbon handprint in all the counties studied except Norway. © 2019 The Authors","Carbon footprint; Carbon handprint; Climate change; Cycle life model; Degradation stress factors; Li-ion battery","Battery management systems; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Charging (batteries); Climate change; Climate models; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electronic Waste; Ions; Life cycle; Temperature; Climate change impact; Cycle lives; Electricity supply; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Operating temperature; Reference situation; Stationary energy storages; Stress factors; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074710274

Coastal spent fuel management facilities are vulnerable to unanticipated environmental events, as evidenced by the 2011 tsunami-related flooding at the Fukushima plant in Japan. We examine how policy-makers can manage climate risks posed to the coastal storage of radioactive materials, and identify the coastal spent fuel storage sites that will be most vulnerable to sea-level rise. A geospatial analysis of coastal sites shows that with six feet of sea-level rise, seven spent fuel sites will be juxtaposed by seawater. Of those, three will be near or completely surrounded by water, and should be considered a priority for mitigation: Humboldt Bay (California), Turkey Point (Florida), and Crystal River (Florida). To ensure policy-makers manage such climate risks, a risk management approach is proposed. Further, we recommend that policy-makers 1) transfer overdue spent fuel from cooling pools to dry casks, particularly where located in high risk sites; 2) develop a long-term and comprehensive storage plan that is less vulnerable to climate change; and 3) encourage international nuclear treaties and standards to take climate change into account. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Cooling pools; Independent spent fuel storage installations; Nuclear power; Sea-level rise; Spent fuel management","Decision making; Fuel storage; Fuels; Nuclear energy; Nuclear power plants; Radioactive materials; Radioactive waste storage; Risk management; Sea level; Spent fuels; Coastal sites; Cooling pools; Geo-spatial analysis; Independent spent fuel storage installations; Policy makers; Sea level rise; Spent fuel management; Spent nuclear fuels; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; nuclear power plant; policy making; radioactive pollution; sea level change; waste management; California; Crystal River; Florida [United States]; Humboldt Bay; Turkey Point; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076204170

However, because climate variability is manifesting with more extreme climate impacts, occurring with greater frequency and with more intensity, the necessity for adaptation to minimize risk is becoming more pronounced. Though this is true of coastal communities around the globe, it is an acutely important concern for coastal communities in high northern latitudes, where the impacts of climate change are occurring at a disproportionate rate. With Homer, Alaska, as a case study, and through the lens of evolutionary governance, this research investigates coastal stressors (eg. storm surges, bluff instability) and subsequent decision dynamics around local government policy and planning for climate adaptation. In particular, the paper explores the relationship between actors and institutions, the connection between power and knowledge, as well as the challenges of path and goal dependencies. Narratives from key informants associated with Homer's climate change agenda highlight that while some stakeholders are keen to mainstream adaptation thinking into long-term strategic planning, adaptation policy remains a low priority (with a focus instead on mitigation). Uptake is further hindered by a belief among key decision-makers that the threat of climate change is a concern for the future. This in turn has resulted in diminished internal capacity (eg. institutions, knowledge) to effectively prepare for climate variability in general. Drawing insights through evolutionary governance theory, this study may provide coastal community decision-makers with an appreciation of the value (and nuanced challenges) of embedding climate adaptation thinking into strategic community planning. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change policy; Climate resilience; Climate stressors; Key informants; Urban planning","adaptive management; climate change; decision making; governance approach; stakeholder; strategic approach; urban development; urban planning; Alaska; Homer; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060147370

The opportunity cost for the landowner may be minimized by shifting the primary management objective in RMZs from timber production to compensation for above-ground carbon. Our primary objective was to compare long-term net revenue generating potential of RMZs under three scenarios: (I) compensation for carbon credits without harvesting; (II) partial harvesting using Best Management Practices (BMP) guidelines without carbon credits; (III) partial harvesting combined with carbon credits as per the California Compliance Offset Protocol. Basic stand data on trees of 2.5 cm and higher were collected in riparian forest plots along headwater streams within two experimental forests in the northeast US. The USFS Forest Vegetation Simulator was used to simulate growth and yield and schedule management activities over 20-year cutting cycles. Timber volumes and registry offset credits along with their market values were calculated for the respective scenarios and a Net Present Value (NPV) and Equal Annual Equivalent (EAE) analysis was performed under assumptions of constant prices and costs. The initial aboveground carbon stocks at both locations were 32% and 140% higher than the average value for their assessment areas. Having above-average carbon stocks and basal areas between 30 and 33 m2/ha, all scenarios returned positive NPVs and EAEs. The hardwood riparian forest had a higher NPV and EAE by not participating in the carbon markets and pursuing partial harvesting as per BMP guidelines (Scenario II) at lower discount rates but had higher NPVs and EAEs under carbon markets at higher discount rates (Scenario I and III). The conifer/mixed species riparian forest provided greater positive net revenue flows by participating in the carbon markets either in a no harvesting scenario or under partial harvesting as per guidelines in the Protocol (Scenarios I and III). Our results indicate that a protocol for compensating landowners with large forest holdings for riparian carbon offsets provides an opportunity to generate positive net revenues in scenarios in which state BMP guidelines may restrict harvesting in RMZs. Given the high density of ecologically critical headwater streams in the Northeast and potential RMZ restrictions, the carbon offset option provides landowners with the opportunity to remain economically viable. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","California Compliance Offset Protocol; Forest carbon offsets; Forest management; Headwater streams; Riparian management zones","Carbon; Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Hardwoods; Harvesting; Rivers; Timber; Above-ground carbons; Best management practices; California; Forest carbons; Forest vegetation simulator; Headwater stream; Management objectives; Riparian management zones; Forestry; Carbon; Commerce; Costs; Hardwoods; Harvesting; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077491373

In this article, we develop an optimization model for the integrated generation and transmission system in the continental U.S. and use it to explore electricity infrastructure pathways from the present through 2050. By comparing and contrasting results from numerous scenarios and sensitivity settings, we ultimately affirm five key policy-relevant insights. (1) U.S. electricity can be substantially decarbonized at modest cost, but complete decarbonization is very costly. (2) Significant expansion of solar PV and wind to combine for at least 40% of the generation mix by 2050 is fairly certain, although solar PV and battery storage are more affected by economic and policy assumptions than wind. (3) Investments in long-distance transmission are very limited, while investments in battery storage are much greater, under a wide range of assumptions. (4) Optimal solutions include large investments in natural gas capacity, but gas capacity utilization rates decline steadily and significantly. (5) Cost structures shift away from operating expenditures and toward capital expenditures, especially under climate policy.

Here, we used phytoplankton, which are a classic model for evaluating interactions between species, grown with and without associated bacteria to test whether the bacteria alter the strength and type of species interactions within a trophic level. We demonstrate that host-associated bacteria alter host growth rates and carrying capacity. This did not change the type but frequently changed the strength of host interspecific interactions by facilitating host growth in the presence of an established species. These findings indicate that microbiomes can regulate their host species’ interspecific interactions. As between-species interaction strength impacts their ability to coexist, our findings show that microbiomes have the potential to modulate eukaryotic species diversity and community composition. IMPORTANCE Description of the Earth’s microbiota has recently undergone a phenomenal expansion that has challenged basic assumptions in many areas of biology, including hominid evolution, human gastrointestinal and neurodevelopmental disorders, and plant adaptation to climate change. By using the classic model system of freshwater phytoplankton that has been drawn upon for numerous foundational theories in ecology, we show that microbiomes, by facilitating their host population, can also influence between-species interactions among their eukaryotic hosts. Between-species interactions, including competition for resources, has been a central tenet in the field of ecology because of its implications for the diversity and composition of communities and how this in turn shapes ecosystem functioning. © 2020 Jackrel et al.","Biodiversity; Eukaryotic species interactions; Microbiome; Species coexistence","algal growth; analysis of variance; Article; cell selection; chloroplast; Coelastrum microporum; controlled study; denaturation; genotype; microbial community; microbiome; microscopy; Monoraphidium minutum; nonhuman; organismal interaction; phytoplankton; polymerase chain reaction; population density; population growth; priority journal; Scenedesmus acuminatus; Selenastrum capricornutum; species diversity; Sphaeropleales; staining; biodiversity; host pathogen interaction; host range; microflora; organismal interaction; Biodiversity; Host Specificity; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Microbial Interactions; Microbiota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078236016

In accordance with the Paris Agreement of November 2015, wherein participating nations agreed to restrict the increase in global temperature below 2 °C, Japan has formulated guidelines on creating adaptation plans that can be implemented by local governments. A Climate Change Adaptive Information Platform was also launched to promote understanding and cooperation by sharing information on climate risks. However, the literature on this topic lacks information related to the organization of requirements and challenges faced by municipal administrative officials that formulate adaptation plans. To address these issues, we examined the four municipal forums hosted at Hosei University to encourage administrative needs for new technological ideas in areas such as climate modeling and impact assessment. We used text mining on the transcripts of the various workshops conducted in these forums and attempted to understand the changes in discussions and to extract issues related to the formulation process. The results showed that various topics, such as creating adaptation promotion systems, assessing the impacts of climate change, formulating adaptation plans, communicating with related organizations and stakeholders, developing human resources, and capacity building, were discussed, and a need for information, procedures, and assistance was identified for the formulation of feasible adaptation plans. This study is expected to provide a useful reference to stakeholders involved in framing adaptation plans to mitigate the effects of climate changes, particularly at the municipal level. © 2020 by the authors.

While the bacteria can be isolated from both clinical and environmental sources during epidemics, it evades isolation by conventional culture techniques during the period between successive epidemics. The problem is identifying the location and mode of survival and multiplication of V. cholerae during this inter-epidemic period. This information is crucial not only for epidemiological reasons, but also because the seasonality of cholera epidemics is plausibly mediated by the climate-regulated activity of the reservoir. This article focuses on the epidemiological importance of the environmental reservoir of V. cholerae, considering several investigations made on different types of aquatic fauna (zooplanktons, crustaceans, etc.) and flora (macrophytes and microphytes). After evaluating different lines of evidence, we make the case that certain species of cyanobacteria (Anabaena variabilis, Microcystis aeruginosa) can act as inter-epidemic reservoirs of V. cholerae. Physiological and functional aspects of this association are also discussed. We then present a hypothesis, expanding upon a previously published conceptual model, of how the climate-regulated seasonality of cholera epidemics is mediated by the effect of climatic factors on algal bloom and other local abiotic variables in the water, using Bangladesh as a model. Finally, another aspect of the climate-dependence of disease patterns is briefly explored: large-scale environmental signatures associated with cholera, and recent modelling efforts to predict cholera outbreaks based on coastal phytoplankton. The review, therefore, serves not only as a study of the identity of the inter-epidemic reservoir of V. cholerae, but also explores different ways in which the reservoir and the pathogen behaviour is affected by the climate, and the possible consequences it may have on disease pattern. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cholera; Cholera seasonality; Climate variability; Cyanobacteria; Environmental reservoir; Vibrio cholerae","algal bloom; aquatic environment; aquatic flora; bacterial strain; bacterial survival; bacterial transmission; climate change; cyanobacterium; disease course; environmental factor; environmental sanitation; epidemic; green alga; human; macrophyte; nonhuman; physiological process; priority journal; Review; seasonal variation; Vibrio cholerae; Bangladesh; cholera; climate; disease carrier; epidemic; eutrophication; microbiology; phytoplankton; season; Bangladesh; Cholera; Climate; Disease Reservoirs; Epidemics; Eutrophication; Humans; Phytoplankton; Seasons; Vibrio cholerae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068410645

Trees can affect the concentration of air pollutants that we breathe in by directly removing pollutants or avoiding emissions and secondary pollutant formation in the atmosphere. In addition, trees have other benefits including increasing property value, intercepting storm water runoff, and saving energy needed for cooling of buildings in hot seasons. In this work, we estimate economic and environmental benefits of three tree species typical for desert regions such as Acacia tortilis, Ziziphus spina-christi, and Phoenix dactylifera. The benefits varied by species with Acacia tortilis having the highest overall benefits, mostly because of its large leaf surface area and canopy shape. Tree benefits from carbon reduction reached up to US $14 billion annually. Mature trees tended to be more beneficial than smaller trees for improving environmental conditions. The location of trees had minimal impact on the overall economic value. This assessment provides urban planners, foresters, and developers in desert regions with the information needed to make informed decisions on the economic and environmental benefits of urban tree planting. © Copyright © 2020 Isaifan and Baldauf.","air quality; economic assessment; gaseous pollutants; particulate matter; urban planning; urban trees",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090081879

Here we report on the incoherent emission of XUV radiation in the region of 6 nm from boron plasma. The optimization of target ablation allowed the generation of XUV emission mainly originated from a single B IV transition (λ = 6.03 nm). We also demonstrate the generation of the 806 nm radiation harmonics up to the 55th order (λ = 14.6 nm) and of tunable near infrared radiation (1280–1400 nm) up to the 35th order (λ=38 nm), during the propagation of femtosecond pulses through boron plasma. The incoherent and coherent emissions from this target were compared and analyzed considering the influence of ionic transitions on the B IV emission and harmonic efficiency. We present different schemes of laser-plasma interaction (two-color pump of B plasma, generation of tunable harmonics in XUV range, formation of structured extended plasma, ablation of boron nanoparticles, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, overheating of boron targets, quasi-phase matching of plasma harmonics, etc.) during the ablation of boron-containing targets.

In order to investigate the emission mechanism, a specific model was developed. The theoretical model proposes to consider three different contributions to the emission of organic compounds from aerated wastewater tanks: the convection due to the sweep air flow rate, the rising bubbles stripping and the aerosol formation and successive evaporation. To compare the modeled results, an experimental campaign was conducted with two different solutes, acetone and butanol. The sampling was carried out with a Wind Tunnel system and the outflow gas samples were analysed with gas chromatographic technique. Moreover, this study investigates the dependence of the concentration in the gaseous phase from the speed of the air on the surface (1–5 cm/s) and from the flow of air diffused inside the liquid body (50–200 L/h).

In the treatment, heavy ions up to neon ions will be used as a primary beam, which is a high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation. The fractionated dose of the treatment will be 10 Gy or more. The microdosimetric kinetic (MK) model overestimates the biological effectiveness of high-LET and high-dose radiations. To address this issue, the stochastic microdosimetric kinetic (SMK) model has been developed as an extension of the MK model. By taking the stochastic nature of domain-specific and cell nucleus-specific energies into account, the SMK model could estimate the biological effectiveness of radiations with wide LET and dose ranges. Previously, the accuracy of the SMK model was examined by comparison of estimated and reported survival fractions of human cells exposed to pristine helium-, carbon-, and neon-ion beams. In this study, we verified the SMK model in treatment planning of scanned helium-, carbon-, oxygen-, and neon-ion beams as well as their combinations through the irradiations of human undifferentiated carcinoma and human pancreatic cancer cells. Treatment plans were made with the ion-species beams to achieve a uniform 10% survival of the cells within a cuboid target. The planned survival fractions were reasonably reproduced by the measured survival fractions in the whole region from the plateau to the fragment tail for all planned irradiations. The SMK model offers the accuracy and simplicity required in hypo-fractionated multi-ion therapy treatment planning. © 2020 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","biological model; charged-particle therapy; multi-ion therapy; relative biological effectiveness","Carbon; Cells; Cytology; Energy transfer; Heavy ions; Helium; Ion beams; Irradiation; Kinetics; Neon; Oxygen; Stochastic systems; Biological effectiveness; Biological modeling; Experimental validations; High linear energy transfers; Ion therapy; National Institute of Radiological Sciences; Relative biological effectiveness; Undifferentiated carcinomas; Stochastic models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079341902

However, the magnitude of these modifications, whether as a direct effect of climate conditions or an indirect effect through changes in soil mineralogy, are still not fully understood. In this study, we aimed to improve understanding of how climate and resultant changes in soil mineralogy affect subsoil (i.e., 0.4–0.9 m) organo-mineral interactions at the macro- and microscale. A set of subsoil samples were collected throughout an elevation gradient (approximately 1800–2400 mm precipitation year−1 and 15–24 °C) on Kohala Mountain, Hawaii. We carried out a combined approach of bulk soil analyses with mineral extractions and spectroscopic and spectromicroscopic analyses. Significant positive correlations (p &lt; 0.05) between soil organic carbon (SOC) with extracted Fe and Al (dithionite citrate bicarbonate – DCB and ammonium oxalate – OX) at the bulk soil scale supported prior research showing concurrent decline of subsoil Fe, Al and SOC above a precipitation level of ∼2000 to ∼2200 mm year−1. However, divergence in microscale organo-mineral associations identified using NanoSIMS allowed us to discern the relative roles of Fe and Al in promoting organo-mineral associations. At the lower precipitation range (∼1800 mm year−1), the clay fraction &lt; 2 µm showed higher amounts of organic matter (OM) co-localized with Fe &amp; Al compared with the higher precipitation level (∼2300 mm year−1), where OM was mostly unassociated or only associated with Al. While Fe contributed to approximately 40% of the microscale organo-mineral associations in the lower precipitation site (quantified by co-localizations with OM segments), this contribution at the higher rainfall regime was only 5%. In contrast, the contribution of Al was approximately the same in both rainfall levels (approximately 30%). Therefore, associations with Al may be more important than Fe for OM stabilization under reducing climate conditions. The normalized CN:C ratio based on individual pixels was found to be higher when co-localized with Al, Fe, or both, especially under the high precipitation regime. This fact points towards the importance of Fe and Al to stabilize more N-rich OM, especially at high rainfall levels. In addition, subsoil from higher rainfall conditions exhibited more reduced forms of Fe (assessed by Fe K-edge XANES) and lower proportions of carboxyl-C (5% lower in the relative abundance) as well as higher alkyl/O-alkyl ratios determined by CP-MAS 13C NMR. Such differences in composition may directly influence the organo-mineral associations at both locations, as differences in Fe reduction and the presence of carboxyl-C groups are recognized to play a role in OM stabilization. We conclude that spatial relationships between Fe and Al with SOC at the microscale show a shift towards Al-dominated SOC associations at higher precipitation that could not be ascertained from bulk measurements alone. Therefore, they are of fundamental importance to understand the impact of climate change on SOC stabilization. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Al; Andosols; Fe; Organo-mineral interactions; Short-range order minerals","aluminum; Andosol; climate conditions; iron; mineralogy; precipitation (climatology); soil organic matter; subsoil; Hawaii [(ISL) Hawaiian Islands]; Hawaii [United States]; Hawaiian Islands; Kohala",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076481836

It has been suggested that less intensive agricultural practices, such as conservation tillage (including no-till and reduced till without soil inversion) may reduce both erosion and loss of SOC. The aim of this study was to determine whether, and why, conservation tillage is used in Scania, which is one of the most agro-intensive regions in Sweden. We also investigated how information on tillage practices is obtained, why one type of tillage may be favored over another, and whether some farmers are more likely to use conservation tillage. The result of this study will benefit policy makers and researchers by pinpointing factors that influence the use of conservation tillage. To collect data, a questionnaire was sent to farmers in Scania in 2016. We found that the majority of the responding farmers used conservation tillage, and that it was more likely to be used if the farmer was highly educated and spent more than 50% of their annual working time on crop production. The use of conservation tillage was also more common if the farm was large and clay soil dominated. Crop rotation was often highlighted as the most important factor influencing the choice of tillage practice, which may be due to crop species requirements. When asked to compare the consequences of reduced tillage and plowing, the perception of farmers using conservation tillage was in general more positive, indicating skepticism toward the practice of reduced tillage until it had been tried. We show that the use of conservation tillage, sometimes in combination with plowing, is widespread in Scania. However, unless changes in, for example, crop rotation and labor requirements occur, the use of conservation tillage will most likely remain the same as today, or only increase slightly in the near future. Farm enlargement may result in an increased conservation tillage use, and so may efforts to educate advisors, increased opportunities for peer-to-peer meetings, and the development of economically viable small farm solutions. Increased conservation tillage may be part of the solution for sustainable crop production, but drawbacks such as increased pesticide use must be addressed further, as well as factors such as crop rotation development and practical knowledge that influence conservation tillage use at the farm level.

Hourly concentrations of PM2.5 were obtained from the Taiwan Air Quality Monitoring Network. According to geographical and climatic characteristics, the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration has divided Taiwan into seven air quality regions (AQRs): the North (four districts), Chu-Miao (two districts), Central (three districts), Yun-Chia-Nan (three districts), Kao-Ping (two districts), Yilan (one district), and Hua-Tung (two districts) regions. Demographic information and mortality data were acquired from the Department of Household Registration and National Death Registry of Taiwan, respectively. The World Health Organization’s (WHO) AirQ+ software was used to estimate the mortality attributable to exposure to PM2.5 for specific causes of deaths, specifically from ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease (stroke), lung cancer (LC), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The results indicated that nationally, the annual mean concentration of PM2.5 decreased from 2008 (30.75 μg m−3) to 2015 (20.07 μg m−3). Moreover, the population-attributable fraction (PAF) of cause-specific mortality due to PM2.5 exposure for IHD, stroke, LC, and COPD decreased from 21.72%, 30.31%, 15.97%, and 13.04%, respectively, in 2008 to 17.40%, 18.18%, 10.77%, and 9.09%, respectively, in 2015. Geographic variation was observed in the PM2.5 concentration and PAF. High PM2.5 levels and PAF of mortality due to PM2.5 were observed in southwestern and central Taiwan. Moreover, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (IHD and stroke) accounted for the majority of the premature deaths related to PM2.5. Stroke was the largest contributor in PM2.5-related premature mortality; however, IHD instead of stroke became the largest contributor in the Yilan AQR in 2010, 2012, and 2014–2015 and in the Hua-Tung AQR in 2012–2015 with relatively low PM2.5 levels (less than 19 μg m−3). In Taiwan, ambient PM2.5 contributed substantially to the burden of disease.

Material combustion from vehicles, manufacturing plants, fossil fuel consumption, and many other industrial activities are the primary sources of atmospheric pollution. These noxious implications cause thousands of premature deaths, million years of life lost, and a contributor to climate change, primarily in developing countries. Therefore, pollution forecast and simulation before happening are the main focus of this paper. It helps address pollution levels, infrastructure installation of cities and underpins a range of environmental policies. Awareness of the characteristics of the atmospheric quality, including the mathematical basis for assessing pollution, allows building the pollution assessment models required to understand air quality and controls. In this paper, an effective model for simulating and analyzing atmospheric quality using cellular automata is proposed. Our model employs three novel underlying rules, e.g. rules of gravity, diffusion, and wind.

However, knowledge of the rate of organic carbon deposition and burial in estuarine sediments is lacking at regional scales. Data on surficial total organic carbon, linear sedimentation, and bulk density of estuarine sediments were compiled and categorized via a cluster analysis in order to estimate carbon deposition within the contiguous United States (CONUS). The cluster analysis broadly grouped estuaries by geography, but exceptions to geographic clustering highlighted differences within regions. A transfer function from deposition to burial based on linear sedimentation rate was used to estimate burial efficiency, and thus the rate of carbon burial within each cluster. We estimate organic carbon deposition rates within CONUS estuarine sediments to be 161 [121–217, 95% confidence] g C/m2/yr with a burial efficiency estimated at 38 [34–42, 95% confidence] %, which yields a long-term burial rate of 64 [44–97, 95% confidence] g C/m2/yr. Spatially integrated organic deposition and burial rates are 11.3 [8.5–15.2, 95% confidence] and 4.5 [3.1–6.8, 95% confidence] Tg C/yr, respectively. Our findings allow a more thorough understanding of coastal carbon cycling, which is critical for both management purposes as well as for the assessment of the role of estuaries in past and future climate change. ©2020.

We refer to the forcing that acts on the meteorological variables over urbanized areas as the urban canopy meteorological forcing (UCMF). UCMF has multiple aspects, while one of the most studied is the generation of the urban heat island (UHI) as an excess of heat due to increased absorption and trapping of radiation in street canyons. However, enhanced drag plays important role too, reducing mean wind speeds and increasing vertical eddy mixing of pollutants. As air quality is strongly tied to meteorological conditions, the UCMF leads to modifications of air chemistry and transport of pollutants. Although it has been recognized in the last decade that the enhanced vertical mixing has a dominant role in the impact of the UCMF on air quality, very little is known about the uncertainty of vertical eddy diffusion arising from different representation in numerical models and how this uncertainty propagates to the final species concentrations as well as to the changes due to the UCMF. To bridge this knowledge gap, we set up the Regional Climate Model version 4 (RegCM4) coupled to the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) chemistry transport model over central Europe and designed a series of simulations to study how UC affects the vertical turbulent transport of selected pollutants through modifications of the vertical eddy diffusion coefficient (Kv) using six different methods for Kv calculation. The mean concentrations of ozone and PM2.5 in selected city canopies are analyzed. These are secondary pollutants or having secondary components, upon which turbulence acts in a much more complicated way than in the case of primary pollutants by influencing their concentrations not only directly but indirectly via precursors too. Calculations are performed over cascading domains (of 27, 9, and 3km horizontal resolutions), which further enables to analyze the sensitivity of the numerical model to grid resolution. A number of model simulations are carried out where either urban canopies are considered or replaced by rural ones in order to isolate the UC meteorological forcing. Apart from the well-pronounced and expected impact on temperature (increases up to 2°C) and wind (decreases by up to 2ms-1), there is a strong impact on vertical eddy diffusion in all of the six Kv methods. The Kv enhancement ranges from less than 1 up to 3m2 s-1 at the surface and from 1 to 10m2 s-1 at higher levels depending on the methods. The largest impact is obtained for the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE)-based methods. The range of impact on the vertical eddy diffusion coefficient propagates to a range of ozone (O3) increase of 0.4 to 4ppbv in both summer and winter (5%-1% relative change). In the case of PM2.5, we obtained decreases of up to 1μg m-3 in summer and up to 2μg m-3 in winter (up to 3%-4% relative change). Comparing these results to the ""total-impact"", i.e., to the impact of all meteorological modifications due to UCMF, we can conclude that much of UCMF is explained by the enhanced vertical eddy diffusion, which counterbalances the opposing effects of other components of this forcing (temperature, humidity and wind). The results further show that this conclusion holds regardless of the resolution chosen and in both the warm and cold parts of the year. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Yet, there is limited knowledge about the preparedness and capacities of health institutions and professionals in developing countries to respond to climate change health risks. Drawing from the World Health Organization’s framework on health system capacities, effective response and emergency preparedness, and using mixed methods research design, we examined capacities and preparedness of public health professionals in Ghana to manage climate change-health risks and emergencies. Qualitative interviews (n = 20) and quantitative surveys (n = 99) were conducted with health professionals in Savelugu-Nanton and Ada East Districts in Ghana. The study found that, capacity and preparedness of health professionals and institutions to respond to climate change related health emergencies were weak in the study districts.

It offers insights into major air pollution problems, reveals the main hot spots and problematic regions and indicates the principal air pollutants in the CR. Air pollution is not presented as a stand-alone problem, but in the wider context of air pollution impacts both on human health and the environment in the CR. The review is arranged into three main parts: (1) the time period until the Velvet Revolution of 1989, (2) the transition period of the 1990s and (3) the modern period after 2000. Obviously, a major improvement in ambient air quality has been achieved since the 1970s and 1980s, when air pollution in the former Czechoslovakia culminated. Nevertheless, new challenges including fine aerosol, benzo[a]pyrene and ground-level ozone, of which the limit values are still vastly exceeded, have emerged. Furthermore, in spite of a significant reduction in overall emissions, the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen, in particular, remains high in some regions. © 2020 by the authors.","1950-2018; Aerosol; Air pollution; Air quality; Atmospheric deposition; Czechoslovakia; Emissions; Environmental issues; Ground-level ozone; Health outcomes","Aerosols; Air pollution; Atmospheric chemistry; Deposition; Meteorological problems; Ozone; Particulate emissions; 1950-2018; Atmospheric depositions; Czechoslovakia; Environmental issues; Ground-level ozone; Health outcomes; Air quality; aerosol formation; air quality; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; environmental issue; ozone; pollution monitoring; Czech Republic",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081167662

Volumetric concentrations of both TSP and HgTSP during the APEC summit were a factor of 2 lower than during the pre-APEC period, indicating substantial reductions in total particulate matter and HgTSP as a result of emissions controls. However, mass-normalized concentrations and mercury isotope ratios of HgTSP did not vary significantly between samples collected before, during, or after the APEC summit.

Climate change and cropping patterns can affect herbivorous pest insect dynamics. Understanding the reasons for population fluctuations can help improve integrated pest management strategies. Here, a 25-year dataset on climate, cropping planting structure, and the population dynamics of cotton bollworms (Helicoverpa armigera) from Bachu County, south Xinjiang, China, was analyzed to assess the effects of changes in climate and crop planting structure on the population dynamics of H. armigera. The three generations of H. armigera showed increasing trends in population size with climate warming, especially in the third generation. The relative abundances of the first and second generations decreased, but that of the third generation increased. Rising temperature and precipitation produced different impacts on the development of different generations. The population numbers of H. armigera increased with the increase in the non-Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton-planted area. Asynchrony of abrupt changes existed among climate change, crop flowering dates, and the phenology of H. armigera moths. The asynchronous responses in crop flowering dates and phenology of H. armigera to climate warming would expand in the future. The primary factors affecting the first, second, and third generations of moths were Tmean in June, the last appearance date of the second generation of moths, and the duration of the third generation of moths, respectively. To reduce the harm to crops caused by H. armigera, Bt cotton should be widely planted. © 2020 The Authors.

The results showed similar average soil respiration rates between calcareous soil and red soil, with an average CO2 emission flux of 1305 and 1167 t C km−2 a−1, respectively. Carbonate tablet dissolution rates were bidirectional with increasing depth and were greater in red soil than calcareous soil, averaging 13.88 ± 5.42 and 7.20 ± 2.11 mg cm−2 a−1, respectively. CO2 concentration was bidirectional with increasing soil depth, reaching a maximum at the base of the soil–atmosphere interface (50–60 cm), and the bidirectional gradient was more distinctive in red soil. Change in the carbon isotope value of soil CO2 was also bidirectional in calcareous soils, for which the overall average was 0.87% heavier in calcareous than red soil. The carbon sink in calcareous soil in karst regions was estimated to be 11.97 times that of red soil in non-karst regions, whereas its role as a carbon source is just 1.12 times that of red soil, thus indicating the key role of karst soil in the reduction of atmospheric CO2 . © 2020 by the authors.

Due to the influence of global climate change and intense human activities, the stability and sustainability of the ecosystems associated with the alpine marsh wetlands are facing enormous threats. It is important to establish a precise risk assessment method to evaluate the risks to alpine wetlands ecosystems, and then to understand the influencing factors of ecological risk. However, the multi-index evaluation method of ecological risk in the Zoige region is overly focused on marsh wetlands, and the smallest units of assessment are relatively large. Although recently developed landscape ecological risk assessment (ERA) methods can address the above limitations, the final directionality of the evaluation results is not clear. In this work, we used the landscape ERA method based on land use and land cover changes (LUCC) to evaluate the ecological risks to an alpine wetland ecosystem from a spatial pixel scale (5 km x 5 km). Furthermore, the boosted regression tree (BRT) model was adopted to quantitatively analyze the impact factors of ecological risk. The results show the following: (1) From 1990 to 2016, the land use and land cover (LULC) types in the study area changed markedly. In particular, the deep marshes and aeolian sediments, and whereas construction land areas changed dramatically, the alpine grassland changed relatively slowly. (2) The ecological risk in the study area increased and was dominated by regions with higher and moderate risk levels. Meanwhile, these areas showed notable spatio-temporal changes, significant spatial correlation, and a high degree of spatial aggregation. (3) The topographic distribution, climate changes and human activities influenced the stability of the study area. Elevation (23.4%) was the most important factor for ecological risk, followed by temperature (16.2%). Precipitation and GDP were also seen to be adverse factors affecting ecological risk, at levels of 13.0% and 12.1%, respectively. The aim of this study was to provide more precise and specific support for defining conservation objectives, and ecological management in alpine wetland ecosystems. © 2020 by the author.","Alpine wetland ecosystem; Boosted regression tree; Ecological risk assessment; Land use and land cover changes; Zoige Plateau","Climate change; Ecosystems; Forestry; Land use; Regression analysis; Wetlands; Alpine wetland; Boosted regression trees; Ecological risk assessment; Land use and land cover change; Zoige Plateau; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080865632

Based on the SO2 ETS of China in 2007, this paper attempts to test and verify impacts of the scheme on environment and economy, especially on green total factor productivity (TFP). We firstly combine biennial weight-modified non-radial direction distance function and Luenberger productivity indicator to measure and decompose the green TFP of 280 cities in China over the period 2003 to 2016, and apply a difference-in-differences method (DID) with fixed effect models to investigate whether SO2 ETS achieves a win–win scenario of “emission reducing” and “efficiency increasing.” The results show that the scheme significantly may decrease SO2 emissions and SO2 intensity by 12.3% and 11.0%, respectively, in ETS regions while no obvious impact on GDP. In terms of green TFP, we find SO2 ETS inhibits the growth of green TFP, and the negative impact mainly caused by the deterioration in efficiency change. Therefore, we hold that SO2 ETS is effective for improving environment, but it is still difficult to achieve the promotion of green TFP simultaneously. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biennial weight-modified non-radial directional distance function; Difference-in-differences; Green total factor productivity; SO2 emissions trading scheme","emissions trading; empirical analysis; environmental economics; green economy; numerical method; sulfur dioxide; total factor productivity; China; sulfur dioxide; agriculture; air pollution; China; city; economics; productivity; Agriculture; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Efficiency; Sulfur Dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077166027

Its structural and functional features were investigated and compared with Wild type (WT) protein using a combination of theoretical and experimental procedures. The tertiary structures of WT and mutant photoproteins were made with MODELLER program, and were used for designing of mutation as well as explaining the results of experimental measurements. Activity measurements showed that the initial intensity of light emission is reduced, but decay time is not changed upon mutation. K89A mutant exhibited more sensitivity to calcium ion than WT protein did. As compared to the pH 9 of WT, the optimum pH for the mutant increased to 9.25. According to the circular dichroism measurements at far UV region, the total amount of helical structure is not changed upon mutation; however, the helicity of chromophores is reduced in K89A mutant, demonstrating that the secondary structural elements in WT protein are more rigid. Heat-induced denaturation data showed that the stability of the WT is greater than mutant photoprotein by 2 kcal/mol. It appears that the higher value of the dipole momentum at the axis of fourth helix in WT photoprotein leads to strengthening of intra-molecular “head-to-tail” versus “side-by-side” anti-parallel interaction between the third and fourth helices. It was concluded that dipole-dipole interaction between the helices are important factors in packaging of the substrate in the core structure of the photoprotein. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bioluminescence; Coelenterazin; Photoprotein; Site-directed mutagenesis; Thermal denaturation","Bioluminescence; Chromophores; Dichroism; Circular dichroism measurements; Coelenterazin; Dipole dipole interactions; Experimental procedure; Photoproteins; Secondary structural elements; Site directed mutagenesis; Thermal denaturations; Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074374043

HFO1234ze(E) is an environmentally friendly alternative to SF6 since contrary to SF6, its global warming potential is negligible. While SF6 is unsurpassed in its efficiency of attaching thermal electrons, HFO1234ze(E) appears to moderate electron energies very efficiently. Electron attachment to HFO1234ze(E), on the other hand, is much weaker. We find a positive synergism in SF6/HFO1234ze(E) mixtures in the sense that the mixture of both compounds has a higher electric field strength than each gas separately. A maximum (E/N)crit of 425 Td is reached for a mixture of 40% SF6 and 60% HFO1234ze(E). A mixture of 90% HFO1234ze(E) and 10% SF6 has a critical electric field strength of 360 Td, similar to pure SF6.

While the national and local level have received ample scholarly attention, thus far little attention has been paid to the regional level. This is remarkable because policy makers across Europe are wondering what governance of regional transition actually is and how to shape and implement it. In the present paper, this concern is addressed. The research questions are, ""What does regional governance of energy transition entail? How can it be conceptualized? And what does it mean in practice?"" The questions are answered by presenting the results of a multi-disciplinary literature study, presenting a conceptual framework on governance of regional energy transition, using insights from innovation and transition studies as well as from the regional and network governance literature, and applying this to the illustrative case of theWest-Brabant region in The Netherlands. West-Brabant is a relatively large region and was home to a pilot that involved the development of a regional energy strategy. Data collection involved twenty expert interviews, text documents and participative observation in workshops. Results highlight the relevance of each of the key elements of the conceptual governance framework. However, some are particularly relevant like structural characteristics of the regional actor network, actor characteristics, and regional governance arrangements used. The results reveal commonalities with regional governance in other policy domains. This paper contributes to the literature on polycentric governance of energy transition and climate change mitigation, and concludes with the presentation of a research agenda. © 2020 by the authors.","Energy transition; Governance; Multi-level governance; Network; Policy; Polycentric governance; Region; Sustainable transition","climate change; conceptual framework; energy planning; governance approach; innovation; policy making; sustainability; Europe; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081200953

The associations of source-specific PM2.5 concentrations with these respiratory diseases were assessed with a time-stratified case-cossover design and logistic regression models to identify the changes in the PM2.5 that have led to the apparently increased toxicity per unit mass. The rates of ED visits and hospitalizations for asthma and COPD associated with increases in source-specific PM2.5 concentrations in the prior 1, 4, and 7 days were estimated for 6 urban sites in New York State. Overall, there were similar numbers of significantly increased (n = 9) and decreased rates (n = 8) of respiratory events (asthma and COPD hospitalizations and ED visits) associated with increased source-specific PM2.5 concentrations in the previous 1, 4, and 7 days. Associations of source-specific PM2.5 concentrations with excess rates of hospitalizations for COPD for spark- and compression ignition vehicles increased in the 2014–2016 period, but the values were not statistically significant. Other source types showed inconsistent patterns of excess rates. For asthma ED visits, only biomass burning and road dust showed consistent positive associations with road dust having significant values for most lag times. Secondary nitrate also showed significant positive associations with asthma ED visits in the AFTER period compared to no associations in the prior periods. These results suggest that the relationships of asthma and COPD exacerbation with source-specific PM2.5 are not well defined and further work will be needed to determine the causes of the apparent increases in the per unit mass toxicity of PM2.5 in New York State in the 2014-16 period. © 2019 The Authors","Asthma; COPD; ED visits; Hospitalizations; Source-specific PM2.5","asthma; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; hospital sector; nitrate; particulate matter; toxicity; adult; aged; ambient air; asthma; biomass production; burn; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical assessment; combustion; comparative study; controlled study; disease association; dust; emergency ward; female; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; New York; particulate matter; priority journal; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental exposure; hospital emergency service; hospitalization; particulate matter; New York [United States]; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Emergency Service, Hospital; Environmental Exposure; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; New York; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075836332

The synthesis gas produced in waste-to-energy gasification of MSW can lead to their increased role in electricity generation in the future and reduces waste disposal costs. In this study, a thermodynamic equilibrium model was developed based on the downdraft fixed-bed gasifier to evaluate the effect of waste moisture content on synthesis gas composition. Besides, the equilibrium temperature of the gasifier and heating value of synthesized gas from the downdraft fixed-bed gasifier have been analyzed.

Two arguments are advanced. First, REDD+ is likely to target local forest users at the expense of both corporate and international drivers of deforestation. This will reduce the effectiveness of the scheme and invite leakage issues. In elucidating the ultimately rejected strategies for addressing international drivers now hidden in neat negotiation outcomes, this article opens a space for considering how the scheme could move beyond a predominant focus on local forest users. Second, targeted forest users are likely to be governed by a combination of neoliberal and disciplinary technologies. REDD+ will seek to ‘improve’ their conduct through a three-staged process involving education, self-reflection and rewards for carbon sequestration. An alternative governmentality associated with local forest users’ claims to decide on REDD+ implementation and governance, on the other hand, met with resistance and ultimately received no protection in the adopted REDD+ safeguards. Moreover, the formulation of the safeguards could undermine legitimacy and forest stewardship in REDD+ projects. By linking the possibility of such issues to the negotiation outcomes, this article demonstrates necessary changes to the scheme. © The Author(s) 2019.","conduct of conduct; drivers of deforestation; governmentality; Michel Foucault; REDD+; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change","deforestation; emission control; environmental protection; forest management; governance approach; policy implementation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064055852

The analysis is motivated by the discussion on the future CAP, with calls for both an increased ambition on climate action from the agricultural sector and for a more incentive-based delivery system of direct payments under strict budgetary restrictions. By conducting a simulation experiment with an agricultural partial equilibrium model (CAPRI), we are able to factor in farmers’ supply and technology-adjusting responses to the policy change and to estimate the potential uptake of the GHG-reduction subsidy in EU regions. We find that a budget-neutral re-allocation of financial resources towards subsidised emission savings can reduce EU agricultural non-CO2 emissions by 21% by 2030, compared to a business-as-usual baseline. Two-thirds of the emission savings are due to changes in production levels and composition, implying that a significant part of the achieved GHG reduction is offset globally by emission leakage. At the aggregated level, the emission-saving subsidy and increased producer prices compensate farmers for the foregone direct income support, but differences in regional impacts indicate accelerated structural change and heterogeneous income effects in the farm population. We conclude that the assumed regional budget-neutrality condition introduces inefficiencies in the incentive system, and the full potential of the EU farming sector for GHG emissions reduction is not reached, leaving ample room for the design of more efficient agricultural policies for climate action. © 2019 The Authors.

Upon delivery to coastal waters, glacially sourced particulate trace elements are processed during early diagenesis in sediments and may be sequestered or recycled back to the water column depending on local biogeochemical conditions. In the glaciated fjords of Svalbard, large amounts of reactive Fe and Mn (oxyhydr)oxides are delivered to the sediment by glacial discharge, resulting in pronounced Fe and Mn cycling concurrent with microbial sulfate reduction. In order to investigate the diagenetic cycling of selected trace elements (As, Co, Cu, Mo, Ni, and U) in this system, we collected sediment cores from two Svalbard fjords, Van Keulenfjorden and Van Mijenfjorden, in a transect along the head-to-mouth fjord axis and analyzed aqueous and solid phase geochemistry with respect to trace elements, sulfur, and carbon along with sulfate reduction rates. We found that Co and Ni associate with Fe and Mn (oxyhydr)oxides and enter the pore water upon reductive metal oxide dissolution. Copper is enriched in the solid phase where sulfate reduction rates are high, likely due to reactions with H2S and the formation of sulfide minerals. Uranium accumulates in the solid phase likely following reduction by both Fe- and sulfate-reducing bacteria, while Mo adsorbs to Fe and Mn (oxyhydr)oxides in the surface sediment and is removed from the pore water at depth where sulfidization makes it particle-reactive. Arsenic is tightly coupled to Fe redox cycling and its partitioning between solid and dissolved phases is influenced by competition with FeS for adsorption sites on crystalline Fe oxides. Differences in trace element cycling between the two fjords suggest delivery of varying amount and composition of tidewater glacier (Van Keulenfjorden) and meltwater stream (Van Mijenfjorden) material, likely related to oxidative processes occurring in meltwater streams. This processing produces a partially weathered, more reactive sediment that is subject to stronger redox cycling of Fe, Mn, S, and associated trace elements upon delivery to Van Mijenfjorden. With climate warming, the patterns of trace element cycling observed in Van Mijenfjorden may also become more prevalent in other Svalbard fjords as tidewater glaciers retreat into meltwater stream valleys. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Arctic; Diagenesis; Fjord; Glacier; Meltwater; Metal reduction; Sediment; Sulfate reduction; Trace metals","diagenesis; dissolution; fjord; geoaccumulation; glacier dynamics; meltwater; sediment chemistry; sediment core; sulfate; trace element; water column; Arctic; Spitsbergen; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077232730

Plant-derived δ2Hn-alkane and δ18Osugar values record the isotopic composition of plant source water (δ2Hsource-water and δ18Osource-water), which usually reflects mean annual precipitation (δ2Hprecipiation and δ18Oprecipiation), modulated by evapotranspirative leaf water enrichment and biosynthetic fractionation (""bio). Accuracy and precision of respective proxies should be ideally evaluated at a regional scale. For this study, we analysed topsoils below coniferous and deciduous forests as well as grassland soils along a central European transect in order to investigate the variability and robustness of various proxies and to identify effects related to vegetation. Soil pH values derived from brGDGTs correlate reasonably well with measured soil pH values but are systematically overestimated (1pH D 0:6 ± 0:6). The branched vs. isoprenoid tetraether index (BIT) can give some indication whether the pH reconstruction is reliable. Temperatures derived from brGDGTs overestimate mean annual air temperatures slightly (1TMA D 0:5 °C ± 2.4). Apparent isotopic fractionation (""n-alkane/precipitation and ""sugar=precipitation) is lower for grassland sites than for forest sites due to signal damping; i.e. grass biomarkers do not record the full evapotranspirative leaf water enrichment. Coupling δ2Hn-alkane with δ18O sugar allows us to reconstruct the stable isotopic composition of the source water more accurately than without the coupled approach (1δ2H D ∼-21‰ ± 22‰ and 1d18O D ∼-2:9 ‰ ± 2.8 ‰). Similarly, relative humidity during daytime and the vegetation period (RHMDV) can be reconstructed using the coupled isotope approach (1RHMDV D∼-17 ± 12). Especially for coniferous sites, reconstructed RHMDV values as well as source water isotope composition underestimate the measured values. This can likely be explained by understorey grass vegetation at the coniferous sites contributing significantly to the n-alkane pool but only marginally to the sugar pool in the topsoils. Vegetation-dependent variable signal damping and ""bio (regarding 2H between n-alkanes and leaf water) along our European transect are difficult to quantify but likely contribute to the observed underestimation in the source water isotope composition and RH reconstructions. Microclimate variability could cause the rather large uncertainties. Vegetation-related effects do, by contrast, not affect the brGDGT-derived reconstructions. Overall, GDGTs and the coupled d2Hn-alkane d18Osugar approach have great potential for more quantitative paleoclimate reconstructions. © 2020 Author(s).",,"alkane; biomarker; coniferous forest; deciduous forest; environmental conditions; evapotranspiration; grass; grassland; isotopic composition; isotopic fractionation; oxygen isotope; paleoclimate; precipitation (chemistry); proxy climate record; reconstruction; sugar; topsoil; Europe; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079806867

In this report, synthetic and photochemical studies probe the initial steps of light-driven speciation for Mn(CO)3(Rbpy)Br complexes bearing a range of 4,4′-disubstituted 2,2′-bipyridyl ligands (Rbpy, where R = tBu, H, CF3, NO2). Transient absorption spectroscopy measurements for Mn(CO)3(Rbpy)Br coordination compounds with R = tBu, H, and CF3 in acetonitrile reveal ultrafast loss of a CO ligand on the femtosecond time scale, followed by solvent coordination on the picosecond time scale. The Mn(CO)3(NO2bpy)Br complex is unique among the four compounds in having a longer-lived excited state that does not undergo CO release or subsequent solvent coordination. The kinetics of photolysis and solvent coordination for light-sensitive complexes depend on the electronic properties of the disubstituted bipyridyl ligand. The results indicate that both metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) and dissociative ligand-field (d-d) excited states play a role in the ultrafast photochemistry. Taken together, the findings suggest that more robust catalysts could be prepared with appropriately designed complexes that avoid crossing between the excited states that drive photochemical CO loss.

Reduced crop yields will lead to higher food prices and increased hardship for low income populations, especially in urban areas. Action on climate change is one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 13) and is linked to the Paris Climate Agreement. The research challenge posed by climate change is so complex that a trans-disciplinary response is required, one that brings together researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers in networks where the lines between ""research"" and ""development"" become deliberately blurred. Fostering such networks will require researchers, throughout the world, not only to work across disciplines but also to pursue new South-North and South-South partnerships incorporating policy-makers and practitioners. We use our diverse research experiences to describe the emergence of such networks, such as the Direct Seeded Rice Consortium (DSRC) in South and Southeast Asia, and to identify lessons on how to facilitate and strengthen the development of trans-disciplinary responses to climate change. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Rice-based systems; South and Southeast Asia; Trans-disciplinary networks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080920893

It is difficult to verify whether these regions are net carbon sinks or sources by studying vegetation indices alone. In this study, we investigate greening trends in Eastern China (EC) and corresponding trends in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We used multiple vegetation indices including NDVI and EVI to characterize changes in vegetation activity over EC from 2003 to 2016. Gap-filled time series of column-averaged CO2 dry air mole fraction (XCO2) from January 2003 toMay 2016, based on observations from SCIAMACHY, GOSAT, and OCO-2 satellites, were used to calculate XCO2 changes during growing season for 13 years. We derived a relationship between XCO2 and surface net CO2 fluxes from two inversion model simulations, CarbonTracker and Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC), and used those relationships to estimate the biospheric CO2 flux enhancement based on satellite observed XCO2 changes. We observed significant growing period (GP) greening trends in NDVI and EVI related to cropland intensification and forest growth in the region. After removing the influence of large urban center CO2 emissions, we estimated an enhanced XCO2 drawdown during the GP of-0.070 to-0.084 ppm yr-1. Increased carbon uptake during the GP was estimated to be 28.41 to 46.04 Tg C, mainly from land management, which could offset about 2-3% of EC's annual fossil fuel emissions. These results show the potential of using multi-satellite observed XCO2 to estimate carbon fluxes from the regional biosphere, which could be used to verify natural sinks included as national contributions of greenhouse gas emissions reduction in international climate change agreements like the UNFCC Paris Accord. © 2020 by the author.","Carbon sink; China; Column CO2; EVI; NDVI; Satellite","Atmospheric composition; Biospherics; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Emission control; Forestry; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Vegetation; Carbon sink; China; Climate Change Agreements; Fossil fuel emissions; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; NDVI; Vegetation activity; Vegetation greening; Satellites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080869778

PCC7120 is a genetically tractable model organism for nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis research. The importance of small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) as mediators of a number of cellular processes in bacteria has begun to be recognized. Bacterial sRNA binds to target genes through base pairing, and play a regulatory role. Many studies have shown that bacterial sRNA can regulate cell stress response, carbon and nitrogen fixation, and so on. However, little is known about sRNAs in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 regarded to nitrogen fixation under later steady state. Methods: To provide a comprehensive study of sRNAs in this model organism, the sRNA (< 200 nt) extracted from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 under nitrogen step-down treatment of 12 days, together with the sRNA from the control, was analyzed using deep RNA sequencing. Possible target genes regulated by all identified putative sRNAs were predicted by IntaRNA and further analyzed for functional categorizations for biological pathways. Result: Totally, 14,132 transcripts were produced from the de novo assembly. Among them, transcripts that are located either in the intergenic region or antisense strand were kept, which resulted in 1219 sRNA candidates, for further analysis. RPKM-based differential expression analysis showed that 418 sRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between the samples from control (nitrogen addition, N+) and nitrogen depletion, (N-). Among them, 303 sRNAs were significantly upregulated, whereas 115 sRNAs were significantly downregulated. RT-PCR of 18 randomly chosen sRNAs showed a similar pattern as RNA-seq result, which confirmed the reliability of the RNA-seq data. In addition, the possible target genes regulated by unique sRNAs of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 under nitrogen addition (N+) condition or that under nitrogen depletion (N-) condition were analyzed for functional categorization and biological pathways, which provided the evidences that sRNAs were indeed involved in many different metabolic pathways. Conclusion: The information from the present study provides a valuable reference for understanding the sRNA-mediated regulation of the nitrogen fixation in Anabaena PCC 7120 under steady state conditions. © 2020 The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085110522

China's water resources are strained by increasing demand from the rapid development of intensive agriculture, with rice cultivation using the most water. Here, a meta-analysis on the rice system in China was conducted using 2753 paired observations to identify the opportunities of optimized water management (two alternate wetting and drying irrigation methods and one limited flooding irrigation method) to reduce both irrigation water usage and greenhouse gas emissions, maintain yield, and increase income. Compared to farmers’ continuous flooding irrigation, optimized management decreased irrigation water usage by 40% while increasing water productivity by 34%. Yield losses occurred under severe soil water shortages, but yield increased by 1–6% under mild alternate wetting and drying irrigation (soil water potential ≥ −15 kPa or soil water table ≥ −10 cm) compared to continuous flooding irrigation. Optimized irrigation reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 37% through lower methane emissions and less energy consumption from irrigation. Scenario analysis indicated that optimized irrigation reduced both irrigation water use and greenhouse gas emissions and that the economic return could largely offset the risk of yield losses. Policies that support and invest in both water management and high-yielding cultivation practices should be prioritized in order to pursue the benefits of sustainable rice production for China and similar regions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Economic benefits; Environmental damage; Optimized irrigation; Rice productivity; Scenario analysis; Sustainability","Cultivation; Economic analysis; Energy utilization; Floods; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Productivity; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Soil moisture; Sustainable development; Water management; Water supply; Wetting; Agricultural productions; Economic benefits; Environmental damage; Irrigation methods; Irrigation water use; Scenario analysis; Soil water potential; Sustainable rice production; Irrigation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074433920

Therefore, understanding of the role of common urban roadside plant plays for particulate matter (PM) reduction would have important meaning for the mitigation of urban air pollution. The leaf surface PM capturing capacity of 12 representative urban plants (five shrubs and seven trees) alongside one main street in Hanover Germany was explored in this study. Significant differences for the amount of captured PM (both PM10 and PM2.5) on the leaf surface were found between plant species. Leaves of Taxus baccata, Berberis thunbergii, Pinus nigra, and Quercus robur showed the highest capturing capacity, while leaves of Prunus laurocerasus and Carpinus betulus showed the lowest value. Leaf shape is an important factor which affects the capturing capacity of the tested plant species. Needle-leaved pants were relatively more effective than broad-leaved species. Besides, species with small leaf surface area (0–10 cm2) showed a notably higher capacity than species with large leaf surface area (over 100 cm2). Additionally, by the observation of leaf surface characteristics, plant species with rough and hairy leaf surface tended to be more effective than species with smooth leaf surface. More PM was found distributed on the upper leaf surface close to the midrib rather than on the surface area away from it. At last, no significant correlation was found between the leaf surface contact angle and its PM capturing capacity for the 12 tested plant species in September. In summary, leaf traits including leaf form, leaf shape, leaf surface area, leaf surface hydrophilicity and leaf surface characteristics all have notable effects on the PM capturing capacity of the roadside plant species. This study provides a scientific basis for roadside plants as an eco-friendly solution for the reduction of urban traffic–related PM and stresses the importance of leaf traits as criteria for the plant selection. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Contact angle; Leaf area; Leaf shape; PM10; PM2.5; SEM","anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; coniferous tree; correlation; deciduous tree; hydrophobicity; leaf; particulate matter; reduction; road traffic; scanning electron microscopy; urban area; urban pollution; Germany; Hannover; Lower Saxony; Berberis thunbergii; Carpinus betulus; Pinus nigra; Prunus laurocerasus; Quercus robur; Taxus baccata; air pollution; chemistry; city; Germany; particulate matter; plant leaf; tree; Air Pollution; Cities; Germany; Particulate Matter; Plant Leaves; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077084184

Methods: We investigated the relationship of ambient PM2.5 exposure with cause-specific cardiovascular disease mortality in 565 477 men and women, aged 50 to 71 years, from the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study. During 7.5 x 106 person-years of follow up, 41 286 cardiovascular disease deaths, including 23 328 ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and 5894 stroke deaths, were ascertained using the National Death Index. PM2.5 was estimated using a hybrid land use regression (LUR) geostatistical model. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Each increase of 10 μg/m3 PM2.5 (overall range, 2.9-28.0 μg/m3) was associated, in fully adjusted models, with a 16% increase in mortality from ischaemic heart disease [hazard ratio (HR) 1.16; 95% CI 1.09-1.22] and a 14% increase in mortality from stroke (HR 1.14; CI 1.02-1.27). Compared with PM2.5 exposure &lt;8 μg/m3 (referent), risks for CVD were increased in relation to PM2.5 exposures in the range of 8-12 μg/m3 (CVD: HR 1.04; 95% CI 1.00-1.08), in the range 12-20 μg/m3 (CVD: HR 1.08; 95% CI 1.03-1.13) and in the range 20+ μg/m3 (CVD: HR 1.19; 95% CI 1.10-1.28). Results were robust to alternative approaches to PM2.5 exposure assessment and statistical analysis. Conclusions: Long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution is associated with ischaemic heart disease and stroke mortality, with excess risks occurring in the range of and below the present US long-term standard for ambient exposure to PM2.5 (12 μg/m3), indicating the need for continued improvements in air pollution abatement for CVD prevention. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019; all rights reserved.

BIFoR FACE employs large-scale infrastructure, in the form of lattice towers, forming ‘arrays’ which encircle a forest plot of ~30 m diameter. BIFoR FACE consists of three treatment arrays to elevate local CO2 concentrations (e[CO2]) by +150 µmol/mol. In practice, acceptable operational enrichment (ambient [CO2] + e[CO2]) is ±20% of the set point 1-min average target. There are a further three arrays that replicate the infrastructure and deliver ambient air as paired controls for the treatment arrays. For the first growing season with e[CO2] (April to November 2017), [CO2] measurements in treatment and control arrays show that the target concentration was successfully delivered, that is: +147 ± 21 µmol/mol (mean ± SD) or 98 ± 14% of set point enrichment target. e[CO2] treatment was accomplished for 97.7% of the scheduled operation time, with the remaining time lost due to engineering faults (0.6% of the time), CO2 supply issues (0.6%) or adverse weather conditions (1.1%). CO2 demand in the facility was driven predominantly by wind speed and the formation of the deciduous canopy. Deviations greater than 10% from the ambient baseline CO2 occurred &lt;1% of the time in control arrays. Incidences of cross-contamination &gt;80 µmol/mol (i.e. &gt;53% of the treatment increment) into control arrays accounted for &lt;0.1% of the enrichment period. The median [CO2] values in reconstructed three-dimensional [CO2] fields show enrichment somewhat lower than the target but still well above ambient.

Framing ocean acidification in this way has been effective at garnering policy action at the domestic level in the United States. It is argued, however, in this paper that this framing has been counterproductive at the international level, resulting in two main impediments to the international governance of this issue. Firstly, defining ocean acidification as a concurrent problem to climate change, rather than as an impact of it, has resulted in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change being interpreted as containing no obligation to address ocean acidification. Secondly, focussing almost solely on the reduction of global emissions of carbon dioxide as the only global solution to ocean acidification has resulted in ocean and biodiversity-related regimes that do not have the mandate to regulate CO2 emissions as being viewed as without the recourse to respond. Through an examination of the causes and consequences of ocean acidification and the general objectives of existing multilateral environmental agreements, a set of alternative problem frames are developed in this paper that could be deployed to mobilize action under existing environmental regimes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Epistemic community; Governance; International agreements; Problem framing","carbon dioxide; acidification; Article; biodiversity; carbon footprint; climate change; ecosystem resilience; environmental impact; environmental policy; epistemology; government regulation; legal aspect; marine environment; ocean acidification; priority journal; United Nations; water pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076245897

Having information on how effects of biotic resistance vary spatially can be especially important when implementing biological control because introduced agents may have different impacts through interactions with host-plant genotype, local environment, or other novel enemies. We conducted a series of field surveys and laboratory studies to determine whether there was evidence of biotic resistance, as foliar fungal pathogens, in two introduced genotypes (triploid G1, diploid G4) of the Eurasian wetland weed, Butomus umbellatus L. in the USA. We tested whether genotypes differed in disease attack and whether spatial patterns in disease incidence were related to geographic location or climate for either genotype. We surveyed 27 B. umbellatus populations (17 G1, 10 G4) to determine disease incidence and associated fungal pathogens. For a subset of plant populations, we isolated foliar fungi and tested pathogenicity of three isolates in laboratory assays. After accounting for location (latitude, climate), G1 plants had lower disease incidence than G4 plants in the field (38% vs. 70%) but similar pathogen richness. In contrast, bioassays revealed G1 plants consistently received a higher damage score and had larger leaf lesions regardless of pathogen. The seemingly contradictory results between the field and laboratory may be due to climatic differences between areas that limit the regional pool of pathogens or their effect on plant genotype. These results demonstrate that two widespread B. umbellatus genotypes exhibit different susceptibility to pathogens and effectiveness of pathogen biological controls may depend on local conditions. © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Biological control; Disease incidence; Enemy resistance; Fungal pathogens; Invasive species; Latitudinal variation","biological control; disease incidence; environmental factor; fungus; genetic variation; geographical variation; heterogeneity; pathogen; pathogenicity; United States; Butomus umbellatus; Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074570251

Methods: Here, we implement a new R package for the estimation of climate from extant and fossil vegetation. The ‘cRacle’ package implements functions for data access, aggregation, and modeling to estimate climate from plant community compositions. ‘cRacle’ is modular and includes many best-practice features. Results: Performance tests using modern vegetation survey data from North and South America shows that CRACLE outperforms alternative methods. CRACLE estimates of mean annual temperature are usually within 1°C of the actual values when optimal model parameters are used. Generalized boosted regression (GBR) model correction improves CRACLE estimates by reducing bias. Discussion: CRACLE provides accurate estimates of climate based on the composition of modern plant communities. Non-parametric CRACLE modeling coupled with GBR model correction produces the most accurate results to date. The ‘cRacle’ R package streamlines the estimation of climate from plant community data, which will make this modeling more accessible to a wider range of users. © 2020 Harbert and Baryiames.

Here, the main pathway and operator of methane oxidation in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) wetland, a methane source in the wet season but a methane sink in the dry season, were investigated. The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and aerobic methane oxidation (AMO) abilities of wetland soil were measured, and the microbial community structure was analyzed. The experimental results showed that AMO was active throughout the year. In contrast, AOM was weak and even undetected. The microbial community analysis indicated that Methylomicrobium and Methylobacter potentially scavenged methane in oxic environments. A representative strain of Methylobacter, which was isolated from the soil, presented a strong AMO ability at high concentrations of methane and air. Overall, this study showed that active AMO performing by Methylobacter may account for methane sink in the YRD wetland during the dry season. Our research not only has determined the way in which methane sinks are formed but also identified the potential functional microbes. In particular, we confirmed the function of potential methanotroph by pure culture. Our research provides biological evidence for why some wetlands have methane sink characteristics, which may help to understand the global methane change mechanism. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aerobic methane oxidation; Anaerobic oxidation of methane; Coastal wetland; Methane sink; Methylobacter","Atmospheric chemistry; Drought; Microorganisms; Oxidation; Wetlands; Anaerobic oxidation of methanes; Atmospheric methanes; Coastal wetlands; Methane oxidation; Methylobacter; Microbial community analysis; Microbial community structures; Representative strain; Methane; methane; methane; anoxic conditions; atmospheric sink; coastal wetland; community structure; dry season; methane; methanogenic bacterium; oxic conditions; oxidation; anaerobic metabolism; Article; bacterial strain; community structure; controlled study; methanotrophic bacterium; Methylobacter; Methylomicrobium; microbial community; nonhuman; oxidation; priority journal; river ecosystem; wetland; aerobic metabolism; bioremediation; chemistry; China; metabolism; Methylococcaceae; microbiology; river; water pollutant; China; Shandong; Yellow River Delta; Methylobacter; Methylomicrobium; Aerobiosis; Biodegradation, Environmental; China; Methane; Methylococcaceae; Rivers; Water Microbiology; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076612042

In the present study, the source changes of PM10 from pre- and post-economic crisis to economic recovery were investigated using receptor model (Positive Matrix Factorization: PMF). PM10 samples were collected during 2014 at six different sites in Andalusia, located in the southern Spain (1–7° W, 37–39° N). Seven source factors were identified as soil dust (17.9–34.8%), road traffic (12.2–25.9%), industrial emission (1.2–16.6%), oil combustion (0–16.1%), sea salt (5.0–15.7%), secondary nitrate (&lt;0.05–30.4%) and secondary sulfate (4.4–15.1%). The soil dust source had the greatest influence on these six stations, followed by the road traffic source. The area was seriously affected by industrial pollution, even to the suburban and rural areas. Industry source contribution showed an increase trend from financial crisis periods to economic recovery, and the contribution in 2014 was even higher than pre-crisis level. As a result, the concentrations of heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Pb, Cr and Ni) in the atmosphere were significant increased, thus enhanced their toxicity and health risks for people. The economic recovery after the financial crisis in Spain may be at the expense of emission control targets and air pollution. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Chemical composition; Industrial emission; Particulate matter; Source apportionment; Spain financial crisis","Air pollution; Dust; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Factorization; Finance; Health risks; Heavy metals; Industrial emissions; Metal recovery; Roads and streets; Sulfur compounds; Atmospheric heavy metals; Chemical compositions; Financial crisis; Industrial pollution; Particulate Matter; Positive Matrix Factorization; Source apportionment; Source contributions; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074149311

Research on these crop responses has focused principally on impacts to food production impacts, but evidence is emerging that they may have serious environmental consequences as well. Recent research has documented potential environmental impacts of shifting cropping patterns, including impacts on water, wildlife, pollinator interaction, carbon storage and nature conservation, on national to global scales. Multiple crops will be moving in response to shifting climatic suitability, and the cumulative environmental effects of these multi-crop shifts at global scales is not known. Here we model for the first time multiple major global commodity crop suitability changes due to climate change, to estimate the impacts of new crop suitability on water, biodiversity and carbon storage. Areas that become newly suitable for one or more crops are Climate-driven Agricultural Frontiers. These frontiers cover an area equivalent to over 30% of the current agricultural land on the planet and have major potential impacts on biodiversity in tropical mountains, on water resources downstream and on carbon storage in high latitude lands. Frontier soils contain up to 177 Gt of C, which might be subject to release, which is the equivalent of over a century of current United States CO2 emissions. Watersheds serving over 1.8 billion people would be impacted by the cultivation of the climate-driven frontiers. Frontiers intersect 19 global biodiversity hotspots and the habitat of 20% of all global restricted range birds. Sound planning and management of climate-driven agricultural frontiers can therefore help reduce globally significant impacts on people, ecosystems and the climate system. © 2020 Hannah et al.

In particular, more states have education standards that specifically address climate change today than ever before. However, previous research raises concerns about the discretion teachers have in if and how particular types of content are presented. The effectiveness of new state standards and the extent to which such state-level standards are coopted by teacher discretion has received minimal attention. Therefore, using a nationally representative sample of 1500 middle school and high school science teachers, this research examines the effectiveness of such state-level standards and the extent to which teacher ideology and knowledge mediate the relationship between standards and actual use of a consensus-informed approach to teaching climate science. Results show that teachers in states with any type of standards around climate change spend significantly more time on the topic in the classroom. However, teachers in states that have standards that require teachers to present “both sides” of climate change are significantly less likely to use a consensus-informed approach. While teacher characteristics (knowledge and ideology) can weaken their effect, standards continue to be important predictors of the time spent on climate change in the classroom and how content is presented. The paper concludes with a discussion of the policy implications of climate science standards. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Global warming; Pedagogy; State standards","Climate change; Global warming; Anthropogenic cause; Pedagogy; Policy implications; Public education system; Representative sample; Science teachers; State standards; Teacher Characteristics; Public policy; building; climate change; global warming; perception; standard (regulation); teaching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075377300

The core of developing a low-carbon economy is to increase carbon productivity, which can be measured as the economic benefits of unit carbon emissions. Therefore, using province‐level panel data in China from 2009 to 2017, we analyze the carbon productivity level of each region, and empirically investigate the threshold effect of clean energy development on carbon productivity under different technological innovation levels. The results show that the carbon productivity is rising, and Chinaʹs economic development pattern has been shifting towards low‐carbon and sustainable development. Furthermore, the driving force of clean energy development on carbon productivity is not monotonously increasing (decreasing) but is a “double threshold effect” of technological innovation capability. Finally, based on the research conclusions and realistic requirements of Chinaʹs low‐carbon economic transformation, this paper proposes improving carbon productivity from the aspects of innovation capability improvement and institutional guarantee. © 2020 by the authors.

This comprises a large part of the total emissions in urban areas. In this article, we address the question of how various local policy instruments and technology can be used to support the use of clean road vehicles in urban areas. Despite some moderate success in specific areas, local policies and technology need to become even more effective. Using the STREAMS model, a comparative analysis is made of six urban cases in the Randstad and the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan areas. The study provides new insights into the dynamics between the perceived problems, policy making (in terms of the adoption of policy instruments), politics (in terms of the fit/misfit between stakeholders’ interests, which may result in a window for policy change), and technology. The policy instruments examined include low emission zones, parking licence restrictions, and incentives to adopt electric vehicles. Policy recommendations are made regarding effective policy instruments for the reduction of harmful emissions in metropolitan areas.

As a fair and effective emission responsibility assignment framework is fundamental for mercury control policy design, this study measures China's provincial shared producer and consumer responsibility for energy-related mercury emissions and draws the evolution trajectories. The results show that the total emissions decrease from 249.29 t in 2007 to 230.63 t in 2010, but rebound to 238.37 t in 2012. Meanwhile, under the shared responsibility (SR) scheme, mercury emissions of Shandong, Jiangsu, and Henan hold the top three positions. SR for mercury emissions of Zhejiang, Liaoning and Henan experience remarkable reduction, while that of Inner Mongolia and Hubei show a growing trend. Richer provinces generally have larger mercury emissions under consumption-based responsibility (CR) than that under SR, indicating these regions should emphasize more on the consumption-side mercury mitigation measures (e.g., regulating the capital investment and encouraging green consumption). On the contrary, more production-side mitigation policies (e.g., closing down small coal-fired power plants and advocating more efficient APCDs) should be conducted in Inner Mongolia, Henan, Shanxi. In conclusion, this study suggests that SR should be adopted as the benchmark for mercury reduction strategy, as it involves more participants to reduce mercury emissions along the supply chains. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; Energy related mercury emissions; Multi-regional input-output analysis; Provincial regions; Shared responsibility","Coal; Fossil fuel power plants; Investments; Plant shutdowns; Small power plants; Supply chains; China; Input output analysis; Mercury emissions; Provincial regions; Shared responsibility; Mercury (metal)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074340475

It is a compliance approach that allows point sources, such as factories, to meet regulatory obligations by using pollutant reductions created by another source, such as local farms, which has lower pollution control costs. The objective of this study was to explore the possibility of expanding the use of WQT from agriculture to rural septic systems, an often-neglected nonpoint source of nutrients to Lake Erie. Septic system upgrades in northwestern Ohio are of special interest because the soil conditions in this area pose a limitation to the effectiveness of nutrient removal for conventional soil-based systems. We assessed the willingness of septic system users to upgrade their systems using three scenarios emphasizing climate change, governmental regulation, or WQT. We found that septic system users were most interested in upgrades under the WQT scenario. The idea of WQT was better accepted in certain locations where septic system users were more concerned about the environment, perceived the local water quality to be degraded, and were aware of the limitation of their septic systems. Pilot WQT projects should focus on approaching these users. © 2020, National Environmental Health Association.

Application of an electric field is a promising technology to increase biomethane production from various complex organic compounds. Here, the effects of an applied voltage (0.6 V, 1.2 V, and 1.8 V) on methane production due to coal biodegradation, as well as the structure of microflora and intermediates were studied by anaerobic culture, pyrosequencing, and GC–MS. The maximum methane production was observed at 1.2 V with an average of 63.0 μmol/g of coal, which was 134% higher than the control without electrodes (26.9 μmol/g of coal). The CO2 yield was negatively correlated with the methane yield, suggesting that more carbon in coal has been transferred to methane after application of an electric field. The pyrosequencing results showed that the abundance of bacteria with extracellular electron transfer abilities, such as Soehngenia, Desulfovibrio, and Deferrisoma, increased after applying a 1.2 V electric field. Moreover, the structure of the fungal communities changed significantly, especially the abundance of Mortierella, Thielavia, Humicola, and Plectosphaerella. According to the GC-MS results, most of the products detected at the end of the cultivation period in the control were not detected in the cultures cultivated at 1.2 V. New organic compounds such as alcohols, unsaturated fatty acids, and amines were produced in the cultures cultivated at 1.2 V. These results suggest that application of an electric field changes the structure of the microflora, which promotes extracellular electron transfer and the biodegradation of organic compounds, thus enhancing methane production from coal. Furthermore, the distinct organic products detected after cultivation and the significant changes in microbial communities suggest that the degrading metabolism of organic matter in coal might be altered due to the application of an electric field. Based on the results, a biogenic methane production system implemented by application of an electric field was proposed and described. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biogenic coalbed methane; Coal biodegradation; Electric field; Microbial community; Organic product","Amines; Biodegradation; Coal; Coal bed methane; Coal deposits; Electric fields; Electron transitions; Firedamp; Greenhouse gases; Microorganisms; Unsaturated compounds; Unsaturated fatty acids; Anaerobic cultures; Complex organic compounds; Cultivation periods; Electric field change; Extracellular electron transfer; Methane production; Microbial communities; Organic products; Methane; anthracite; biodegradation; biogenic deposit; coalbed methane; electric field; metabolism; microbial community; Desulfovibrio; Humicola; Mortierella; Plectosphaerella; Soehngenia; Thielavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077750994

They are further associated with adverse health impacts within urban ecosystems. In order to manage and control deteriorating urban air quality, an efficient and effective urban air quality management plan is required consisting of systematic sampling, monitoring and analysis; modelling; and control protocols. Air quality monitoring is the essential and basic step that develops foundation of any management plan. The present research article describes a comprehensive methodology for establishing a systematic and robust air quality monitoring network in LMICs and strengthening the effectiveness and efficiency of urban air quality management frameworks. It also describes step-by-step procedures for chemical characterization of both organic and inorganic constituents of ambient particulate matter along with molecular markers, which are essential to identify the corresponding sources of particulate matter, an integral part of air pollution monitoring protocol. Additionally, it discusses the need for coupling low cost wireless sensor-based stations with a limited number of manual and conventional real time ambient air monitoring stations in order to make it cost effective, yet robust.

It was used to quantify hydrogen peroxide and glucose by UV-visible spectroscopy. Banana peels were used to prepare the CDs by a microwave-assisted method. The CDs can be prepared within 5 min at 700 W. They act as (a) substrate, (b) stabilizer, and (c) reductant to convert silver ions to AgNPs. The nano-assembly was characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The CDs have a particle size of 1.4 nm. Photoexcitation of the CDs with a UV lamp of 365 nm results in blue fluorescence. The absorption spectra of the CDs show a peak at 205 nm along the wide shoulder absorption band. On incorporation of the Ag nanoparticles into the CDs matrix, the color of the CDs turns into yellow and an additional absorbance peak at 408 nm appears. FTIR spectroscopy shows that different functional groups are present on the CDs. They are responsible for the stabilization of the AgNPs. On exposure to H2O2, the color of the nano-assembly disappears gradually. Hence, the assembly can be used as a colorimetric indicator probe for H2O2 with a linear response in the 0.1-100 μM concentration range. It can also be applied to the determination of glucose by using glucose oxidase which causes the formation of H2O2 from glucose. The linear response ranges from 1- 600 μM. The detection limits for H2O2 and glucose are 9 nM and 10 nM, respectively. In our perception, this is the lowest detection limit reported so far. The AgNP@CD nano-assembly does not respond to saccharides, maltose, fructose, and lactose. It can be used to quantify glucose in diluted blood plasma.

Coastal marsh hydrology varies based on elevation, distance from channel, and hydraulic properties, resulting in zones of unique water level oscillation patterns. These zones impact ecology and geochemistry and correspond to differences in carbon accumulation rates. These physical-biogeochemical linkages enable use of a hydrological model to predict changes in marsh zonation, and in turn carbon accumulation, as well as groundwater-surface water exchange under SLR. Here, we developed a calibrated hydrological model of a Delaware coastal marsh using HydroGeoSphere. We simulated three scenarios each of SLR, sediment accretion, and upland hydrologic response, and we quantified changes in the spatial coverage of different hydrologic zonations and groundwater-surface water exchange. Results show that relative SLR reduces marsh area, carbon burial, and lateral water fluxes. However, the magnitudes of change are linked to the terrestrial groundwater table response as well as relative SLR. In scenarios where the upland water table does not change with SLR, the magnitude of decline in marsh area and carbon accumulation is reduced compared to scenarios where the upland water table keeps pace with SLR. In contrast, the reduction in lateral water flux is minimized in scenarios with an upland water table rise equal to SLR compared to scenarios where the upland water table is held at present-day levels.

Numerous studies have focused on bloom formation mechanisms; however, the detailed mechanisms remained unclear. Our study explored the influence of four metal ions (Ca, Cu, Pb and Cd) on Microcystis aeruginosa to determine their effects on bloom formation. We found that Ca concentrations higher than 100 mg L−1 contributed to cyanobacterial bloom formation. The presence of Ca triggered the anti-oxidation process and promoted the secretion of extracellular polysaccharides, thus inducing aggregation of algal cells and enhancing their buoyancy 2.1-fold more than the control (p＜0.05). The reverse regulation of dissolved CO2 to bicarbonate by carbonic anhydrase formed a large amount of carbonate and decreased the growth rate by 38–56%. Cu (&gt;0.1 mg L−1) presented significant toxicity to algal cells while Pb (&gt;1 mg L−1) suppressed the algal growth rate due to the acidic condition. Cd (&lt;0.1 mg L−1) exhibited no apparent toxicity to the algae. Furthermore, as the buoyancy increased, Cd was likely to facilitate the formation of cyanobacterial blooms, which needs further research.

Three types of ligands for each central metal atom are considered: OH-, NO3 -, and CO3 2- with common oxo ligands in all cases. Among these, carbonate complexes show the strongest adsorption followed by hydroxide and nitrate. Two types of model, cluster and periodic models, have been considered to include the short- and long-range effects. The cluster and periodic models are complementary, although the former has not yet been widely used for studies of 2D materials. Two cluster sizes have been investigated to check size dependency. Calculations were performed in the gas phase and water solvent. On the basis of the adsorption energy, for the CO3 2- and OH- ligands, the bond position between two Si atoms in the silicene sheet is the most strongly adsorbed site in the cluster model for silicene whereas in the periodic model these complexes exhibit strong binding on the Si atom of the silicene surface. The Ac complexes with the NO3 - ligand show strong affinity at the hollow space at the center of a hexagonal ring of silicene in both models. The H site is most favorable for the binding of complexes on the germanene cluster whereas these sites vary in the periodic model. Electronic structure calculations have been performed that show a bandgap range from 0.130 to 0.300 eV for the adsorption of actinide complexes on silicene that can be traced to charge transfer. Density of states calculations show that the contribution of the nitrate complexes is small near the Fermi level, but it is larger for the carbonate complexes in the silicene case. Strong interactions between Ac complexes and silicene are due to the formation of strong Si-O bonds upon adsorption which results in reduction of the actinide atom. Such bonding is lacking in germanene.

Renewable electricity can be leveraged to produce fuels and chemicals from CO2, offering sustainable routes to reduce the carbon intensity of our energy and products-driven economy. A number of approaches have been developed for the electron-driven reduction of CO2 to products, including both direct and indirect (via an energy carrier such as H2) pathways and spanning from electrochemical to biological to thermocatalytic conversion. While these approaches are at various stages of development, there are technical barriers related to each core conversion technology that need to be addressed in order to accelerate commercialization and drive the transition towards a circular carbon economy. In this perspective, we assess and characterize the top technical barriers for utilizing renewable electricity for CO2 reduction across five different conversion approaches (direct electrochemical, direct bioelectrochemical, direct non-thermal plasma, indirect bioelectrochemical, and indirect thermochemical) under state-of-technology conditions, outline the R&amp;D needs to overcome each barrier, and identify the most promising C1-C3 hydrocarbons and oxygenates based on their relative ease of formation, economic viability, CO2 utilization potential, and energy storage capacity. Our analysis suggests, based on current reported states of technology, that indirect pathways paired with the formation of C1 products offer the most technically feasible approach for electron driven CO2 reduction in the near term. However, as we strive for longer carbon chain molecules, and as technologies continue to advance, there are a multitude of advantages and limitations to be considered for all five approaches. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon; Costs; Electric energy storage; Reduction; Bio-electrochemical; Carbon chain molecule; Economic viability; Energy storage capacity; Low-cost electricity; Renewable electricity; Technological advancement; Technology condition; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; commercialization; cost analysis; electricity; energy storage; fossil fuel; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081788965

Climate change and local anthropogenic activities such as river regulation and urban growth are raising risk levels in coastal hotspots, like low-lying areas of river deltas. This urges to revise present management strategies to guarantee their future sustainability, demanding a detailed diagnostic of the hazard evolution. In this paper, flooding and erosion under current and future conditions have been assessed at local scale at the urban area of Riumar, a touristic enclave placed at the Ebro Delta (Spain). Process-based models have been used to address the interaction between beach morphology and storm waves, as well as the influence of coastal environment complexity. Storm waves have been propagated with SWAN wave model and have provided the forcings for XBeach, a 2DH hydro-morphodynamic model. Results show that future trends in sea level rise and wave forcing produce non-linear variations of the flooded area and the volume of mobilized sediment resulting from marine storms. In particular, the balance between flooding and sediment transport will shift depending on the relative sea level. Wave induced flooding and long-shore sand transport seem to be diminished in the future, whereas static sea level flooding and cross-shore sediment transport are exacerbated. Therefore, the characterization of tipping points in the coastal response can help to develop robust and adaptive plans to manage climate change impact in sandy wave dominated coasts with a low-lying hinterland and a complex shoreline morphology. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Coastal flooding; Ebro delta; Episodic beach erosion; Morphodynamics; Sea level rise; SWAN; XBeach","Beaches; Erosion; Floods; Hazards; Morphology; Sea level; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Storms; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Water waves; Beach erosion; Coastal flooding; Ebro deltas; Morphodynamics; Sea level rise; SWAN; XBeach; Climate change; beach erosion; beach morphology; climate change; coastal erosion; coastal zone; flooding; growth; sea level change; sediment transport; shoreline change; storm; urban area; urban growth; Catalonia; Ebro Delta; Spain; Spain; Tarragona [Catalonia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081555695

Unfortunately, wetlands are declining much faster than forests. The safeguarding of the wetlands also needs knowledge of the dynamics that control the water balance of these environments. Therefore, an accurate estimation of evapotranspiration in wetlands is an essential task. When adequate experimental data are available, some algorithms deriving from Artificial Intelligence research represent a promising alternative to the most common estimation techniques. In this study, starting from daily measurements of climatic variables such as net solar radiation, depth to water, wind speed, mean relative humidity, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and mean temperature, using the Random Forest, Additive Regression of Decision Stump, Multilayer Perceptron and k-Nearest Neighbors algorithms, 24 estimation models, different in input variables, have been developed and compared. The data have been provided by USGS. They have been obtained from a measuring site in wetlands of Indian River County, Florida using the eddy-covariance technique. The accuracy of these models based on AI algorithms remains good even if the number of input variables is reduced from 7 to 3. Net solar radiation, mean temperature and mean relative humidity or wind speed measurements allow obtaining a sufficiently accurate estimation model. Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors provide slightly better performance than Additive Regression of Decision Stump and Multilayer Perceptron. The analyzed models show in most cases the lowest accuracy in the range 2–4 mm/day, while the highest accuracy is obtained in the ranges 0–2 mm/day and 6–8 mm/day, with the exception of the models based on the Additive Regression, which show similar levels of accuracy in the different considered sub-intervals. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Evapotranspiration; Prediction models; Wetlands","Additives; Artificial intelligence; Decision trees; Disasters; Evapotranspiration; Motion compensation; Multilayers; Nearest neighbor search; Regression analysis; Solar radiation; Wind; Actual evapotranspiration; Artificial intelligence research; Eddy covariance technique; Estimation techniques; Minimum temperatures; Natural disaster risk; Prediction model; Wind speed measurement; Wetlands; artificial intelligence; evapotranspiration; numerical model; prediction; relative humidity; wetland; additive regression of decision stump; Article; artificial intelligence; controlled study; Eddy covariance; environmental temperature; evapotranspiration; Florida; humidity; intermethod comparison; k nearest neighbor; measurement accuracy; multilayer perceptron; priority journal; random forest; solar radiation; wetland; wind speed; environmental monitoring; procedures; temperature; theoretical model; water flow; wind; Florida [United States]; Indian River County; United States; Artificial Intelligence; Environmental Monitoring; Models, Theoretical; Neural Networks, Computer; Temperature; Water Movements; Wetlands; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075820922

While the global EV industry is expanding rapidly, the regional effect is significant, with some markets according near-mainstream status, and others remaining in early-adoption stages. This leaves domestic automakers to come up with forecasts with little relevant data. The main objective of this study is to identify a set of pertinent factors impacting the adoption of EVs at a local level, to determine the adoptability index of such vehicles in India. While current forecasting methods use either qualitative or quantitative factors, this study selects an amalgamation of both, displaying their relative importance.

We report three main results. First, education is a strong predictor of LPG adoption. Second, perceptions that LPG is good and affordable and progressive health-related perceptions are associated with LPG ownership. Third, and surprisingly, education does not predict positive attitudes toward clean cooking fuels. These results suggest that education leads to LPG adoption, but not through attitudinal changes.

The species is also known for its large annual fluctuations in the number of wintering individuals, so inference about population trends should be based on long-term data. Prior to 2005, analyses indicated stable or even increasing barbastelle population in Poland. We analysed the results of 13 winter bat counts (2005–2017) of the species from 15 of the largest hibernacula, and additional site of 47 small bunkers, in Poland. The total number of wintering individuals remained stable during the study period, because the barbastelle is not a long-distance migrant, this likely reflects the national population trend. On the basis of mean winter air temperatures we divided the country into four thermal regions. Analyses of barbastelle abundance in hibernacula in the four regions revealed a 4.8% annual mean increase in numbers in the coldest region, where mean winter temperatures were below -2°C, annual mean declines of 3.3% and 3.1% in two warmer regions of western Poland, but no trend in the region of intermediate mean winter temperatures of between -1°C and -2°C. Overall, there was a significant, but weak, negative correlation between the abundance of hibernating individuals and the mean winter temperature. On the other hand, the number of individuals hibernating in small bunkers increased, even though the site was located in one of the warm regions. The results indicate a warming climate will likely reduce the use of large, well-insulated winter roosts by species that prefer colder conditions–and that this is already happening. For forest-dwelling bats, such as the barbastelle, for which monitoring schemes are primarily based on winter surveys of large hibernacula, estimations of population trends may consequently become less reliable. © 2020 Gottfried et al.

Despite compelling evidence indicating that mixed-species plantations can provide many economic, environmental and social benefits, whether they can also enhance regional stress responses to drought remains unclear. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted based on 457 field observations to assess the effects of different planting patterns on the soil moisture of 500 cm on the Loess Plateau. The results showed that both monoculture and mixed-species plantations consumed significant soil moisture content. However, compared with monoculture plantations, mixed-species plantations were better able to maintain the soil moisture at 0–400 cm. Soil moisture content varied by topography, climate, vegetation species and planting age. We observed that afforestation was a good choice for areas with the high precipitation (>500 mm), the middle elevation (1200–1600 m) and slope (20–30°). Furthermore, the arbors mixed with shrubs did not significantly consume the soil moisture content and was more sensitive to the change in planting ages. In addition, the response sizes of soil moisture among different vegetation species were negatively correlated with the initial soil moisture content. We therefor concluded that mixed-species plantations, especially arbors mixed with shrubs were conducive to enhancing drought resistance in arid and semiarid regions. In considering future afforestation activities, planners need to be aware that different environments support different vegetation species and patterns. This study provides a reference and guidance for the scientific planning and sustainable development of forest ecosystem in arid and semiarid regions. © 2019","Mixed-species plantations; Soil moisture; The Loess Plateau; Water stress","Arid regions; Drought; Ecosystems; Landforms; Moisture determination; Planning; Reforestation; Sediments; Sustainable development; Topography; Vegetation; Afforestation activity; Arid and semi-arid regions; Environmental change; Initial soil moisture; Loess Plateau; Mixed species; Monoculture plantations; Water stress; Soil moisture; afforestation; drought resistance; forest ecosystem; meta-analysis; moisture content; monoculture; plantation; soil moisture; sustainable development; water stress; Drought; Ecosystems; Planning; Reforestation; Sediments; Topography; China; Loess Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076259433

Water and nutrient limitations can impair photosynthesis through the reduction of RuBisCO and increment of photorespiration, disturbing the plant carbon balance. In this context, we conducted a controlled experiment with the epiphytic C3-CAM bromeliad Guzmania monostachia to investigate how the combined water and nutritional deficits affect the activity of RuBisCO and its activation state (RAS), and to evaluate the efficiency of photosynthesis during the transition from C3 to CAM. Apart from an increase in CAM activity, bromeliads submitted to both water and nutritional deficits showed higher RAS values and unaltered RuBisCO activity compared to C3 bromeliads and, surprisingly, the maximum quantum efficiency of photosynthesis increased. Glucose, fructose and starch levels were maintained, while sucrose concentrations increased over time. These results, combined with the high RAS values, suggest an increased efficiency of RuBisCO functioning. Our results reinforce the ability of epiphytic bromeliads to deal with stressful habitats by a higher efficiency of RuBisCO during the transition to CAM, another feature that may allow their evolution in the epiphytic environment. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","CAM pathway; Guzmania; Photosynthesis; PSII; RuBisCO; RuBisCO activation state; Water and nutritional deficits","ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; water; Bromeliaceae; enzymology; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; Bromeliaceae; Photosynthesis; Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076540221

This region is considered as a poor water country in Europe with a semi-arid climate that also has a frequent occurrence of drought and limited water resources that are mainly dependent on rainfall. Cyprus is suffering from unevenly distributed rainfall and small catchments, where extreme drought events are suspected due to climate change. The water policy in Cyprus is based on two pillars: sustainable development of water resources and water demand management. Around 1970 changes in the rainfall pattern in addition to population growth led to critical situations in many aquifers, which deteriorated due to the intrusion of seawater intrusion into the aquifer. Hence, the estimation of water resource values and water consumption for the following decades is important to implement effective management plants. By collecting and analyzing 100 years of standardized precipitation index data the future expected precipitation probabilities of the island of Cyprus were estimated using Markov chains (MC) and MCFS analysis. For this purpose, the inter-state transition probability matrix of the system has been determined and long-term equilibrium vectors have been calculated to determine the stability of the system. This study shows that the use of the MCFS gives more sensitive results for the prediction of future precipitation than the classical MC model. © 2020 Desalination Publications.

Properly protected and promoted Antarctic blue carbon will form the world’s largest natural negative feedback on climate change. However, fulfilling this promise may be challenging, given the uniqueness of the region and the legal systems that govern it. In this interdisciplinary study, we explain: the global significance of Antarctic blue carbon to international carbon mitigation efforts; the urgent need for international legal protections for areas where it is emerging; and the hurdles that need to be overcome to realize those goals. In order to progress conservation efforts past political blockages we recommend the development of an inter-instrument governance framework that quantifies the sequestration value of Antarctic blue carbon for attribution to states’ climate mitigation commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Key policy insights Blue-carbon emergence around Antarctica’s coastlines will potentially store up to 160,000,000 tonnes of carbon annually. Blue-carbon will emerge in areas of rich biomass that will make it vulnerable to harvesting and other human activities; it is essential to incentivise conserving, rather than commercial exploitation of newly ice-free areas of the Southern Ocean. Antarctic blue carbon is a practical and prime candidate to build a cooperative, inter-instrument, non-market mitigation around; this should be considered at the ‘blue COP’ UN Climate change discussions in Spain. Allowing Antarctic fishing states to account for the carbon storage value of blue carbon zones through a non-market approach under the Paris Agreement could provide a vital incentive to their protection under the Antarctic Treaty System. The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research would be the ideal body to facilitate the necessary connections between the relevant climate and Antarctic governance regimes. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Antarctic Treaty System; Antarctica; Blue carbon; non market approach; Paris Agreement","Antarctic Treaty; carbon; carbon storage; environmental policy; environmental protection; governance approach; ice retreat; sea ice; United Nations; Antarctica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075727472

Conventional approaches to assess fish populations can be logistically challenging and cost-prohibitive. As a result, resource managers often make assumptions about the status of fish populations based on limited information. The watersheds of Washington’s San Juan Islands were considered too small to support wild salmonid populations. Many streams flow only seasonally, and all have been subjected to varying degrees of anthropogenic impacts affecting their ecological integrity. Nonetheless, we found that at least five watersheds in the archipelago support populations of coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki clarki). To better understand the conservation status of coastal cutthroat trout populations there, we genotyped approximately fifty trout in each of three watersheds: Cascade and Doe Bay creeks on Orcas Island and Garrison Creek on San Juan Island. Results suggest that two watersheds support native populations and one supports naturalized hatchery fish. The likely native coastal cutthroat trout diversity documented in the two watersheds contributes to the overall diversity of the species, demonstrates that species’ resiliency, and provides justification for conservation measures. Effective management and conservation planning in data-limited situations requires the use of a precautionary approach. Population genetics provide a useful tool for identifying vulnerable fish populations and understanding their relationships with other conspecific populations. This information can inform restoration goals and help identify and prioritize restoration and protection measures. © 2019, The Author(s).","Coastal cutthroat trout; Conservation genetics; Oncorhynchus clarki clarki; Precautionary principle","anthropogenic effect; cichlid; climate change; conservation genetics; conservation planning; conservation status; conspecific; environmental protection; native species; precautionary principle; prioritization; resource management; vulnerability; Orcas Island; San Juan Islands; United States; Washington [United States]; Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii; Salmonidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075344552

This method exploits the radio emission generated in the electromagnetic component of a particle shower following a neutrino interaction. NuRadioMC simulates everything from the neutrino interaction in a medium, the subsequent Askaryan radio emission, the propagation of the radio signal to the detector and finally the detector response. NuRadioMC is designed as a modern, modular Python-based framework, combining flexibility in detector design with user-friendliness. It includes a state-of-the-art event generator, an improved modelling of the radio emission, a revisited approach to signal propagation and increased flexibility and precision in the detector simulation. This paper focuses on the implemented physics processes and their implications for detector design. A variety of models and parameterizations for the radio emission of neutrino-induced showers are compared and reviewed.

The study carbonates pertain to the Inner Apulian Platform, and form a surface structural analogue of the fractured carbonate reservoirs currently exploited for hydrocarbon production in nearby areas of southern Italy. By combining traditional field stratigraphic and structural methods with photogrammetric analysis of a large portion of the aforementioned cliff, we assess the abutting and crosscutting relationships among the sub-seismic structural elements and different types of flooding surfaces. At smaller scale, bed interfaces extend laterally for a few tens-of-metres, bound tens-of-centimetres-thick beds characterized by amalgamation and bifurcation geometries, and form sequence boundaries of the 4th-5th order. At larger scale, transgressive surfaces extend laterally for hundreds-of-metres, include mm-thick terrigenous material, bound multiple metre-thick bed packages made up of multiple beds, and form sequence boundaries of the 3rd order. Field evidences are consistent with joints and sheared joints often forming stratabound and non-stratabound elements, respectively. At a reservoir scale, prominent transgressive surfaces are laterally continuous for kilometres, include up to a few centimetres-thick, clay-rich levels and collapsed breccia, bound tens-of-metres-thick bed package associations, and form sequence boundaries of the 2nd order. There, small faults with up to 10's of cm-offset mainly localize within individual bed package associations, whereas well-developed faults with up to a few m-offset crosscut multiple prominent transgressive surfaces. Results after DFN modelling of representative geo-cellular models highlight the control exerted by the study structural elements on the fluid accumulation and flow properties of the fractured carbonates.

Microbial biodiversity, particularly the local diversity of fungi, has been shown to promote multiple functions of the boreal forests of Northeastern China. However, this microbial biodiversity-multifunctionality relationship has yet to be explored in Northeastern Canada, where historical environment have shaped a different regional pool of microbial diversity. This study focuses on the relationship between the soil microbiome and ecosystem multifunctionality, as well as the influence of pH and redox potential (Eh) on the regulation of such relationship. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to explore the different causal relationships existing in the studied ecosystems. In a managed part of the Canadian boreal forest, 156 forest polygons were sampled to (1) estimate the α-and β-diversity of fungal and bacterial communities and (2) measure 12 ecosystem functions mainly related to soil nutrient storage and cycling. Both bacteria and fungi influenced ecosystem multifunctionality, but on their own respective functions. Bacterial β-diversity was the most important factor increasing primary productivity and soil microbial biomass, while reducing soil emitted atmospheric CO2. Environmental characteristics, particularly low levels of organic matter in soil, were shown to have the strongest positive impact on boreal ecosystem multifunctionality. Overall, our results were consistent with those obtained in Northeastern China; however, some differences need to be further explored especially considering the history of forest management in Northeastern Canada. © 2020 by the authors.

The goal of this research is to find the optimal disposal service price and level of environmental improvement to mitigate adverse impacts and maximize profits. The applicability of dual-channel service in the hazardous waste supply chain is also investigated. Our study shows that the supply chain obtains the highest profit if both the disposal facility and the contractor operate in a centralized model.

These high-density hydrate structures consist of individual CO2 molecules confined in cages of hydrogen-bonded water molecules. Solid-state storage of CO2 in shallow aquifers can improve the storage capacity greatly compared to supercritical CO2 stored at greater depths. Moreover, impermeable hydrate layers directly above a liquid CO2 plume will significantly retain unwanted migration of CO2 toward the seabed. Thus, a structural trap accompanied by hydrate layers in a zone of favorable kinetics are likely to mitigate the overall risk of CO2 leakage from the storage site. Geophysical monitoring of the CO2 storage site includes electrical resistivity measurements that relies on empirical data to obtain saturation values. We have estimated the saturation exponent in Archie's equation, n ≈ 2.1 (harmonic mean) for CO2 and brine saturated pore network, and for hydrate-bearing seal (SH &lt; 0.4), during the process of storing liquid CO2 in Bentheimer sandstone core samples.

If stored below the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ), unwanted vertical migration of CO2 can be effectively inhibited by the formation of solid hydrate layers. Lowering the risks of CO2 leakage to the atmosphere is instrumental to accelerate the implementation of full-scale carbon sequestration in the North Sea and elsewhere. In the laboratory, we have successfully visualized CO2 trapping phenomena, measured CO2 leakage rates, and demonstrated that the integrity of the hydrate seal strongly depends on fluid-rock interactions and initial water distribution. CO2 propagation in water-filled core samples has been monitored over a total of 140 days inside the GHSZ. Solid CO2 hydrate formed and sealed the pore space in both homogeneous sandstone and heterogeneous limestone cores. However, the physical flow barrier developed considerably faster in sandstone (after 1.8 pore volumes – PV) compared to limestone (after 7.4 PV), with a factor ten reduced CO2 leakage rate through the seal in favor of sandstone. Furthermore, pore-scale images of upward CO2 migration verified trapping of CO2 both as solid hydrate precipitation and as liquid CO2 clusters made discontinuous and stabilized by capillary forces.

Increasingly uncertain and scarce resources, together with an increasingly variable and changing climate, make conventional crop production vulnerable and unsustainable. We hypothesized that replacing traditional crop management with conservation agriculture based-sustainable intensification practices would reduce energy requirements and CO2-equivalent emissions while increasing energy use efficiency. Across three major cropping systems (rice-wheat, rice-maize and rice-lentil) we tested improved management practices against a conventional baseline on over 400 on-farm trials. Improved management practices significantly reduced the total energy used in rice-wheat cropping systems, from 30,045 MJ ha−1 under traditional baseline practice to around 26,500 MJ ha−1. Similar savings in total energy used were observed in rice-maize and rice-lentil cropping systems; additionally, energy use was significantly more efficient under improved management in all three cropping systems. CO2-equivalent emissions were reduced by around 10% under cropping systems with improved management compared to emissions from baseline systems. For all cropping systems the rice-equivalent yield and net income were inversely proportional to the specific energy of the system under improved management but not under traditional practice. This study demonstrated that high cropping system yields under improved management practices increased energy use efficiency while reducing CO2-equivalent emissions. Our research enables farmers in the Eastern Gangetic Plains to produce more food, more sustainably, under increasing climate variability and change. These results are applicable across the Eastern Gangetic Plains region of over 450 million people and also have broader application for smallholder cropping systems in developing and emerging-economy countries globally. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO2-Equivalent emissions; Conservation agriculture-based sustainable intensification; Cropping systems; Energy use efficiency; Participatory trials","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Crops; Cultivation; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Grain (agricultural product); Greenhouse gases; Climate variability and change; Conservation agricultures; Cropping systems; Energy-use efficiency; Major cropping systems; Management practices; Participatory trials; Rice-wheat cropping systems; Energy management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074489887

Ni, a thermally active metal for the methanation of CO2, was coupled with Ag, a metal that exhibits a surface plasmon resonance effect in the visible light region, with the intention of exploiting the catalytic CO2 conversion by Ni and light enhancement from Ag. The catalytic metals were loaded onto an insulating silica support and exposed to 405 nm laser light during the reaction. The impact of the Ni-Ag bimetallic interaction intimacy on the influence of the light illumination on CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity was examined. Sequentially impregnating Ni and Ag (regardless of the order) provided a stronger bimetallic interaction relative to the coimpregnation procedure. The coimpregnated sample, with the weakest metallic interaction, exhibited the highest CH4 productivity in the dark, while irradiating the catalyst at 405 nm had minimal impact on its performance. The poor photoeffect was attributed to the lack of interaction between Ni and Ag in conjunction with the low catalytic activity of Ag. The sequentially impregnated samples, which facilitated a stronger bimetallic interaction, exhibited an increase in CO2 conversion when illuminated, with the greatest improvement produced when Ni was loaded first. The increase in CO2 conversion under laser irradiation was attributed to the contribution of the Ag photoresponse. Comparing the three bimetallic catalysts clearly revealed that Ni-Ag/SiO2 with the strongest bimetallic interaction delivered the highest photoenhancement in terms of both CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity.

Fuel sales in the Metropolitan Area and CO emissions from reanalysis showed a significant decrease during the fuel shortage of 7% and 6%, respectively. This study analyses the air quality and meteorological conditions during this period to evaluate whether these measures indirectly affected air quality in Mexico City. During the shortage, mean-ambient concentrations of nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) were significantly lower than normal whereas levels of particulate matter (PM) were only modestly lower than usual. Daily-mean NO and CO had record-low anomalies of −10 ppb and −0.5 ppm from typical days, respectively. In contrast, ozone mean-levels were not significantly different than average. The percentage of days with PM mean concentrations above the World Health Organisation guidelines (5 and 19% for particles smaller than 2.5 and 10 μm, respectively) and the percentage of ozone 8-h rolling means above Mexican law (0.5%) were record lows. Meteorological factors, such as wind speed or the mixed-layer height were not significantly different than average. The anomalously low pollution levels were accentuated when each day was compared to days of similar flow patterns. This episode of better than usual air quality showcases how strategies addressing transport emissions could control air quality in Mexico City and highlights that improving ozone mean levels require comprehensive strategies that reduce emissions from all sectors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Meteorological forcing; Ozone; Primary pollutants; Transport emissions","Air pollution; Air quality; Carbon monoxide; Fuels; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Ozone layer; Wind; Ambient concentrations; Mean concentrations; Meteorological condition; Meteorological factors; Meteorological forcing; Particulate Matter; Primary pollutants; Transport emissions; Quality control; carbon monoxide; fuel; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; concentration (composition); meteorology; metropolitan area; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; particulate matter; spatiotemporal analysis; traffic emission; World Health Organization; aerosol; air quality; air quality control; Article; chemical interaction; controlled study; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; meteorology; Mexico City; particulate matter; practice guideline; priority journal; surface property; wind speed; World Health Organization; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075891042

In underground mines, the use of diesel-powered machinery has been increased in the past decades. The combustion of diesel fuel produces a great quantity of pollutants (i.e. gas emissions, particulate matter, etc.). Thus, a constant ventilation is required to satisfy the regulations on health and safety of miners. One of the innovative transformations that underground mining processes have adopted is the use of electrical Load Haul Dumps (LHDs) to reduce the in-mine emissions and the ventilation burden and to improve in-mine working conditions, among other benefits. Electric mobile LHDs could be further improved by replacing battery-based energy supplies with hydrogen fuel cells. The present work focuses on the techno-economic assessment of modifying electrical LHDs by incorporating different processes and equipment (i.e. fuel cell stacks, storage tanks, DC/DC converters). The base case considers the modification of the whole mining fleet of diesel-based LHDs. As a result, a positive Net Present Value (for the project time span under consideration) and a payback period of 7.78 years were observed. The sensitivity analysis showed that considerable modifications of the current states of diesel price are required so that modifications are not feasible (diesel prices of 0.53 €/l). A tight electricity cost of 70 €/MWh was obtained as a breaking point (considerably safe for several industrial conditions). © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Fuel cell range extender; Hydrogen; Hydrogen refuelling station; Underground mining machinery; Viability analysis","Accident prevention; DC-DC converters; Diesel engines; Environmental regulations; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Hydrogen; Industrial economics; Investments; Mining machinery; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Economic considerations; Environmental conditions; Hydrogen refuelling stations; Industrial conditions; Range extenders; Techno-economic assessment; Underground mining; Viability analysis; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071081944

The results show that three types of in situ stress regime exist and are converted corresponding to a certain depth, (1) &lt;600 m is the strike-slip fault regime (σH &gt; σv &gt; σh); (2) 600-1050 m is the stress transition zone (σH ≈ σv &gt; σh); and (3) &gt;1050 m is the normal fault regime (σv &gt; σH&gt;σh). Regionally, with depths &lt; 1050 m, stress regime also changes from west to east, that is, σH &gt; σv &gt; σh type in the western Miquan, σH ≈ σv &gt; σh type in the middle Fukang, and σv &gt; σH &gt; σh type in the eastern Jimushaer, respectively. Controlled by stress regime and vertical belting, coal K shows a trend of “remarkably decreased, rebounded increase and greatly decreased,” and two decreasing stages (&lt;600 m and &gt; 1050 m) are mainly influenced by horizontal stress and vertical stress, respectively. Taking a burial depth of 1000-1150 m as a boundary, the relationship between G and depth converts from “continually increasing” to “gradually decreasing,” which is in good agreement with the converted interface of stress regime from σH ≈ σv &gt; σh type to σv &gt; σH &gt; σh type. Taking the converted interfaces of G (1000-1150 m), K (800 m), and the prediction depth of the weathered zone (400 m) into consideration, CBM development potential in the study area can be divided into three grades, that is, (1) 400-800 m (high K and medium G), (2) 800-1150 m in Miquan and 800-1000 m in Fukang (medium K and high G), and (3) &gt;1150 m in Miquan and &gt;1000 m in Fukang (low K and poor G). Overall, a key CBM development breakthrough will most likely be made in the study area within the scope of 600-800 m due to the better G and higher K. © 2019 The Authors.

In this work, during all seasons, we sampled atmospheric particulate matter (PM10) and leaves of southern magnolia Magnolia grandiflora and deodar cedar Cedrus deodara, two evergreen plant species widespread in the urban area of Milan where the study was carried out. We then quantified Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) both in PM10 and on leaves and used sequencing of 16S rRNA gene, shotgun metagenomics and qPCR analyses to investigate the microbial communities hosted by the sampled leaves. Taxonomic and functional profiles of epiphytic bacterial communities differed between host plant species and seasons and the microbial communities on leaves harboured genes involved in the degradation of hydrocarbons. Evidence collected in this work also suggested that the abundance of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms on evergreen leaves increased with the concentration of hydrocarbons when atmospheric pollutants were deposited at high concentration on leaves, and that the biodegradation on the phyllosphere can contribute to the removal of PAHs from the urban air. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Evergreen plants; Naphthalene dioxygenase; PAHs; Phyllosphere; PM10","Air pollution control; Biodegradation; Genes; Microorganisms; Naphthalene; Plants (botany); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Polymerase chain reaction; RNA; Atmospheric particulate matter; Atmospheric pollutants; Evergreen plants; Microbial communities; Naphthalene dioxygenase; Phyllospheres; PM10; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Air pollution; hydrocarbon; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; RNA 16S; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; adsorption; atmospheric pollution; bacterium; biodegradation; enzyme; evergreen tree; microbial community; PAH; particulate matter; phyllosphere; pollutant removal; urban area; air pollutant; amplicon; Article; biodegradation; Cedrus; Cedrus deodara; evergreen; Italy; Magnolia; Magnolia grandiflora; metagenome; metagenomics; microbial community; nonhuman; particulate matter; plant leaf; plant microorganism interaction; real time polymerase chain reaction; season; seasonal variation; urban area; adsorption; air pollutant; bacterium; bioremediation; chemistry; city; classification; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; Italy; Lombardy; Milan [Milano]; Milano [Lombardy]; Bacteria (microorganisms); Cedrus deodara; Magnolia grandiflora; Adsorption; Air Pollutants; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Cedrus; Cities; Italy; Magnolia; Microbiota; Particulate Matter; Plant Leaves; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072702922

Transcription Factor Activator Protein 2γ (TFAP2C, AP-2γ) governs luminal breast cancer phenotype through direct and indirect regulation of ERα and ERα-associated genes, GATA3, FOXA1, EGFR, CDH1, DSP, KRT7, FBP1, MYB, RET, KRT8, MUC1, and ERBB2—genes which are responsible for the luminal signature in breast cancer. Herein, utilizing chromatin immunoprecipitation and direct sequencing (ChIP-seq), we show that CA12 is regulated by AP-2γ through binding with its promoter region in luminal breast cancer cell lines and indirectly through a distal estrogen-responsive region in ERα-positive cell lines by upregulation of ERα. CA12 is transcriptionally silenced in basal breast cancer cell lines through histone deacetylation and CpG methylation of the promoter region and can be re-activated with Trichostatin A (histone deacetylase inhibitor) and/or 5-aza-dC (an inhibitor of DNA methylation). Strong concordance in co-expression of CA12 and ESR1 (R2 = 0.1128, p = 0486) and TFAP2C (R2 = 0.1823, p = 0.0105) was found using a panel of primary breast tumor samples (n = 35), supporting a synergetic role of AP-2γ and ERα in activation of CA12. Our results highlight the essential role of AP-2γ in maintaining the luminal breast cancer phenotype and provide evidence that epigenetic mechanisms silence luminal gene expression in the basal phenotype. Additional studies to decipher mechanisms that drive epigenetic silencing of AP-2γ target genes are a critical area for further research. © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",,"carbonate dehydratase XII; decitabine; estrogen receptor alpha; histone; transcription factor activator protein 2 gamma; transcription factor AP 2; trichostatin A; unclassified drug; CA9 protein, human; carbonate dehydratase IX; estrogen receptor alpha; estrogen receptor alpha, human; TFAP2C protein, human; transcription factor AP 2; tumor antigen; tumor marker; Article; breast cancer; breast cancer cell line; CA12 gene; cancer tissue; chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; CpG island; deacetylation; disease association; DNA methylation; epigenetics; ESR1 gene; estrogen responsive element; gene; gene activation; gene control; gene expression; gene silencing; gene targeting; genetic association; genetic transcription; human; human cell; human tissue; phenotype; priority journal; promoter region; protein binding; protein function; sequence analysis; TFAP2C gene; upregulation; apoptosis; breast tumor; cell proliferation; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; pathology; prognosis; tumor cell culture; Antigens, Neoplasm; Apoptosis; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Carbonic Anhydrase IX; Cell Proliferation; DNA Methylation; Estrogen Receptor alpha; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Prognosis; Transcription Factor AP-2; Tumor Cells, Cultured",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074598649

Nighttime samples were collected with a time resolution of 12 h between 19:00–07:00. Samples were collected for three weeks during the winter and one week during the spring, summer, and fall. The daily PM2.5 concentrations exceeded the standard of 35 μg m−3 29% of the time. Air quality was classified as fair (PM2.5&gt;26.4 μg m−3) and unhealthy (PM2.5&gt;39.9 μg m−3) 43% and 20% of the days, respectively. The annual average OC and EC were 11.3 ± 4.91 and 4.1 ± 1.16 μg m−3, respectively. Organic carbon showed strong seasonal variation with high concentrations during the heating season and low concentrations during the summer. Elemental carbon did not show strong seasonality due to the continuous influence of heavy traffic. Diurnal variations of OC and EC were characterized by high concentrations during the morning and evening rush hours, and low concentrations in the middle of the day due to the dilution effect of an increased mixing layer. Formation of secondary organic carbon was uncertain during the summer due to dilution and low primary organic carbon emissions. Concentrations heavily depended on surface wind speed. Average OC concentrations were 56–72% higher at wind speeds lower than 2 m s−1 compared to that at wind speeds higher than 3 m s−1 during fall and winter. Higher EC concentrations (15–56%) were observed at wind speeds higher than 3 m s−1, showing that in addition to traffic emissions, EC was transported from nearby areas.

Production pathways based on the reuse of CO2 will achieve ultimate sustainability. Furthermore, the costs of renewable electricity production are decreasing at such a high rate, that electricity is expected to be the main energy carrier from 2040 onward. Electricity-driven novel processes that convert CO2 into chemicals need to be further developed. Microbial electrosynthesis is a biocathode-driven process in which electroactive microorganisms derive electrons from solid-state electrodes to catalyze the reduction of CO2 or organics and generate valuable extracellular multicarbon reduced products. Microorganisms can be tuned to high-rate and selective product formation. Optimization and upscaling of microbial electrosynthesis to practical, real life applications is dependent upon performance improvement while maintaining low cost. Extensive biofilm development, enhanced electron transfer rate from solid-state electrodes to microorganisms and increased chemical production rate require optimized microbial consortia, efficient reactor designs, and improved cathode materials.This Account is about the development of different electrode materials purposely designed for improved microbial electrosynthesis: NanoWeb-RVC and EPD-3D. Both types of electrodes are biocompatible, highly conductive three-dimensional hierarchical porous structures. Both chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and electrophoretic deposition were used to grow homogeneous and uniform carbon nanotube layers on the honeycomb structure of reticulated vitreous carbon. The high surface area to volume ratio of these electrodes maximizes the available surface area for biofilm development, i.e., enabling an increased catalyst loading. Simultaneously, the nanostructure makes it possible for a continuous electroactive biofilm to be formed, with increased electron transfer rate and high Coulombic efficiencies. Fully autotrophic biofilms from mixed cultures developed on both types of electrodes rely on CO2 as the sole carbon source and the solid-state electrode as the unique energy supply.We present first the synthesis and characteristics of the bare electrodes. We then report the outstanding performance indicators of these novel biocathodes: current densities up to -200 A m-2 and acetate production rates up to 1330 g m-2 day-1, with electron and CO2 recoveries into acetate being very close to 100% for mature biofilms. The performance indicators are still among the highest reported by either purposely designed or commercially available biocathodes. Finally, we made use of the titration and off-gas analysis sensor (TOGA) to elucidate the electron transfer mechanism in these efficient biocathodes. Planktonic cells in the catholyte were found irrelevant for acetate production. We identified the electron transfer to be mediated by biologically induced H2. H2 is not detected in the headspace of the reactors, unless CO2 feeding is interrupted or the cathodes sterilized. Thus, the biofilm is extremely efficient in consuming the generated H2. Finally, we successfully demonstrated the use of a synthetic biogas mixture as a CO2 source. We thus proved the potential of microbial electrosynthesis for the simultaneous upgrading of biogas, while fixating CO2 via the production of acetate.

This method was developed to determine the kinetics and balance of nitrogen transformation during anaerobic digestion with high inoculum-to-substrate ratio while avoiding instabilities with nutrients addition. Inoculum was washed to reduce ammonium content and carbonates were added to adjust buffer capacity. Results show that kinetics of nitrogen mineralisation depends mainly on initial substrate. Nitrogen was quickly transformed before stabilisation (from 2 to 8 days). Four types of nitrogen transformation were identified: (a) rapid mineralisation (transformation of organic nitrogen (Norg) into ammonium) for blood, (b) moderate mineralisation, for sludge, green waste and food waste, (c) limited protein hydrolysis (no transformation of nitrogen forms) for slurry and manure and, (d) immobilisation of nitrogen (transformation of ammonium into Norg (biomass growth)) for fruits, straw and greases. Biological nitrogen potential (BNP) ranged from − 7.1 to 22.8 gN kgWW−1 and showed a good correlation (R2 = 0.80) with Norg from substrates. On co-digestion tests, no significant inhibitions of mineralisation nor synergies between substrates were assessed allowing to calculate BNP value of the mix as the weighting average of the BNP values of each added substrate. Examples of calculation of nitrogen form on digestate show that do not use BNP may induce to under or overestimations of the final NH4 + content. A comparison of this methodology with an already published methodology shows an excellent correlation but a systematic difference of 7.2 gN kgWW−1, which seems to be explained by a better capacity of the methodology developed in this study to describe immobilisation phenomena. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Digestate; Kinetics; Mineralisation potential; Nitrogen immobilisation; Organic fertilisation","Enzyme kinetics; Fertilizers; Kinetics; Mineralogy; Nitrogen; Substrates; Digestate; Fertilisation; Immobilisation; Inoculum to substrate ratios; Mineralisation; Nitrogen mineralisation; Nitrogen transformations; Protein hydrolysis; Anaerobic digestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074507839

Cover crops (CCs) adoption is promoted in NT systems because CCs growth curbs nitrate losses via leaching. However, incorporating CC residues into the soil may have positive or negative effects on N2O emissions depending on CC species and agro-ecosystem management. A better understanding of how tillage practices and CC species affect N2O emissions is therefore needed for the development of productive agroecosystems that contribute to climate change mitigation. The objectives of this three-year (2015–2017) field experiment on a Udertic Haplustalf soil in the Po Valley were to compare N2O emissions and crop yield of soybean under NT and CT, and to examine how contrasting residues from two CCs (rye, Secale cereale L. vs hairy vetch, Vicia villosa Roth) affect N2O emissions in NT soybean and maize. We hypothesized that N2O emissions would be lower with NT than with CT and with rye residues than with vetch ones. Nitrous oxide was continuously sampled using automatic chambers during three periods (emergence, N-fixation and maturity) over the soybean-cropping season in 2015 and during the entire cropping maize season in 2017. The DNDC model was calibrated (2015 data) and validated (2017 data), and then used to estimate the annual cumulative N2O emissions in different treatments. Overall, N2O emissions in NT were 40–55% lower than in CT, for both in situ measurements (Period I) and modelled estimations. These differences could be ascribed to the higher water-filled pore space (WFPS) and soil nitrate availability in CT than in NT. No-till also increased SOC content (28%; 0–5 cm) and earthworm abundance (5 times) compared with CT. Within NT systems, N2O emissions were 20–36% lower with rye CC than with vetch CC (P &lt; 0.05), which was a consequence of the lower availability of soil mineral N under rye than under vetch due to the high C/N ratio of rye residues.

NOx, soot, combustion noise and heat release rate data, pertaining to the two injector types, have been compared, based on a pilot-main injection calibration. The performance of the solenoid injectors resulted to be in line with that of the direct acting piezoelectric injectors. Digital and continuous rate-shaping strategies have then been investigated at a hydraulic rig in solenoid injectors. The cycle-to-cycle dispersion in the injected mass increases significantly in the closely-coupled injection regime, where the overall injected quantity raises up as the dwell time progressively reduces. However, as the dwell time is diminished to values well within the injection fusion zone, the cycle-to-cycle dispersion of the injected mass again improves and this confirms that is possible to implement effective continuous injection rate-shaping schedules also for the solenoid injectors. A previously developed one-dimensional model of a solenoid fuel injection system has been applied to perform parametric analyses on the solenoid injector setup: mechanical, electromagnetic and hydraulic parameters have been changed in order to investigate their effect on the closely-coupled injections. The objective is to provide design keys for realizing more efficient injection rate-shaping schedules in order to improve engine emissions, fuel consumption and combustion noise. Finally, the performance of two production solenoid injectors, which feature a different internal layout, has been compared in the short dwell time range and the experimental results have been successfully interpreted on the basis of the injector parametric analyses. © 2019","Closely-coupled injections; Common rail injection system; Diesel engine; Experimental emission and noise data; Injection rate-shaping strategies; One-dimensional modeling","Acoustic noise; Automobile engines; Combustion; Diesel engines; Passenger cars; Piezoelectricity; Solenoids; Vehicle performance; Common rail injection system; Continuous injections; Fuel injection systems; Heat Release Rate (HRR); Hydraulic parameters; Injection rates; Noise data; One-dimensional model; Direct injection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077758022

Currently, human-driven land use changes have substantial effects on landscape changes over a range of temporal and spatial scales. In this context, the Sorocaba River basin, São Paulo State, Brazil, is an ideal study area to assess human influence on the present denudation rates of the Paulista Peripheral Depression (PPD). Twelve fluvial water sample collections were carried out at the Sorocaba River mouth, covering one complete hydrological cycle (Jun/2009 to Jun/2010). In the same period, 46 rainfall events were sampled. All samples were analyzed for dissolved cations, anions and silica, and total dissolved solids (TDS). Total suspended solids (TSS) were measured only in fluvial samples. The export of TDS and TSS occurs mostly during the wet season, accounting for ca. 60% and 87% of the total dissolved solids and total suspended sediment transported in the hydrological cycle studied (2009/2010), respectively. The total annual specific flux of TSS was 74.27 t/km2/year (including soil erosion by agricultural activities), with a small portion being derived from the anthropogenic contributions (ca. 2%). The total annual specific flux of TDS (74.43 t/km2/year) was similar to the TSS, but after the correction of the atmospheric inputs and anthropogenic contributions (ca. 18 and 29%, respectively), this value decreased to 39.35 t/km2/year. The chemical weathering rate was 7.1 m/Myear and this process tended towards monosialitization (RE = 2.6), with an atmospheric/soil CO2 consumption rate of 3.3 × 105 mol/km2/year. The difference between the chemical weathering and soil removal rates (7.1 and 49.6 m/Myear, respectively) indicated that the soil thickness reduction occured in the Sorocaba River basin. The climatic control on chemical weathering and soil removal rates was clearly evidenced, with the highest values of denudation occurring in the wet and hot climatic conditions. However, the chemical weathering processes (RE index) was not sensitive to climatic controls. In order to assess human influence on chemical weathering and soil removal rates in the PPD, the results were compared with other works undertaken in this vast geomorphological province. Even considering the uncertainties associated with a number of data points, the chemical weathering and soil removal rates in the PPD observed in this study were approximately 4 and 7.5-fold higher than these natural denudation rates, respectively, evidencing the effect of recent land use changes on the present denudation rates in the PPD. Thus, this study reinforces the complexity of the human-landscape systems in São Paulo State and increases the values of long-term landscape evolution rates. © 2019","Brazil; Human-landscape system; Landscape evolution; Water-rock interactions","anthropogenic effect; chemical weathering; denudation; hydrological cycle; land use change; landscape evolution; soil erosion; water-rock interaction; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Sorocaba Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074881420

In contrast to single-halide perovskites, we find high luminescence yields for photoexcited carrier densities far below solar illumination conditions. Using time-resolved spectroscopy we show that the charge carrier recombination regime changes from second to first order within the first tens of nanoseconds after excitation.

Deposition from the atmosphere, especially through precipitation, is an important source of Se to soils. However, very little is known about the atmospheric cycling of Se. It has therefore been difficult to predict how far Se travels in the atmosphere and where it deposits. To answer these questions, we have built the first global atmospheric Se model by implementing Se chemistry in an aerosol-chemistry-climate model, SOCOL-AER (modeling tools for studies of SOlar Climate Ozone Links-aerosol). In the model, we include information from the literature about the emissions, speciation, and chemical transformation of atmospheric Se. Natural processes and anthropogenic activities emit volatile Se compounds, which oxidize quickly and partition to the particulate phase. Our model tracks the transport and deposition of Se in seven gas-phase species and 41 aerosol tracers. However, there are large uncertainties associated with many of the model's input parameters. In order to identify which model uncertainties are the most important for understanding the atmospheric Se cycle, we conducted a global sensitivity analysis with 34 input parameters related to Se chemistry, Se emissions, and the interaction of Se with aerosols. In the first bottom-up estimate of its kind, we have calculated a median global atmospheric lifetime of 4.4 d (days), ranging from 2.9 to 6.4 d (2nd-98th percentile range) given the uncertainties of the input parameters. The uncertainty in the Se lifetime is mainly driven by the uncertainty in the carbonyl selenide (OCSe) oxidation rate and the lack of tropospheric aerosol species other than sulfate aerosols in SOCOL-AER. In contrast to uncertainties in Se lifetime, the uncertainty in deposition flux maps are governed by Se emission factors, with all four Se sources (volcanic, marine biosphere, terrestrial biosphere, and anthropogenic emissions) contributing equally to the uncertainty in deposition over agricultural areas. We evaluated the simulated Se wet deposition fluxes from SOCOL-AER with a compiled database of rainwater Se measurements, since wet deposition contributes around 80 % of total Se deposition. Despite difficulties in comparing a global, coarse-resolution model with local measurements from a range of time periods, past Se wet deposition measurements are within the range of the model's 2nd-98th percentiles at 79 % of background sites. This agreement validates the application of the SOCOL-AER model to identifying regions which are at risk of low atmospheric Se inputs. In order to constrain the uncertainty in Se deposition fluxes over agricultural soils, we should prioritize field campaigns measuring Se emissions, rather than laboratory measurements of Se rate constants. © 2020 Author(s).",,"aerosol; agricultural soil; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric dynamics; mapping; selenium; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty analysis; wet deposition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079430926

This review examined the current ecological status, degradation causes, and impacts of the various grassland degradation mitigation measures employed and their eects on grassland health and growth in the QTP. Our findings revealed that QTP grasslands are continually being degraded as a result of complex biotic and abiotic drivers and processes. The biotic and abiotic actions have resulted in soil erosion, plant biomass loss, soil organic carbon loss, a reduction in grazing and carrying capacity, the emergence of pioneer plant species, loss of soil nutrients, and an increase in soil pH. A combination of factors such as overgrazing, land-use changes, invasive species encroachment, mining activities, rodent burrowing activities, road and dam constructions, tourism, migration, urbanization, and climate change have caused the degradation of grasslands on the QTP. A conceptual framework on the way forward in tackling grassland degradation on the QTP is presented together with other appropriate measures needed to amicably combat grassland degradation on the QTP. It is recommended that a comprehensive and detailed survey be carried out across the QTP to determine the percentage of degraded grasslands and hence, support a sound policy intervention. © 2020 by the author.","Abiotic; Biodiversity; Biotic; China; Climate change; Degradation; Grassland; Grazing; Soil","biodiversity; climate change; environmental factor; grassland; land degradation; land use change; soil nutrient; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Rodentia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081213521

In situ X-ray diffraction experiments revealed that cobalt was maintained as CoO under a reaction environment when initial Co3O4 particles on SiO2 were below 8.4 nm. The large metallic Co particles can keep a stable size and phase state, indicating almost unchanged catalytic activity and methane selectivity. In contrast, small metallic Co or CoO particles show a gradual increase in methane selectivity with time on stream. Stable large metallic Co particles can be explained as the dominant surface high-coordinated Co atoms having a weak binding ability for H2O molecules, which are more difficult to be oxidized into CoO. It is believed that CoO rather than metallic Co atoms could interact with Si-OH groups to form inactive cobalt silicate (Co2SiO4), which leads to a higher methane selectivity and drives a decrease in the particle size during the FTS reaction. ZrO2 as a structural promoter highly dispersed on SiO2 was found to give a milder increase in methane selectivity due to fewer chances of Si-OH interacting with CoO species. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with CO temperature-programmed desorption (CO-TPD), NH3-TPD, CO2-TPD, and Py-IR demonstrate that Co/ZrO2 interfacial sites play a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity as the electron accumulation in the interface region not only increases the CO adsorption amount but also promotes the CO dissociation on cobalt sites. At the same time, a higher surface C*/H concentration benefits a lower methane selectivity. ZrO2, which acts as a Lewis acid, can adsorb CO molecules abundantly but weakly by the interaction between Zr4+ cations and O atoms in CO. Especially, for the 15Co(C)/Q15 catalyst with initial CoO particles on SiO2, methane selectivity rapidly increases at an early reaction stage, which originates from easier accessible CoO reacting with Si-OH groups. In addition, both 15Co(C)/Q15 and 15Co(C)/10Zr(I)-Q15 catalysts show the dominant CoO phase, which is active in the FTS reaction. Indeed, the DFT calculations demonstrate that CO activation on the CoO(200) surface via the H-assisted CH2O dissociation pathway exhibits a lower activation energy of 1.21 eV compared to that on the face-centered cubic (fcc) Co(111) surface with an activation energy of 1.42 eV, despite that direct CO dissociation, CHO dissociation, and CHOH dissociation on CoO(200) show higher activation energies.

WELS is a national, government-run scheme that mandates water efficiency labelling for indoor water-using fixtures and appliances. The scheme also imposes a minimum standard for some products. The evaluation considered the environmental and economic impacts of improvements in the water efficiency of WELS-labelled products since the scheme’s inception in 2006 and forecast for 20 years. The study estimated water, energy, greenhouse gas (GHG) and utility bill savings as well as the costs associated with the scheme. The evaluation showed WELS to be an important component of urban water management in Australia, saving 112 GL in 2017–18, across the country, and 231 GL/year by 2036–37. The largest economic benefits of WELS came from the energy saving from reduced water heating. Over 30 years, these energy savings are also expected to reduce GHG emissions by a cumulative 53.5 Mt. On average, Australians saved $A42 (US$30) per person per year in 2017–18 due to the water efficiency driven by WELS. Overall, the evaluation shows the WELS scheme to be highly beneficial for Australia with significant net benefits to the present and projected into the future.

Here, the facile transformation of residual Ni particle catalysts in carbon nanotubes into thermally stable single Ni atoms with a possible NiN3 moiety is reported, surrounded with a porous N-doped carbon sheath through a one-step nanoconfined pyrolysis strategy. These structural changes are confirmed by X-ray absorption fine structure analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The dispersed Ni single atoms facilitate highly efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction at low overpotentials to yield CO, providing a CO faradaic efficiency exceeding 90%, turnover frequency approaching 12 000 h−1, and metal mass activity reaching about 10 600 mA mg−1, outperforming current state-of-the-art single atom catalysts for CO2 reduction to CO. DFT calculations suggest that the Ni@N3 (pyrrolic) site favors *COOH formation with lower free energy than Ni@N4, in addition to exothermic CO desorption, hence enhancing electrocatalytic CO2 conversion. This finding provides a simple, scalable, and promising route for the preparation of low-cost, abundant, and highly active single atom catalysts, benefiting future practical CO2 electrolysis. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

As the characteristics of flame propagation determine the control authority of ignition timing, it is important and necessary to investigate pressure dependence of flame speed in the lean-premixed mixture relative to engine operating conditions. Experimental study in an optical rapid compression machine (RCM) and simulation work were carried out using two fuels comprising n-heptane/iso-octane/ethanol with varied octane sensitivity (S). The effective pressure ranged from 10 to 35 bar, temperature from 715 to 860 K, and equivalence ratios between 0.3 and 0.7 to cover the region of lean flammability limits of low and high S fuels with ethanol blended. Based on pressure profiles, flame speed extracted from images, and sensitivity analysis of flame speed, the dependence of flame speed on the effective pressure in low and high S fuels was discovered and the fundamental mechanism behind this phenomena became to be understood in the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) and non-NTC regions, respectively. In the studied temperature conditions, the flame speed of high S fuel has stronger dependence on the pressure than that of low S fuel does. In the NTC region, this phenomenon is attributed to the dependence of H radical concentration on pressure in the unburned mixture and flame structure. In the non-NTC region, promoting effect of dominant reactions varied with pressure can significantly influence pressure dependence of flame speed. Although quite limited data of laminar burning velocity for studied fuels were obtained in high pressures (>15 bar), the trend of flame speed's dependence on pressure was well predicted by two models with different but well-accepted core mechanisms, showing consistent results with the experimental ones in the RCM. © 2019","Ethanol blending; Laminar burning velocity; Octane sensitivity; Pressure dependence; Rapid compression machine; Sensitivity analysis","Engines; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Flammability; Heptane; Ignition; Mixtures; Speed; Temperature; Engine operating conditions; Fundamental mechanisms; Homogeneous charge compression ignition; Laminar burning velocity; Lean flammability limits; Octane sensitivity; Pressure dependence; Rapid compression machine; Sensitivity analysis; alcohol; fuel; gasoline; heptane; octane; Article; chemical reaction kinetics; combustion; compression; concentration process; flame; flammability; machine; optics; pressure gradient; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; temperature; thermodynamics; velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074878275

It is also a way to valorize carbon dioxide and reduce CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. At the heart of the process, the methanation reaction has to achieve high-performance conversion in a completely dynamic mode of operation. This mode of operation—linked to the fluctuations of available power on the grid, and the possible thermal runaway of the reactor due to the exothermic nature of the methanation reaction—means that special care is needed in the design of the reactor as well as its control. The reactor, which might be catalytic fixed-bed, should also restart quickly after an idle period. Start-up requires the reactor temperature to be sufficiently high to ignite the reaction. In this paper, the intermittent operation of a fixed-bed methanation reactor is studied. A mathematical model is developed in order to simulate successive gas shutdowns and reinjections. It is examined as well if the reactor is able to restart spontaneously (i.e. with no external heating, but utilizing thermal inertia and the exothermicity of the reaction), when reactants are reinjected after an idle phase. A relation is found between the respective durations of spontaneous restart and idle phase, which can be used to evaluate whether using an external heat source is preferable to relying on spontaneous restart. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Catalytic methanation; Intermittent operation; Modeling; Start-up time; Transient simulation","Carbon dioxide; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Hydrogenation; Models; External heating; Intermittent operation; Mode of operations; Reactor temperatures; Renewable sources; Startup time; Thermal runaways; Transient simulation; Methanation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056359301

As part of the comprehensive program evaluation, we compared fine particulate material (PM2.5) concentrations in kitchens and patios in treated (TH), and non-treated households (NTH), and analyzed pollutant levels according to patterns of fuels and devices use reported by the women. A panel study was conducted in 728 households (357 TH and 371 NTH) in three regions of SLP including two sampling rounds in 2015–16. Data on exposure determinants, ICS conditions and cooking practices were collected. Daily PM2.5 in kitchen and patio was measured in a subsample. The average treatment effect was estimated using the double difference method. We constructed a mixed linear model to estimate PM2.5 levels for the entire study sample and obtained personal exposure according to time-activity logs. NTH had lower socioeconomic status compared to TH. The average daily PM2.5 concentrations in NTH compared to TH were 155.2 and 92.6 μg/m3 for kitchen and 35.4 and 39.8 μg/m3 for patio, respectively. PM2.5 levels showed significant regional differences but no significant treatment effect. In many cases, the ICS was added to previous open fire and LPG use (stacking). The household size, kitchen ventilation, relative humidity, temperature and the ratio of indoor/outdoor PM2.5 concentration were significant predictors of kitchen PM2.5 levels. The daily PM2.5 personal exposure was significantly reduced using ICS in good conditions or LPG (57 μg/m3) compared to the traditional open fire (86 μg/m3). This study strengthens the evidence on the potential daily PM2.5 exposure reduction for women using an ICS in good conditions or LPG, displacing the polluting open fire. Comprehensive strategies tailored to the sociocultural context of the communities are needed to implement clean energy programs that achieve adoption and sustained use of ICS or LPG. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Household air pollution; Impact evaluation program; Improved cookstoves; PM2.5; Solid fuels","Air pollution; Exposure controls; Fuels; Kitchens; Rural areas; Average treatment effects; Exposure determinants; Impact evaluation; Improved cookstoves; PM2.5; Socio-economic status; Sociocultural context; Solid fuels; Liquefied petroleum gas; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); cooking appliance; health impact; indoor air; particulate matter; pollution effect; pollution exposure; rural area; socioeconomic status; womens health; womens status; adoption; adult; air pollution; article; clinical article; controlled study; cooking; female; household; human; human experiment; humidity; Mexico; panel study; pollutant; program evaluation; social status; air pollution; devices; environmental exposure; indoor air pollution; Mexico; particulate matter; Mexico [North America]; San Luis Potosi; Potos; Air Pollution; Air Pollution, Indoor; Cooking; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Mexico; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074895758

One of the aims is to increase the percentage of clean energy use in the national energy matrix. Consequently, the integration of energy efficiency strategies prior to the incorporation of renewables has become essential at different levels. Industrial buildings have significant heat gains and losses through the envelope, mainly due to their vast surface and simple construction systems. This work analyses the typical envelopes of industrial buildings in Mexico and the effect of industrial rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems over the annual energy consumption. It was found that for temperate climates, the best option would be to insulate the roof. For cities with warm climates, the best approach is to implement a cool roof on a non-insulated layer or to simply insulate the roof. Additionally, the industrial buildings with metallic roofs situated in warmer climates would benefit the most from the implementation of rooftop PV systems. After all, the results point out that the decrease in the required CELs would not influence the savings. © 2020 by the authors.","Clean energy certificates; Energy efficiency; Envelope; Industrial building; PV systems","building; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy market; energy use; photovoltaic system; temperate environment; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081198963

Tight ecological and economic links to climate variation constrain production in dryland systems, but producers have a breadth of strategies to reduce climate-related risks and maintain RBLP. Research on these strategies has focused on context-specific tactics linked to specific systems and/or geographies. Inspired by studies that look for broader patterns to offer frameworks for discourse and to advance collective knowledge, we review global literature to identify risk management strategies related to climate variability that are in widespread use across dryland rangeland systems and geographies. We organize strategies within three key decision areas for producers engaged in RBLP: profit and return options, land use, and herd management. Across the decision areas, four strategies emerge as playing a strong role in risk management across the globe, with refinements based on local conditions. These shared and prevalent producer driven strategies are dynamic management of forage supply (in the decision area of land use), dynamic management of animal demand (in the area of herd management), and diversification and use of social networks (both of which apply across all three decision areas). Within each of the decision areas, we found diversification reduces climate related risks but has circumstances under which it is less effective; for example, large landholders already buffered to risk via landscape diversity benefit less from livelihood diversification. In practice, implementation of the four strategies often results in livestock producers who do not maximize short-term profits but instead prioritize land resilience, large herd sizes, lifestyle goals, and longer-term economic sustainability. In this synthesis, we considered existing producer strategies for reducing risk related to climate related variability – an intrinsic and defining characteristic of dryland rangelands – in order to highlight valuable areas in which research can support problem solving across diverse RBLP geographies and economies, especially in a changing climate. © 2019","Adaptation; Arid rangelands; Diversification; Forage demand; Forage supply; Social networks","adaptive management; annual variation; climate change; climate variation; livestock; livestock farming; rainfall; rangeland; social network; climate change; forage; geography; human; lifestyle; livestock; nonhuman; problem solving; profit; rangeland; review; risk management; social network; synthesis; animal; climate; environmental protection; geography; Animalia; Animals; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Geography; Livestock; Risk Management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076026613

Although literature abounds with studies investigating the positive impact of low carbon construction on decreasing the emission of carbon in the construction industry, following a low carbon practice might come into conflict with job satisfaction amongst construction site managers, which in turn can negatively affect companies’ performances. This study examines the mediating effect of job stress to investigate the indirect effects of low carbon waste practices on job satisfaction. Data from a survey of 110 site managers of construction companies in Malaysia were examined through the application of the partial least squares technique. The results of the study advocates that unlike the reduce waste management practices, the two other low carbon waste practices, recycle and reuse management practices, positively and directly affected job stress. It was also revealed that only recycle waste management practices negatively and indirectly affected construction site managers’ job satisfaction via job stress. The findings of the research presents an extent of caution for the managers of those construction companies which execute low carbon waste practices regarding the potential impact of low carbon practices on job stress and job satisfaction. From the job stress and job satisfaction points of view, the construction companies should give priority to waste reduction practices amongst low carbon waste practices. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","62G08; Job satisfaction; Job stress; Low carbon construction; Malaysia; Waste management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046629706

This study examines Turkey's province-based GHG emissions released by its livestock sector due to these processes. Besides, this study focusses on biogas production through anaerobic digestion, which is one of the most effective GHG mitigation options from manure management. This study aims to show the importance of the livestock sector in regards to GHG emissions in Turkey based on estimations made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 Guidelines. As a result of these estimations, for the year 2015, 33.85 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) were produced from enteric fermentation and manure management system. The study also aims to evaluate Turkey's province-based biogas production potential from animal manure through the anaerobic digestion (AD) technology. Two different biogas potential scenarios with varying manure recovery rates were developed. Scenario 1 was developed based on the assumption of that total amount of produced animal manure would be used in AD for biogas production, and scenario 2 was developed based on the realistic manure recovery rates that vary with the type of livestock. Biogas potentials for scenario 1 and scenario 2 were determined as 8.41 billion m3 and 4.18 billion m3 in 2015, respectively. These values can meet Turkey's total electricity demand at a rate of 5.25% for scenario 1, and the rate of 2.3% for scenario 2. In addition, according to Turkey's GHG Inventory, submitted annually to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), GHG emissions from manure management can be reduced by 1.13% through biogas production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Enteric fermentation; GHG emissions; Manure management; Turkey","biogas; carbon dioxide; methane; biofuel; nitrous oxide; anaerobic digestion; biogas; emission; fermentation; greenhouse gas; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; livestock; livestock farming; mitigation; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; anaerobic digestion; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; electricity; fermentation; livestock; manure; nonhuman; practice guideline; Turkey (republic); United Nations; animal; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; livestock; turkey (bird); Turkey; Animalia; Animals; Biofuels; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Livestock; Manure; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076785200

The determination of the reservoir permeability using the irreducible water saturation in a shaly sand transition zone has been problematic due to the presence of the bound water saturation. In this research, a model was developed based on the Coates and Dagan permeability model formulation using the dual water model parameters. In this model formulation using the three models, a sensitivity coefficient for conditioning the permeability field at the transition zone was introduced. The sensitivity factor is a quotient function of bound water saturation and the total water saturation. The localized nature of the well data in the determination of the depositional architecture (porosity and permeability) were extrapolated away from or interpolated between acquisition locations using the areal coverage provided by seismic data. The analysis of the well information from the Kolmani River showed that the hydrocarbon lies at depth between 2071m and 2194m (Cenomenian-Turonian Yolde formation). The acoustic map within the reservoir shows the occurrence of dense uniform marine shales and sandstones. It also shows the depositional process has been uniform and sequential. High density clastic materials were also discovered within the reservoir. The permeability results obtained by equating the bound water and total water saturations to the irreducible water saturation gave the 26mD and 16mD as the upper (clean sand) and lower (pure shale) limits of the effective permeability values for the reservoir. The result obtained using the new model showed that the effective permeability is 21mD within the transition zone. Other petrophysical results showed that the reservoir has an effective porosity of 20% and effective water saturation of 12%. Based on these reservoir results, it is understood that the well is highly compact and will not flow during production. © 2019","Bound water saturation; Irreducible water saturation; Permeability; Porosity; Shaly sand reservoir","hydrocarbon exploration; hydrocarbon reservoir; modeling; numerical model; permeability; porosity; sandstone; saturation; shale; Benue Valley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076682713

Exposure to natural environments could explain the negative urban-rural gradient of schizophrenia, but it is unclear if all natural environments are associated with schizophrenia rates. We investigated the association between schizophrenia and growing up surrounded by environments classified as mainly urban, agricultural, near-natural green space, and blue space. Vegetation density and air pollution were assessed as potential pathways. We used the Danish population (943 027 people) and remotely-sensed environmental data to determine land cover exposure and vegetation density around each individual's residence. Effect sizes were estimated using Cox regression and adjusted for air pollution, socioeconomic status, and urbanization. Our results show that growing up surrounded by non-urban environments is associated with lower schizophrenia rates. Firstly, growing up surrounded by non-built-up areas (agricultural areas, near-natural green and blue space) is associated with lower schizophrenia rates compared to urban areas. Secondly, rates decrease with vegetation density in a dose-response relationship for urban and agricultural areas. Air pollution mitigation more strongly explained the protective association in near-natural green spaces, implying that restorative pathways together with air pollution mitigation may explain lower rates in natural environments. This study suggests that ensuring access to natural environments during childhood may be important for schizophrenia prevention, whilst being the first study to show that natural environments may influence schizophrenia rates through multiple pathways. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Environment; Green space; Mental health; Psychiatric risk; Psychological ecosystem services; Remote sensing","air pollution; Article; Danish citizen; environmental exposure; human; land use; priority journal; psychological well-being; remote sensing; rural area; schizophrenia; social environment; social status; urban area; urbanization; vegetation; adverse event; air pollution; environment; rural population; schizophrenia; Air Pollution; Environment; Humans; Rural Population; Schizophrenia; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074683974

Mongolia has experienced significant impacts from climate change, and it has been suggested that these impacts have led to significant degradation to the extensive grasslands of the iconic Mongolian steppes. This paper presents research results of the effects of climate parameters on the biomass of the steppes of central northern Mongolia as determined by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). NDVI shows a negative correlation with temperature and, as maximum temperature has been increasing over the last three decades, NDVI is now lower than the high values of the 1980s. NDVI also shows a positive correlation with annual precipitation, and a dramatic drop in NDVI that occurred in 1995 is related to changes in large-scale climate patterns combining to reduce rainfall. A northward movement of the tracks of rain-bearing cyclones away from Mongolia and a change in ENSO from El Niño to La Niña suppressed convective rainfall events. Moderation of climate extremes led to some recovery of the NDVI, but dramatic increases in the number of livestock are again producing a loss of biomass leaving the region open to catastrophe whether climate again returns to extreme conditions. © 2019, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","Cyclone activity index (CAI); ENSO; NDVI; Oceanic Niño index (ONI); Steppe","biomass; climate change; climate effect; El Nino; growing season; index method; La Nina; livestock; NDVI; rainfall; seasonal variation; steppe; Mongolia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076529277

Heat stress damages the molecular structures and physiological processes in plants in proportion to the level and duration of the stress, which leads to different types of responses. In general, plants respond more efficiently when they are first subjected to a moderate temperature increase before being subjected to a higher temperature stress. This adaptive response is called the acclimation period and has been investigated in several plant species. However, there is a lack of information on the dynamic of the Heat Shock Response (HSR) over a continuous period of temperature rise without an acclimation period. In this paper, we investigated the effects of mild (30 °C) and high (37 °C) continuous heat stress over a 24-h period. Through RNA-Seq analysis, we assessed the remodeling of the transcriptome in the moss Physcomitrella patens. Our results showed that the 30 °C treatment particularly affected the expression of a few genes at 1 and 24 h, suggesting a biphasic response. Up-regulated genes at 1 h encode mainly HSR proteins (protein folding and endoplasmic reticulum stress), indicating an early heat response; while the up-regulated genes at 24 h belong to the thiamine biosynthesis pathway. In contrast, the genes involved in photosynthesis and carbon partitioning were repressed by this treatment. Under a higher temperature stress (37 °C), the induction of the HSR occurred rapidly (1 h) and was then attenuated throughout the time points investigated. A network approach (Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis, WGCNA) was used to identify the groups of genes expressing similar profiles, highlighting a HsfA1E binding motif within the promoters of some unrelated genes which displayed rapid and transient heat-activation. Therefore, it could be suggested that these genes could be direct targets of activation by a HsfA1E transcription factors. © 2020 by the authors.

However, upscaling of site-level CH4 observations across diverse Arctic landscapes remains highly uncertain, compromising accuracy of current pan-Arctic CH4 budgets and confidence in model forecasts. We report a 30,000-km2 survey at 25-m2 resolution (~1 billion observations) of CH4 hotspot patterns across Alaska and northwestern Canada using airborne imaging spectroscopy. Hotspots covered 0.2% of the surveyed area, concentrated in the wetland-upland ecotone, and followed a two-component power law as a function of distance from standing water. Hotspots decreased sharply over the first 40 m from standing water (y = 0.21×−0.649, R2 = 0.97), mirroring in situ flux observations. Beyond 40 m, CH4 hotspots diminished gradually over hundreds of meters (y = 0.004×−0.164, R2 = 0.99).

First and second vertical derivatives, upward continuation, source edge detection, analytical signal, Centre for Exploration Targeting (CET) and standard Euler deconvolution operations were done to delineate the spatial distributions and depths to the different magnetic sources. The enhanced maps showed major and minor magnetic anomaly centres in the Lower Benue Trough (LBT) and Ikom-Mamfe Rift (IMR) characterized by thin (151–745 m) sedimentation. Also, within these areas there exist some isolated pockets of intermediate depths (745–1634 m) occurring in the neighborhood of these magnetic anomalies. The Calabar Flank (CF) characterized by minor remnants of post-Cretaceous intrusions has sedimentation of over 6126 m in some locations. The 2000 m upward continued TMI map revealed the existence of major deep-seated weak zones believed to have originated during the rifting episode connected with the formation of the Benue Trough.

However, due to weather-dependent fluctuations, generation from variable renewable energy (VRE) sources is characterised by significantly lower market values in comparison to conventional technologies, reinforced by a decline in electricity prices. This development poses interesting questions as to its drivers and to what extent market values of wind and solar power can be influenced by the design of electricity markets. Against this background, a scenario-based analysis is conducted to trace the future development of market values using endogenously derived electricity prices considering different regional and technological VRE diversification strategies and investments into VRE technologies on a myopic basis. The results show a continued decline in market values with increasing regional discrepancies indicating a growing importance of interregional interdependencies for assessing the profitability of VRE. Furthermore, from a system point of view, a more distributed allocation of onshore wind capacities to contend with declining market values does not always prove to stabilise market values by facilitating a more constant feed-in pattern, contrary to expectation. Finally, replacing onshore with offshore wind energy appears to be beneficial as it can lead to an overall increase in the market values of offshore, onshore as well as PV generation technologies compared to other mitigation strategies. This result raise interesting questions about the systemic economic value of offshore wind despite its higher LCOE in the context of market integration of VRE. © 2020 The Authors","Geographical diversification; Market integration of renewables; Market value; Spatial value factor distribution; Technological diversification","Commerce; Costs; Offshore oil well production; Offshore technology; Photovoltaic cells; Power markets; Solar energy; Wind power; Geographical diversification; Market integration; Market values; Spatial value factor distribution; Technological diversification; Investments; alternative energy; energy market; price dynamics; profitability; solar power; spatial data; technological development; wind power; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078537162

While BGC effects are assessed at global scale and are at the heart of climate treaties such as the Paris Agreement, BPH effects are totally absent despite their increasingly recognized impact, especially at local scale. This stems from the complexity in characterizing their climate impacts both at local and global scale, which makes it impractical to offer clear advices for the development of climate policies. To overcome this barrier, we built a prototype for an assessment tool to evaluate the local BPH impact of a series of land cover transitions. It relies on a dedicated methodology, based on satellite remote sensing data, that can estimate the local change in near surface air temperature associated with BPH effects of potential LULCC. This tool follows a tiered methodological approach, using transparent methods and mirroring what is currently provided by the IPCC to estimate the BGC effects, i.e. through different levels of increasing methodological complexity, from Tier 1 (i.e. default method and factors) to Tier 2 (i.e. similar to Tier 1 but with higher level of details and complexity) and Tier 3 (i.e. tailored solution to address national circumstances). The prototype tool enables the evaluation of the local impacts of land-related BPH effects, therefore facilitating a scientifically informed and comprehensive assessment of land-based climate policies. © 2019 The Authors","Biophysical effects; land-based climate policies; LULCC; temperature","air temperature; complexity; environmental assessment; land use change; land use planning; policy making; temperature profile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087934424

Ag and Cu remain fully phase-segregated in the as deposited bimetallic foam exhibiting a high degree of dispersion of pure nm-sized Ag domains embedded in the Cu matrix. An activation of this bimetallic material towards ethanol formation is achieved by thermal annealing of the as deposited foam under mild conditions (200 °C for 12 h). Such annealing quantitatively transforms the Cu in the bimetallic system into a mixture of crystalline Cu2O and amorphous CuO whereas the Ag remains in its metallic state due to the thermal instability of Ag2O above temperatures of 180 °C. The selective oxidation of Cu in the bimetallic Ag15Cu85 catalyst goes along with an enrichment of Cu oxides on the surface of the formed mixed AgCuxO foam. Both operando X-ray diffraction and operando Raman spectroscopy demonstrate, however, that the oxide reduction is completed before the electrochemical CO2 reduction sets in. The thus formed oxide-derived (OD) bimetallic Ag15Cu85 foam catalyst shows high selectivity towards alcohol formation with Faradaic efficiencies of FEEtOH = 33.7% and FEn-PrOH = 6.9% at −1.0 V and −0.9 V vs RHE, respectively.

Although electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) may expose passerby to nicotine and particulate matter, few US states regulate indoor use of ENDS. The purpose of this study was to investigate reported rationales for ENDS use and reported ENDS use in public smoke-free places by dual cigarette/ENDS users. Methods: A population of ENDS/cigarette co-users (n = 2051) was drawn from Wave 2 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) dataset (2014–2015). Harm reduction beliefs and cessation behavior of co-users were investigated as predictors of ENDS use in public smoke-free places using logistic regression. Results: Fifty-eight percent of dual users reported past 30-day ENDS use in public smoke-free places. Reported use of ENDS to cut down on cigarette smoking (OR: 2.38, 95% CI: 1.86, 3.05), as an alternative to quitting tobacco (OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.37, 2.13), or because of belief that ENDS help people to quit cigarettes (OR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.20, 1.92) were significantly associated with increased odds of ENDS use in smoke-free places. Conclusions: Beliefs that ENDS were useful as cessation tools or posed modified risk to users and nonusers were associated with elevated odds of use ENDS in locations where conventional tobacco is prohibited. Due to limitations in the survey instrument, in-home ENDS use could not be directly assessed in this analysis. However, these self-reported findings suggest that use of ENDS in public places where cigarette use is prohibited is prevalent enough to be of concern for future regulation and enforcement efforts. © 2020 by the authors.

The UV bump observed in the interstellar medium extinction curve of galaxies has been assigned to π → π⋆ transitions within the sp2 conjugated network of carbon grains. These grains are commonly thought to be graphitic particles or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. However, questions are still open regarding the shape and degree of amorphization of these particles, which could account for the variations in the 2175 Å astronomical bump. Optical spectra of graphitic and onion-like carbon structures were previously obtained from dielectric constant calculations based on oscillating dipole models. In the present study, we compute the optical spectra of entire populations of carbon clusters using an explicit quantum description of their electronic structure for each individual isomer. Aims. Our aim is to determine the optical spectra of pure carbon clusters Cn=24,42,60 sorted into structural populations according to specific order parameters, namely asphericity and sp2 fraction, and to correlate these order parameters to the spectral features of the band in the region of the UV bump. Our comparison involves data measured for the astronomical UV bump as well as experimental spectra of carbon species formed in laboratory flames. Methods. The individual spectrum of each isomer is determined using the time-dependent density functional tight-binding method. The final spectrum for a given population is obtained by averaging the individual spectra for all isomers of a given family. Our method allows for an explicit description of particle shape, as well as structural and electronic disorder with respect to purely graphitic structures. Results. The spectra of the four main populations of cages, flakes, pretzels, and branched structures (Dubosq et al. 2019, A&A, 625, L11) all display strong absorption in the 2-8 eV domain, mainly due to π → π* transitions. The absorption features, however, differ from one family to another and our quantum modeling indicates that the best candidates for the interstellar UV bump at 217.5 nm are cages and then flakes, while the opposite trend is found for the carbonaceous species formed in flame experiments; the other two families of pretzels and branched structures play a lesser role in both cases. Conclusions. Our quantum modeling shows the potential contribution of carbon clusters with a high fraction of conjugated sp2 atoms to the astronomical UV bump and to the spectrum of carbonaceous species formed in flames. While astronomical spectra are better accounted for using rather spherical isomers such as cages, planar flake structures are involved as a much greater component in flame experiments. Interestingly, these flake isomers have been proposed as likely intermediates in the formation mechanisms leading to buckminsterfullerene, which was recently detected in space. This study, although restricted here to the case of pure carbon clusters, will be extended towards several directions of astronomical relevance. In particular, the ability of the present approach to deal with large-scale molecular systems at an explicit quantum level of electronic structure and its transferable character towards different charge states and the possible presence of heteroatoms makes it the method of choice to address the important case of neutral and ionic hydrogenated compounds. © C.

This study proposed an extended STIRPAT model to predict CO2 emissions peak of industrial energy consumption in Jilin Province under the four scenarios (baseline scenario (BAU), energy-saving scenario (ESS), energy-saving and low-carbon scenario (ELS), and low-carbon scenario (LCS). We analyze the influences of various factors on the peak time and values of CO2 emissions and explore the reduction path and mechanism to achieve CO2 emissions peak in industrial energy consumption. The results show that the peak time of the four scenarios is respectively 2026, 2030, 2035 and 2043, and the peak values are separately 147.87 million tons, 16.94 million tons, 190.89 million tons and 22.973 million tons. Due to conforming to the general disciplines of industrial development, the result in ELS is selected as the optimal scenario. The impact degrees of various factors on the peak value are listed as industrial CO2 emissions effciency of energy consumption &gt; industrialized rate &gt; GDP &gt; urbanization rate &gt; industrial energy intensity &gt; the share of renewable energy consumption. But not all factors affect the peak time. Only two factors including industrial clean-coal and low-carbon technology and industrialized rate do effect on the peak time. Clean coal technology, low carbon technology and industrial restructuring have become inevitable choices to peak ahead of time. However, developing clean coal and low-carbon technologies, adjusting the industrial structure, promoting the upgrading of the industrial structure and reducing the growth rate of industrialization can effectively reduce the peak value.

To avoid a reversal of the reduction convergence in the environmental field, mitigation strategies should aim to reduce the environmental risks posed by carbon inequality. This article uses the Gini index and Theil index to examine carbon inequality in the transport sector in China and decomposes the per capita carbon inequality using Kaya factors. Then, the variations within and between regions are analyzed by decomposing the Theil index of the carbon intensity by region. Our major findings are as follows. First, carbon inequality is relatively insignificant in the regional transport sector in China. Second, the main drivers of the per capita carbon inequality include the carbon intensity and per capita added value in the transport sector. Third, intra-regional components are major contributors to the heterogeneous spatial distribution of the carbon intensity, and the degree of carbon inequality in the eastern region is much greater than that in other regions. Moreover, the four economic regional components of the Theil index of the carbon intensity have had an obvious convergence effect since 2009. In addition, this study provides some suggestions for developing differentiated mitigation policies in different regions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon emissions; Gini index; Inequality; Theil index; Transportation","carbon emission; economic conditions; empirical analysis; environmental conditions; index method; spatial distribution; transportation system; China; Torreya nucifera; carbon; carbon dioxide; China; economics; industry; pollution; socioeconomics; traffic and transport; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Environmental Pollution; Industry; Socioeconomic Factors; Transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077034381

In research papers, district heating multi-objective optimization usually takes into account minimization of the total discounted cost and environmental impact, while exergetic objective function is rarely introduced. Most of the times, economic and ecological objective functions are studied as a single objective optimization problem through internalization of the cost related to carbon dioxide emissions tax. This paper presents novel approach since additional tax, related to exergy destruction, has been introduced. The influence of these two taxing systems on a single and multi-objective optimization results of district heating system has been carried out. Two approaches have been proposed. In the first one, multi-objective optimization has been used where objective functions were defined as economic and ecological or exergetic. In the second approach, single-objective optimization has been used where cost function also includes both carbon and exergy destruction tax. It has been shown that inclusion of carbon tax causes convergence of Pareto fronts after specific exergy destruction has been reached. On the other hand, if all technologies are available, increase of exergy tax doesn't reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The most important outcome of this paper is analysis of the impact of exergy tax on natural gas consumption in heat-only boilers. Acquired results show that exergy, together with carbon tax, can effectively reduce natural gas consumption in heat-only boilers. If there are no back-pressure CHP technologies available, these taxing systems can completely push out its consumption. Finally, the analyses with carbon emissions allocation in CHP units has also been carried out. Acquired results have shown that with increase of carbon tax, exergy efficiency of the system could be increased. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","District heating; Exergy; External cost; Internal cost; Linear programming; Multi-objective optimization; Thermal storage","Boilers; Carbon dioxide; Cost functions; District heating; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Exergy; Global warming; Heat storage; Linear programming; Natural gas; Taxation; Carbon dioxide emissions; District heating system; External costs; Internal costs; Natural gas consumption; Single objective optimization; Single objective optimization problems; Thermal storage; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076674830

Box 14155-6455, Tehran, Iran","Pteropyrum is a small genus of Polygonaceae with four species from the arid regions of Iran and adjacent countries. Pteropyrum spp. are not precisely delimitated and are difficult to identify because of their high plasticity in morphological characters. Pteropyrum (C) has a close affinity to Calligonum (C) and is therefore a suitable case for C evolutionary studies. We investigated the morphology and micromorphology (including pollen morphology) of Pteropyrum and elucidated the phylogenetic relationships with Atraphaxis and Calligonum using nuclear ITS sequences. Characteristics of the photosynthetic tissues such as volume and number of layers of primary carbon assimilation tissues (PCA) and photosynthetic carbon reduction tissue (PCR) were studied. In addition, the leaf and cotyledon anatomical characters of Pteropyrum (C), Atraphaxis (C) and Calligonum (C), and their δC values were compared to look for evolutionary changes in assimilating organs. The molecular phylogenetic tree identifies two strongly supported clades in Pteropyrum and its close relationship with Calligonum, confirming previous studies. Some morphologically similar species belong to different clades, which is probably due to convergent evolution and homoplasy. Leaf anatomical studies show that Atraphaxis has a multilayered mesophyll tissue, whereas Calligonum has one-layered mesophyll cells. The volume and layer number of mesophyll tissue cells decreases, whereas water storage tissue area significantly increases from Atraphaxis to Pteropyrum and Calligonum. This phenomenon confirms previous studies in other lineages with C salsoloid anatomy that have evolved through increasing of water storage tissue and succulence of assimilating organs. In the taxonomic part of the paper, a key to identification of accepted taxa of Pteropyrum, description of species and distribution maps are presented based on numerous herbarium specimens and our own rich collections from the field. Four new species are described based on a combination of morphology of seedlings and mature plants, pollen morphology and molecular data.

This study aimed to determine the water use strategies of T. taklamakanensis in the Taklimakan Desert under a falling groundwater depth. Four typical T. taklamakanensis nabkha habitats (sandy desert of Tazhong site, saline desert-alluvial plain of Qiemo site, desert-oasis ecotone of Qira site and desert-oasis ecotone of Aral site) were selected with different climate, soil, groundwater and plant cover conditions. Stable isotope values of hydrogen and oxygen were measured for plant xylem water, soil water (soil depths within 0–500 cm), snowmelt water and groundwater in the different habitats. Four potential water sources for T. taklamakanensis, defined as shallow, middle and deep soil water, as well as groundwater, were investigated using a Bayesian isotope mixing model. It was found that groundwater in the Taklimakan Desert was not completely recharged by precipitation, but through the river runoff from snowmelt water in the nearby mountain ranges. The surface soil water content was quickly depleted by strong evaporation, groundwater depth was relatively shallow and the height of T. taklamakanensis nabkha was relatively low, thus T. taklamakanensis primarily utilized the middle (23%±1%) and deep (31%±5%) soil water and groundwater (36%±2%) within the sandy desert habitat. T. taklamakanensis mainly used the deep soil water (55%±4%) and a small amount of groundwater (25%±2%) within the saline desert-alluvial plain habitat, where the soil water content was relatively high and the groundwater depth was shallow. In contrast, within the desert-oasis ecotone in the Qira and Aral sites, T. taklamakanensis primarily utilized the deep soil water (35%±1% and 38%±2%, respectively) and may also use groundwater because the height of T. taklamakanensis nabkha was relatively high in these habitats and the soil water content was relatively low, which is associated with the reduced groundwater depth due to excessive water resource exploitation and utilization by surrounding cities. Consequently, T. taklamakanensis showed distinct water use strategies among the different habitats and primarily depended on the relatively stable water sources (deep soil water and groundwater), reflecting its adaptations to the different habitats in the arid desert environment. These findings improve our understanding on determining the water sources and water use strategies of T. taklamakanensis in the Taklimakan Desert. © 2020, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bayesian isotope mixing model; deep soil water; groundwater; stable isotopes; Taklimakan Desert; Tamarix taklamakanensis; water use strategies","Bayesian analysis; groundwater; hydrogen isotope; oxygen isotope; soil water; stable isotope; water content; water resource; water use; China; Taklimakan Desert; Xinjiang Uygur; Tamarix taklamakanensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082879039

This paper investigates the energy saving and carbon reduction performance of timber stadiums in China in comparison with stadiums constructed using conventional building materials, based on both life cycle energy assessment (LCEA) and life cycle carbon assessment (LCCA). The authors select five representative cities in five climate zones in China as the simulation environment, simulate energy use in the operation phase of stadiums constructed from reinforced concrete (RC) and timber, and compare the RC and timber stadiums in terms of their life cycle energy consumption and carbon emissions. The LCEA results reveal that the energy saving potential afforded by timber stadiums is 11.05%, 12.14%, 8.15%, 4.61% and 4.62% lower than those of RC buildings in ""severely cold, "" ""cold, "" ""hot summer, cold winter, "" ""hot summer, warm winter, "" and ""temperate"" regions, respectively. The LCCA results demonstrate that the carbon emissions of timber stadiums are 15.85%, 15.86%, 18.88%, 19.22% and 22.47% lower than those of RC buildings for the regions above, respectively. This demonstrates that in China, timber stadiums have better energy conservation and carbon reduction potential than RC stadiums, based on life cycle assessment. Thus, policy makers are advised to encourage the promotion of timber stadiums in China to achieve the goal of sustainable energy development for public buildings. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon reduction; Energy saving; Reinforced concrete; Timber","assessment method; building; carbon emission; comparative study; economic policy; emission control; energy conservation; energy efficiency; government; incentive; life cycle analysis; performance assessment; reinforced concrete; simulation; timber; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081234139

Both European and UK national policies suggest that efforts should be made to reduce carbon emissions and increase the share of renewable energy, an important element of which is encouraging generation, typically PV, in partnership with energy storage systems in the residential sector. The scale of the energy storage system is important, i.e. in individual properties or as a community resource. Many advantages of community energy storage (CES) over household energy storage (HES) have been identified, but the design and operation of CES has received significantly less attention. Most existing research has analysed CES at community level only, but the performance and impact on individual households has yet to be fully explored. In this study an agent-based model is proposed to investigate and analyse CES based on a range of criteria. Results indicate that both HES and CES can significantly reduce the grid peak power import and export, improve the community self-consumption rate (SCR) and self-sufficiency rate (SSR), and contribute to much higher energy saving. Furthermore, optimising the CES capacity leads to more effective use of PV power and better demand localisation during high PV-generation periods. It is found that an important challenge for CES systems is to realise the value of the shared electricity equitably amongst the participants and potentially to seek other revenue streams. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based modelling; Battery management; Community energy storage; Distributed generation; Photovoltaics; Self-consumption","Autonomous agents; Battery management systems; Computational methods; Distributed power generation; Energy conservation; Heating; Housing; Photovoltaic cells; Simulation platform; Agent-based modelling; Battery Management; Community energy; Photovoltaics; Self-consumption; Electric energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076320587

Then, by constructing an indicator of PM2.5 decoupling efforts (PDE), PDE of different regions and the degree of efforts caused by various factors were explored. Finally, the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of internal and external factors influencing PDE was explored using the Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression Model (GTWR).

In the analysis of the sensitivity of PM2.5 to various emission reduction factors throughout the country, the sensitivity of the emission coefficient was highest in Shandong province. (3) From 2000 to 2014, all provinces made decoupling efforts (PDE&gt;0), among which PDE in Guizhou province were the largest. According to various indicators of decoupling efforts, the contribution of decoupling effort of emission coefficient was the largest. (4) All influencing factors exhibited spatiotemporal heterogeneity. In most regions, the interaction between environmental regulation and industrial structure had a positive impact on PDE, which verifies the existence of the “Porter Hypothesis”. However, in some central and western regions, this interaction exhibited a dynamic change from negative to positive. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","GTWR; LMDI; PDE; PM2.5; Sensitivity analysis","Economics; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Regression analysis; Emission coefficient; GTWR; Industrial structures; Internal and external factors; LMDI; PM2.5; Spatiotemporal heterogeneities; Weighted regression; Sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074443139

Changes are reflected in different components of the climate system including the marine biota. In this study we focus on studying the East Equatorial Pacific Ocean (EEP), a relevant area in the present and past climate regulation. We present a high-resolution record of benthic foraminifera from the Ocean Drilling Program Leg 202 Site 1242 (East Equatorial Pacific, 1364 m water depth) from MIS 18 to MIS 30 (716 to 1038 ka). The analysis of benthic foraminiferal assemblages allows to identify palaeoenvironments and to make inferences about the palaeoceanographic processes involved. Bottom waters were deficient in oxygen during mild glacials of Marine Isotopic Stage (MIS) 26 and 28, early MIS 23, glacial MIS 22, and the glacial-interglacial transitions of MIS 20/19 and MIS 18e/d. The overall sustained organic carbon regime suffered a major change during mid MIS 23 (890–900 ka). We interpret this change was caused by an increased influence the open ocean upwelling system of the Costa Rica Dome derivering labile organic carbon to the seafloor. Another substantial change occurred at mid MIS 19 and it is interpreted to involve a shift in the nature of the organic carbon arriving at the seafloor. This shift largely coincides with the disappearance of a group of mainly elongated benthic foraminifera, commonly known as the “Extinction Group”. Our findings suggest the arrival of a particular type of food, for which these foraminifera where not adapted, might have contributed to the final demise of this group of foraminifera in the East Equatorial Pacific. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Intertropical Convergence Zone; ODP 1242; Oxygen depletion; Phytoplankton blooms","algal bloom; benthic foraminifera; environmental change; glacial-interglacial cycle; intertropical convergence zone; local extinction; marine isotope stage; Ocean Drilling Program; paleoceanography; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; phytoplankton; Pleistocene; Costa Rica Dome; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Equatorial); Foraminifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076176821

Objectives: We aimed at quantifying the effect of woody and non-woody understory vegetation on net ecosystem production (NEP) for a forested area of 158 km2 in the European Alps. Methods: We simulated C dynamics for the period 2000–2014, characterized by above-average temperatures, windstorms and a subsequent bark beetle outbreak for the area, using the regional ecosystem model LandscapeDNDC. Results: In the entire study area, woody and non-woody understory vegetation caused between 16 and 37% higher regional NEP as compared to a bare soil scenario over the 15-year period. The mean annual contribution of the understory to NEP was in the same order of magnitude as the average annual European (EU-25) forest C sink. After wind and bark beetle disturbances, the understory effect was more pronounced, leading to an increase in NEP between 35 and 67% compared to simulations not taking into account these components. Conclusions: Our findings strongly support the importance of processes related to the understory in the context of the climate change mitigation potential of temperate forest ecosystems. The expected increases in stand replacing disturbances due to climate change call for a better representation of understory vegetation dynamics and its effect on the ecosystem C balance in regional assessments and Earth System Models. © 2020, The Author(s).","Carbon sequestration; Ecosystem modelling; Forest disturbance; Herb layer; Mountain forest; Net ecosystem production; Tree regeneration","carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; ecosystem modeling; environmental disturbance; herb; landscape ecology; montane forest; net ecosystem production; regeneration; temperate environment; understory; Alps; Scolytinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078994046

Extreme cold environments are mainly dependent on microbial activities because this climate restricts higher plants and animals. Himalaya is one of the most important cold environments on Earth as it shares climatic similarities with the polar regions. It includes a wide range of ecosystems, from temperate to extreme cold, distributed along the higher altitudes. These regions are characterized as stressful environments because of the heavy exposure to harmful rays, scarcity of nutrition, and freezing conditions. The microorganisms that colonize these regions are recognized as cold-tolerant (psychrotolerants) or/and cold-loving (psychrophiles) microorganisms. These microorganisms possess several structural and functional adaptations in order to perform normal life processes under the stressful low-temperature environments. Their biological activities maintain the nutrient flux in the environment and contribute to the global biogeochemical cycles. Limited culture-dependent and culture-independent studies have revealed their diversity in community structure and functional potential. Apart from the ecological importance, these microorganisms have been recognized as source of cold-active enzymes and novel bioactive compounds of industrial and biotechnological importance. Being an important part of the cryosphere, Himalaya needs to be explored at different dimensions related to the life of the inhabiting extremophiles.

This study explores how REDD + through the principle of social inclusion enhances deliberation of the less powerful and disadvantaged users and stipulates responsiveness in local leaders of community forests. The study is based on in-depth interviews conducted with the users of two community forests in Nepal`s Terai region. After the implementation of REDD+, disadvantaged groups such as the poor, Dalits, women and indigenous groups have secured their position in decision making structures. The implementation of REDD + has resulted in positive changes in community forestry governance, but the institutional and social benefits of REDD + have not trickled down to the expected users of community forests. Though participation of poor, Dalits, women and indigenous communities in key decision-making position has increased, it is still far from influencing decisions in their favor based on social justice. Deliberation without the facilitation of the local political leaders has not taken space. Local politics is highly influential in community forest user groups and dominates the formal decision-making structure of community forestry. To overcome these issues, disadvantaged groups should be empowered and the criteria of selecting representatives in a quota system should be based on the users’ dependency on the forest. Only such criteria can stimulate responsiveness in local leaders. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Community forestry; Decision-making; Deliberation; REDD+; Responsiveness; Social inclusion","Deforestation; Developing countries; Timber; Community forestry; Deliberation; REDD; Responsiveness; Social inclusion; Decision making; Criteria; Decision Making; Deforestation; Developing Countries; Forestry; Forests; Position; Women",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075014990

We resampled populations of Threespine Stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) along a latitudinal gradient in California bar-built estuaries to examine their evolution in response to changing climate and habitat. We took advantage of the strong association between stickleback lateral plate phenotypes and Ectodysplasin A (Eda) genotypes to infer changes in allele frequencies over time. Our results show that over time the frequency of low-plated alleles has generally increased and heterozygosity has decreased. Latitudinal patterns in stickleback plate phenotypes suggest that evolution at Eda is a response to climate-driven habitat transformation rather than a direct consequence of climate. As climate change has reduced precipitation and increased temperature and drought, bar-built estuaries have transitioned from lotic (flowing-water) to lentic (still-water) habitats, where the low-plated allele is favoured. The low-plated allele has achieved fixation at the driest, hottest southernmost sites, a trend that is progressing northward with climate change. Climate-driven habitat change is therefore causing a reduction in genetic variation that may hinder future adaptation for populations facing multiple threats. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adaptation; climate change; Gasterosteus aculeatus; intraspecific variation; latitudinal gradient; rapid evolution; resurvey; space-for-time","adaptation; allele; climate change; finfish; genetic variation; habitat fragmentation; interspecific variation; latitudinal gradient; phenotype; sampling; California; United States; Gasterosteus; Gasterosteus aculeatus; animal; California; ecosystem; evolution; gene frequency; phenotype; Smegmamorpha; Animals; Biological Evolution; California; Ecosystem; Gene Frequency; Phenotype; Smegmamorpha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075235655

Complex chemistry of mineral dust surfaces might give rise to the conversion of some important atmospheric trace gases. Herein, for the first time we find that CO2 can be photochemically reduced to CO, which is an ozone precursor in the atmosphere, on mineral dust particles. In this study, we performed CO2 uptake experiments using a quartz reactor and investigated the uptake kinetics of CO2 on TiO2 particles and authentic mineral dust (Arizona Test Dust, illite, montmorillonite, and kaolin) under simulated atmospheric conditions using gas chromatography (GC). The impacts of different relative humidity (RH) values and irradiation intensities on CO2 photoreduction were studied. Moreover, the surface intermediate of the heterogeneous photoreduction of CO2 with mineral dust and its kinetic relevance were investigated using in situ DRIFTS and isotopic 13C labelling. Furthermore, field observations of increased CO concentrations in a mineral dust storm were interpreted as the results of the direct uptake of CO2 on the mineral dust surface and the following photochemical reaction of CO2 on atmospheric mineral dusts under solar irradiation.

We use these samples to evaluate the influence of meteoric diagenesis, marine burial diagenesis, and dolomitization on the Li isotope system in carbonates. We find that recrystallization of aragonite to low-Mg calcite in the presence of meteoric fluids results in a systematic decrease of the Li/(Ca+Mg) ratio in Clino, Unda and Key Largo samples, due to the lower Li/(Ca+Mg) ratio in meteoric fluids compared to seawater. For Li isotopes, we observe that the δLi of meteorically altered low-Mg calcite is +22.0±3.8‰ (n=28, 1), which is coincidentally similar to the original aragonite-rich sediments (+22±1‰ in the Bahamas, +18±1‰ in Key Largo), but with a larger variability (from +15 to +27‰). We interpret these features as reflecting the overprinting of primary Li during meteoric alteration with a highly variable isotope signature that may be controlled by a combination of local porewater and/or global climatic conditions; in either case, meteoric diagenesis produces isotopic signatures that are unrelated to seawater composition. In contrast, marine burial diagenesis and dolomitization of Clino and Unda sediments under ""fluid-buffered"" conditions result in Li isotope composition that is similar (+30.2±1.5‰, n=36, 1-) to modern seawater (+31‰). For Site 1007, the δLi values range between +23 permil and +31 permil. We interpret this range as reflecting a combination of varying diagenesis style (fluid to sediment-buffered) and varying contribution of calcite derived from pelagic sediments, with distinct isotopic composition due to primary mineralogy. Altogether, our results show that diagenesis does not invalidate the use of bulk carbonates for deriving Li isotope paleo-records, but the reliability of past carbonates as recorders of seawater δLi values will depend on carefully characterizing their diagenetic history. © 2020 American Journal of Science.

The carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio, energy consumption, microbial population, nitrate coulomb-reduction rate, and hydrogen production were considered during the experiments. The optimum condition for nitrate removal was obtained at C/N = 2, applied current = 2 mA, and reaction time = 6 h. Nitrate coulomb-reduction rate and hydrogen gas generation were 3.33 mg C–1 and 2.2 × 10–4 moles, respectively. The consumption of electricity and power were computed 0.0104–0.096 kWh m–3 and 9.9 × 10–5, respectively. The analysis of microbial community relying on 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) genes demonstrated that the denitrifying bacteria mainly belonged to Bacillus spp., and Pseudomonas spp. This integrated MES makes it possible to – – both NO3 and NO2 removed effectively. This system could achieve a high denitrification performance with low nitrate and ammonia accumulation due to providing suitable and larger surface area for bacterial adhesion, uniform distribution and better electron exchange in redox reactions. © 2020 Desalination Publications.

Combustion emissions from a variety of sources, such as power generation or road traffic, make a large contribution to harmful air pollutants such as ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5)4. Efforts to mitigate air pollution have focused mainly on the relationship between local emission sources and local air quality2. Air quality can also be affected by distant emission sources, however, including emissions from neighbouring federal states5,6. This cross-state exchange of pollution poses additional regulatory challenges. Here we quantify the exchange of air pollution among the contiguous United States, and assess its impact on premature mortality that is linked to increased human exposure to PM2.5 and ozone from seven emission sectors for 2005 to 2018. On average, we find that 41 to 53 per cent of air-quality-related premature mortality resulting from a state’s emissions occurs outside that state. We also find variations in the cross-state contributions of different emission sectors and chemical species to premature mortality, and changes in these variations over time. Emissions from electric power generation have the greatest cross-state impacts as a fraction of their total impacts, whereas commercial/residential emissions have the smallest. However, reductions in emissions from electric power generation since 2005 have meant that, by 2018, cross-state premature mortality associated with the commercial/residential sector was twice that associated with power generation. In terms of the chemical species emitted, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide emissions caused the most cross-state premature deaths in 2005, but by 2018 primary PM2.5 emissions led to cross-state premature deaths equal to three times those associated with sulfur dioxide emissions. These reported shifts in emission sectors and emission species that contribute to premature mortality may help to guide improvements to air quality in the contiguous United States. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"nitrogen oxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; mortality; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollution effect; power generation; public health; adult; air pollution; air quality; Article; cohort analysis; combustion; commercial species; concentration (parameter); controlled study; disease association; environmental exposure; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; female; human; particulate matter; pollution transport; power supply; premature mortality; priority journal; residential home; risk reduction; traffic and transport; United States; waste management; adverse event; air pollution; epidemiology; United States; Adult; Air Pollution; Humans; Mortality, Premature; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079337548

The different types of forest ecosystems existing over the Indian region offer a tremendous carbon sequestration potential useful for the global mitigation of climate change as predicted by the modelling studies. The monsoon results in a strong seasonality of the ecosystem-atmosphere carbon exchange due to the differential availability of two key controlling parameters of photosynthesis namely radiation and water. However, due to the sparsity of surface observations neither the carbon sequestration potential of these ecosystems nor its relation with the monsoon has been analysed comprehensively so far. This paper studies the ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange at a tropical semi-evergreen moist deciduous forest and its relation with the monsoon over north-east India using the eddy covariance and associated meteorological measurements. In 2016, this ecosystem acts as a net source of atmospheric CO2 with net ecosystem exchange of 207.51 ± 157.37 gC m−2 year−1 and gross photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration of 2604.88 ± 179.43 and 2812.38 ± 22.05 gC m−2 year−1, respectively. The monsoon clouds are seen to introduce a bimodal pattern in the annual GPP record. The pre-monsoon and winter are the most and least favourable seasons for the photosynthetic CO2 uptake by this forest canopy. Additionally, the rate of increase of photosynthesis with evapotranspiration is maximum and minimum during the pre-monsoon and winter, respectively. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Carbon sequestration; Eddy covariance; Indian summer monsoon; MetFlux India; Net ecosystem exchange; Tropical forest","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Forestry; Photosynthesis; Carbon sequestration; Carbon sequestration potential; Controlling parameters; Ecosystem respiration; Gross photosynthesis; Indian summer monsoon; Meteorological measurements; Net ecosystem exchange; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086671087

The year 2017 was one of the three warmest on record and the world continues to experience extreme weather conditions. An effective mobilization of resources earmarked for key economic sectors is an important component of a strategy of any country to comply with greenhouse gases (GHG) emission reduction targets, especially Brazil, that is a top GHG emitter. This paper aims to identify these strategic economic sectors for investment to mitigate GHG emissions in Brazil. In order to do so, we estimate emission-demand elasticities of productive sectors, obtained from the Brazil’s Input-Output Matrix (IOM). In consequence, we identify those sectors with greater pollution impacts on the economy and then deserve higher priority for investment as well as mitigation policies. The paper also describes the flows and sources of climate investment and suggests that to ensure efficient outcomes policy makers should consider the role played by each different production sector. The results show the relevance of paying particular attention to the country’s productive structure and the pollution pressure it generates. From this approach, we identified that forest sector is still a key investment destination for mitigation of GHG emissions. Agriculture, transportation, and industrial sectors are also relevant to investment allocation. Confronting the results with literature and with the availability of funds, we ratified that forest and agriculture are strategic sectors for Brazil, and the sectoral approaches, classified as strong multilateralism policy architecture, are fundamental to achieve climate targets. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Greenhouse gas emission elasticities; Input–output matrix; Mitigation investment; Strategic production sectors","assessment method; climate change; economic conditions; emission control; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; input-output analysis; investment; strategic approach; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068186962

Windows energy efficiency depends on thermal indices (U-factor, SHGC) but also on climate and building characteristics. In order to identify the most influential factors and to explore energy savings strategies for the climatic and technological context of Argentina, a parametric study based on detailed building simulations was conducted using EnergyPlus. The analyzed parameters were window type, leakage rate, location, building geometry, window-to-wall ratio (WWR), orientation and building envelope materiality and exposure. The results indicate that window type is one of the most determining factors, followed by location, orientation and building envelope characteristics. In the most populous locations of Argentina, characterized by mild winters and high solar irradiation levels, windows mainly impact on buildings cooling demand. In consequence, the most energy efficient windows are generally not the more insulated but the ones with low SHGC, which shows the importance of shading devices. In addition, it was found that an adequate architectural design (as regards WWR and windows orientation) may produce substantial energy savings, offering alternative strategies to expensive high-performance window technologies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Architectural design; Argentina; Energy efficiency; Parametric study; Window","Architectural design; Location; Solar buildings; Windows; Argentina; Building characteristics; Energy saving potential; Energy savings strategies; Energy-efficient windows; Influential factors; Parametric study; Window-to-wall ratio; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076826315

Considering that climate had significant effect on socio-economic behavior of Earth populations, the objective of this work was to evaluate the relationship between human progress and drought sensitivity behavior in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Methods: The human progress variable was generated by principal component analysis, considering the factors: Territorial occupation of the population, dependency ratio, urbanization degree, income, habitation, health, education, sanitation, security and human development index. The moisture index product was generated based on map algebra calculation in GIS, using WorldClim precipitation and MODIS evapotranspiration products. Nonlinear least squares method and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm fit an exponential model to the moisture index (independent) and human progress (dependent) variables. Covariance and crossed-covariance functions were used to characterize the structure and magnitude of spatial dependence between the human progress and the moisture index co-variable. Results: Couple modeling human progress and moisture index variability generated the human drought sensitivity behavior variable, representing the effects of regional climate in Homo sapiens population. The generated human drought sensitivity behavior values were inverted, i.e. lower and higher human drought sensitivity behavior values indicated higher and lower human sensitivity to drought, respectively.

The scarcity of information on factors influencing N2O emissions from sheep excreta in subtropical ecosystems such as those of Southern Brazil led us to conduct field trials in three different winter pasture seasons on an integrated crop–livestock system (ICL) in order to assess N2O emission factors (EF-N2O) in response to variable rates of urine and dung. Materials and methods: The equivalent urine-N loading rates for the three winter seasons (2009, 2010, and 2013) ranged from 96 to 478 kg ha−1, and the dung-N rates applied in 2009 and 2010 were 81 and 76 kg ha−1, respectively. Air was sampled from closed static chambers (0.20 m in diameter) for approximately 40 days after excreta application and analyzed for N2O by gas chromatography. Results and discussion: Soil N2O-N fluxes spanned the ranges 4 to 353 μg m−2 h−1 in 2009, − 47 to 976 μg m−2 h−1 in 2010, and 46 to 339 μg m−2 h−1 in 2013. Urine addition resulted in N2O-N peaks within for up to 20–30 days after application in the 3 years, and the strength of the peaks was linearly related to the N rate used. Emission factors of N2O (EF-N2O, % of N applied that is emitted as N2O) of urine ranged from 0.06 to 0.34% and were essentially independent of N rate applied. By considering a ratio of N excreted by urine and dung of 60:40, a single combined excretal EF-N2O of 0.14% was estimated. Conclusions: Our findings showed higher mean EF-N2O for sheep urine than that for dung (0.21% vs 0.03%), irrespective of the occurrence or not of urine patches overlap. This value is much lower than default value of 1% of IPCC’s Tier 1 and reinforces the needs of its revision. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Greenhouse gases; Livestock; Nitrous oxide; Subtropical environment","grazing; greenhouse gas; mixed farming; nitrous oxide; pasture; sheep; subtropical region; urine; Brazil; Ovis aries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074663413

These simulations are widely used to isolate the dynamical contributions to variability and trends in trace gas species. However, it is not clear if trends in the stratospheric overturning circulation are properly reproduced by SD schemes. This study assesses numerous SD schemes and modeling choices in the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Whole Atmosphere Chemistry Climate Model (WACCM) to determine a set of best practices for reproducing interannual variability and trends in tropical stratospheric upwelling estimated by reanalyses. Nudging toward the reanalysis meteorology as is typically done in SD simulations does not accurately reproduce lower-stratospheric upwelling trends present in the underlying reanalysis. In contrast, nudging to anomalies from the climatological winds or anomalies from the zonal-mean winds and temperatures better reproduces trends in lower-stratospheric upwelling, possibly because these schemes do not disrupt WACCM's climatology. None of the schemes substantially alter the structure of upwelling trends - instead, they make the trends more or less AMIP-like. An SD scheme's performance in simulating the acceleration of the shallow branch of the mean meridional circulation from 1980 to 2017 hinges on its ability to simulate the downward shift of subtropical lower-stratospheric wave momentum forcing. Key to this is <i>not</i> nudging the zonal-mean temperature field. Gravity wave momentum forcing, which drives a substantial fraction of the upwelling in WACCM, cannot be constrained by nudging and presents an upper limit on the performance of these schemes. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Here we use a regional climate model to examine the response of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) to two projected anthropogenic aerosol emission scenarios (a) short-lived climate pollutant “mitigation” scenario (2020–2030) and (b) current legislation “baseline” scenario (2005–2015). In the mitigation scenario, carbonaceous aerosol (black carbon and organic carbon) emissions are projected to decrease while sulfate emissions are projected to increase. This is expected to result in a marginal increase in anthropogenic aerosol optical depth over India (by 0.04–0.08). The dominating effect of scattering aerosols over absorbing aerosols in the mitigation scenario is expected to enhance atmospheric cooling over the Indian landmass, which in turn dampens the latitudinal thermal gradient and leads to a weakening of the ISM. This effect also reduces dust emissions over the Arabian Peninsula and transport across the Arabian Sea, decreasing the influence of the dust radiative feedback on the ISM. In addition, the increased amounts of sulfate and decreased amounts of carbonaceous aerosols are expected to result in drier conditions over the central parts of India. We also show that changes in emissions of different types of anthropogenic aerosols induce a chain of feedbacks, which can modulate the space-time variability of dust, thereby affecting the magnitude of dust radiative effects on the ISM dynamics. We conclude that it is critical from the policy point of view to implement strategies to cut the currently increasing sulfate emissions. © 2020. American Geophysical Union.

Two hundred households in two villages receive the benefits from biogas technology in many ways. It requires 217 m3/day of biogas to cover amounts of 100 kg/day of LPG that has been previously used. The heat energy cost is decreased from previously paid of 400 baht/month (12 USD/month) on LPG down to 100 baht/month (3 USD/month) with the existence of biogas as a cooking fuel. Biogas not only is used as energy source for cooking, but also contributes to the reduction of environmental pollutions produced by municipal solid waste. It helps in reducing methane (CH4) release to atmosphere by 400 kg equivalent to 10,000 kg CO2. Local communities gain new knowledge in biogas technology and its benefits. Major success to the biogas program comes from the collaboration between the solid waste disposal center, households, and government department.

The results of the comparisons, performed with reference to a state-of-the-art double pilot-Main (pM) strategy, are presented in terms of engine-out exhaust emissions, combustion noise (CN) and fuel consumption. Rate-shaped main injections, when included in delayed multiple injection patterns, have shown a minor influence on reducing NOx, while a slight deterioration in soot has been found. Both a double pilot and a boot injection schedule have been able to reduce CN at low loads. A higher reduction in CN has been obtained with an injection fusion event. Finally, DoE optimized triple and quadruple injection strategies have led to improved soot-NOx trade-offs, with respect to the pM calibration. In fact, splitting the injection helps to entrain air inside the fuel plumes, thus creating locally leaner mixture (less prone to forming soot) and allowing increasing the EGR rates (reducing NOx formation). © 2020, KSAE/113-01.","Boot injection; Closely-coupled injections; DoE calibration optimization; Multiple injections; Rate-shaped injection","Acoustic noise; Calibration; Combustion; Deterioration; Diesel engines; Economic and social effects; Fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Soot; Exhaust emission; Experimental investigations; Low compression ratios; Multiple injections; NOx formation; Performance and emissions; Pollutant emission; State of the art; Compression ratio (machinery)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078166353

Renewable sources have an intermittent power output to the electrical grid, thus EES represents a strategic solution in balancing electrical grids and enables the decarbonisation of the energy sector. Cryogenic Energy Storage (CES) is a novel method of EES falling within the thermo-mechanical category. It is based on storing liquid cryogenic fluids after their liquefaction from an initially gaseous state. A particular form of CES, Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES), has gained growing attention respect to other cryogens. The current state of LAES is still at the development and demonstration stage since no commercial or pre-commercial plants have been built. This technology has been developed in different ways throughout its history (from 1977), and, to the best of our knowledge, no review paper has been published so far about the CES topic. Therefore, the present paper intends to provide a clear picture of the CES/LAES virtues in the literature as well as the challenges associated to the system to be commercially viable. For this purpose, this review includes: an investigation of the properties of cryogens and different CES processes as well as the main ways the system could be combined to other facilities to further enhance the energy efficiency, in particular the combination to a refrigerated warehouse with cold energy recovery from the cryogen evaporation. © 2019","Cryogenic energy storage; Electrical energy storage; Global efficiency; Liquid air; Renewable energy","Air; Balancing; Cryogenics; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Greenhouse gases; Liquefied gases; Renewable energy resources; Electrical energy storages; Global efficiency; Integration of renewable energies; Renewable energies; Renewable energy integrations; Renewable sources; Storage technology; Strategic solutions; Cryogenic energy storage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076004660

As scientists, we know more and more about our environment, about processes, rates of change, new threats, and risks. However, the challenges we face seem to grow quicker than the solutions we can create. To achieve sustainability, the key is to make solutions not only functional from an environmental point of view, but also socially acceptable and economically viable. In this context, the TERRAenVISION conference series gathers diverse groups of scientists to discuss sustainability. The first TERRAenVISION meeting in January 2018 was framed around 7 themes: (1) Climate Change: Mitigation and Adaptation, (2) Water Resources: Quality and Quantity, (3) Land Degradation and Restoration, (4) Nature-based Solutions, (5) Fire in the Earth System, Effects, and Prevention, (6) Ecosystem Services and Health, and (7) Science Interface with Policy and Public. Among the works presented in the conference, this Special Issue collates 22 papers that illustrate the best, problems and solutions the scientific community is currently working on to achieve sustainability. Similar to the concept of the SDGs, paper subjects often intertwine and bridge the conference themes. The papers are grouped in two main chapters dealing with Water and Land, with two additional cross cutting chapters of Scientific Tools and Science-Policy Interface. Drawing from the conclusions of these works as well as those of the TERRAenVISION 2018 conference, we make recommendations regarding raising awareness, connecting scientific fields, and supporting robust economic and policy transitions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Awareness; Economy transitions; Policy transitions; Sustainability; Transdisciplinarity","awareness; climate change; ecosystem restoration; Editorial; environmental policy; environmental sustainability; human activities; priority journal; water supply",Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076586786

Two distinctly different current domains, namely, region I and region II have been identified in I–V dependence. I–V data for region I have been used for the evaluation of ideality factor which varies from 1.478 to 3.932 when the temperature changes from 350 to 110 K. We have also investigated how far the existing models account for our experimental results. From an analysis of the Arrhenius plot of I–V–T curves in terms of the model due to Hirsch and Barriere it is found that the domains are distinguished by current transport mechanisms governed by hole thermionic emission and hole tunneling which are discussed in detail. Next, estimating the data on voltage gradient obtained from the open circuit voltage decay method, as well as those of ideality factor from the I–V measurement, the temperature dependence of carrier lifetime has been evaluated. A logarithmic plot of carrier lifetime as a function of inverse temperature shows a weak temperature-dependence below 228 K and this region gives important information regarding the dominant energy level of traps assisting tunneling of current carriers in the device. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Carrier lifetime; Ideality factor; InGaN; OCVD method; Trap level","Arrhenius plots; Current voltage characteristics; Gallium alloys; III-V semiconductors; Indium alloys; Inverse problems; Light emitting diodes; Open circuit voltage; Semiconductor alloys; Temperature distribution; Thermionic emission; Blue light emitting diodes; Current transport mechanism; Ideality factors; InGaN; OCVD method; Open circuit voltage decays; Temperature dependence of current; Trap levels; Carrier lifetime",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077874560

However, with increasing attention on environmental protection issues, coal distribution centers need to focus on their environmental impacts during the construction and operation process. This paper develops an integrated approach to achieve the environmentally-friendly coal distribution sites selection process. In this study, suitable candidate sites were first selected by employing big data tools and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) technology, then an equilibrium strategy based multi-objective bi-level model was proposed to resolve the potential conflicts of interest between authority and the collieries. This model pursued maximum revenue and minimum coal dust emissions in order to achieve harmonious development of both the economy and the environment, and it was simplified into an easier calculation form with interactive solutions. The proposed method was then proven to be applicable by providing practical application from China and analyzing the computational results under different scenarios. Recommendations at the managerial level based on this methodology could assist administrators in different regions to make informed decisions and develop reasonable policies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Coal distribution center; Environmental friendly; Equilibrium strategy; Site selection","Coal; Environmental impact; Site selection; Supply chains; Warehouses; Computational results; Distribution centers; Environmental-friendly; Equilibrium strategy; Harmonious development; Informed decision; Integrated approach; Potential conflict; Coal dust",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074436160

One key issue is how similar the factors determining species’ distributions across spatial scales are (here we focus especially on spatial extents). If the factors are similar across extents, then the large scale distribution pattern of a species may provide information about its local habitat requirements, and vice versa. We assessed the relationships between landscape and national optima as well as landscape and continental optima for growing degree days, maximum temperature and minimum temperature for 96 bryophytes and 50 vascular plants. For this set of species, we derived landscape optima from abundance weighted temperature data using species inventories in central Sweden and a fine-grained temperature model (50 m), national optima from niche centroid modelling based on GBIF data from Sweden and the same fine-grained climate model, and continental optima using the same method as for the national optima but from GBIF data from Europe and Worldclim temperatures (c. 1000 m). The landscape optima of all species were positively correlated with national as well as continental optima for maximum temperature (r = 0.45 and 0.46, respectively), weakly so for growing degree days (r = 0.30 and r = 0.28), but sometimes absent for minimum temperature (r = 0.26 and r = 0.04). The regression slopes of national or continental optima on local optima did not differ between vascular plants and bryophytes for GDD and Tmax. However, the relationship between the optima of Tmin differed between groups, being positive in vascular plants but absent in bryophytes. Our results suggest that positive correlations between optima at different spatial scales are present for some climatic variables but not for others. Moreover, our results for vascular plants and bryophytes suggest that correlations might differ between organism groups and depend on the ecology of the focal organisms. This implies that it is not possible to routinely up- or downscale distribution patterns based on environmental correlations, since drivers of distribution patterns might differ across spatial extents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bryophyte; Climatic optima; Distribution; Microclimate; Spatial scale; Vascular plant","abundance; bryophyte; climate change; correlation; microclimate; regression analysis; temperature; vascular plant; Sweden; bryophytes; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075390402

Drawing on a wide range of case studies including Brazil, China and Chile, the authors use a comparative approach to examine the policies and programmes being implemented, looking at the existing legal frameworks and regulatory challenges. By showcasing stories of success, as well as barriers to energy efficiency, they highlight the opportunities for increased energy access and efficiency and demonstrate how these opportunities may directly impact on climate change mitigation.

At present, it facilitates exchange among European Union (EU) Member States and much of the rest of the world. Maritime transport forms the main axis of international exchange, carrying ~90% of total traded tonnage. In doing so, it bears responsibility for 2.5% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. The efforts to reduce negative environmental impact of transport activity is centered on better modal integration of the common transport system, sustainability, green technologies in the transport sector, resource efficiency, and carbon emissions reduction. The International Maritime Organization has tasked its members to achieve a 70% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 or, if possible, to eliminate them altogether. From a business end, it is possible to apply a variety of technologies to ensure zero-emissions or, at the least, a dramatic reduction of emissions in the shipping sector. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the strategic approach to the decarbonization process based on EU strategic documents and low-emission and zero-emission technologies, used and developed, in maritime transport. An estimation of external costs incurred by maritime transport will allow for the assessment of benefits resulting from the application of technologies and alternative fuels proposed in the solutions. On the basis of the obtained results from the external cost valuation it will be possible to estimate the potential for decarbonization in maritime transport. © Copyright © 2020 Czermański, Pawłowska, Oniszczuk-Jastrząbek and Cirella.","cost valuation; emission reductions; EU; external costs theory; IMO; shipping and the environment","Alternative fuels; Cost estimating; Decarbonization; Emission control; Environmental technology; Europium; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Ships; Sustainable development; Waterway transportation; Carbon emissions reductions; Emission reduction; External costs; International exchange; International maritime organizations; Reduction of emissions; Resource efficiencies; Shipping and the environments; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082556615

Detailed metallicity maps and gradients are derived for a subsample of 28 galaxies from reconstructed source-plane emission-line maps, exploiting the variety of different emission-line diagnostics provided by the broad wavelength coverage of the survey. About 85 per cent of these galaxies are characterized by metallicity gradients shallower than 0.05 dex kpc-1 and 89 per cent are consistent with a flat slope within 3s (67 per cent within 1s), suggesting a mild evolution with cosmic time. In the context of cosmological simulations and chemical evolution models, the presence of efficient feedback mechanisms and/or extended star formation profiles on top of the classical 'inside-out' scenario of mass assembly is generally required to reproduce the observed flatness of the metallicity gradients beyond z ~ 1. Three galaxies with significantly (&gt;3σ) 'inverted' gradients are also found, showing an anticorrelation between metallicity and star formation rate density on local scales, possibly suggesting recent episodes of pristine gas accretion or strong radial flows in place. Nevertheless, the individual metallicity maps are characterized by a variety of different morphologies,with flat radial gradients sometimes hiding non-axisymmetric variations on kpc scales, which are washed out by azimuthal averages, especially in interacting systems or in those undergoing local episodes of recent star formation. © 2019 The Author(s).","Galaxies: abundances; Galaxies: evolution; Galaxies: high-redshift",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079460695

Solvent-dependent effect in photoluminescence provides a facial and effective approach to tune the emission of CDs. In this study, green emissive nitrogen-doped carbon dots (N-CDs) are synthesized from p-hydroquinone and ethylenediamine through a simple hydrothermal method. The as-prepared N-CDs possess a robust excitation-independent green luminescence and a high PLQY of up to 15.9%. Further spectroscopic characterization indicates that the high PLQY is achieved by the balance of nitrogen doping states and the surface passivation extent in CDs. The N-CDs also exhibit solvent-dependent multi-color emissive property and distinct PLQY in different solvents (the maximum can reach up to 25.3%). Furthermore, the as-prepared N-CDs are applied as fluorescence probes to detect acetone and H2O2 in water. This method has exhibited a low detection limit of acetone (less than 0.1%) and a quick and linear response to the H2O2 with the concentration from 0 to 120 μmol/L.

This study examines the question: how do networked organisations build capacity for anticipatory governance through project-based interactions? We analyse a global network of organisations that mobilise climate and hydrological modelling technologies into the Chao Phraya and Ayeyarwaddy deltas. The methodology innovatively combines ethnographic data with policy analysis and social network analysis. Findings suggest that organisations consolidate technology and knowledge transfer through a global network. However, their governance effect in enhancing anticipatory decision making is found to be marginal at the local level. We argue that anticipatory governance practices need a balancing of foresight tools and techniques with local institutional arrangements in order to be effective. We further demonstrate that technology transfer projects need to be backed up with social and strategic capacity building in order to nurture consistent anticipatory governance in different cultural contexts. We conclude that preventive actions, together with transparent operational response frameworks, could significantly improve resilience and adaptability of local knowledge systems and institutions dealing with climate change adaptation. Such integration could enable anticipatory response measures to better manage risk, as well as increase institutional cooperation for long term environmental planning. © 2020 The Authors","Anticipatory governance; Capacity building; Environmental planning; Global networks; Modelling technologies; Project-based interactions","capacity building; climate modeling; decision making; environmental planning; ethnography; future prospect; governance approach; hydrological modeling; policy analysis; project management; social network; technology transfer; Ayeyarwady; Central Region [Thailand]; Chao Phraya Delta; Irrawaddy Delta; Myanmar; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077744745

Such sources can then be used to characterize and calibrate instruments used to assay Pu for materials control and accountancy, nuclear safeguards, and nuclear security applications. An important contribution determining the ultimate accuracy of this technique is how well the neutron multiplicity distribution of 252Cf is known (actually the low order factorial moments are typically used). This knowledge governs how well the emission rate of the 252Cf sources can be determined. Additionally, because 252Cf is used as a reference standard against which other spontaneously fissile systems are compared, it also governs the scaling of the 252Cf characterization and calibration data to the corresponding performance estimates for the spontaneously fissile Pu-nuclides. The main scale setting parameter is nu-bar, the average number of neutrons released following fission, of 252Cf. This is a fundamental nuclear constant. In this work we briefly review the 14 high quality absolute determinations of nu-bar and subject them to a full covariance evaluation. This is compared to several variants of weighted mean, including an extension where an allowance is made for the uncertainty in the estimated variance on each point. The prompt nu-bar value was found to be robust to the different statistical assessment methods applied, and moreover, the overall uncertainty estimates were of similar magnitude. Based on the full covariance treatment a prompt nu-bar value of (3.7573 ± 0.0056) prompt neutrons per fission was obtained, where the uncertainty is at the 1–σ level (68% confidence interval). This compares favorably with the value of Zucker and Holden, (3.757 ± 0.010) prompt neutrons per fission, long used in the nuclear safeguards community. The relative standard deviation of 0.15% obtained from the analysis reported here is sufficiently small that we advocate for a new high accuracy determination of the delayed neutron contribution, since this is needed to correct the Mn-bath class of nu-bar measurements. Collectively the measurements span the period 1963 to 1985. Of the 14 measurements six carry very little weight (individually 2% or less), five carry intermediate weight (individually 3%–7%), while three values are highly weighted (individually 15%–32%). These have reported relative standard deviations of between 0.2% and 0.3%. Given the small number of measurements with small reported uncertainties, and the fact that the youngest such determination is over 30 years old, we also strongly suggest that new measurements of the highest currently achievable quality are needed. In this regard a high efficiency 3He based counter would remove the residual concern over γ-sensitivity of doped liquid scintillator tank data. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","252Cf source strength; 252Cf spontaneous fission; Data fitting; Nu-bar; Nuclear data evaluation","Neutrons; Nuclear materials safeguards; Quality control; Statistics; Uncertainty analysis; Covariance evaluations; Data fittings; Neutron multiplicity counting; Nuclear data; Relative standard deviations; Source strength; Spontaneous fission; Statistical assessment; Fission reactions",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061150826

The AOM-SR can lead to the formation of methane-derived authigenic carbonates which entrap sulfide minerals (pyrite) and carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS). We studied the sulfur isotope compositions of the pyrite and CAS in seafloor methane-derived authigenic carbonate crust samples from the North Sea and Barents Sea which reflect the time-integrated metabolic activity of the AOM-SR community as well as the physical conditions under which those carbonates are formed. In these samples, pyrite exhibits δ34S values ranging from −23.4‰ to 14.8‰ and Δ33S values between −0.06‰ and 0.16‰, whereas CAS is characterized by δ34S values ranging from 26.2‰ to 61.6‰ and Δ33S mostly between −0.05‰ and 0.07‰. Such CAS sulfur isotope compositions are distinctly lower in δ34S-Δ33S space from published porewater sulfate values from environments where the reduction of sulfate is mostly coupled to sedimentary organic matter oxidation. Mass-balance modelling suggests that (1) AOM-SR appears to cause rapid carbonate precipitation under high methane flux near or at the sediment-water interface and (2) that the precipitation of pyrite and carbonates are not necessarily synchronous. The sulfur isotopic composition of pyrite is interpreted to reflect more variable precipitating conditions of evolving sulfide with porewater connectivity, fluctuating methane fluxes and oxidative sulfur cycle. Taken together, the multiple isotopic compositions of pyrite and sulfate in methane-derived authigenic carbonates indicate protracted precipitation under conditions of non-steady state methane seepage activity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","anaerobic oxidation of methane; methane-derived authigenic carbonates; microbial sulfate reduction; multiple sulfur isotopes; pyrite and carbonate-associated sulfate","Carbonates; Carbonation; Isotopes; Oxidation; Pyrites; Submarine geology; Sulfate minerals; Anaerobic oxidation of methanes; Carbonate-associated sulfates; Methane-derived authigenic carbonates; Multiple sulfur isotopes; Sulfate reduction; Methane; carbonate sediment; hydrocarbon seep; methane; oxidation; precipitation (chemistry); pyrite; sulfate; sulfur cycle; sulfur isotope; Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Barents Sea; North Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076516010

Based on data from an online survey conducted in 2018 in the United Kingdom (N = 787), a latent class analysis reveals that there are five climate change opinion publics. The two largest publics have strong beliefs that climate change is occurring, but view it as a low salience issue, or are wary of government action to address it.

A total of 641 separate events were collated from 40 experimental field sites. Individual EFs ranged over an order of magnitude (0–12% of applied N) for each fertiliser type, following a log-normal distribution in all cases. Our study shows that a Bayesian approach can provide a robust statistical method that is capable of performing uncertainty analysis on log-normal distributed data in a more defensible manner than conventional statistical methods allow. This method allowed for a national scale comparison of EFs between the most commonly applied mineral fertilisers based solely on previously published data (UK and Ireland in this case). The study shows that ammonium nitrate (AN) and Calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) are the largest emitting fertiliser types by mass across the British Isles (temperate climate zone), with EFs of 1.1 (1.0–1.2) % and 1.0 (0.7–1.3) % for all recorded events, respectively; however, emissions from AN applications were significantly lower for applications to arable fields (0.6%) than to grasslands (1.3%). EFs associated with urea (CO(NH₂)₂) were significantly lower than AN for grasslands with an EF of 0.6 (0.5–0.7) %, but slightly higher for arable fields with an EF of 0.7 (0.4–1.4) %. The study highlights the potential effectiveness of microbial inhibitors at reducing emissions of N2O from mineral fertilisers, with Dicyandiamide (DCD) treated AN reducing emissions by approximately 28% and urea treated with either DCD or N-(n)-butyl) thiophosphorictriamide (NBTP) reducing emissions by approximately 40%. Although limited by a relatively small sample size (n = 11), urea treated with both DCD and NBPT appeared to have the lowest EF of all treatments at 0.13 (0.08–0.21) %, highlighting the potential to significantly reduce N2O emissions at regional scales if applied instead of conventional nitrogen fertilisers. © 2019 The Authors","Agriculture; Ammonium nitrate; Greenhouse gas; Microbial inhibitor; N2O; National inventory; Urea","Agriculture; Barium alloys; Bayesian networks; Calcium compounds; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Metabolism; Minerals; Nitrates; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Normal distribution; Statistical methods; Urea; Ammonium nitrate; Bayesian approaches; Log-normal distribution; Microbial inhibitor; National inventory; Nitrous oxide emission factors; Reducing emissions; Robust statistical method; Uncertainty analysis; amide; ammonium nitrate; calcium; dicyandiamide; fertilizer; n butythiophosphorictriamide; unclassified drug; fertilizer; mineral; nitrous oxide; ammonium nitrate; Bayesian analysis; emission; experimental study; fertilizer application; greenhouse gas; nitrogen dioxide; nitrous oxide; urea; Article; Bayes theorem; comparative study; controlled study; grassland; greenhouse gas; Ireland; nitrification; nitrous oxide emission; priority journal; quantitative analysis; United Kingdom; agriculture; air pollutant; soil; Ireland; United Kingdom; Agriculture; Air Pollutants; Bayes Theorem; Fertilizers; Ireland; Minerals; Nitrous Oxide; Soil; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076391239

With limited prospects for technical- or policy-based reductions in sectoral carbon emissions, behavioural shifts in the form of decreased demand for flying become increasingly important. This conceptual article introduces an innovative approach to aviation demand reduction in the form of a co-benefits approach, wherein conventional pro-environmental messaging is augmented by the articulation of the negative personal health impacts of flying. Using a critical review approach based on secondary literature, we examine frequent flying and theories of environmental behaviour change before examining how co-benefits approaches have been used in other domains. We then identify global and local environmental harms from aviation and synthesise these with the existing literature on the personal health impacts of frequent flying, which includes both physiological effects and psycho-social harms. We find that flying less would engender a much wider range of benefits for individual health, than for the environment, and that the health benefits would likely be more salient for frequent flyers than environmental benefits. We conclude that the personal nature of health impacts will add needed salience and urgency to efforts to reduce unsustainable aeromobility. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","behavioural salience; Co-benefits; environment; frequent flyers; personal health; self-interest","air transportation; environmental factor; health impact; health status; literature review; physiology; transportation system; travel behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065640573

Sorption-enhanced water-gas shift (SEWGS) combines the water-gas shift reaction with in-situ adsorption of CO2 on potassium-promoted hydrotalcite (K-HTC). This enables a direct conversion of syngas into separate hot streams of H2 at feed pressure and CO2 at regeneration pressure, making the process attractive for pre-combustion carbon capture and storage (CCS) and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The current work is evaluating the high-temperature, high-pressure adsorption step of the SEWGS process enhanced by a novel technology which replaces common packed bed reactors with 3D-printed monolithic structures. This approach would enable an overall increase in process productivity. To this extent, innovative dynamic models based on validated competitive adsorption isotherms were developed in this work. COMSOL Multiphysics was used to develop a 1D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of adsorption for a fixed bed reactor in order to verify the model accuracy against existing studies. Subsequently, 2D CFD simulations were developed to describe adsorption inside monolith structures, both free and porous regions. The multi-component adsorption isotherm used in the simulations was validated with published breakthrough capacities for CO2 and H2O at different pressures. Model predictions are in agreement with expected behavior, as monolith reactors provide a more efficient mass transfer, and will be used to enhance the performance of experimental monolith structures used in SEWGS. © 2020 Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania.

They provide various ecosystem services (carbon dioxide sequestration, pollution removal, water retention, climate regulation, etc.) as long as they are in good condition. By definition, wetlands are rich in water ecosystems. However, ongoing climate change with an ambiguous balance of rain in a temperate climate zone leads to drought conditions. Such periods interfere with the natural processes occurring on wetlands and restrain the normal functioning of wetland ecosystems. Persisting unfavorable water conditions lead to irreversible changes in wetland habitats. Hence, the monitoring of habitat changes caused by an insufficient amount of water (plant water stress) is necessary. Unfortunately, due to the specific conditions of wetlands, monitoring them by both traditional and remote sensing techniques is challenging, and research on wetland water stress has been insufficient. This paper describes the adaptation of the thermal water stress index, also known as the crop water stress index (CWSI), for wetlands. This index is calculated based on land surface temperature and meteorological parameters (temperature and vapor pressure deficit-VPD). In this study, an unmanned aerial system (UAS) was used to measure land surface temperature. Performance of the CWSI was confirmed by the high correlation with field measurements of a fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (R = 0.70) and soil moisture (R = 0.62). Comparison of the crop water stress index with meteorological drought indices showed that the first phase of drought (meteorological drought) cannot be detected with this index. This study confirms the potential of using the CWSI as a water stress indicator in wetland ecosystems. © 2020 by the author.","Biebrza River Valley; CWSI; Drought monitoring; Janów Forest Landscape Park; LST; Thermal infrared; UAS","Antennas; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Crops; Drought; Ecosystems; Forestry; Hydrogeology; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; River pollution; Soil moisture; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Wetlands; CWSI; Drought monitoring; Forest landscape; River valley; Thermal infrared; Land surface temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080889590

The impact of frequency and duration of extreme air quality has received considerable attention. The extreme concentration of air pollution is related to its duration and annual frequency of occurrence known as concentration–duration–frequency (CDF) relationships. However, the CDF formulas are empirical equations representing the relationship between the maximum concentration as a dependent variable and other parameters of interest, i.e., duration and annual frequency of occurrence. As a basis for deducing the extreme CDF relationship of PM2.5, the function assumes that the extreme concentration is related to the duration and frequency. In addition, the spatial pattern estimation of extreme PM2.5 is identified. The regional CDF identifies the regional extreme concentration with a specified duration and return period. The spatial pattern of extreme air pollution over 8 h duration shows the hotspots of air quality in the central and southwestern areas. Central and southwestern Taiwan is at high risk of exposure to air pollution. Use of the regional CDF analysis is highly recommended for efficient design of air quality management and control. © 2020 by the authors.

In this study, the electrochemical CO2 reduction mechanism over the Cu catalysts with various oxidation states was studied by using in situ surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS), in situ soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (Cu L-edge), and online gas chromatography measurements. The atop-adsorbed CO (COatop) intermediate is obtained on the electrodeposited Cu surface which primarily has the oxidation state of Cu(I). COatop is further reduced, followed by the formation of C1 product such as CH4. The residual bridge-adsorbed CO (CObridge) is formed on the as-prepared Cu surface with Cu(0) which inhibits hydrocarbon formation. In contrast, the CV-treated Cu electrode prepared by oxidizing the as-prepared Cu surface contains different amounts of Cu(I) and Cu(0) states. The major theme of this work is that in situ SEIRAS results show the coexistence of COatop and CObridge as the reaction intermediates during CO2 reduction and that the selectivity of CO2-to-ethylene conversion is further enhanced in the CV-treated Cu electrode. The Cu catalysts modulated by the electrochemical method exhibit different oxidation states and reaction intermediates as well as electrocatalytic properties. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Copper compounds; Electrocatalysts; Electrochemical electrodes; Ethylene; Gas chromatography; Light absorption; Oxidation; Reduction; X ray absorption spectroscopy; X rays; Adsorbed intermediates; Electrocatalytic properties; ELectrochemical methods; Ethylene conversions; Hydrocarbon formation; Online gas chromatography; Soft x-ray absorption spectroscopies; Surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy; Reaction intermediates; carbon dioxide; copper; ethylene; hydrocarbon; methane; absorption spectroscopy; Article; catalyst; chemical parameters; chemical reaction; chemical structure; controlled study; electrochemistry; gas chromatography; in situ surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy; oxidation; reduction (chemistry); surface property; X ray absorption spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079328389

Methods and Materials: The study (NCT 01391065) recruited patients with residual or recurrent disease after hysterectomy. Patients underwent baseline T2 weighted (T2W) MRI, 18F-flouro-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG), 18F-flouro thymidine (18F-FLT) and 18F-flouromisonidazole (18F-F Miso) positron emission tomography (PET) and received external radiation (50 Gy/25 fractions for 5 weeks) and weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m2). MRI was performed at brachytherapy and used for delineation of clinical target volume (CTV). Patients with parametrial disease at baseline received interstitial brachytherapy (16-20 Gy/4-5 fractions) and those with vaginal disease received intracavitary brachytherapy (12-14 Gy/2-4 fractions). Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to evaluate locoregional relapse, disease free survival, and overall survival. Common Toxicity Criteria for adverse event reporting (CTCAE) v4.1 was used for toxicity scoring and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questtionaire Core 30 (QLQC-30) and Cx 24 for quality-of-life reporting. Results: Between January 2011 and February 2016, 60 patients were included, of which 50 received study treatment. The mean gross tumor volume on T2 W MR was 20 (IQR 3.6-90) cc. The metabolic tumor volume was 15 (interquartile range [IQR] 2.1-56.1) cc. The median FLT volume was 10 (IQR 0-48) cc. A total of 8 patients had 18-F F Miso uptake. The median CTV at brachytherapy was 38 (12-85) cc. The median CTVD90 and D 98 was 71 (53-74) and 74 (53-74) Gy. At a median follow-up of 60 (5-93) months, the 5-year local control, disease free survival, and overall survival were 84%, 73%, and 74.5%, respectively. Grade III and IV proctitis and cystitis were observed in 4% and 2% of patients. On multivariate analysis baseline tumor volume, on T2 W MR impacted disease free (91% vs 65%, P =.03) and overall survival (96% vs 77%, P =.06).

The results of the combustion period characteristics, versus the three types of emulsion fuel and the turbocharger compression ratios, shows that the combustion period is shortened in the order of CR00 > CR01 > CR02 > CR03, according to the compression ratio of the turbocharger. As the fuel water content increases, the combustion period is shortened in the order of EMDO16 < EMDO13 < EMDO10. The nitrogen oxide and black carbon reduction was because the combustion period increased, with increasing compression ratio, while the combustion period was shortened, with increasing moisture content of emulsion fuel. This also caused is an increase in the combustion pressure and a shortening of the combustion period, due to the expansion of the volume, in turn due to the micro-explosion of water. This may be due to the shortening of the post combustion period and the reduction of black carbon emissions. In addition, combustion was accelerated in the order-CR00 > CR01> CR02> CR03.

This study proposes a unified analytical framework for anticipating such gains in 2020 and estimates the key factors involved using data envelopment analysis based models. The results indicate that: (1) when the value of the marginal abatement cost is higher than the carbon price, no regions will have an incentive to reduce emissions by technological improvements. The only source of direct potential gains is from the amounts of carbon quota. (2) As carbon price increases from CNY 10 to 4000 per ton, the indirect potential gains will increase because the strategies for carbon reduction are technological innovation or limit economic activities. However, Jiangsu and Shanghai will suffer potential losses even though the price is high because they have no more carbon reduction potential. (3) Most central provinces will have potential gains when the carbon price is lower in ETS, while regions rich in fossil energy sources will suffer potential losses. However, a middle-price interval of CNY 1000–2000/ton is more rational, because it helps motivate market transactions and benefits low-carbon technological innovations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon price; Data envelopment analysis (DEA); Emissions trading scheme (ETS); Potential gains","Commerce; Data envelopment analysis; Emission control; Carbon price; Carbon reduction potentials; Emissions Trading Scheme; Fossil energy sources; Marginal abatement costs; Potential gains; Technological improvements; Technological innovation; Carbon; assessment method; carbon emission; data envelopment analysis; emission control; emissions trading; China; Jiangsu; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076203154

To minimize the social costs of future climate change and to promote economic development through identification of cost-effective adaptation strategies and mitigation policies, quantitative assessments are needed for obtaining a better understanding of the causal impacts of climate change on human society. In this work, we estimate the economic impacts of climate change during the 21st century under nine CMIP6 scenarios, using the PAGE-ICE integrated assessment model driven by the latest anthropogenic emission and socio-economic projections. Our results show that the largest climate change damages occur under the SSP3-7.0 scenario (involving regional rivalry and high anthropogenic emissions), followed by the SSP3-LowNTCF scenario (which considers significantly reduced NTCF emissions), and that climate change damage costs are expected to grow much faster than global GDP (reaching ~47% of global GDP in 2100). Gaps in adaptation resulting from regional inequalities would lead to higher climate change damages in poorer and warmer regions such as Africa and the Middle East. The outcomes obtained under the SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 scenarios, in which the warming limit targets of 1.5 °C and 2 °C set forth in the Paris Agreement are considered, respectively, reveal that aggressive mitigation strategies pass a cost-benefit analysis and could significantly reduce the economic impacts of climate change. © 2019","Anthropogenic emissions; Climate change; CMIP6 scenarios; Economic impacts","Climate models; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Economic and social effects; Adaptation strategies; Anthropogenic emissions; CMIP6 scenarios; Economic development; Economic impacts; Integrated assessment models; Mitigation policies; Quantitative assessments; Climate change; fossil fuel; anthropogenic source; climate change; CMIP; cost-benefit analysis; economic impact; future prospect; scenario analysis; Article; climate change; cost benefit analysis; economic aspect; futurology; human impact (environment); priority journal; Africa; Middle East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075351261

The results show that there is a clear inverted-U relationship between environmental regulations and CO2 emissions in the IS industry. Additionally, there are regional heterogeneity and regulatory intensity on the impact of environmental regulations on CO2 emissions. The results in the eastern region are consistent with the whole sample results, while the upward trend in the central region and the downward trend in the western region together lay the basis for the inverted-U shape of the whole sample. High environmental regulations affect CO2 emissions in an inverted-U shape, while low environmental regulations present a U shape. The mechanisms of environmental regulations affecting CO2 emissions are synergy effect and technological innovation effect.

However, the trade-off relationship between CH4 and NOX emissions limits the development of dual-fuel (DF) engines. In order to resolve this problem, the effects of injection pressure (IP) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) ratio on the combustion and emission of diesel/NG dual-fuel engines are investigated in this study. The results show that the diesel/NG dual fuel has a distinct three-stage heat release characteristic in the high-temperature combustion process. As the injection pressure increases, the flame propagation speed of methane and the indicated thermal efficiency (ITE) increase. However, the methane in the crevice region and cylinder wall cannot be ignited because of low temperature; these are the main sources of methane emissions. When the EGR rate increases, the indicated thermal efficiency first increases and there after decreases, and diesel is cleaved through the reaction chain, PC4H9 → C2H4 → CH4, to produce CH4; this becomes one of the reasons for CH4 emissions. When the EGR rate is small (&lt;10%), CO and CH4 emissions are not sensitive to IP; when the EGR rate is large (&gt;30%), CO and CH4 emissions can be significantly reduced by increasing the IP. Accordingly, when the injection pressure is 160 MPa and the EGR rate is 20%, the diesel/NG DF engine can achieve higher ITE and lower emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Dual-fuel engine; EGR; Injection pressure; Natural gas; Performance","Combustion; Diesel engines; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Exhaust gas recirculation; Gas emissions; Methane; Natural gas; Temperature; Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR); Flame propagation speed; Heat release characteristic; High-temperature combustion; Indicated thermal efficiency; Injection pressures; Performance; Trade-off relationship; Dual fuel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073506678

Chinese Torreya (Torreya grandis 'Merrillii') has been an important crop tree in subtropical China for over a thousand years. It is necessary to characterize its adaptation to climate change. In this study, the average monthly temperature and precipitation from 1901 to 2017 in the six regions with Chinese Torreya plantations at different provinces were analyzed. The results indicated that the average annual air temperature across these regions had increased by about 2.0 °C, but no general trend in the annual precipitation and incidence of drought was found. The annual air temperature that Chinese Torreya plantations had experienced was 12.96-18.23 °C; the highest and the lowest average monthly air temperatures were 30.1 °C and-0.8 °C, respectively. The lowest and the highest annual precipitation were 874.56 mm and 2501.88 mm, respectively. Chinese Torreya trees endured a severe drought period in the 1920s. The monthly air temperature at Zhuji, which is the central production region, showed a significant correlation with the air temperature in the other five regions. The monthly precipitation in Hunan and Guizhou had no significant correlation with that of Zhuji. Chinese Torreya plantations have been grown in the regions with a similar climate distance index of air temperatures but different precipitation. This tree has a high capacity to adapt to climate change based on the climate dynamics across its range. This approach may provide a way to evaluate climate adaptation in other tree species. These results may provide helpful information for the development of Chinese Torreya plantations. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate distance index; Drought; Monthly air temperature; Monthly precipitation; Standardized precipitation index","Atmospheric temperature; Drought; Forestry; Adaptation to climate changes; Agricultural policies; Air temperature; Annual precipitation; Climate distance index; Climate dynamics; Standardized precipitation index; Subtropical China; Climate change; air temperature; climate change; coniferous tree; drought; plantation; precipitation (climatology); China; Guizhou; Hunan; Torreya; Torreya grandis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081168210

Water-saving irrigation technologies provide new ways for improving the efficiency of water use for agricultural production. Although efficient irrigation management could lead to water savings and increased yields, the water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions during the construction of irrigation projects also puts pressure on environmental health. However, little research has considered the environmental impact of the construction process and materials. To fill this gap, the water footprint (WF) and carbon footprint (CF) of irrigation projects were calculated using life cycle assessment (LCA) methods. The results for sixty typical irrigation projects in northern China showed that the WF accounted for only 0.2–1.5% of the total agricultural WF and 2.3–8.8% of the water saved. When the WF to construct modern irrigation systems is not considered, the water-saving effects of these systems are generally overestimated by 13%. The CF for irrigation projects was 42.0% of all agricultural activities. Due to the difficulty to obtain detailed information for irrigation projects, this paper established the relationship between financial investment or area and CF for three kinds of irrigation projects. It provided a simple quantitative method for assessing its environmental impacts. By comparing environmental impacts and production benefits under different scenarios, using drip irrigation over the long-term could increase crop yield and reduce water footprint, but carbon footprint was increased at the same time. This study suggests that it is necessary to assess the environmental impacts of irrigation construction projects from a life cycle perspective rather focusing only on yield increases and reductions in irrigation amounts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Environmental impact; Irrigation project; Life cycle assessment; Scenario; Water footprint","Artificial life; Carbon footprint; Emission control; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Project management; Water conservation; Water supply; Agricultural productions; Arid and semi-arid regions; Irrigation projects; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle perspectives; Scenario; Water footprint; Water-saving irrigation; Irrigation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074376502

The taxonomy of Chinese representatives has been studied primarily based on cursory morphological comparisons and their molecular phylogenetic analyses remain unexplored. In order to understand the phylogeny of this group in China, we estimated the first multilocus phylogeny and conducted species delimitation, including taxon sampling throughout their distribution range. Results: We obtained one mitochondrial gene (cytb) (~ 1, 134 bp) and three nuclear genes (ApoB, BRCA1, RAG1) (~ 2, 170 bp) for 132 samples from 57 localities. Molecular analyses identified at least 14 putative species that occur within two major well-supported groups in China. Polyphyletic C. wuchihensis appears to be composed of two putative species. Two subspecies, C. rapax rapax and C. rapax kurodai should be elevated to full species status. A phylogenetic tree based on mitochondrial gene from Asian Crocidura species showed that the C. rapax rapax is embedded within C. attenuata, making the latter a paraphyletic group. Three strongly supported undescribed species (C. sp.1, C. sp.2 and C. sp.3) are revealed from Zada County of Tibet (Western China), Hongjiang County of Hunan Province (Central China) and Dongyang County of Zhejiang Province (Eastern China), Motuo County of Tibet, respectively. The divergence time estimation suggested that China's Crocidura species began to diversify during the late Pliocene (3.66 Ma) and the Early Pleistocene (2.29 Ma), followed by a series of diversifications through the Pleistocene. Conclusions: The cryptic diversity found in this study indicated that the number of species is strongly underestimated under the current taxonomy. We propose that the three undescribed species should be evaluated using extensive taxon sampling and comprehensive morphological and morphometric approaches. Climate change since the late Pliocene and the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau may result in the diversification and speciation of China's Crocidura species. In short, the underestimated diversity underlines the need for a taxonomic revision of Chinese Crocidura species. © 2020 The Author(s).","Mitochondrial DNA; Nuclear DNA; Rapid radiation; Soricidae; Species delimitation","adaptive radiation; divergence; DNA; mammal; molecular analysis; phylogenetics; phylogeny; Pleistocene; sampling; taxonomy; uplift; Africa; China; Europe; Crocidura; Crocidura attenuata; Crocidura rapax; Mammalia; Soricidae; mitochondrial DNA; Africa; animal; Asia; China; classification; Europe; genetic variation; genetics; mitochondrial gene; multilocus sequence typing; phylogeny; phylogeography; procedures; shrew; Tibet; veterinary medicine; Africa; Animals; Asia; China; DNA, Mitochondrial; Europe; Genes, Mitochondrial; Genetic Variation; Multilocus Sequence Typing; Phylogeny; Phylogeography; Shrews; Tibet",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079532999

Here, we develop an approach to interpret carbon footprints of cities by focusing on their system boundaries, double counting recognition, spatial paths and policy sensitivities. Using four megacities in China as a case study, we quantify and map urban carbon footprints from various accounting perspectives: territorial carbon emissions, community-wide infrastructure carbon footprint, consumption-based carbon footprint, wider production carbon footprint, and full-scope carbon footprint. We find that the megacities’ infrastructure carbon footprints are dominated by electricity-related emissions, whereas their consumption-based carbon footprints are significantly impacted by imports of both electricity and other products and services. Over 55% of the full-scope carbon footprints (sums of all three scopes) of Beijing and Shanghai can be attributed to upstream emissions, while in Chongqing and Tianjin territorial emissions are more important. Key urban infrastructure contributes over 70% to the total carbon emissions in import supply chains, determining the spatial paths and the carbon intensities of imports for these megacities. The main destinations of outsourced carbon emissions across the country from the megacities are found to be similar due to market domination of bulk suppliers of infrastructure-related and other carbon-intensive products. In addition, double counting of certain footprint indicators is considered small in this case, but could be amplified with increasing number of cities being assessed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Double counting; Policy sensitivity; Spatial carbon transfer; System boundaries; Urban carbon footprint","Emission control; Supply chains; Anthropogenic carbon; Carbon emissions; Carbon intensity; Carbon transfer; Double counting; Products and services; System boundary; Urban infrastructure; Carbon footprint; anthropogenic effect; carbon emission; carbon footprint; electricity generation; megacity; policy strategy; supply chain management; Beijing [China]; China; Chongqing; Shanghai; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076057103

With the goal of minimizing government financial expenditures, this paper establishes a CTS joint taxation-subsidy emission reduction policy optimization model. This model is able to optimize the government's tax and subsidy policy implementation plan for a CTS considering the non-cooperative game among shippers and the Stackelberg game led by the government and followed by carriers and shippers. Based on the active set algorithm, a local optimal solution algorithm for the model is designed. Numerical experiments are performed using the container transportation network of the Bohai Rim region of China. Two sensitivity analysis experiments are conducted on the traffic volume of the CTS and the capacity of waterway links.

Furthermore, we propose an improved approach to estimate the rebound effect index. By comparing the different effects of technological progress on carbon emissions, our results indicate that China's overall domestic technological progress reduced its carbon emissions over this period. As for the rebound effect index, the estimated results are higher than in previous studies because of the spatial rebound effect, which was ignored by previous studies. Regionally, although the eastern region had high rebound effects, the western region is at the greatest risk from the rebound effects.

However, much remains to be resolved concerning long-term sectoral and regional coping strategies. In this study, we developed a spatial downscaling framework to identify the roles played by different provinces and sectors in promoting early emission peak, and the spatiotemporal variations of city-level reduction potentials for the building sector by coupling an integrated assessment model with openly available information. Simulations show that peaking emissions five years earlier means an additional 12.5 Gt CO2 emission cut during 2015–2035 and building sector needs to increase renewable penetration to 22% and further improve emission efficiency by 12%, which are both greater than other end use sectors. More developed eastern regions would peak earlier than national target and some central cities are expected to double their per capita building emissions. While for the less developed northern and western regions to peak on time it is necessary that the gap of CO2 emission intensity between these cities and national average narrow down from 9.8t/thousand RMB in 2020 to 5.9t/thousand RMB in 2030. © 2019","Building sector; Carbon emission peak; City; Energy transformation; Province","Carbon; Building sectors; Carbon emissions; City; Energy transformation; Province; Carbon dioxide; building; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; modeling; spatial variation; temporal variation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075356117

This research uses a global model cognizant of energy policy, technology learning curves and international carbon reduction targets to optimize the future energy system in terms of cost and carbon emissions to the year 2050. Exploring combinations of four exploratory scenarios incorporating hydrogen city gas blend levels, nuclear restrictions, regional emission reduction obligations and carbon capture and storage deployment timelines, it was identified that hydrogen has the potential to supply approximately two percent of global energy needs by 2050. Irrespective of the quantity of hydrogen produced, the transport sector and passenger fuel cell vehicles are consistently a preferential end use for future hydrogen across regions and modeled scenarios.

With rainfall agriculture being predominent in the region, the local population is extremely vulnerable to intraseasonal dry spells and multi-year droughts as well as to intense rainfall over small time steps. Were this variability to increase, it might render the area close from becoming unhabitable. Anticipating any change is thus crucial from both a societal and a scientific perspective. Despite continuous efforts in Global Climate Model (GCM) development, there is still no agreement on the sign of the future rainfall regime change in the region. Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are used for more accurate projections of future changes as well as end-user-oriented impact studies. In this study, the sensitivity of the Modele Atmospherique Regional (MAR) to homogeneous perturbations in boundary forcing air temperature and/or SST is assessed with the aim to better understand (i) the thermodynamical imprint of the recent rainfall regime changes and (ii) the impact of errors in driving data on theWest African rainfall regime simulated by an RCM. After an evaluation step where the model is proved to satisfactorily simulate the West African Monsoon (WAM), sensitivity experiments display contrasted, sizable and robust responses of the simulated rainfall regime. The rainfall responses to the boundary forcing perturbations compare in magnitude with the intrinsic model bias, giving support for such an analysis. A physical interpretation of the rainfall anomalies provides confidence in the model response consistency and shows the potential of such an experimental protocol for future climate change downscalling over this region. © 2020 by the author.

Its presence in grape and wine is strongly related to climatic conditions and the expected climate change could represent a risk of increasing fungal colonization and OTA contamination in grapes. In this regard, the interacting effect of i) different conditions of water availability (0.93 and 0.99aw) and ii) different 10 h/14 h dark/light alternating temperature conditions simulating a nowadays (18/31 °C) and climate change scenario (20/37 °C) in high OTA risk areas of Apulia region, were studied. Lag phases prior to growth, mycelial growth rate, the expression of biosynthesis, transcription factors and regulatory genes of OTA cluster and OTA production were analysed in Aspergillus carbonarius ITEM 5010 under the combined effect of different climatic factors. At 18/31 °C and under water stress conditions (0.93 aw) the growth rate was slower than at 0.99 aw; on the contrary, at 20/37 °C a higher growth rate was observed at 0.93 aw. An over-expression of OTA genes and genes belonging to the global regulator Velvet complex was observed at 18/31 °C and 0.99 aw, with the specific OTA pathway transcription factor bZIP showing the highest expression level. The up-regulated transcription profile of the genes positively correlated with OTA production higher at 18/31 °C than at 20/37 °C and 0.99 aw; while no OTA production was detected at 0.93 aw at each of the temperature conditions tested. These findings provide preliminary evidence that the possible increase of the temperature, likely to happen in some areas of the Apulia region, may results in a reduction of both A. carbonarius spoilage and OTA production in grapes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Gene expression; Grape; Growth; Lag phase; Ochratoxin A","basic leucine zipper transcription factor; ochratoxin; water; mycotoxin; ochratoxin; absorption lag time; Article; Aspergillus carbonarius; climate change; drought stress; ecophysiology; growth rate; mycelial growth; nonhuman; protein expression level; regulator gene; temperature; water availability; water stress; Aspergillus; chemistry; fruit; metabolism; microbiology; pathogenicity; temperature; Vitis; wine; Aspergillus; Fruit; Mycotoxins; Ochratoxins; Temperature; Vitis; Water; Wine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074699763

The paper contributes to shed light on the role of fiscal policy in climate-change adaptation, which aims at containing the economic damage of climate change. We use an overlapping generations (OLG) model for a small open economy in which adaptation reflects the extent to which public policies reduce the negative influence of climate change on the capital depreciation rate. Adaptation includes both preventive measures, i.e. investment in infrastructure, and remedial measures, i.e. post-disaster relief and reconstruction. Through model simulations we assess the costs and benefits of both remedial and preventive actions. We find that preventive intervention leads to higher GDP growth rates than either taking no action or waiting until remedial action is necessary. However, the evidence shows that, due to high costs of early adaptation and budgetary constraints, countries tend to focus on late corrective actions, also relying on international assistance. Given the expected increase in climate-related risks, a comprehensive strategy including both preventive and corrective actions would be desirable to strengthen resilience to shocks and alleviate the financial constraints, which particularly affect small countries. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic analysis; Government policy; Natural disasters and their management; Other public investment and capital stock","Budget control; Climate models; Developing countries; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Dynamic analysis; Economics; Investments; Public policy; Budgetary constraints; Capital depreciation; Capital stock; Climate change adaptation; Climate related risks; Financial constraints; International assistance; Natural disasters; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; developing world; economic impact; environmental economics; fiscal policy; governance approach; Gross Domestic Product; natural disaster; state role",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076136700

The developed procedure links (i) the assessment of outdoor microclimate and mitigation techniques for counteracting Urban Heat Island, (ii) Near Zero Energy (NZE) Building energy efficiency design and (iii) the minimization of their environmental impact in terms of CO2eq. In this view, a multi-objective analysis is carried out by investigating the most proper inter-building size to be focused on for sustainable cities, able to optimize these three targets. Both the energy and environmental aspects are considered at different urban scales, starting with a single-building analysis and progressively extending the field of action. The presented methodology is applied to a real new residential NZE Settlement in Italy. Findings show that microclimate mitigation strategies, e.g. increased vegetated areas and highly-reflective envelope materials and permeable pavements, can lead to annual energy saving up to 12 % and reduction of summer operational CO2 emissions by 4 % at building level. Such benefits reach about 22 % energy savings and 5 % operational CO2 reduction when extending the size of the mitigated area to the whole settlement. © 2019","Dynamic thermal-energy simulation; Energy efficiency; Inter-building effect; Microclimate mitigation; Near Zero Energy Settlement; Urban Heat Island","Architectural design; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Building effects; Energy simulation; Microclimate mitigation; Urban heat island; Zero energies; Zero energy buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075507893

The objective of this research is to optimize technology implementation within the industrial symbiosis system to achieve enhanced environmental and economic performance. The case study in this research has five objectives, making this a many-objective optimization problem (MaOP). MaOPs are a type of multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), with the key difference being that MaOPs have four or more optimization objectives. While traditional intelligent algorithms are suitable for solving MOPs with no more than three objectives, they encounter serious difficulties when applied to MaOPs (high risk of falling into a local optimum, high computational complexity in algorithm performance evaluation, and difficulty in visualizing and analyzing high-dimensional optimal solutions). To fill this gap, this article establishes a novel methodological framework for solving many-objective environmental management problems. The framework includes a modified NSGA-III model, the Hypervolume by Slicing Objectives algorithm, the Heatmap method, and the fitted curve method. This framework provides model optimization, algorithm performance evaluation, results visualization, and decision-making analysis capabilities for optimizing technology implementation within the industrial symbiosis system. The study tests the effectiveness and reliability of this methodology. The result shows that industrial symbiosis can greatly reduce energy consumption, pollutant emissions, and economic costs in the industrial sector. Optimal technologies for effective industrial symbiosis in China from 2020 to 2030 are identified. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Emission reduction; Energy conservation; Industrial symbiosis; Many-objective optimization; NSGA-III","Computational complexity; Decision making; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Industrial research; Multiobjective optimization; Emission reduction; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Environmental and economic performance; Hypervolume by slicing objectives; Industrial symbiosis; Many-objective optimizations; Multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs); NSGA-III; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074365971

The Detritus Input and Removal Transfer (DIRT) experiment was conducted in two subtropical plantations, an Acacia crassicarpa monoculture (AC) and a Eucalyptus urophylla monoculture (EU), to assess the importance of leaf litter and fine roots for SOC content over a 6-year period. The SOC content in 0–10 cm soil layer was significantly reduced by litter removal (NL) or by removal of both litter and roots (NI), but the influence of root removal (NR) was only marginal. The AC forest had a much higher annual rate of litter production and a lower decomposition rate than the EU forest, but carbon release from plant litter did not significantly differ between the two forests. These results help explain why the SOC content did not differ between the two forests. Our findings suggest that plant leaf litter is more important than roots in maintaining the balance of the SOC pool in subtropical forest plantations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Decomposition; Detritus inputs; Forest type; Litter production; SOC content","Decomposition; Organic carbon; Soils; Tropics; Annual rates; Decomposition rate; Detritus inputs; Experimental evidence; Forest type; Plant litter; Soil organic carbon; Subtropical forests; Forestry; forest product; leaf litter; plantation; root system; soil organic matter; soil quality; subtropical region; Acacia crassicarpa; Eucalyptus urophylla; carbon; agriculture; forest; microbiology; plant leaf; plant root; Agriculture; Carbon; Forests; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076586781

Nevertheless, the role of oxygen fugacity (fO2) in controlling Mo enrichment and precipitation of molybdenite in such reduced porphyry Mo deposits is poorly understood. The Suyunhe reduced porphyry Mo deposit with a Mo metal reserve of 0.57Mt at an average grade of 0.05–0.09%, located in the West Junggar terrane in Xinjiang, is associated with Early Permian granitic rocks, which emplaced into the volcano-sedimentary sequences of the Middle Devonian Barluk Formation. In this study, we report that the variation of magmatic fO2, the possible mechanism of Mo enrichment, and the contributions of the reduced gases or matter to molybdenite precipitation. Results indicate that the primitive magma is still oxidized with fO2 &gt; NNO (Ni–NiO oxygen buffer), but it is then reduced due to contamination by the reduced sequences. Furthermore, the decreasing magmatic fO2 does not significantly prevent the enrichment of Mo metals during magmatic evolution. By contrast, the evolved parental magma, characterized by highly differentiated and fluorite-rich, is responsible for improving Mo concentration of melts. Most of reduced gases are derived from decomposition of organic matter occurring in the reduced volcanic sedimentary rocks of Barluk Formation. More importantly, these reduced gases (e.g. CH4) play a role in molybdenite precipitation, which may effectively improve the efficiency of metal precipitation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Oxygen fugacity; The efficiency of metal precipitation; The mechanism of Mo enrichment; The reduced porphyry Mo deposits","Deposits; Efficiency; Fluorspar; Hematite; Magnetite; Metals; Molybdenum compounds; Molybdenum deposits; Nickel oxide; Oxygen; Precipitation (chemical); Sedimentary rocks; Sedimentology; Volcanic rocks; Volcanoes; Formation mechanism; Magmatic evolution; Metal precipitation; Middle Devonian; Mo concentration; Oxygen fugacity; Possible mechanisms; Volcano-sedimentary sequences; Molybdenum; enrichment; formation mechanism; magma; molybdenum; ore deposit; oxygen; partial pressure; porphyry; China; West Junggar; Xinjiang Uygur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077135721

Despite the importance of urban SOC there are still many uncertainties associated, resulting in low accuracy of SOC stock estimations or in its neglection in the regional and national carbon budgets. We focused on one of the most extended urban areas of Italy (Milan) estimating SOC stock in the topsoil and comparing it for different urban land uses (park/non-park) and covers (woodland/grassland). We also compared urban SOC stocks with other typologies of natural and semi-natural land use in the region. We found generally high variability in urban soil properties. Average SOC of urban parks was higher (7.9 ± 2.4 kg m−2) than urban non-parks (5.3 ± 2.5 kg m−2); while SOC stock did not significantly differ for urban land cover types. Urban parks had SOC stock values comparable with forest, pasture and grasslands of the same region and higher than SOC of croplands. At the same time, urban non-parks had the lower SOC stocks values found in the region. The results highlighted the significant contribution of urban SOC stock to carbon budget estimations and differences based on urban land use types. Furthermore, we described the main pedological characteristics of investigated urban soils and we identified the factors that contribute to limiting our capacity to model urban SOC stock that can be partially overcome by the addressed strategies. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Climate regulation; Milan; Regulatory ecosystem services; Urban forest; Urban region; Urban soil",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074697576

The increasing presence of alternative powered vehicles, such as electric or hybrid vehicles, could provide an improvement of such a situation due to the absence of internal combustion engines. However, tyre/road noise is independent of the vehicle type and still exists in alternative powered vehicles. Hence, efforts should focus also on reducing noise emission by means of new tyre designs. The tyre/road noise emission of newly produced tyres is currently evaluated by the Coast-By method, and as a result the rolling sound pressure level at the measuring distance, located 7.5 m away from the test vehicle is obtained. Such an acoustic index provides a very representative data of the annoyance that a pedestrian located at such distance could suffer. However, this value could be affected by external factors, such as environmental conditions. For that reason, this paper presents a methodology for extrapolating the sound pressure levels that are obtained in a Coast-By test, by means of the sound power level emitted by the specific tyre/road combination evaluated. This methodology could serve as the basis for defining a universal model to evaluate a tyre when rolling on a road, by using its sound power emission and predicting the Coast-By sound pressure level. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Model; Sound propagation; Traffic noise; Tyre/road noise","Acoustic emissions; Acoustic variables measurement; Acoustic wave propagation; Acoustic wave transmission; Acoustics; Extrapolation; Models; Noise pollution; Tires; Environmental conditions; Measuring distances; Sound power emissions; Sound power levels; Sound pressure level; Sound propagation; Traffic noise; Tyre/road noise; Acoustic noise",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073957037

However, evaluation of scenario planning for adaptation is lacking. In this paper we summarise a science-policy session held at the European Climate Change Adaptation Conference in May 2019, where practitioners explored the strengths and weaknesses of scenario planning for climate adaptation and identified modifications to enhance the method's utility. Eight case studies spanning three scenario planning types (problem-focused, actor-focused and reflexive-interventionist) from varied socio-cultural contexts were presented by the authors, followed by discussion amongst the 40 participants. Strengths focussed on opportunities provided by scenario planning for stakeholder participation, and raising their awareness about future risks, vulnerability and uncertainty. Participatory scenario planning was most useful for building stakeholder consensus at the local scale (e.g. communities, neighbourhoods) over shorter timeframes (e.g. 20 years). Weaknesses centred on the inability of scenarios to generate quantitative predictions and concrete adaptation solutions. This was partly attributed to practitioners’ limited understanding of stakeholder politics and power dynamics, and the resulting lack of integration of scenario exercises within decision-making processes. Scenarios were also limited by being static, and participatory processes were resource-intensive. Suggested modifications were to develop iterative scenario planning embedded within decision-making cycles. Such ‘transient scenarios’ could absorb system feedbacks and updated information to prioritise adaptation responses, thus actively contributing to ongoing adaptation pathways. Applying monitoring, evaluating and learning would enable reflexive refinement of the method, adapting it to become an agile approach applicable to varied socio-cultural and political contexts. © 2019","Adaptation; Climate change; Decision-making; Futures; Participation; Politics","adult; article; awareness; climate change; clinical article; consensus; decision making; exercise; female; human; human experiment; learning; male; neighborhood; physician; politics; prediction; stakeholder engagement; uncertainty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074888515

Yet to date no systematic review has been conducted to identify and synthesize these studies. In this systematic review, we assess the effectiveness of interventions in reducing ambient particulate matter air pollution and improving adverse health outcomes. Methods: We searched a range of electronic databases across multiple disciplines, as well as grey literature databases, trial registries, reference lists of included studies and the contents of relevant journals, through August 2016. Eligible for inclusion were randomized and cluster randomized controlled trials, as well as several non-randomized study designs often used for evaluating air quality interventions. We included studies that evaluated interventions targeting industrial, residential, vehicular and multiple sources, with respect to their effect on mortality, morbidity and the concentrations of particulate matter (PM – including PM10, PM2.5, coarse particulate matter and combustion-related PM), as well as several criteria pollutants, including ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide and sulphur dioxide. We did not restrict studies based on the population, setting or comparison. Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We assessed risk of bias using the Graphic Appraisal Tool for Epidemiological studies (GATE) for correlation studies, as modified and employed by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. We synthesized evidence narratively, as well as graphically using harvest plots. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Results: We included 42 studies assessing 38 unique interventions. These comprised a heterogeneous mix of interventions, including those aiming to address industrial sources (n = 5; e.g. the closure of a factory), residential sources (n = 7; e.g. coal ban), vehicular sources (n = 22; e.g. low emission zones), and multiple sources (n = 4; e.g. tailored measures that target both local traffic and industrial polluters). Evidence for effectiveness was mixed. Most included studies observed either no significant association or an association favoring the intervention, with little evidence that the assessed interventions might be harmful. Conclusions: Given the heterogeneity across interventions, outcomes, and methods, it was difficult to derive overall conclusions regarding the effectiveness of interventions in terms of improved air quality or health. Some evidence suggests that interventions are associated with improvements in air quality and human health, with very little evidence suggesting interventions were harmful. The evidence base highlights the challenges related to establishing the effectiveness of specific air pollution interventions on outcomes. It also points to the need for improved study design and analysis methods, as well as more uniform evaluations. The prospective planning of evaluations and an evaluation component built into the design and implementation of interventions may also be particularly beneficial. © 2019 The Authors",,"Air quality; Carbon monoxide; Coal combustion; Grading; Health; Health risks; Housing; Industrial emissions; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Plant shutdowns; Risk assessment; Sulfur dioxide; Ambient air pollution; Ambient particulate Matter; Coarse particulate matter; Correlation studies; Design and implementations; Epidemiological studies; Multiple disciplines; Randomized controlled trial; Quality control; carbon monoxide; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; database; health impact; health risk; morbidity; mortality; particulate matter; adverse outcome; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; ambient air; combustion; exhaust gas; health hazard; human; industry; morbidity; mortality; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; residential area; Review; study design; systematic review; air pollution; prospective study; United Kingdom; Air Pollution; Humans; Nitrogen Dioxide; Nitrogen Oxides; Particulate Matter; Prospective Studies",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076409494

We compared the effects of biostimulation and bioaugmentation of soil historically contaminated with aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The studied bioaugmentation treatments comprised of the introduction of differently developed microbial inoculants, namely: an isolated hydrocarbon-degrading community C1 (undefined—consisting of randomly chosen degraders) and a mixed culture C2 (consisting of seven strains with well-characterized enhanced hydrocarbon-degrading capabilities). Sixty days of remedial treatments resulted in a substantial decrease in total aliphatic hydrocarbon content; however, the action of both inoculants gave a significantly better effect than nutrient amendments (a 69.7% decrease for C1 and 86.8% for C2 vs. 34.9% for biostimulation). The bioaugmentation resulted also in PAH removal, and, again, C2 degraded contaminants more efficiently than C1 (reductions of 85.2% and 64.5%, respectively), while biostimulation itself gave no significant results. Various bioassays applying different organisms (the bacterium Vibrio fischeri, the plants Sorghum saccharatum, Lepidium sativum, and Sinapis alba, and the ostracod Heterocypris incongruens) and Ames test were used to assess, respectively, potential toxicity and mutagenicity risk after bioremediation. Each treatment improved soil quality, however only bioaugmentation with the C2 treatment decreased both toxicity and mutagenicity most efficiently. Illumina high-throughput sequencing revealed the lack of (C1) or limited (C2) ability of the introduced degraders to sustain competition from indigenous microbiota after a 60-day bioremediation process. Thus, bioaugmentation with the bacterial mixed culture C2, made up of identified, hydrocarbon-degrading strains, is clearly a better option for bioremediation purposes when compared to other treatments. © 2020 by the authors","Biostimulation/bioaugmentation; Defined mixed culture; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); Total aliphatic hydrocarbons (TAHs); Toxicity tests; Undefined community","petroleum; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; animal; bacterium; bioremediation; chemistry; comparative study; Crustacea; Lepidium sativum; metabolism; microbiology; Sinapis; soil; soil pollutant; sorghum; Animals; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Crustacea; Lepidium sativum; Petroleum; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Sinapis; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants; Sorghum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079084054

We propose two counterintuitive mechanisms: high levels of regulation and a firm's increased tolerance for risk. Drawing from insights on how institutional contexts constrain, and enable, prosocial firm behavior, we argue that external pressures, amplified internally by a firm's higher tolerance for risk, increase the likelihood that a greenhouse gas (GHG)-intensive firm will engage in climate change actions that exceed regulatory requirements. An analysis based on 7,101 observations of U.S. publicly traded firms during the 2013 to 2015 period supports our hypotheses. Our models show high overall prediction accuracy (88.6%) using an out-of-time holdout sample from 2016. Moreover, we find that firms that have exhibited environmental wrongdoing are also more likely to engage in beyond-compliance activities, which may be a form of greenwashing. Thus, more formal and informal regulatory oversight has the potential to spur positive environmental actions. This has implications for a firm's corporate social responsibility actions as well as for climate change regulatory policy. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","beyond-compliance actions; climate change; corporate social responsibility; environmental policy; GHG emissions; institutional theory; regulation","accuracy assessment; climate change; corporate social responsibility; emission inventory; environmental economics; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; industrial production; mitigation; regulatory framework; risk assessment; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075037759

West Africa contains approximately 14% of the world’s mangrove area but despite 25% of coverage loss between 1980 and 2006, the region’s mangroves have not been well studied. This study aims to provide a first step toward increasing the knowledge of the region’s blue carbon stocks, with a focus on mangroves, and of their financial value based on their carbon storage benefit alone. The best available data suggest that the region contains 1.97 million hectares of mangroves storing 854 million metric tons of carbon in above- and below-ground biomass and the top meter of soil; 4.8 million hectares of seagrass storing 673 million metric tons of carbon; and 1.2 million hectares of salt marshes storing 303 million metric tons of carbon. Even without including values for other benefits of intact mangroves, the conservation of mangroves in the region appears viable. Specifically, the discounted value of 20-year emission reductions under a conservation scenario is estimated to be between $341.2–569.0 million at an 8% discount rate and carbon prices of $3 and $5 per metric ton respectively. © 2020, The Author(s).","Biomass; Ecosystem service; Mangrove; Protected area; Sequestration","biomass; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; feasibility study; mangrove; nature conservation; protected area; West Africa; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078773244

Based on a multiscalar justice framework and a critical discourse analysis, we explore the extent to which conceptions of justice align or diverge across and between scales of REDD+ discourse. The findings indicate the dominance of a “utilitarian–neoliberal” nexus at the policy level, underpinning a cost-effective orientation of REDD+, that conflicts with the egalitarian ethics present at the community level in Ethiopia. The research suggests that conflicts in REDD+ design, implementation, and management are likely to be underpinned by, and reflect, fundamental divergences in actors’ norms and ethics.

Concern about the adverse human health impacts of PM2.5 has led to the increased use of indoor air cleaners to improve indoor air quality, which can be an important environment for PM2.5 exposure. However, the degree to which the oxidative potential of indoor and personal PM2.5 can be influenced by an indoor air cleaner remains unclear. In this study we enrolled 43 children with physician diagnosed asthma in suburban Shanghai, China and collected two paired-sets of 48-h indoor, outdoor, and personal PM2.5 exposure samples. One set of samples was collected under “real filtration” during which a functioning air cleaner was installed in the child's bedroom, and the other (“false filtration”) with an air cleaner without internal filters. The PM2.5 samples were characterized by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy for elements, and by an alveolar macrophage assay for oxidative potential. The sources of metals contributing to our samples were determined by the EPA Positive Matrix Factorization model. The oxidative potential was lower under real filtration compared to sham for indoor (median real/sham ratio: 0.260) and personal exposure (0.813) samples. Additionally, the sources of elements in PM2.5 that were reduced indoors and personal exposure samples by the air cleaner (e.g. regional aerosol and roadway emissions) were found by univariate multiple regression models to be among those contributing to the oxidative potential of the samples. An IQR increase in the regional aerosol and roadway emissions sources was associated with a 107% (95% CI: 80.1–138%) and 38.1% (17.6–62.1%) increase in measured oxidative potential respectively. Our results indicate that indoor air cleaners can reduce the oxidative potential of indoor and personal exposure to PM2.5, which may lead to improved human health. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Air quality intervention; Indoor air quality; Particulate matter; Personal exposure; Reactive oxygen species","activated carbon; antimony; arsenic; cadmium; cerium; chromium; copper; iron; lanthanum; lead; manganese; molybdenum; nickel; reactive oxygen metabolite; titanium; transition element; vanadium; zinc; domestic chemical; metal; aerosol; air quality; asthma; child health; health impact; indoor air; oxidation; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollution exposure; public health; reactive oxygen species; abrasion; adolescent; aerosol; air conditioning; air monitoring; air pollutant; animal cell; asthma; chemical composition; child; clinical article; combustion; comparative study; controlled study; crossover procedure; double blind procedure; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; filtration; highway; household; human; in vitro study; indoor air pollution; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; lung alveolus macrophage; nonhuman; NR8383 cell line; outdoor exposure; oxidation reduction potential; particulate matter; physician; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; rat; suburban area; air pollutant; China; environmental monitoring; oxidative stress; particle size; China; Shanghai; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Child; China; Environmental Monitoring; Household Products; Humans; Metals; Oxidative Stress; Particle Size; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075353122

Although larger projects rely more on loans, community shares are the most common and cheapest financial instrument in the sector. Community energy has pioneered low-cost citizen finance for renewables, but its future is threatened by reductions, and instability, in policy support. Over 90% of the projects in our sample make a financial surplus during our single-year snapshot, but this falls to just 20% if we remove income from price guarantee mechanisms, such as the Feed-in Tariff scheme.

Unprecedented opportunities lie ahead for local renewable energy development. Proper system and resource integration is therefore an economic imperative. Technical and economic integration will require policy alignment and collaboration among cities, counties, energy utilities (both gas and electric), and state government. There is also a potentially invaluable role for higher education in support of local planning and integration. State policy interventions in support of collaborative local renewable integration will be a necessary supplement to existing market and regulatory structures. States can affirm fundamental property rights that empower communities and citizens to actively support local climate action and adaptation. State policy can drive the evolution of existing market and regulatory structures to account for local differences and provide increased flexibility for local jurisdictions to address their diverse local resource opportunities and usage profiles. In parallel, states can encourage cities and counties to increase their capacity to take on vital new roles. State energy regulators will need to balance public interest in the economic health of the companies against they regulate against the opportunity to secure important benefits of local clean energy resource development and integration. They will need to create new processes for harmonizing and cross-leveraging progress toward diverse local goals with progress toward over-arching state goals. The key enabling factor will be a culture of collaboration between energy service providers and local governments. Collaborative local renewable integration can be empowered by state action that creates new points of coordination, integration and assistance. Through policy interventions, states can reduce or eliminate barriers to collaborative local renewable integration while capturing opportunities to bring together local government and energy utility capacities and data, plus capacities of universities, non-profit and utility training programs. © 2019 The Author","Cities; Climate action; Collaboration; Community choice; Community solar; Counties; Electricity; Integration; Local government; Micro-grids; Natural gas; Renewable energy; Solar energy; State policy; Universities; Utilities; Utility training",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075519540

In this study, we investigate the novel possibility that structures and compositions of lipids produced by microbial communities are sensitive to environmental redox conditions. We extracted lipids from microbial biomass collected along the thermal and redox gradients of four alkaline hot springs in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) and investigated patterns in the average oxidation state of carbon (ZC), a metric calculated from the chemical formulae of lipid structures. Carbon in intact polar lipids (IPLs) and their alkyl chains becomes more oxidized (higher ZC) with increasing distance from each of the four hot spring sources. This coincides with decreased water temperature and increased concentrations of oxidized inorganic solutes, such as dissolved oxygen, sulfate, and nitrate. Carbon in IPLs is most reduced (lowest ZC) in the hot, reduced conditions upstream, with abundance-weighted ZC values between −1.68 and −1.56. These values increase gradually downstream to around −1.36 to −1.33 in microbial communities living between 29.0 and 38.1°C. This near-linear increase in ZC can be attributed to a shift from ether-linked to ester-linked alkyl chains, a decrease in average aliphatic carbons per chain (nC), an increase in average degree of unsaturation per chain (nUnsat), and increased cyclization in tetraether lipids. The ZC of lipid headgroups and backbones did not change significantly downstream. Expression of lipids with relatively reduced carbon under reduced conditions and oxidized lipids under oxidized conditions may indicate microbial adaptation across environmental gradients in temperature and electron donor/acceptor supply. © Copyright © 2020 Boyer, Schubotz, Summons, Woods and Shock.","carbon oxidation state; geobiochemistry; hydrothermal system; intact polar lipid; microbial community; redox gradient","alkyl group; carbon; dissolved oxygen; ester; lipid; nitrate; sulfate; Article; biofilm; biomass; concentration (parameter); cyclization; electron; hydroxylation; lipid composition; microbial community; microorganism; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; pH; phylogeny; temperature acclimatization; thermal spring; water temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081199160

On detailed preliminary investigations both the incinerators were found to have shortcomings to meet emission norms as per Indian standards for MSW incinerators. Parameters for the comparison were combustion efficiency and emissions, basically CO and CO2, to assess the quality of combustion. Carefully designed experiments, to improve the performance, revealed the need to evaluate the stochiometric air flow requirement and a need to modify. To enable better combustion inside the combustion chamber, it was established that airflow distribution, and mixing was necessary. The paper analyses the performance of the incinerators towards optimizing the air flow location and the air flow rate in the combustion chamber. Based on these studies it was evident that the commercially available designs are not suitable for five-napkin batches, as claimed by the manufacturers. A higher starting temperature (&gt;600 °C) is essential for quick heating, and optimum an air supply (~10 LPM) is necessary for reducing environmentally sensitive emissions. Results indicated higher combustion efficiency, and a need for meeting the emissions norms as per Indian standards for MSW incinerators. Based on the performance of the devices and arriving at an optimal specification for the design, an alternative method of incineration using LPG gas torch retrofitted over the grate, was tested.

For all ecoregions in Mexico, we analyzed land use changes over 14 years (2001–2014) using MODIS images (250 m) and identified regions that had significant gains or loss of woody vegetation, pasturelands, or croplands. The land use patterns varied greatly among the 40 major ecoregions, but in general, woody vegetation and cropland cover increased while pastures decreased. In contrast to previous studies, much of the increase in croplands did not correspond with hotspots of decline in pastures but occurred in the Sonora and Chihuahuan deserts ecoregions in northern Mexico. Industrial cotton, sorghum, and pecans production for export where the major crops responsible for the increase in these ecoregions. Similar to patterns in the rest of Latin America, pasture expansion mainly occurred in ecoregions in the tropical moist forest biome (e.g. Veracruz and Peten-Veracruz ecoregions). The ecoregions that experienced the greatest increase in woody vegetation were the Balsas dry forest ecoregion along the Pacific coast and Trans Mexican volcanic oak-pine ecoregion. In both regions, rural-urban migration appears to be an important driver of the transition from grasslands to woody vegetation, while the conversion of croplands to woody vegetation in the Tamaulipan mezquital ecoregion was clearly associated with drug related violence.

Energy costs to operate the system scale almost linearly with the temperature drop between the ingested air and the cryogenic desublimation temperature of CO2, driving siting to the coldest accessible locations. System performance in three Arctic/Antarctic regions where the proposed system can potentially be located is analyzed. Colder ambient temperatures provide colder system input air temperature yielding lower CO2 removal energy requirements. A case is also presented using direct-sky radiative cooling to feed colder-than-ambient air into the system. Removing greater fractions of the ingested CO2 lowers the CO2 desublimation temperature, thereby demanding greater energy input for air cooling. It therefore is disadvantageous to remove all CO2 from the processed air, and the optimal mass fraction of CO2 desublimated under this scheme is found to be ~0.8-0.9. In addition, a variety of precooler effectiveness (ε) values are evaluated. Increasing effectiveness reduces the required system power input. However, beyond ε = 0.7, at certain higher values of desublimated CO2 mass fraction, the CO2 begins to solidify inside the precooler before reaching the cryocooler. This phenomenon fouls the precooler, negating its effectiveness. Further system efficiencies can be realized via a precooler designed to capture solidified CO2 and eliminate fouling. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Arctic/Antarctica; CO2 desublimation; cryogenics; thermodynamics","Climate models; Cryogenics; Radiative Cooling; Temperature; Thermodynamics; Air temperature; Arctic/Antarctica; Desublimation; Energy inputs; Energy requirements; System efficiency; Temperature drops; Thermodynamic model; Carbon dioxide; air temperature; carbon dioxide; climate; cooling; thermodynamics; Antarctica; Arctic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076034538

This paper approaches these systems through the lens of conservation biopolitics, identifying the calculative processes and spatial logics that attempt to regulate the life and death of the forest. It uses an example of the Indonesian National Carbon Accounting System to explore how a biopolitical apparatus of constant data accumulation and presentation integrates an infinitely complex set of ecological processes across highly differentiated spatial landscapes, and organises these into governable carbon domains. The Indonesian National Carbon Accounting System provides a visual and numeric representation of the various policy and socio-economic processes that drive and limit carbon emissions, and identifies where this occurs in the landscape. By understanding these forest–carbon–human dynamics, programmes can be designed that change how populations access, use and potentially restore the life of the forest. For state and non-state interests alike, the System was viewed as a critical tool for both developing and evaluating the performance of multiple forest carbon initiatives. It also offers a surveillance apparatus to regulate the carbon market and to discipline the actions of various agents that utilise forests and land. Critically, the biopolitical utility of these systems have been undermined by waning commitment within Indonesia to overhaul forest governance towards carbon outcomes. © The Author(s) 2019.","Carbon accounting; conservation biopolitics; forests; Indonesia","carbon emission; forest management; governance approach; nature conservation; policy approach; socioeconomic impact; spatial analysis; Indonesia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067818816

When analyzing the effects of the UK’s decision to leave the EU (Brexit) on EU climate action, this paper looks at two types of impact. The first is related to UK absence from EU climate policy, finance and diplomacy following the actual UK departure from the EU. The second is related to the costs attached to the withdrawal process, including the additional costs and uncertainty created by the delayed UK departure. These latter implications of Brexit have been less explored by the literature, although the last years provide plenty of evidence for them. The paper finds that the impact of Brexit on EU climate action is mainly negative, without denying some potential positive impact and while acknowledging the limitations of a study that entails forecasting in an uncertain political context. Key policy insights Following Brexit, the EU will lose a member that supported its climate action internally and internationally through commitment to high emissions reduction targets at the EU level, policy solutions, and financial and diplomatic support. The withdrawal process itself has had a negative impact on EU climate action: Brexit has hijacked the EU agenda, captured EU human and administrative resources and increased the uncertainty in which investors and businesses operate. Planning for separate European Councils to deal with Brexit could prevent agenda hijacking. Both the EU and UK also need to provide businesses with a clear regulatory framework. A repeatedly postponed Brexit has caused additional damage, by prolonging uncertainty. Continuing to work with the UK on climate during the Brexit negotiations and after the UK departure should be a priority for the EU, as well as ensuring the willingness to cooperate is not spoiled by mutual resentment. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Brexit; climate change policies; European Union; uncertainty; United Kingdom","climate change; decision making; environmental policy; European Union; planning process; policy analysis; regional policy; regulatory framework; uncertainty analysis; Europe; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076352427

The existing literature on impacts of technological availability and cost on electric sector planning typically use models that do not have sufficient technological, spatial, and temporal detail to adequately resolve the economic competitiveness of variable renewable energy vis-à-vis dispatchable generators. Using a state-of-the-art energy-economic model, this work examines impacts of technological availability and advanced generation technologies on U.S. electricity market outcomes across a range of regional, market, and policy contexts. We show that decarbonization costs are 11%–76% higher as technological options are removed from consideration (incremental compliance costs for a 95% CO2 reduction below 2005 levels are roughly twice as high when new nuclear, carbon-capture-equipped units, and transmission are not allowed). However, the economic and technical implications of limited portfolios depend on the market and policy contexts (e.g., costs are higher with stringent targets, more extensive end-use electrification, and lower gas prices) and the costs and capabilities of the remaining options. The analysis demonstrates how lower temporal and spatial resolution models likely understate the value of technology by omitting key economic and technical features of high variable renewable pathways. Additionally, the analysis quantifies how technological change can lower costs of emissions reductions by 7%–73% and how low-cost battery storage can provide a hedge against higher costs when technological portfolios are limited. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Energy and environmental policy; Energy systems modeling; Power sector economics; Renewable integration; Technology; Value of technology","Commerce; Competition; Cost reduction; Decarbonization; Emission control; Environmental protection; Environmental technology; Financial markets; Renewable energy resources; Economic competitiveness; Energy systems modeling; Environmental policy; Generation technologies; Power sector; Renewable integration; Technical implications; Variable renewable energies; Cost benefit analysis; alternative energy; electrical power; emission control; energy market; energy policy; environmental policy; spatial resolution; technological change; technology adoption; United States",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078844471

These cumulative factors limit the quantitative interpretation of the global warming effect on surface water acidification in relation to the atmospheric CO2 sink. To quantitatively estimate the impact of global warming on the atmospheric/soil CO2 uptake by carbonate weathering, the approach proposed here involves discriminating the proportion of [Ca + Mg] in waters resulting from soil carbonic acid dissolution (equal to the amount of CO2 uptake from soil/atmosphere) from the proportion resulting from strong acid pollution. This approach was applied to 5 karst hydrosystems located in France, far from local pollution sources and with several decades of hydrochemical monitoring. [Ca + Mg] from acid deposition represented between 16 and 25% of the total [Ca + Mg] concentration and the flux was positively correlated with the atmospheric deposition flux. This [Ca + Mg] increase is associated with increasing [Mg] and was found to be driven by the acid pollution inputs. Equilibrating water with calcite in presence of carbonic acid will release [Ca + Mg] into solution. The input of strong acids from atmospheric pollution contributes more to magnesian calcite dissolution because its solubility is lower than that of calcite. Since the 1980s, the decrease in [Ca + Mg] production due to the decrease in acid atmospheric deposition has minimized the increase in [Ca + Mg] linked to CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) increasing with global warming. It was found that [Ca + Mg] from H2CO3 dissolution did not decrease with an increase in air temperature, as suggested by carbonate solubility. The annual fluxes of Ca + Mg from H2CO3 dissolution, calculated for an average flow, showed a positive gradient with air temperature, of about 0.061 mol m2 yr−1 °C−1 (±0.006). In low rainfall areas, the pCO2 increase with air temperature was stronger than in rainy areas. For an average specific discharge of 300 L m−2 yr−1, global warming is estimated to increase the CO2 uptake flux by about 204 micromol L−1 °C−1 (5.7% of the observed flux). © 2019","Acid Rain; Carbon dioxide; Carbonate; Global warming; Karst; pCO2; Weathering","acid rain; atmospheric deposition; carbon dioxide; carbonate; chemical weathering; global warming; hydrochemistry; karst; karst hydrology; water chemistry; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076113938

However, little has been done to incorporate the low-cost sensor measurements in large-scale PM2.5 exposure modeling. We conducted spatially varying calibration and developed a downweighting strategy to optimize the use of low-cost sensor data in PM2.5 estimation. In California, PurpleAir low-cost sensors were paired with air quality system (AQS) regulatory stations, and calibration of the sensors was performed by geographically weighted regression. The calibrated PurpleAir measurements were then given lower weights according to their residual errors and fused with AQS measurements into a random forest model to generate 1 km daily PM2.5 estimates. The calibration reduced PurpleAir's systematic bias to ∼;g/m3 and residual errors by 36%. Increased sensor bias was found to be associated with higher temperature and humidity, as well as longer operating time. The weighted prediction model outperformed the AQS-based prediction model with an improved random cross-validation (CV) R2 of 0.86, an improved spatial CV R2 of 0.81, and a lower prediction error. The temporal CV R2 did not improve due to the temporal discontinuity of PurpleAir. The inclusion of PurpleAir data allowed the predictions to better reflect PM2.5 spatial details and hotspots. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Air quality; Calibration; Decision trees; Forecasting; Random errors; Random forests; Systematic errors; Air quality systems; Exposure assessment; Exposure modeling; Geographically weighted regression; Large spatial scale; Random forest modeling; Temperature and humidities; Weighted predictions; Costs; air quality; calibration; measurement method; numerical model; optimization; particulate matter; pollution exposure; pollution monitoring; prediction; scale effect; sensor; spatial analysis; spatial resolution; accuracy; air analysis; air quality; Article; calibration; cost; environmental temperature; hierarchical clustering; high temperature; humidity; Mexico; microenvironment; particulate matter; random forest; United States; air pollutant; air pollution; California; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; California; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; California; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080957971

If per capita carbon emissions (or carbon intensity) converge over time, then any negotiation of multilateral agreements will be easier than if convergence is absent. It is also possible for club convergence to exist where countries within a club converge but countries between clubs do not converge. We examine the convergence of consumption-based and territory-based carbon emissions intensity across 70 countries. We find two convergent clubs for consumption-based emissions and three convergent clubs for territory-based emissions. Increases in each of total factor productivity, renewable energy consumption and urbanisation increase the odds of belonging to a low carbon emissions intensity club. An increase in industry value added reduces the odds of belonging to a low carbon intensity club. Increases in total factor productivity can be obtained through effective macroeconomic policy, while increasing renewable energy consumption may require structural changes in economies focused on transitioning to a low carbon economy. Under a business as usual forecasting scenario the number of consumption-based carbon emissions intensity clubs increases between 2014 and 2030 making it more difficult to negotiate multilateral agreements on climate change in the future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emissions; Club convergence; Renewable energy; Total factor productivity","Climate change; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Productivity; Renewable energy resources; Carbon emissions; Club convergence; Low-carbon emissions; Macroeconomic policies; Multilateral agreements; Renewable energies; Renewable energy consumption; Total factor productivity; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077503821

Inorganic Click (iClick) is employed to link two or four Au(I) metal ions through a triazolate bridge. Depending on the choice of phosphine ligand (PEt3 or PPh3), dinuclear Au2-FO or tetranuclear Au4-FO complexes can be controllably synthesized (FO = 2-(9,9-dioctylfluoreneyl-)). The iClick products Au2-FO and Au4-FO are characterized by combustion analysis and multinuclear NMR, TOCSY 1D, 1H-13C gHMBC, and 1H-13C gHSQC. In addition, the photophysical properties of Au2-FO and Au4-FO were examined in THF solution. Transient absorption spectroscopy was employed to elucidate the excited state features of the gold compounds. Solution processed OLEDs were fabricated and characterized, which gave white light electroluminescence with CIE coordinates (0.34, 0.36), as seen referenced to CIE standard illuminant D65 (0.31, 0.32). TDDFT computational analysis of Au2-FO and Au4-FO reveals the origin of light emission. In the case of Au4-FO, direct excitation leads to increased aurophilic bonding in the excited state, and as a result the emission profile is broadened to cover a larger region of the visible spectrum, thus giving white light emission. Designing molecules that can access or increase aurophilic bonding in the excited state provides another tool for fine-tuning the emission profiles of gold complexes. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078870764

In the optimization problem, the dependability index of not supplied energy (NSE) is also considered to have a reliable system. The VCS algorithm is an effective and powerful approach that has fast convergence and high precision.

However, several additional production and removal processes have been identified which could complicate its use at larger scales, among which are soil uptake, dark uptake by plants, and soil and anthropogenic emissions. This study evaluates the significance of these processes at the regional scale through a top-down approach based on atmospheric COS measurements at Gif-sur-Yvette (GIF), a suburban site near Paris (France). Over a period of four and a half years, hourly measurements at 7 m above ground level were performed by gas chromatography and combined with 222Radon measurements to calculate nocturnal COS fluxes using the Radon-Tracer Method. In addition, the vertical distribution of COS was investigated at a second site, 2 km away from GIF, where a fast gas analyzer deployed on a 100 m tower for several months during winter 2015–2016 recorded mixing ratios at 3 heights (15, 60 and 100 m). COS appears to be homogeneously distributed both horizontally and vertically in the sampling area. The main finding is that the area is a persistent COS sink even during wintertime episodes of strong pollution. Nighttime net uptake rates ranged from -1.5 to -32.8 pmol m-2 s-1, with an average of -7.3 ± 4.5 pmol m-2 s-1 (n = 253). However, episodes of biogenic emissions happened each year in June-July (11.9 ± 6.2 pmol m-2 s-1, n = 24). Preliminary analyses of simulated footprints of source areas influencing the recorded COS data suggest that long-range transport of COS from anthropogenic sources located in Benelux, Eastern France and Germany occasionally impacts the Paris area during wintertime. These production and removal processes may limit the use of COS to assess regional-scale CO2 uptake in Europe by plants through inverse modeling. © 2020 Public Library of Science.

Because of their hierarchical nature, combustion processes require a large number of chemical species and pathways to describe hydrocarbon oxidation. In order to simulate kinetic enhancement by non-thermal electrons, additional species and processes are included, which model the ionization and excitation of neutral molecules. From a practical perspective, integrating large kinetics mechanisms is computationally burdensome due to the temporal stiffness of the nonlinear combustion dynamics and the memory requirements associated with the high number of species. In order to alleviate computational costs, a dimensionality reduction approach is proposed based on principal component analysis. The methodology is demonstrated on a detailed kinetics mechanism for plasma-assisted combustion excited by a nanosecond pulse discharge. Data are collected from a zero-dimensional two-temperature reactor model, whereby a nanosecond pulse generates a population of excited-state molecules and radicals in argon and air mixtures with hydrocarbon fuels. The data from the detailed mechanism are used to describe the evolution of the plasma and mixture based on principal components.

Aggressive emission mitigation measures have been taken recently in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH), China, but pervasive and persistent haze still frequently engulfs this region during wintertime. Occurrence frequency of unfavorable meteorological conditions in winter is anticipated to constitute a significantly important factor in driving the heavy haze formation in BTH. Large scale synoptic patterns influencing BTH during the wintertime from 2013 to 2017 are categorized into six types, including “north-low”, “southwest-trough”, “southeast-high”, “southeast-trough”, “transition”, and “inland-high” using the NCEP reanalysis data. “Southwest-trough” and “southeast-high” are defined as favorable synoptic patterns and the remaining four categories are unfavorable ones based on FLEXPART simulations. Compared to measurements of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in BTH, favorable synoptic conditions generally correspond to the low level or decreasing trend of PM2.5 concentrations while under unfavorable conditions PM2.5 concentrations are high or increasing. Occurrence of wintertime haze episodes in BTH correlates well with the evolution trend of unfavorable synoptic patterns from 2013 to 2017 although the anthropogenic emissions have substantially decreased. PM2.5 concentrations also exhibit correlations with local meteorological elements, including winds, temperature, and relative humidity, which are ultimately steered by large scale synoptic situations. The WRF-Chem model simulations further reveal the critical role of large-scale synoptic patterns in the heavy haze formation. Overall, under unfavorable synoptic situations, emission mitigation is the best choice to improve the air quality in BTH. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","BTH; PM2.5; Synoptic situations","Air quality; Anthropogenic emissions; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Meteorological condition; Meteorological elements; PM2.5; PM2.5 concentration; Synoptic situations; Atmospheric movements; air quality; air temperature; concentration (composition); haze; particulate matter; relative humidity; synoptic meteorology; wind; winter; air pollutant; air quality; article; China; haze; humidity; meteorology; particulate matter; simulation; winter; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075973677

In this study, we assessed vulnerability to climate change among maize-dependent smallholders in three districts of Ethiopia. Household socio-demographic factors, land use system, access to food, natural hazard, livelihood strategy and social network data were collected and subsequently analysed by the livelihood vulnerability index and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Vulnerability Index approaches. Results show that within the same production system, smallholder farmers experience different degrees of climate change vulnerability. This variation in climate change vulnerability is highly and significantly explained by very localized socio-economic factors such as household educational level, access to drought-resistant crop varieties, extent of family ties with social groups and local organizations, and quality of rural water supply and health infrastructures along with biophysical factors like land size and soil fertility status. It is, therefore, suggested that recognizing smallholder farmers’ relative vulnerability to climate change provides a range of effective coping strategies that would help to better build household resilience capacity and promote sustainable livelihood development. Hence, policymakers and development organizations need to focus on better strengthening human and institutional capacity through enhanced education and continuous training on climate change impact, and efficient and sustainable intensification through crop rotation, fertilizer use, rainwater harvesting and farm diversification that increase productivity by restoring soil and agroecosystem health. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Africa; Coping strategy; Resilience capacity; Sustainable livelihood; Vulnerability index","agricultural ecosystem; climate change; coping strategy; crop rotation; index method; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; livelihood; maize; smallholder; soil fertility; vulnerability; Ethiopia; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049563326

Tailoring this information to the needs of policymakers requires collaboration between scientists and stakeholders. A lot of literature on design principles and comprehension of scientific visualisations exists. However, the links between objective comprehension, perceived usefulness for communication and aesthetics of climate change impact maps have rarely been analysed in empirical studies. In a co-design effort together with stakeholders in adaptation planning and climate change communication experts, regional climate change impact maps were developed and published as open-access dataset. The comprehension, aesthetics and perceived usefulness of different map design features were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated in a two-step survey. Designs with less information density were understood best, found most aesthetical and useful for communication practice. Uncertainties were deemed necessary by participants, but not understood well when combined with other variables on the same map sheet. Map understanding varied significantly with the cognitive difficulty of a task. This difference was robust over user groups.

However, invasive species managers’ concerns about the effects of climate change, the degree to which they incorporate climate change into their management, and what stops them from doing so remain unknown. Therefore, we surveyed natural resource managers addressing invasive species across the U.S. about their priorities, concerns, and management strategies in a changing climate. Of the 211 managers we surveyed, most were very concerned about the influence of climate change on invasive species management, but their organizations were significantly less so. Managers reported that lack of funding and personnel limited their ability to effectively manage invasive species, while lack of information limited their consideration of climate change in decision-making. Additionally, managers prioritized research that identifies range-shifting invasive species and native communities resilient to invasions and climate change. Managers also reported that this information would be most effectively communicated through conversations, research summaries, and meetings/symposia. Despite the need for more information, 65% of managers incorporate climate change into their invasive species management through strategic planning, preventative management, changing treatment and control, and increasing education and outreach. These results show the potential for incorporating climate change into management, but also highlight a clear and pressing need for more targeted research, accessible science communication, and two-way dialogue between researchers and managers focused on invasive species and climate change. © 2019, The Author(s).","Climate change; Invasive species; Management; Translational ecology","climate change; decision making; introduced species; invasive species; natural resource; resource management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072110131

However, controlled defect formation remains a challenge, and, recently, it was shown that common formation methods such as proton irradiation may, in fact, lower the intensity of photoluminescence (PL) emission from V Si as compared to other ion species. Herein, we combine hybrid density functional calculations and PL studies of the proton-irradiated n-type 4H-SiC material to explore the energetics and stability of hydrogen-related defects, situated both interstitially and in defect complexes with V Si, and confirm the stability of hydrogen in different interstitial and substitutional configurations. Indeed, V Si-H is energetically favorable if V Si is already present in the material, e.g., following irradiation or ion implantation. We demonstrate that hydrogen has a significant impact on electrical and optical properties of V Si, by altering the charge states suitable for quantum technology applications, and provide an estimate for the shift in thermodynamic transition levels. Furthermore, by correlating the theoretical predictions with PL measurements of 4H-SiC samples irradiated by protons at high (400 °C) and room temperatures, we associate the observed quenching of V Si emission in the case of high-temperature and high-fluence proton irradiation with the increased mobility of H i, which may initiate V Si-H complex formation at temperatures above 400 °C. The important implication of hydrogen being present is that it obstructs the formation of reliable and efficient single-photon emitters based on silicon vacancy defects in 4H-SiC. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Ground state; Optical properties; Particle beams; Photons; Proton irradiation; Silicon carbide; Temperature; Electrical and optical properties; High-spin ground state; Hybrid density functional calculations; Hydrogen implantation; Hydrogen related defects; Photoluminescence emission; Quantum technologies; Single photon emitters; Silicon compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080072219

However, no systematic analysis has been performed on which regions or processes contribute to this term. To obtain deeper insight on the sources of uncertainty in global and regional carbon budgets, we analyzed differences in Net Biome Productivity (NBP) for all possible combinations of bottom-up and top-down data sets in GCB2018: (i) 16 dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), and (ii) 5 atmospheric inversions that match the atmospheric CO2 growth rate. We find that the global mismatch between the two ensembles matches well the GCB2018 budget imbalance, with Brazil, Southeast Asia, and Oceania as the largest contributors. Differences between DGVMs dominate global mismatches, while at regional scale differences between inversions contribute the most to uncertainty. At both global and regional scales, disagreement on NBP interannual variability between the two approaches explains a large fraction of differences. We attribute this mismatch to distinct responses to El Niño–Southern Oscillation variability between DGVMs and inversions and to uncertainties in land use change emissions, especially in South America and Southeast Asia. We identify key needs to reduce uncertainty in carbon budgets: reducing uncertainty in atmospheric inversions (e.g., through more observations in the tropics) and in land use change fluxes, including more land use processes and evaluating land use transitions (e.g., using high-resolution remote-sensing), and, finally, improving tropical hydroecological processes and fire representation within DGVMs. ©2020.

Low-cost air monitors are increasingly popular for monitoring air pollution exposure; however, they must be calibrated and evaluated in their deployment location first to ensure measurement accuracy and precision. In this study, we developed a 2-step calibration method in which a low-cost monitor is calibrated against a reference analyzer and is then used to calibrate other monitors, shortening the required calibration time and reducing measurement error. The monitors in our experiment measured indoor, outdoor, and personal exposure PM2.5 concentrations during 1 week each of true and sham filtration in 7 homes in Beijing, China. On average, filtration reduced the indoor and personal exposure relevant concentrations by 72% (std. err. = 7%) and 28% (std. err. = 5%), respectively. This study indicates that minimizing personal exposure, however, also requires reducing the infiltration of outdoor air in homes or decreasing PM2.5 pollution at the city or country level. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Air filtration; Low-cost sensors; Personal exposure; Plantower; PM2.5","Calibration; Costs; Exposure controls; Indoor air pollution; Air filtration; Low-cost sensors; Personal exposures; Plantower; PM2.5; Air filters; accuracy assessment; atmospheric pollution; calibration; concentration (composition); filtration; indoor air; particulate matter; pollution exposure; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079047608

Data were collected from the GHG inventories and climate action plans from 24 Brazilian cities using content analysis. All cities developed their GHG inventories using Production-Based Approach (PBA), adding at least electricity and waste emissions that occurred out-boundaries. Several gaps were identified in the cities' greenhouse (GHG) emissions inventories that consequently impacted their climate action plans. Two main types of reporting gaps were identified: incompleteness (Gap 1) and lack of transparency (Gap 2). Seventeen GHG reports presented Gap 1. Brazilian cities’ GHG reports do not appropriately reflect emissions occurring as a result of activities and consumption patterns of the city. Twenty reports presented Gap 2 with no transparency about assumptions, input data, source of input data, emission factors, calculation methods or accounting limitations. Sixteen cities measured only (I) stationary energy, including electricity imported by the grid; (II) transport; and (III) waste. Four cities reported also Industrial Process and Product Use (IPPU) emissions and seven, reported Agriculture, Forestry and other Land Use (AFOLU) emissions/removals. Brazilian cities did not measure GHG emissions related to consumption of foods, beverages and imports of manufactured products. As a result, no climate action plan considers actions towards sustainable consumption. The study provides insights for academics and policymakers on how to choose the best methodology and develop more complete inventories and low-carbon plans. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon accounting; City; Climate action plans; Climate change; Consumption-based carbon accounting; GHG emissions inventories gaps; Production-based carbon accounting","Carbon; Climate change; Emission control; Forestry; Gas emissions; Input output programs; Land use; Transparency; Action plan; Carbon accounting; City; Consumption patterns; GHG emission; Greenhouse gas inventory; Manufactured products; Sustainable consumption; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074173702

The advent of the 4th industrial revolution has seen the increased application of digitalization in several fields and at different levels. High-tech digital devices, platforms and environments are increasingly being deployed to enhance productivity, efficiency and sustainability, and improve overall well-being of urban dwellers. Digitalization is projected to further impact cities in future, transform jobs and trigger life-style changes with far-reaching impacts that will ultimately affect cities’ resilience and adaptation capacities. While a growing body of research has highlighted the significance of digitalization to climate change mitigation such as reducing GHG and CO2 emissions, comprehensive evaluations of the potentials of digitalization as an enabler of climate change adaptation remain scarce. This paper addresses this gap by analysing the current trend in digital revolution in relation to climate change adaptation and examines the likely challenges of digitalization. A desk research method was adopted, focusing on core digitalization concepts driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0). Nine case studies in cities across various continents were selected to assess the potentials of digitalization in addressing climatic hazards and to highlight benefits from implementing digitalization, while considering the social-ecological-technological challenges and tensions around IR 4.0. Our findings reveal the capabilities of digitalization in supporting more effective early warning and emergency response systems, enhancing food and water security, improving power infrastructure performance, enabling citizen engagement and participatory adaptation measures and minimizing the impacts of climatic hazards. Finally, we recommend feasible pathways to overcome present risks and challenges in order to optimize the numerous opportunities offered by digitalization in support of climate change adaptation initiatives. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate change; Digitalization; Sustainable; Urban","Digital devices; Greenhouse gases; Hazards; Industrial research; Industry 4.0; Planning; Sustainable development; Adaptation; Climate change adaptation; Climate change mitigation; Comprehensive evaluation; Digitalization; Emergency response systems; Sustainable; Urban; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074688306

Ecological services of agroforestry systems in selected upland farming communities in the Philippines. Biodiversitas 21: 707-717. A study was conducted in three selected upland farming communities in Nueva Vizcaya, Benguet and Quezon, Philippines to assess the ecological services of agroforestry systems. Results showed that alley cropping was the dominant agroforestry system in Nueva Vizcaya, while vegetable-based and coffee-based multistorey systems were found prevailing in Benguet and Quezon provinces. Agrobiodiversity assessment revealed that the values of Shannon-Wiener diversity index of agroforestry systems in the three study sites were considered to be low to moderate, ranging from 2.21 to 2.71. This validates that the number of individuals per species in the agroforestry landscape was not evenly distributed. The means of biomass in the three study sites, ranging from 106.22-127 tons ha-1, were higher than that of agroforestry systems (102.80 tons ha-1) in the Philippines. The agroforestry systems in Nueva Vizcaya had the largest carbon stock of 57.15 ton C ha-1, followed by Quezon 52.96 ton C ha-1 and Benguet 47.80 ton C ha-1. These results are comparable to the overall mean of carbon stock of tree plantations (59.0 ton C ha-1) and higher than that of agroforestry systems in the Philippines, i.e., 45.4 ton C ha-1. Therefore, this article argues that the different agroforestry systems provide ecological services in the upland farming communities in the Philippines. © 2020, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Land use changes can alter the soil organic carbon (SOC) content, a key determinant of several regulation ecosystem services. Here, we analyzed the effects of land cover (e.g. from forest to cropland) and land use (i.e. management practices) change on SOC in the semi-arid Chaco of Argentina, a global deforestation hotspot. Using the CENTURY model, we analyzed SOC changes over 20 years for two sites with contrasting rainfall (600 and 800 mm). For each site, we evaluated the effect of different combination of management practices (e.g. fertilization, grazing intensity) and land uses (i.e. annual crops and sown pastures). 98.5% of the simulations performed for cropping systems showed a reduction in SOC, with an average reduction of 25% respect to the native forest. Wheat proportion in the crop rotation had the highest relative influence on SOC variation (54%), higher than the proportion of maize (26.4%) and nitrogen fertilization (9.8%). For sown pastures, &lt;40% of the simulations showed SOC decreases up to 18%. Grazing intensity had the greatest relative influence on SOC variation in both sites (&gt;60%), followed by burning (19%), temporary exclusion of cattle (12%) and nitrogen fertilization (4.3%). In most cases SOC changes were mainly explained by changes in C inputs (i.e. NPP) rather than by changes in outputs (i.e. respiration and erosion). Therefore, delta SOC showed a strong negative relationship with the Human Appropriation of NPP (R2 = 0.54 and 0.67 in cropping systems and pastures, respectively). Overall, our results suggest that land use change has negative effects on SOC regardless of the management practices implemented. The few combinations that balanced food production and carbon sequestration were maize monocultures with annual N fertilization, and cattle raising with temporary exclusion and burning suppression. Our results may be used to define management practices that allow maintaining soil carbon stocks in the upper soil layer. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CENTURY; HANPP; Land use change; Net primary production; Soil organic carbon","carbon sequestration; crop rotation; deforestation; ecosystem service; land use change; management practice; net primary production; rainfall; semiarid region; soil carbon; Argentina; Chaco [Argentina]; Bos; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075261820

These models can include both photochemical Eulerian grid models or reduced complexity models; these latter models make simplifying assumptions about the emissions-to-air quality relationship as a means of reducing the computational time needed to simulate air quality. This manuscript presents a new database of photochemical- and reduced complexity-modelled changes in annual average particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm and associated health effects and economic values for five case studies representing different emissions control scenarios. The research community is developing an increasing number of reduced complexity models as lower-cost and more expeditious alternatives to full form Eulerian photochemical grid models such as the Comprehensive Air-Quality Model with eXtensions (CAMx) and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. A comprehensive evaluation of reduced complexity models can demonstrate the extent to which these tools capture complex chemical and physical processes when representing emission control options. Systematically comparing reduced complexity model predictions to benchmarks from photochemical grid models requires a consistent set of input parameters across all systems. Developing such inputs is resource intensive and consequently the data that we have developed and shared (https://github.com/epa-kpc/RFMEVAL) provide a valuable resource for others to evaluate reduced complexity models. The dataset includes inputs and outputs representing 5 emission control scenarios, including sector-based regulatory policy scenarios focused on on-road mobile sources and electrical generating units (EGUs) as well as hypothetical across-the-board reductions to emissions from cement kilns, refineries, and pulp and paper facilities. Model inputs, outputs, and run control files are provided for the Air Pollution Emission Experiments and Policy Analysis (APEEP) version 2 and 3, Intervention Model for Air Pollution (InMAP), Estimating Air pollution Social Impact Using Regression (EASIUR), and EPA's source apportionment benefit-per-ton reduced complexity models. For comparison, photochemical grid model annual average PM2.5 output is provided for each emission scenario. Further, inputs are also provided for the Environmental Benefits and Mapping Community Edition (BenMAP-CE) tool to generate county level health benefits and monetized health damages along with output files for benchmarking and intercomparison. Monetized health impacts are also provided from EASIUR and APEEP which can provide these outside the BenMAP-CE framework. The database will allow researchers to more easily compare reduced complexity model predictions against photochemical grid model predictions. © 2019","APEEP; BenMAP; CAMx; CMAQ; EASIUR; InMAP; PM2.5",,Data Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076093128

The 9-km simulation results show that the 8-year average contribution of the Chinese emissions in 17 provinces ranged from 40-65%, which is ~4% lower than that from the 27-km simulation for the high-tier government segments (particularly prominent in coastal areas). However, for the same comparison for low-tier government segments (i.e., 250 prefectures), the 9-km simulation presented lowered the foreign contribution by up to 10% compared to that from the 27-km simulation. Based on our study results, we recommend using high-resolution modeling results for regional contribution analyses to develop an air quality action plan as the receptor coverage decreases. © 2020 by the authors.","Long-range transport; Model horizontal grid resolution; PM2.5; Receptor coverage; Source-receptor relationship","Smoke; Horizontal grid; Long range transport; PM2.5; Receptor coverage; Source-receptor relationships; Air quality; aerosol composition; air quality; atmospheric modeling; concentration (composition); long range transport; particulate matter; quantitative analysis; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081158937

In this article, the focus was placed on the prospects of improving urban air quality through proper design and protection of vegetation systems within local spatial planning strategies. Recent studies regarding the mitigation of air pollution by urban greenery due to deposition and aerodynamic effects were reviewed, with special attention given to the design guidelines resulting from these studies and their applicability in the process of urban planning. The conclusions drawn from the review were used to conduct three case studies: in Gdansk, Warsaw, and Poznan, Poland. The existing local urban planning regulations for the management of urban greenery were critically evaluated in relation to the findings of the review. The results indicate that the current knowledge regarding the improvement of urban air quality by vegetation is not applied in the process of urban planning to a sufficient degree.

This research focuses on the comparison between a traditional roof (TR) and a green roof (GR) under the weather conditions of eight cities in Mexico. The study was carried out by means of thermal simulations using the EnergyPlus software, which were validated with experimental data from two test boxes (TR and GR). For the validation of the simulations, the interior surface temperature and the heat flow of the roof of the test boxes were measured, and a maximum error of 3.55% and 2.17% was found for the interior surface temperature for the traditional and green roof, respectively. The results of the simulation showed that in locations with warm weather the GR reduced the indoor temperature of the house up to 4.7 °C. In locations with temperate weather, the GR reduced the cooling energy demand by up to 99%, and at the same time increased the heating energy demand by 25%. From the environmental study, it was found that the GR also reduced the CO2 by 45.7%. In the economic part, the GR had a payback period of 8.8 years, which makes the implementation of the green roof viable. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Energy consumption; Green roofs; Residential building; Thermal performance","Atmospheric temperature; Building codes; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy utilization; Heating; Housing; Investments; Software testing; Surface properties; Energy performance; Environmental studies; Green roof; Indoor temperature; Interior surfaces; Residential building; Thermal Performance; Thermal simulations; Roofs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076840232

Through five cases, covering a range of climate risks and types of adaptation measures, this paper critically examines Swedish project coordinators’ perceptions of costs and benefits in already-implemented climate adaptation measures. Our study finds that project coordinators make use of different system boundaries–on temporal, geographical and administrative scales–in their cost/benefit evaluations, making the practice of determining adaptation costs arbitrary and hard to compare. We further demonstrate that the project coordinators interpret costs and benefits in a manner that downplays the intangible environmental and social costs and benefits arising from the adaptation measures, despite their own experience of how such measures negatively impact upon social value. The exclusion of social and environmental costs and benefits has severe implications for justice, as it can bias decisions against people and ecosystems that are affected negatively. Based on the findings, we propose three tentative social justice dilemmas in local climate adaptation planning and implementation: 1. Cost and benefit distribution across scales; 2. The identification and valuation of non-market effects; and 3. The equitable allocation of costs and benefits. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

We investigated exposure to nitrogen oxides (NOX) as a whole and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) specifically, as well as PM10, and PM2·5, during childhood and subsequent schizophrenia risk. Methods: People born in Denmark from 1980 to 1984 (N=230 844), who were residing in the country on their tenth birthday, and who had two Danish-born parents were followed-up from their tenth birthday until schizophrenia diagnosis or Dec 31, 2016. Mean daily exposure to each pollutant (NO2, NOX, PM10, and PM2·5) at all of an individual's residential addresses from birth to their tenth birthday was modelled. Incidence rate ratios, cumulative incidence, and population attributable risks were calculated using survival analysis techniques. Findings: We analysed data between Aug 1, 2018, and Nov 15, 2019. Of 230 844 individuals included, 2189 cohort members were diagnosed with schizophrenia during follow-up. Higher concentrations of residential NO2 and NOX exposure during childhood were associated with subsequent elevated schizophrenia risk. People exposed to daily mean concentrations of more than 26·5 μg/m3 NO2 had a 1·62 (95% CI 1·41–1·87) times increased risk compared with people exposed to a mean daily concentration of less than 14·5 μg/m3. The absolute risks of developing schizophrenia by the age of 37 years when exposed to daily mean concentrations of more than 26·5 μg/m3 NO2 between birth and 10 years were 1·45% (95% CI 1·30–1·62%) for men and 1·03% (0·90–1·17) for women, whereas when exposed to a mean daily concentration of less than 14·5 μg/m3, the risk was 0·80% (95% CI 0·69–0·92%) for men and 0·67% (0·57–0·79) for women. Associations between exposure to PM2·5 or PM10 and schizophrenia risk were less consistent. Interpretation: If the association between air pollution and schizophrenia is causal, reducing ambient air pollution including NO2 and NOX could have a potentially considerable effect on lowering schizophrenia incidence at the population level. Further investigations are necessary to establish a causal relationship.

In this study, we report the facile synthesis of fluorescent carbon quantum dots (CQDs) using ice-biryani (processed white rice waste) as a precursor and its application in bioimaging was evaluated using in vitro and in vivo models. CQDs was synthesized from carbonized ice-biryani by means of nitric acid treatment. To improve the quantum yield (QY) of as synthesized CQDs, we adopted two-step surface modification processes i.e., (i) preparation of reduced-state CQDs (r-CQDs) via borohydride reduction method followed by (ii) rigidifying with a tripeptide i.e., glutathione (r-CQDs-GS).The effective interactions of oxygen rich r-CQDs and GS stabilization has enhanced the QY from (bare CQDs) 5.46 % to (r-CQDs-GS) 41 %. The resultant r-CQDs-GS was found to be an average particle size of ∼2−5 nm with pH tuned emission between pH 1–10. The biocompatibility of r-CQDs-GS was tested using A549 cells and it was observed that almost 90 % cell viability and normal morphology was retained even after treated with concentrations up to 100 μg/ml.

Water input is mostly from rainfall, concentrated in three to four months of the year and with a potential evaporation that is over twice the amount of rainfall that characterizes its hydric deficit. Study focus: Interactions between hydrological functions, services and human actions to minimize environmental impacts, improve the availability of water of good quality and decrease degradation of the ecosystems; land use management effect on systems resilience, impact on surface runoff, soil loss, herbaceous and radicular biomass production, soil humidity and total organic carbon under altered vegetation cover. New hydrological insights for the region: Strategies to improve ecosystem services should rely on adequate management of vegetation to reduce surface flow. This reduction contributes to higher soil moisture contents, less intense erosive processes and resulting higher stocked soil carbon. The many techniques that improve resilience and ecosystem services in tropical dry forests lack an integrated view on how ecohydrological processes may be managed to favor the system. Vegetation thinning promotes underbrush development that dissipates rainfall and surface flow kinetic energy, increasing soil moisture content and carbon fixation and reducing soil loss. © 2019","ecohydrology; ecosystem resilience; ecosystem services; hydrologic processes; semi-arid hydrology; tropical dry forest",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075879048

Since liquefaction plants represent energy intensive processes, the best configurations/operation assessment is of primary importance. In this paper, a novel general procedure for the thermodynamic design and optimization, engineering design and off-design evaluation for small-scaleLNGproduction systems is presented. The procedure can be used for the complete design and performance evaluation of plug&play facilities at filling stations for vehicles/boats, with the contemporary benefits of reducing pollutant emission in the city/port area and operating as electrical storage, coupled with renewable generators. Furthermore, the procedure has been applied to a case study (ferry boat operating at the main canal in the port of Ravenna, Italy), evaluating the optimal size for the integrated wind plant by minimizing the electricity introduction into the grid. The obtained results show 78 kW as optimal wind size, allowing the LNG plant to operate 187 h/year in design and 4720 h/year in off-design conditions, with electricity surplus around 33 MWh/year. A prototype will be installed to reduce pollutant emissions and test this technology as a storage option for renewable sources. © 2020 by the authors.","LNG; Off-design calculation model; Power to liquid; Small-scale application; Thermodynamic analysis; Transport sector",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081201477

Immediate response of atmospheric turbulence to BC-induced atmospheric warming strongly depends on the available solar radiation (time of the day), BC concentration, and atmospheric boundary layer dynamics. Besides the significant climate implications of a reduction in turbulence kinetic energy, a large reduction in the refractive index structure parameter (C2 n) resulting from BC-induced warming would affect the atmospheric propagation of laser beams. Interestingly, aerosols contribute significantly (up to 25%) to the signal deterioration in optical wireless communication systems during convectively stable atmospheric conditions when higher signal-to-noise ratios are expected otherwise due to the reduced thermal convection. Competing effects of the fractional contributions of aerosol extinction and scintillations on beam attenuation are reported; daytime being largely dominated by scintillation effects while the nighttime being dependent on the ambient aerosol concentration as well. We put forward the entanglement of optical turbulence to aerosol concentration, atmospheric boundary layer dynamics, and surface-reaching solar radiation, and discuss the possible implications for optical propagation. © 2020 Optical Society of America",,"Aerosols; Atmospheric boundary layer; Atmospheric structure; Atmospheric turbulence; Deterioration; Heat convection; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Laser beams; Light propagation; Optical communication; Particles (particulate matter); Refractive index; Scintillation; Signal to noise ratio; Solar radiation; Aerosol black carbon; Aerosol concentration; Atmospheric conditions; Atmospheric propagation; Optical wireless communication systems; Refractive index structure parameter; Signal deterioration; Turbulence kinetic energy; Atmospheric thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079408413

In state of the art steam cracking plants more than 90% of the CO2 emissions can be directly related to the high energy consumption of the endothermic conversion in the cracking furnaces. Steam cracking accounts for a global emission of more than to 300 million tonnes of CO2per annum. Enhancing heat transfer in the radiation section, using green energy and reducing coke formation are key to substantially reduce CO2 emissions. Heat transfer can be increased by implementing three-dimensional (3D) coil technologies such as swirled and dimpled tubes. These reactor technologies also reduces coke formation because of the lower wall temperatures that are consequently obtained. Advanced manufacturing techniques and better computational abilities have opened the door to novel and improved 3D reactor technologies that are designed to increase the heat transfer while minimizing the pressure drop penalty. At the same time applying high emissivity coatings on the furnace refractory and reactor tubes can further reduce CO2 emissions. Substantial fuel savings can also be obtained by a novel furnace design, where the heat recovery scheme is substantially modified. Combining all these technologies could result in reducing emissions by 30%. Shifting completely to green electricity, which is practically infeasible today, is another alternative but the technologies that would potentially allow this are still in their infancy. These new technologies, combined with advanced process innovations and CO2 capture, will help the industry to meet future emissions targets. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.",,"Carbon dioxide; Coke; Energy utilization; Fuel economy; Furnaces; Heat transfer; Light olefins; Steam; Waste heat; Advanced manufacturing; Computational ability; Enhancing heat transfer; Furnace refractories; High energy consumption; Industrial processs; Steam cracking plants; Threedimensional (3-d); Steam cracking",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079345915

Environmental pollution could be caused by different types of pollutants, which come from different sources. This study aims to assess the environmental magnetism efficiency for heavy metal pollution assessment using the magnetic susceptibility technique which became a more rapid and cost-effective compared to conventional methods. Increasing heavy metal contents in soils causes an increase in the magnetic mineral concentration. The study area is located in Al- Muthanna province, southeast of Iraq, and contains three cement plants, an oil refinery, bricks factories, and power plants. Fifty topsoil and subsoil samples (0-50 cm depth) were collected from five sites; Al-Jinoob cement plant (one site), Samawa oil refinery (two sites) and Al- Muthanna cement plant (two sites). In this study, magnetic properties of samples in vertical sections and levels of heavy metal elements; of selected samples from regions with different geological settings were compared. The heavy metals analysis included chromium (Cu), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), Arsenic (As) and lead (Pb), which could give indications of heavy metal pollution in soil. The highest magnetic susceptibility value (65.23 x10-8 m3kg-1) was recorded in Al-Muthanna cement plant (TSL-4) and the highest Cu concentration (602.57 ppm) was also recorded in Al-Muthanna cement plant (TSL-5-3). The results of magnetic properties show the dominance of coarse magnetite, which is supposed to have originated from pedogenic particles in natural soils, causing the positive correlation between magnetic susceptibility (χ) and anhysteretic remanent magnetisation (ARM). According to the results of frequency dependent susceptibility ratio (κfd%), the magnetic particles showed an admixture of multi-domain and pseudo-single domain behaviour. Magnetic susceptibility and heavy metal analyses results indicated emissions from nearby industrial plants. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) was carried out for heavy metal analyses which supported our results. Results of this study demonstrate the suitability of applying magnetic techniques for assessing environmental situations. © 2020 University of Baghdad-College of Science.

LIBs are a critical enabler of clean energy technologies commonly associated with air pollution and greenhouse gas mitigation strategies. However, LIBs require lithium, and expanding the supply of lithium requires new lithium production capacity, which, in turn, changes the environmental impacts associated with lithium production since different resource types and ore qualities will be exploited. A question of interest is whether this will lead to significant changes in the environmental impacts of primary lithium over time. Part one of this two-part article series describes the development of a novel resource production model that predicts future lithium demand and production characteristics (e.g., timing, location, and ore type). In this article, part two, the forecast is coupled with anticipatory life-cycle assessment (LCA) modeling to estimate the environmental impacts of producing battery-grade lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) each year between 2018 and 2100. The result is a normalized life-cycle impact intensity for LCE that reflects the changing resource type, quantity, and region of production. Sustained growth in lithium demands through 2100 necessitates extraction of lower grade resources and mineral deposits, especially after 2050. Despite the reliance on lower grade resources and differences in impact intensity for LCE production from each deposit, the LCA results show only small to modest increases in impact, for example, carbon intensity increases from 3.2 kg CO2e/kg LCE in 2020 to 3.3 kg CO2e/kg LCE in 2100. © 2019 The Authors.

More efficient use of agrosystem restoration practices can be achieved with the aid of termites' activities, which positively influence the physicochemical and hydraulic properties of soils in favor of productive soil. However, termites have a significant place in agrosystems, but it has remained under exploited and unrefined and needs to be restored to increase its yield. Here, we quantify the colonization rates of termites on marginal soils and in agrosystems with ongoing restoration efforts, as well as determine their footprints on soil characteristics over a 2-year period in semi-arid Niger. We used a rapid assessment protocol, a technic used to assess termites' population in semi-arid regions, adapted from an earlier studies. The results from various analyses showed that termite abundance, richness, and diversity were 15% to 45% higher in the restored agrosystems than in the degraded ones. The evenness did not augment in the restored habitats what might result from the changes in soil properties triggered by clearcutting. Moreover, organic compounds, particularly carbon, nitrogen, in some cases phosphorus, and exchangeable cations are more abundant in restored sites where termite activities are intense than in the controls. A higher termite diversity and abundance are important factors underlying positive changes in soil properties. This study provides evidence of the effectiveness of termite species in restoring degraded soil and in maintaining long-term soil fertility, thereby facilitating sustainable agriculture. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","agrosystems restoration; bio indicators; soil properties; taxonomic richness; termites","Agriculture; Ecosystems; Food supply; Physicochemical properties; Soils; Exchangeable cation; Hydraulic properties; Restoration practices; Soil characteristics; Soil property; Sustainable agriculture; Taxonomic richness; termites; Restoration; Isoptera; Termitidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076347010

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are ubiquitous atmospheric pollutants contained in the atmospheric aerosol. PAH in particulate matter with diameters ≤2.5 µm (PM2.5) represent a human health risk due to their toxic properties. In this study, PAH in PM2.5 at a receptor site of Mexico City during the dry cold season were determined. The most abundant PAH (median, 10–90th percentile, pg m−3) were benzo[ghi]perylene (467, 291–697), followed by pyrene (427, 218–642). A decrease around 40% in the carcinogenic PAH onto PM2.5 was calculated with respect to the same PAH measured a decade ago, at the same receptor site, despite of increase in vehicle fleet. The PAH decrease trend agrees with the decrease trend of CO, NO and NO2, released into the air by similar emission sources than PAH. Control emissions strategies implemented by local and federal authorities are discussed. PAH analyses were carried out by non-real-time and real-time methods. The PAH non-real-time method involved PM2.5 sampling, sample treatment and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The PAH real-time method involved the use of a photoelectric aerosol sensor (PAS). The PAH determination by non-real time method was selective and efficient, with recoveries between 75 ± 14% and 98 ± 26%. By combining non-real-time and real-time methodologies, multivariate regression models were obtained based on PAS response, NO2 and wind speed to estimate PAH in PM2.5 at low-cost (r2 = 0.59 to r2 = 0.89). Fossil fuel combustion from vehicles was the major source around the sampling site. Diagnostic ratios (DR) based on retene, chrysene, and triphenylene, suggested biomass burning emission sources. Photo-oxidation in sunny months was observed based on benzo[a]pyrene, benzo[ghi]perylene, benz[a]anthracene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene and black carbon. The correlation analyses suggested transport of PM2.5, O3, BC and SO2 to the sampling site, and local emissions of PAH, NO and CO. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality; Diagnostic ratio; Emission sources; Low-cost techniques; Public policies","Air quality; Atmospheric aerosols; Costs; Fleet operations; Fossil fuels; Gas chromatography; Health risks; Mass spectrometry; Mineral oils; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Public policy; Pyrene; Regression analysis; Wind; Biomass burning emissions; Diagnostic ratios; Emission sources; Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; Low costs; Multivariate regression models; Photoelectric aerosol sensors; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH); Cost benefit analysis; aerosol composition; aerosol formation; air quality; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; carbon emission; carcinogen; PAH; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075948777

However, there is a paucity of international studies that analyse the status of climate change policies. This paper reports on research undertaken in a sample of 13 highly diverse countries, in regards to their geography, socioeconomic development, vulnerability elements, adaptation, and climate-risks. The results draw attention to the global spread and standardisation of climate change policies, namely through the adoption of comprehensive National Adaptation Plans/Strategies (NAPs/NASs) that include mitigation measures and evaluation mechanisms. Although NAPs tend to take into account different non-governmental stakeholders, they are still mainly state-centred (i.e. their steering and implementation are the responsibility of each country´s Ministry of the Environment) in most of the 13 countries in which this study was carried out. The results show that NAPs’ objectives mainly reflect more a global agenda and pay less attention to national/regional vulnerabilities and contexts. In fact, despite different socioeconomic levels of development, diverse climate-risks, and dissimilar vulnerability and readiness status among countries, the examined NAPs tend to focus on the same critical sectors and objectives. Notwithstanding their similarities, our results highlight two different logics of adaptation reflected on the NAPs: one focused on economic risks and opportunities, characteristic of developed countries; and others focused on natural resources and conservation, characteristic of developing countries. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Climate change adaptation policies; Global/Local vulnerabilities; National adaptation plans","adoption; article; attention; climate change; developing country; geography; natural resource; responsibility; standardization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076461402

Results show increase in the number of clusters did not significantly alter results. PM10 generally shows a reduction in trend, especially in SW direction and an overall minimal reduction in the pollutants’ concentration in all directions is observed (less than 1). Fluctuations were observed in the behaviors of CO and NOx during the day while NOx displayed relative stability. Results also show that a direct and positive linear relationship exists between the PM10 (target pollutant) and CO, SO2, which suggests that these pollutants originate from the same sources. A semi-linear relationship is observed between the PM10 and others (O3 and NOx) while humidity shows a negative linearity with PM10. We conclude that most of the major pollutants show a positive trend toward the industrial areas in both stations while traﬃc emissions dominate this site (CA0016) for CO and NOx.

Through a case study in the Inter Andean sector of the Region of Amazonas, the study aims at exploring the perceptions and interpretations of climate change and its impacts from two different perspectives: regional institutions and smallholder farmers. The novelty of this study lies in examining simultaneously different levels of society and comparing two sets of views. In addition, it focuses on the inter Andean sector of Peru in the Region of Amazonas, an area that is relatively underexplored in the scientific literature. Data collection involved 13 semi-structured interviews at the institutional level, 23 semi-structured interviews in two selected rural communities and 2 participatory workshops deploying Participatory Rural Appraisal tools. The most commonly reported indicators of change include higher temperatures, shifts in the rainy season and more frequent extreme weather events. As a consequence of these changes, reduced crop yield, greater incidence of coffee rust, increased difficulties with the organization of the agricultural calendar and new diseases for animals and humans were mentioned. Compared to institutions, farmers provided a more accurate description of how climate change affects the local livelihood system. Institutions highlighted the problem of limited availability of historical climatic data and scientific studies related to the Region. In this context, local knowledge and bottom-up perspectives can play an important role to inform policies and plans to address climate change at the local scale. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate change; institutions; livelihoods; perceptions; Peru; smallholder farmers","agronomy; climate change; coffee; farmers attitude; farmers knowledge; institutional framework; literature review; livelihood; questionnaire survey; rust disease; smallholder; traditional knowledge; vulnerability; Amazonas [Peru]; Peru; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065657148

As such, the management of food waste can play a fundamental role in the reduction of preventable emissions associated with food waste. In this study, life cycle assessment (LCA) has been used to evaluate and compare the environmental impact associated with two composting techniques for treating food waste using SimaPro software; windrow composting and the hybrid anaerobic digestion (AD) method. The study, based on a 1 tonne of food waste as a functional unit for a case study in the State of Qatar, concludes that anaerobic digestion combined composting presents a smaller environmental burden than windrow composting. The majority of the emissions generated are due to the use of fossil fuels during transportation, which correspond to approximately 60% of the total impact, followed by the impact of composting with 40% of the impact especially in terms of global warming potential. Environmental assessment impacts were the highest in windrow composting for the acidification impact category (9.39 x 10-1 kg SO2 eq).

The aim is to increase the success of in-situ CO2 foam generation and propagation into the reservoir for CO2 mobility control, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and CO2 storage. Un-steady state in-situ CO2 foam behavior, representative of the near wellbore region, and steady-state foam behavior was evaluated. Multi-cycle surfactant-Alternating gas (SAG) provided the highest apparent viscosity foam of 120.2 cP, compared to co-injection (56.0 cP) and single-cycle SAG (18.2 cP) in 100% brine saturated porous media. CO2 foam EOR corefloods at first-contact miscible (FCM) conditions showed that multi-cycle SAG generated the highest apparent foam viscosity in the presence of refined oil (n-Decane). Multi-cycle SAG demonstrated high viscous displacement forces critical in field implementation where gravity effects and reservoir heterogeneities dominate. At multiple-contact miscible (MCM) conditions, no foam was generated with either injection strategy as a result of wettability alteration and foam destabilization in presence of crude oil. In both FCM and MCM corefloods, incremental oil recoveries were on average 30.6% OOIP regardless of injection strategy for CO2 foam and base cases (i.e. no surfactant). CO2 diffusion and miscibility dominated oil recovery at the core-scale resulting in high microscopic CO2 displacement. CO2 storage potential was 9.0% greater for multi-cycle SAGs compared to co-injections at MCM. A validated core-scale simulation model was used for a sensitivity analysis of grid resolution and foam quality. The model was robust in representing the observed foam behavior and will be extended to use in field scale simulations. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Boreholes; Carbon dioxide; Enhanced recovery; Oil wells; Paraffins; Petroleum refining; Porous materials; Quality control; Sensitivity analysis; Surface active agents; Viscosity; Enhanced oil recovery; First-contact miscible; Near-wellbore region; Numerical sensitivity; Reservoir heterogeneity; Saturated porous media; Sensitivity studies; Wettability alteration; Foam control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079611772

The commodity boom of the 2000s significantly expanded the agriculture frontier in most provinces of Argentina, with devastating effects on native forests. Interestingly, some of the subnational governments that presided over the commodities supercycle also sought to reform the forestry sector to reduce rampant deforestation, despite promoting and benefiting from agricultural expansion. A national program to protect native forests through payment for environmental services (PES) was created to be implemented in local districts. We argue that the success of new forest protections is contingent on the capacity of subnational governments to implement the law. In our study, we find that changes in provincial deforestation rates are explained by the interaction of state capacity, on one hand, and high land prices driven by commodity pressures, on the other. Our research carries implications for students and practitioners of forest PES.

Its increased use combined with the difficulty of accurately measuring this variable points a need to directly assess the importance of microbial biomass abundance for carbon (C) cycling. To test the hypothesis that the initial microbial biomass abundance (i.e. biomass abundance on new plant litter) is a strong driver of plant litter C cycling, we manipulated biomass abundance by 10 and 100-fold dilution and composition using 12 source communities on sterile pine litter and measured respiration in microcosms for 30 days. In the first two days of microbial growth on fresh litter, a 100-fold difference in initial biomass abundance caused an average difference in respiration of nearly 300%, but the effect rapidly declined to less than 30% in 10 days and to 14% in 30 days. Parallel simulations with a soil carbon model, SOMIC 1.0, also predicted a 14% difference over 30 days, consistent with the experimental results. Model simulations predicted convergence of cumulative CO2 to within 10% in three months and within 4% in three years. Rapid microbial growth, evidenced by appearance of visible microbial mats on the litter during the first week of incubation, likely attenuates the effects of large initial differences in biomass abundance. In contrast, the persistence of source community as an explanatory factor in driving differences in respiration across microcosms supports the importance of microbial composition in C cycling. Overall, the results suggest that the initial abundance of microbial biomass on litter is a weak driver of C flux from litter decomposition over long timescales (months to years) when litter communities have equal nutrient availability. By extension, slight variation in the timing of microbial dispersal to fresh litter is likely to be a minor factor in long-term C flux. Importance Microbial biomass is one of the most common microbial parameters used in land carbon (C) cycle models, however, it is notoriously difficult to measure accurately. To understand the consequences of mismeasurement, as well as the broader importance of microbial biomass abundance as a direct driver of ecological phenomena, greater quantitative understanding of the role of microbial biomass abundance in environmental processes is needed. Using microcosms, we manipulated the initial biomass of numerous microbial communities across a 100-fold range and measured effects on CO2 production during plant litter decomposition. We found that the effects of initial biomass abundance on CO2 production was largely attenuated within a week, while the effects of community type remained significant over the course of the experiment. Overall, our results suggest that initial microbial biomass abundance in litter decomposition within an ecosystem is a weak driver of long-term C cycling dynamics. © 2020 Albright et al.

Here, we explored the spatio-temporal patterns of potential squid habitat in the western and central North Pacific across inter-decadal climate transitions, coincident with periods of persistent warming and cooling. Potential habitat distributions of Ommastrephes bartramii were derived from the outputs of multi-ensemble species distribution models, developed using the most influential environmental factors to squid distribution and occurrence data. Our analyses captured the underlying temporal trends in potential squid habitat in response to environmental changes transpiring at each climatic transition, regulated by phase shifts in Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) from 1999-2013. The spatial differences in environmental conditions were apparent across transitions and presumably modulate the local changes in suitable squid habitat over time. Specifically, during a cold to warm PDO shift, decreases in the summer potential habitat (mean rate ± standard deviation:-0.04 ± 0.02 habitat suitability index (HSI)/yr) were observed along the southern edge of the subarctic frontal zone (162°E-172°W). Coincidentally, this area also exhibits a warming trend (mean temporal trend: 0.06 ± 0.21 °C/yr), accompanied with the prevalence of cold-core mesoscale eddies, west of the dateline (mean temporal trend in sea surface height:-0.19 ± 1.05 cm/yr). These conditions potentially generate less favorable foraging habitat for squid. However, a warm-to-cold PDO transition underpins a northward shift of suitable habitat and an eastward shift of regions exhibiting the highest rate of potential squid habitat loss (170-160°W; mean temporal trend:-0.05 ± 0.03 HSI/yr). Nonetheless, the emergence of the areas with increasingly suitable habitat regardless of climate transitions suggests the ecological importance of these regions as potential squid habitat hotspots and climatic refugia. © 2020 by the authors.","Habitat shifts; Multi-model ensemble; Neon flying squid; North pacific ocean; Pacific decadal oscillation","Climatology; Molluscs; Surface waters; Habitat shifts; Multi-model ensemble; Neon flying squids; North Pacific Ocean; Pacific decadal oscillation; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080866454

In order to increase the competitiveness and performance level of the port, it has been proposed to implement the Port Community System (PCS) and the dry port railway connection. In order to reduce the harmful gas emission values of ships in port, usage of renewable and environmentally friendly energy generated by Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) method as an Onshore Power Supply System (OPS) has been proposed.

Crop modelling can help inform the improvement of agricultural productivity under future climate. This study applies the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to assessing the impacts of projected climate change on two (early and medium maturing) sorghum varieties under different management practices. Results show high model accuracy with excellent agreement between simulated and observed values for crop phenology and leaf number per plant. The prediction of grain yield and total biomass of an early maturing variety was fair RMSEn (22.9 and 23.1%), while that of the medium maturing was highly accurate RMSEn (14.9 and 11.9%). Sensitivity analysis performed by changing the calibrated variables of key plant traits in the model, showed higher significant yield change by + or - 10 % changed in radiation use efficiency, (RUE), coefficient extinction (Coeff_ext) and Phyllocron (Phyllo) for early maturing variety while + or - 10 % changed in phyllochron and RUE showed a significant yield change for the medium maturing variety. Under climate change scenerios using RCP 8.5, the simulated yield for the early–maturing variety revealed high inter-annual variability and potential yield loss of 3.3% at Bamako and 1% at Kano in the near-future (2010–2039) compared to baseline (1980–2009). The mid-century (2040–2069) projected yield decline by 4.8% at Bamako and 6.2% at Kano compared to baseline (1980–2009). On the contrary, the medium maturing variety indicated significantly yield gain with high yielding potential in both climate regimes compared to the baseline period (1980–2009). The simulated grain yield increased by 7.2% at Bamako and 4.6% at Kano, in the near-future (2010–2039) while in the mid-century (2040–2069) projected yield increase of 12.3% and 2% at Bamako and Kano compared to baseline (1980–2009). Adaptation strategies under climate change for varying sowing dates in the near-future (2010–2039, indicated that June sowing had a higher positive yield gained over July and August sowing for early maturing variety; July sowing simulated positive gained by 5 -11% over June and August sowing for medium maturing variety in both locations. Similarly, under the mid-century (2040–2069), among the sowing dates and in both locations, June sowing indicates lowest negative yield change over July and August sowing for early maturing variety. However, for medium maturing variety, July sowing had the highest yield gain of 16% over June and August sowing at Bamako and June highest positive yield gained of 11.4% over July and August at Kano. Our study has, therefore, demonstrated the capacity of APSIM model as a tool for testing management, plant traits practices and adoption of improved variety for enhancing the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers under climate change in the Sudanian zone of West Africa. This approach offers a promising option to design more resilient and productive farming systems for West Africa using the diverse sorghum germplasm available in the region. © 2019 International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT)","APSIM; Climate scenarios; Simulated yield potential; Sorghum; Water-Limited environment","annual variation; climate change; climate conditions; crop improvement; crop processing; crop production; crop yield; cultivar; high yielding variety; light use efficiency; management practice; modeling; smallholder; sorghum; Kano [Nigeria]; Mali; Nigeria; West Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075274018

The consequences of this heat-induced damage range from the rapid loss of habitat-forming organisms, through to a reduction in the services that ecosystems support, and ultimately to impacts on human health and society. How we tackle the sudden emergence of ecosystem-wide degradation has not yet been addressed in the context of marine heat waves. An examination of recent marine heat waves from around Australia points to the potential important role that respite or refuge from environmental extremes can play in enabling organismal survival. However, most ecological interventions are being devised with a target of mid to late-century implementation, at which time many of the ecosystems, that the interventions are targeted towards, will have already undergone repeated and widespread heat wave induced degradation. Here, our assessment of the merits of proposed ecological interventions, across a spectrum of approaches, to counter marine environmental extremes, reveals a lack preparedness to counter the effects of extreme conditions on marine ecosystems. The ecological influence of these extremes are projected to continue to impact marine ecosystems in the coming years, long before these interventions can be developed. Our assessment reveals that approaches which are technologically ready and likely to be socially acceptable are locally deployable only, whereas those which are scalable—for example to features as large as major reef systems—are not close to being testable, and are unlikely to obtain social licence for deployment. Knowledge of the environmental timescales for survival of extremes, via respite or refuge, inferred from field observations will help test such intervention tools. The growing frequency of extreme events such as marine heat waves increases the urgency to consider mitigation and intervention tools that support organismal and ecosystem survival in the immediate future, while global climate mitigation and/or intervention are formulated. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","ecosystem intervention; heat wave; marine; marine degradation; temperature stress","environmental degradation; extreme event; global climate; heat wave; marine ecosystem; temperature effect; Australia; Australia; climate; climate change; ecosystem; heat; human; Australia; Climate; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Hot Temperature; Humans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077144780

Plant strategies to beat cold are characterized by morphological and physiological adjustments. Here we studied the variations in leaf anatomy and physiology of two grasses Cenchrus ciliaris (Cc) and Imperata cylindrica (Ic) dominating in western Himalayan grasslands which are driven by elevation. We collected leaves of each grass from upper most canopy from three different elevations of district Poonch viz., lower site Paniola (1310 m a.s.l.), middle site Banjosa (1780 m a.s.l.) and higher site Tarkhul (2100 m a.s.l). Results showed that both grasses dodge the aggressive climatic forces by modifying anatomical setting and changing physiological adjustments. Elevation controls the conductive tissues by reducing vessel size and extensive sclerified tissues around the vascular bundles help the plant to avoid cavitation induced in cold conditions. The better physiological adjustment of these grasses at high elevation is ascribed to high proline and sugar present in leaves and accelerated activities of catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) show scavenging ability of these grasses at high altitude. The low activity of malondialdehyde (MDA) is related with lower lipid peroxidation. These results bring novel information on how ecological factors influence the evolution of anatomical and physiological adaptations in high altitude plants. © 2019, Plant Science and Biodiversity Centre, Slovak Academy of Sciences.","Altitude; Antioxidant activities; Eco-physiological traits; Grasses; Himalaya; Osmotic adjustment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076588126

Empirical evidence from a World Bank funded project in the state of Himachal Pradesh in India suggests that these projects might conflict with existing policies and complicate property relations on the ground. These projects might be used by powerful stakeholders as a tool to scuttle the progressive policy reforms. In the case of Himachal Pradesh, state bureaucracy and local elites have used forest carbon project to thwart the progressive policy provisions of HP common land vesting and utilisation (Amendment) Act 2001 and Forest Rights Act 2006, which were enacted to recognise individual and community rights on the community and forest lands respectively. Similarly, existing institutional issues related to lack of inclusiveness, participation and transparency have been exacerbated by the availability of increased resources from the project. Project activities such as fencing and changing land use of community pastures through plantations can adversely impact local livelihoods.

In order to account for uncertainties and to reduce the computational times and retain accuracy, moment matching is used to discretize uncertain distributions. Diverse scenarios are constructed by random sampling of the vectors which contain discrete distributions of uncertain parameters. System design is carried out to minimize the annual total cost and to limit the average of the worst-case emissions with the 5% probability which corresponds to the conditional value at risk (CVaR) of emissions for the confidence level of 95%. The effects of the different values of CVaR on the design of the system are examined. It is shown how the system size changes due to uncertainty and as a function of the CDE target value. Design of an energy system for office buildings in Dalian, China, is presented. Since there is no significant amount of flat surfaces available in a dense urban core, photovoltaics and thermal solar are not considered as candidates for system components. It is shown that with the present-day technology, the lowest amount of CDE is 37% of emissions from standalone systems which use coal-based grid electricity. This indicates the necessity of a significant technological change to reduce CDE to be 10% of standalone systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emission strategies; Combined cooling; Energy system design; Heat; Power system; Random vector sampling; Two-stage stochastic programming; Uncertainty","Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Heating; Office buildings; Solar power generation; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Value engineering; CO2 emissions; Combined cooling; Energy system design; Power system; Random vectors; Two-stage stochastic programming; Uncertainty; Systems analysis; accuracy assessment; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cooling; design method; energy efficiency; sampling; stochasticity; strategic approach; uncertainty analysis; urban area; China; Dalian; Liaoning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076525757

The performance of geothermal tax incentive policies is reflected in the level of utilization of geothermal potential, which is higher in states that provide greater tax incentives. The results also indicate that geothermal power plants in AMS use dry steam, flash and binary cycle technologies with flash plants being the most common. Results suggest that the future development of geothermal energy in AMS will be related to the tax incentive policy and investment climate in those states.

We find that market-based operation can increase efficiency and reduce costs in all Southern Grid provinces—reducing wholesale electricity costs by up to 35% for the entire region relative to the 2016 baseline. About 60% of the potential cost reduction can be realized by creating independent provincial markets within the region, and the rest by creating a regional market without transmission expansion. The wholesale market revenue is adequate to recover generator fixed costs; however, financial restructuring of current payment mechanisms may be necessary. Electricity markets could also reduce the Southern Grid's CO2 emissions by up to 10% owing to more efficient thermal dispatch and avoided hydro/renewable curtailment. The benefits of regional electricity markets with expanded transmission likely will increase as China's renewable generation increases. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","China; CO2 emissions; Dispatch modeling; Power Market reforms; Southern grid","Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Economic and social effects; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission networks; Environmental impact; Power markets; Transmissions; China; CO2 emissions; Economic and environmental benefits; Financial restructuring; Market-based operations; Power market reform; Regional electricity markets; Southern grid; Electric load dispatching; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electricity generation; energy market; environmental economics; Article; carbon footprint; case study; China; commercial phenomena; cost control; economic aspect; electricity; energy resource; environmental impact; hydropower; power supply; renewable energy; rural area; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074671731

Here we present a record of this type of variability inferred from carbon productivity and sea surface temperature (SST) proxies in high-resolution sediment records from the Southern California Current System (CCS). The reconstruction covers ~1,800 years of the Common Era and is associated with the latitudinal migration of the CCS tropical boundary at multidecadal timescales. Inorganic carbon proxies and a Globigerinoides ruber Mg/Ca summer SST reconstruction are associated with the intrusion of the tropical waters in the Southern CCS and organic carbon proxies with the strength of the California Current (CC). From these and other sediment components, we derived a principal component that captures the balance between tropical and subarctic waters in the study region. This principal component record shows further connections with land moisture records, which suggests a link with Pacific basin scale climate reorganization. The results show periods of reduced Pacific multidecadal climate variability associated with cold periods in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). We propose a mechanism related with the southward migration of the westerlies during relatively cool periods in the NH and a southward shift of the North Pacific Current, which could have reduced the advection of subarctic waters to the subtropical region. ©2020.

Specifically, S2Se1 is not only the most stable in the energetic sense but also dynamically stable. Our HSE06+SOC band structure calculation shows that the monolayers exhibit band gaps in the visible region comparable to those of the Janus configuration. S2Se1 WSSe exhibits a direct gap for the spin-up component, while it displays an indirect gap for the spin-down component due to the strong spin-orbit interaction. Our calculation of the activation barrier indicates that the Janus configuration can be converted to S2Se1 by a 15% uniaxial strain. Due to the absence of vertical polarization, we finally show that a S2Se1 WSSe/MoSSe heterobilayer can be much more advantageous than a Janus heterobilayer for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO or HCOOH in almost the entire pH range. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Energy gap; Molybdenum compounds; Monolayers; Activation barriers; Band structure calculation; Photo-catalytic; Photocatalytic reduction; Spin orbit interactions; Uni-axial strains; Vertical polarization; Visible region; Tungsten compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075696572
