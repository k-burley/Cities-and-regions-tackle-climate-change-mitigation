A less understood linkage between weather and air quality is the temperature-dependence of emissions from electricity generating units (EGUs), associated with high electricity demand to support building cooling on hot days. This study quantifies the relationship between ambient surface temperatures and EGU air emissions (CO2, SO2, and NOX) using historical data. We find that EGUs in the Eastern U.S. region from 2007 to 2012 exhibited a 3.87% ± 0.41% increase in electricity generation per °C increase during summer months. This is associated with a 3.35%/°C ± 0.50%/°C increase in SO2 emissions, a 3.60%/°C ± 0.49%/°C increase in NOX emissions, and a 3.32%/°C ± 0.36%/°C increase in CO2 emissions. Sensitivities vary by year and by pollutant, with SO2 both the highest sensitivity (5.04% in 2012) and lowest sensitivity (2.19% in 2007) in terms of a regional average. Texas displays 2007-2012 sensitivities of 2.34%/°C ± 0.28%/°C for generation, 0.91%/°C ± 0.25%/°C for SO2 emissions, 2.15%/°C ± 0.29%/°C for NOX emissions, and 1.78%/°C ± 0.22%/°C for CO2 emissions. These results suggest demand-side and supply side technological improvements and fuel choice could play an important role in cost-effective reduction of carbon emissions and air pollution. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Air quality; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Electric power generation; Pollution; Sulfur dioxide; Temperature distribution; Carbon emissions; Electricity demands; Electricity generation; Natural emissions; Power-plant emissions; Surface temperatures; Technological improvements; Temperature dependence; Air pollution; carbon dioxide; nitrogen oxide; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; demand-side management; electricity generation; emission control; industrial emission; power plant; sensitivity analysis; temperature effect; air quality; Article; cooling; electric power plant; electricity; environmental temperature; pollutant; summer; temperature; temperature sensitivity; United States; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; temperature; Texas; Texas; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Power Plants; Temperature; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020553086

We used available long-term ozone and NOx data in the NFRMA to investigate these trends. Ozone increased from weekdays to weekends for a number of sites in the NFRMA with weekend reductions in NO2 at two sites in downtown Denver, indicating that the region was in a NOx-saturated ozone production regime. The stagnation and increases in ozone in the NFRMA are likely due to a combination of decreasing NOx emissions in a NOx-saturated environment and increased anthropogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions in the NFRMA. Further investigation of the weekend-weekday effect showed that the region outside of the most heavily trafficked Denver area was transitioning to peak ozone production towards NOx-limited chemistry. This transition implies that continued NOx decreases will result in ozone being less sensitive to changes in either anthropogenic or biogenic VOC reactivity in the NFRMA. In contrast to anthropogenic VOCs, biogenic VOCs are unlikely to have increased in the NFRMA between 2000 and 2015, but are temperature dependent and likely vary by drought year. Ozone in the NFRMA has a temperature dependence, albeit smaller than many other US locations, consistent with biogenic VOC contributions to ozone production in the region. We show that while ozone increased with temperature in the NFRMA, which is consistent with a NOx-saturated regime coupled to temperature-dependent VOCs, this relationship is suppressed in drought years. We attribute this drought year suppression to decreased biogenic isoprene emissions due to long-term drought stress. Thus, while anthropogenic NOx and VOCs likely dominate ozone production regimes in the NFRMA, biogenic VOCs may also impact regional ozone and its temperature dependence. © Author(s) 2017.",,"air temperature; atmospheric chemistry; drought; emission control; isoprene; metropolitan area; nitrogen oxides; ozone; summer; volatile organic compound; Colorado; Front Range; Rocky Mountains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019970321

Simulation of anaerobic corrosion conditions was carried out in a laboratory for 28 days. Raw crude oil gathered from the Baram Delta Operation Terminal was cultured in broth number 1249 (Modified Barr's Medium) to study the effect of bacteria growth upon metal loss. Carbon steel coupons grade X70 were cut to approximately 10mm x 20mm x 5mm and immersed in the cultured broth. During the experiment, the planktonic SRB were enumerated using a counting chamber (direct cell count method) under the electronic microscope at 200x magnification. Results indicated that the optimum pH and temperature for the respected SRB consortium genes were 8.5 and 37 °C, respectively. Metal loss of the corrosion specimen was measured and recorded after retrieval from the immersion period in the medium on a weekly basis prior to SRB inoculation for further analysis. The metal loss values supported that SRB activity can increase the metal loss of carbon steel against time of exposure. Additionally, the FESEM image showed the biofilm formations on the corrosion specimen. Thus, the results could conclude that bio-corrosion caused by particular local SRB consortium can be considered as a threat to carbon steel pipelines. Besides, the effect of SRB activity and response towards metallic materials in a dynamic environment is an interesting topic to be studied upon in the future. © Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Malaysia.","Anaerobic corrosion; Bio-corrosion; Microbiologically influenced corrosion; Sulfate-reducing bacteria",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041802565

We modified the traditional ALSO curriculum in our institution by adding hands-on training in laceration repairs and simulation scenarios on acute maternity care. Methods: The modified ALSO provider course was designed to enhance cognitive and procedural skills of health care professionals in managing obstetric emergencies. Forty-nine participants attended this course and completed a posttraining survey. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the participant-reported assessment scores for the ALSO course on three domains (subject knowledge, organization and clarity, and teaching effectiveness) for each of 12 course topics. Results: Evaluation of the results showed a high rate of trainee satisfaction as evidenced by the mean assessment scores across all topics ranging from 4.80 to 4.98 (out of 5.00). All trainees said they would refer others to the course. Our modified ALSO course effectively addressed the important needs of primary care physicians involved in maternity care, especially in underserved communities where specialized obstetric care is not readily available. Both simulation scenarios and workshops using simulated human tissue provide a better foundation before formal training. Conclusion: Given the changing legal and regulatory climate, we expect that learning to treat complex obstetric situations on the job will become increasingly risky. With this in mind, both simulation scenarios and workshops using simulated human tissue will provide a better foundation before formal training. © 2017 Family Medicine and Community Health.","Advanced Life Support in Obstetrics (ALSO); Hands-on laceration repair; Simulated human tissue; Training",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018455515

In addition, they are expected to reduce the high levels of CO2 concentrations in big cities. Previous CO2 fixation studies on green roofs were done by taking long-time-period samples using expensive equipment and with limited replication. To plan green roofs for optimal CO2 reduction, a simple method to quantify CO2 fixation rate in relation to plant species-composition is required. The method we tested is direct measurement of CO2 concentrations with a portable air-quality meter, which allows a large number of samples. Here we focus on differences in the photosynthetic effect between plots containing the local Mediterranean succulent, Sedum sediforme and plots containing various annuals. In a factorial design (presence or absence of Sedum crossed with presence or absence of annuals), we tested the effect of sedum and annual treatments on CO2 concentrations. To compare our results with a commonly used method, and to evaluate the role of the different species, we examined the photosynthetic activity at the single plant level under these treatments by using a portable gas-exchange measuring system. We found that our method can detect the effect of different green roof plots and can be used as a simple and reliable tool for green-roof planers. We found that annuals reduced CO2 concentrations, but only in the absence of Sedum. Sedum alone had no effect on CO2 concentrations. This emphasizes the importance of integrating plots with annual plants in Sedum-based green roofs. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","CO2 concentration; Living roofs; Photosynthesis","air quality; carbon dioxide; carbon fixation; community composition; concentration (composition); ecosystem service; gas exchange; greenspace; heat island; Mediterranean environment; photosynthesis; plant community; roof; urban area; Sedum; Sedum sediforme",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016143607

We show that a region-specific carbon tax that equalizes the tax burden among regions, instead of a homogenous national tax, may compensate these inequalities and reduce total CO2 emissions.

To properly manage this deterioration of the marine environment, it is important to identify the causes of oxygen declines and the influence of anthropogenic activities. Here, we provide a study aiming to explain the declining oxygen levels in the deep waters of the Bothnian Sea over the past 20 years by investigating data from environmental monitoring programmes. The observed decline in oxygen concentrations in deep waters was found to be primarily a consequence of water temperature increase and partly caused by an increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the seawater (R2Adj. = 0.83) as well as inflow from the adjacent sea basin. As none of the tested eutrophication-related predictors were significant according to a stepwise multiple regression, a regional increase in nutrient inputs to the area is unlikely to explain a significant portion of the oxygen decline. Based on the findings of this study, preventing the development of anoxia in the deep water of the Bothnian Sea is dependent on the large-scale measures taken to reduce climate change.

We show that the temperature of an electrolyte solution can influence several reaction parameters in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), including pH (both local and bulk), concentration of dissolved CO2 ([CO2]), solution resistance, the rate of diffusion of reactants to the electrode surface, and adsorbed intermediates. The working potential was −1.60 V vs. Ag/AgCl to allow direct comparison with literature values. Under optimal reaction conditions at 2 °C, the faradaic efficiency (FE) for converting CO2 to methane (CH4) on a Cu electrocatalyst increases to ca. 50% while ethylene (C2H4) decreases to ca. 10%. Above room temperature, the production of hydrogen gas (H2) dominates the electrochemical reaction, reaching &gt;50% FE. The major products (i.e., &gt;5% FE) observed at all temperatures studied were H2, CH4, C2H4, carbon monoxide, and formate, with product selectivity driven by changes in [CO2] rather than changes in pH. Our initial goal was to confirm pH dependence of CO2RR on Cu at different temperatures. Importantly, we discovered that pH varies minimally over the temperature range studied (2 °C to 42 °C), in contrast to changes in [CO2] and corresponding changes in product selectivity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide; Copper; Electrocatalysis; Temperature","Carbon monoxide; Copper; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Electrolytic reduction; Ethylene; Reaction intermediates; Reduction; Temperature; Adsorbed intermediates; Effect of temperature; Electrochemical reactions; Electrochemical reductions; Faradaic efficiencies; Optimal reaction condition; Polycrystalline copper; Production of hydrogen; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996598702

The study aimed to develop relationship between degraded air quality and resident's willingness to pay for improved air quality in city of Lahore, Pakistan through contingent valuation method to quantify an individual's willingness to pay for improved air quality. Hypothetical market was created and 250 respondents, selected through random sampling, were asked to respond to pre tested questionnaire. Results revealed that 92.5% of respondents showed positive willingness to pay and average predicted willingness to pay by each person was $9.86 per month. Respondents were willing to pay $118 per year which was 1.27% of their mean monthly income. Stepwise Regression model was used to develop relationship between independent variables and willingness to pay. Most parameters accompanied by econometric analysis elaborated expected results. Results disclosed that annual household income, symptoms of respiratory diseases and self observed air pollution pointedly impact willingness to pay. It is concluded that despite of the fact that Pakistan is among the lower income countries with no rigid budget allocation for improvement in air quality, people of Pakistan are willing to pay to reduce air pollution load. One of the factor which effected the positivity of willingness to pay is that, a quite large number of people were suffering from pollution related respiratory disorders like asthma, chronic bronchitis, wheezing, cough, and chest congestion. Only 7.5% of respondents were not interested to pay for improved air quality which reported unconcerned attitude and lack of environmental awareness.","Air pollution; Contingent valuation method (CVM); Developing country; Regression model; Respiratory diseases; Willingness to pay (WTP)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043337294

Domestic publics and stakeholders will have an interest in knowing if peer countries are undertaking (or planning to undertake) comparable efforts in mitigating their GHG emissions. Moreover, if the aggregate effort is considered inadequate in addressing the risks posed by climate change, then this will likely prompt a broader interest in identifying those countries where greater effort is arguably warranted based on comparison with their peers. Both assessments require metrics of effort and comparisons among countries. We propose a framework for such an exercise, drawing from a set of principles for designing and implementing informative metrics. We present a template for organizing metrics on mitigation effort, for both ex ante and ex post review. We also provide preliminary assessments of effort along emissions, price, and cost metrics for post-2020 climate policy contributions by China, the European Union, Russia, and the United States. We close with a discussion of the role of academics and civil society in promoting transparency and facilitating the evaluation and comparison of effort.

We provide an illustration of this framework with an energy-economic model.

The first quarter of 2017 in Indonesia saw resilient GDP growth, moderate inflation, stable exchange rates, an increase in the growth of non-oil exports, and an investment upgrade from ratings agency Standard & Poor's. Investment growth, however, did not pick up enough to drive overall growth to a higher rate. The poor quality of banking-sector assets and the gaps in tax revenue—despite the fulfilment of the government's tax-amnesty program—are two of the most immediate economic concerns. President Joko Widodo (Jokowi), who is well into the second half of his term, is under pressure to deliver on his development platform, which includes making progress in sustainable development and climate change mitigation. The effective management of forests is key to this platform. There has been longstanding tension over Indonesia's forests between the protection of environmental values, including carbon storage, and the production of valuable commodities, including timber, palm oil, and pulpwood, which generate revenue and employment. We survey recent developments in four storylines related to forestry and climate change: first, Indonesia's commitment to reducing emissions to 29%–41% below projected business-as-usual levels by 2030, as well as the international climate agreements and finance that can help achieve this commitment; second, land-use rights and regulations, including a moratorium on clearing, draining, or setting fires on peatland; third, measures to prevent catastrophic forest fires like those during the 2015 El Niño, including the establishment of the Peatland Restoration Agency; and, fourth, the actions of non-state actors, especially large agribusinesses, in managing forests and peatland. We conclude by discussing differences in the approaches of Jokowi's administration and those of former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's administration and by questioning whether Indonesia's budgeted resources, actions, and results to date are commensurate with its climate commitments. © 2017 ANU Indonesia Project.","climate change; credit growth; forest fires; investment upgrade; land rights; oil palm; peatland; tax revenue","banking; climate change; credit provision; forest fire; forestry; investment; land rights; peatland; tax system; Indonesia; Elaeis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033229808

However, the use of these materials, characterized by a high strength to weight ratio, stiffness and high work hardening at early stages of plastic deformation, have imposed many challenges in sheet metal industry, mainly their low formability and different behaviour, when compared to traditional steels, which may represent a defying task, both to obtain a successful component and also when using numerical simulation to predict material behaviour and its fracture limits. Although numerical prediction of critical strains in sheet metal forming processes is still very often based on the classic forming limit diagrams, alternative approaches can use damage models, which are based on stress states to predict failure during the forming process and they can be classified as empirical, physics based and phenomenological models. In the present paper a comparative analysis of different ductile damage models is carried out, in order numerically evaluate two isotropic coupled damage models proposed by Johnson-Cook and Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman (GTN), each of them corresponding to the first two previous group classification.

Continental conditions during the latest Miocene are of particular interest because global faunal turnover is roughly synchronous with a period of global glaciation from 6.2-5.5 Ma and with the Messinian Salinity Crisis from 6.0-5.3 Ma. Despite the climatic and ecological significance of this period, the continental climatic conditions associated with it remain unclear. We address this question using erosion rates of ancient watersheds to constrain Mio-Pliocene climatic conditions in the south-central Andes near 30° S. Our results show two slowdowns in erosion rate, one from 6.1-5.2 Ma and another from 3.6 to 3.3 Ma, which we attribute to periods of continental aridity. This view is supported by synchrony with other regional proxies for aridity and with the timing of glacial ""cold"" periods as recorded by marine proxies, such as the M2 isotope excursion. We thus conclude that aridity in the south-central Andes is associated with cold periods at high southern latitudes, perhaps due to a northward migration of the Southern Hemisphere westerlies, which disrupted the South American Low Level Jet that delivers moisture to southeastern South America. Colder glacial periods, and possibly associated reductions in atmospheric CO2, thus seem to be an important driver of Mio-Pliocene ecological transitions in the central Andes. Finally, this study demonstrates that paleo-erosion rates can be a powerful proxy for ancient continental climates that lie beyond the reach of most lacustrine and glacial archives.","M2; Messinian; Miocene; Pliocene; Precipitation","carbon; water; Article; cold; environmental erosion; glacial period; latitude; mass extinction; Miocene; Pliocene; precipitation; priority journal; salinity; sea surface temperature; South America; Southern Hemisphere; vegetation; watershed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021121894

This research provides a computational framework for this decision-making process. Charging and discharging strategies of EV aggregators are incorporated into a security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) problem such that overall energy cost is minimized and operation within acceptable reliability criteria is ensured. Particularly, this SCOPF problem has been formulated for Jeju Island in South Korea, in order to lower carbon emissions toward a zero-carbon island by, for example, integrating large-scale renewable energy and EVs. On top of conventional constraints on the generators and line flows, a unique constraint on the system inertia constant, interpreted as the minimum synchronous generation, is considered to ensure grid security at high renewable penetration. The available energy constraint of the participating EV associated with the state-of-charge (SOC) of the battery and market price-responsive behavior of the EV aggregators are also explored. Case studies for the Jeju electric power system in 2030 under various operational scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and improved operational flexibility via controllable EVs. © 2017 by the authors.","Electric vehicle (EV); Grid-to-vehicle (G2V); High renewable penetration; Optimal power flow (OPF); Vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Acoustic generators; Battery management systems; Carbon; Charging (batteries); Cost effectiveness; Costs; Decision making; Electric automobiles; Electric load flow; Electric machine control; Electric power system control; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Vehicle-to-grid; Decision making process; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Grid to vehicle (G2V); High renewable penetration; Operational efficiencies; Optimal power flows; Security-constrained optimal power flow; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Electric power system security",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044307969

Climatic changes resulting in fewer or more CFTs have important implications for agriculture. Examining CFT trends can provide information that will assist plant breeders and agricultural producers to develop new adaptation strategies for crop and livestock selection, and thereby safeguard the general food supply. Six CFTs temperatures [maximum temperatures (Tmax) ≥ 30 °C, 32 °C, 34 °C, 35 °C, 39 °C and 40 °C] were considered in this study. The variability frequency and intensity of CFTs were analyzed over both short-term (four time-periods; initiation of recordkeeping up to 1920, 1921–1950, 1951–1980, and 1981–2009) and long-term (100-year) time-periods, using data from 23 weather stations spread across Kansas, USA. Results indicated that ∼75% of long-term trend values across all CFTs and locations decreased, one remained the same (less than 1%), and ∼25% had positive trend values. About 91% of long-term trend values fell between 1 and −1 day/decade. Overall, the range in the number CFT days was greatest at 30 °C and steadily decreased as CFT increased, with a 10-fold decrease in the range of the number of CFT days at 40 °C CFT. However, 53% of all 30-year trend lines with absolute slope values of &gt;6 days/decade occurred during the 1981–2009 time-period. The greatest changes in slope were also recorded during this time-period, with 9 slopes greater than 10 days/decade. Thus, the greatest changes in number of CFT days, along with the greatest number of sites experiencing decreases in CFT days occurred during the most recent time-period. Eastern Kansas had the most and largest decreases in CFT days across all CFTs. © 2016","Climate; Climate change impacts on plants; Cropping systems; Drought; Extreme temperature change; Heat; High plains aquifer; Historic temperatures; Ogallala aquifer; Plant ceiling threshold temperature; Trend","Agriculture; Aquifers; Crops; Drought; Food supply; Heating; Climate; Climate change impact; Cropping systems; Extreme temperatures; Ogallala aquifers; Threshold temperatures; Trend; Climate change; adaptive management; agricultural ecosystem; climate change; crop; environmental indicator; food supply; livestock; temperature; threshold; weather station; Kansas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009957976

Here we use a multiproxy network of tree-ring chronologies to reconstruct spatially resolved warm season (May–August) mean temperatures across the extratropical Northern Hemisphere (40-90°N) using Point-by-Point Regression (PPR). The resulting annual maps of temperature anomalies (750–1988 CE) reveal a consistent imprint of volcanism, with 96% of reconstructed grid points experiencing colder conditions following eruptions. Solar influences are detected at the bicentennial (de Vries) frequency, although at other time scales the influence of insolation variability is weak. Approximately 90% of reconstructed grid points show warmer temperatures during the Medieval Climate Anomaly when compared to the Little Ice Age, although the magnitude varies spatially across the hemisphere.

The bulk of the literature explains sub- and non-state actors' participation in transnational initiatives as a product of, on the one hand, micro-level incentives and, on the other, diffusion processes that create and spread normative and market-based pressures. We argue that such theoretical perspectives overlook the dynamic relationship between national policies and transnational governance. First, we argue that ambitious national policies positively affect sub- and non-state actors' participation in transnational governance. Second, we posit that domestic institutions condition the effects of micro-level incentives and transnational pressures on participation in transnational governance. We test these claims in the climate regime, using an original dataset that, for the first time, measures cross-national participation in transnational climate initiatives across jurisdictions. The results support our expectations. They therefore suggest that we should understand national policies and transnational governance as complements, rather than competitors, to one another. Finally, by showing how and when national policies affect participation in transnational initiatives, we identify important scope conditions for their significance in addressing climate change. © The Author (2017).

The one electron reduction of [CoII(Rsalophen)] with alkali metals (M = Li, Na, K) leads to either ligand-centered or metal-centered reduction depending on the alkali ion. It affords either the [CoI(Rsalophen)K] complexes or the [CoII2(bis-salophen)M2] (M = Li, Na) dimers that are present in solution in equilibrium with the respective [CoI(salophen)M] complexes. The two electron reduction of [CoII(OMesalophen)] results in both ligand centered and metal centered reduction affording the Co(I)-Co(II)-Co(I) [Co3(tris-OMesalophen)Na6(THF)6], 6 complex supported by a bridging deca-anionic tris-OMesalophen10- ligand where three OMesalophen units are connected by two C-C bonds. Removal of the Na ion from 6 leads to a redistribution of the electrons affording the complex [(Co(OMesalophen))2Na][Na(cryptand)]3, 7.

On-road diesel vehicles produce approximately 20 per cent of global anthropogenic emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO x), which are key PM 2.5 and ozone precursors. Regulated NO x emission limits in leading markets have been progressively tightened, but current diesel vehicles emit far more NO x under real-world operating conditions than during laboratory certification testing. Here we show that across 11 markets, representing approximately 80 per cent of global diesel vehicle sales, nearly one-third of on-road heavy-duty diesel vehicle emissions and over half of on-road light-duty diesel vehicle emissions are in excess of certification limits. These excess emissions (totalling 4.6 million tons) are associated with about 38,000 PM 2.5 - and ozone-related premature deaths globally in 2015, including about 10 per cent of all ozone-related premature deaths in the 28 European Union member states. Heavy-duty vehicles are the dominant contributor to excess diesel NO x emissions and associated health impacts in almost all regions. Adopting and enforcing next-generation standards (more stringent than Euro 6/VI) could nearly eliminate real-world diesel-related NO x emissions in these markets, avoiding approximately 174,000 global PM 2.5 - and ozone-related premature deaths in 2040. Most of these benefits can be achieved by implementing Euro VI standards where they have not yet been adopted for heavy-duty vehicles. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Seedlings containing four to six leaves were sprayed with a sporangia suspension containing 105 sporangia per milliliter. After spraying, the seedlings were subjected to temperatures of 26, 28, 29.1, 30.4, and 31.8°C for 24 hours. The percentage of diseased leaf area and the latent period were evaluated. Maps of the geographic and temporal distribution of the disease were made considering the monthly average of the mean air temperature and leaf wetness duration for the reference climate or climate normal (1961-1990) and the future climates (2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100), considering the A2 and B1 gas emission scenarios, designed by the Intergovernamental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Favorability ranges were set and used in logic functions of the geografical information system (GIS) to generate monthly maps for grapevine downy mildew. Rising temperatures interfered with the grapevine downy mildew infections, reduced the disease severity, and increased the latent period. Future climate scenarios indicate a reduction of favorability of downy mildew in Brazil, with variability in the different grape producing regions.","Air temperature; Geographical information system; Plasmopara viticola; Vitis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025150917

In the context of these combined changes, understanding the interactions between global and local forcing has become a major challenge for developing sustainable fisheries. We analyzed commercial landing statistics of Lake Geneva to describe the long-term changes in the abundance of exploited fish species and to identify mechanisms responsible for fish population changes. We showed a significant relationship between the decrease in phosphorus concentrations and structural changes in the composition of the fish community. Local management of reducing phosphorus loadings played a major role in the recovery of whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) spawning areas and slowed the process toward more climate-induced percid and cyprinid communities.

Fresh organic material is considered reactive because it contains carbons that is subject to decompose, therefore, when it exposed to acid sulphate soil, both in natural condition (aeration required) and intensive (aeration not required) will lower the value of redox potential. This experiment aimed to determine the flux of methane (CH4) from various locally available organic materials applied to acid sulphate soil. The experiment was arranged in factorial design with two factors. The first factor was the source of organic matter, i.e. fresh rice straw, fresh purun, fresh cattle manure, composted rice straw, composted purun and composted cattle manure, and control. The second factor was the management of organic matter i.e. placed on the soil surface with no tillage and mixed with soil during tillage. The results showed that application of fresh organic matter into inundated acid sulphate soil increased CH4 fluxes up to 23.78 μg CH4 g1 d1 which was higher than from composted organic matter (4.327 μg CH4.g1.d1). Methane flux due to organic matter management was significantly negatively (p=0.001) correlated with soil redox potential (Eh) with R2 of - 0.76. Organic matter placed on the soil surface with no tillage produced methane flux ranged from 0.33 to 20.78 g CH4 g1 d1, which was lower than methane flux produced from organic matter mixed with soil during tillage (0.38 to 27.27 g CH4 g1 d1). Composting organic matter before application and mixing them with the soil through tillage are highly recommended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cultivated acid sulphate soils. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agricultural machinery; Agriculture; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Manures; Methane; Organic compounds; Redox reactions; Sulfur compounds; Acid sulphate soils; Factorial design; Laboratory studies; Methane fluxes; Natural conditions; Organic materials; Redox potentials; Soil redox potential; Soils",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023186629

Urban air pollution concentrations vary sharply over short distances (≪1 km) owing to unevenly distributed emission sources, dilution, and physicochemical transformations. Accordingly, even where present, conventional fixed-site pollution monitoring methods lack the spatial resolution needed to characterize heterogeneous human exposures and localized pollution hotspots. Here, we demonstrate a measurement approach to reveal urban air pollution patterns at 4-5 orders of magnitude greater spatial precision than possible with current central-site ambient monitoring. We equipped Google Street View vehicles with a fast-response pollution measurement platform and repeatedly sampled every street in a 30-km2 area of Oakland, CA, developing the largest urban air quality data set of its type. Resulting maps of annual daytime NO, NO2, and black carbon at 30 m-scale reveal stable, persistent pollution patterns with surprisingly sharp small-scale variability attributable to local sources, up to 5-8× within individual city blocks. Since local variation in air quality profoundly impacts public health and environmental equity, our results have important implications for how air pollution is measured and managed. If validated elsewhere, this readily scalable measurement approach could address major air quality data gaps worldwide.

Prior research on Corn Belt farmers' perspectives on climate change employed a latent class analysis (LCA) that created a six-class typology - the Concerned, Uneasy, Uncertain, Unconcerned, Confident, and Detached - to develop a better understanding of farmer perspectives on climate change and inform more effective climate adaptation and mitigation outreach strategies. The LCA employed 34 variables that are generally unobserv-able - beliefs about climate change, experience with extreme weather, perceived risks of climate change, and attitudes toward climate action - to identify types. The research reported in this paper builds on this typology of Corn Belt farmers by exploring 33 measures of observable farm enterprise characteristics, land management practices, and farmer demographics to assess whether variations in these observable characteristics between the six farmer classes display systematic patterns that might be sufficiently distinctive to guide audience segmentation strategies. While analyses detected some statistically significant differences, there were few systematic, meaningful observable patterns of difference between groups of farmers with differing perspectives on climate change. In other words, farmers who believe that anthropogenic climate change is occurring, that it poses risks to agriculture, and that adaptive action should be taken, may look very much like farmers who deny the existence of climate change and do not support action. The overall implication of this finding is that climate change engagement efforts by Extension and other agricultural advisors should use caution when looking to observable characteristics to facilitate audience segmentation. Additional analyses indicated that the farmer types that tended to be more concerned about climate change and supportive of adaptive action (e.g., Concerned and Uneasy) reported that they were more influenced by key private and public sector actors in agricultural social networks. On the other hand, farmers who were not concerned about climate change or supportive of adaptation (e.g., the Unconcerned, Confident, and Detached groups, comprising between one-third and one-half of respondents) were less integrated into agricultural networks. This suggests that Extension and other agricultural advisors should expand outreach efforts to farmers who are not already within their spheres of influence.","Adaptation; Audience segmentation; Climate change; Farmer typology; Social networks","action plan; adaptive management; agricultural extension; climate change; farmers attitude; farmers knowledge; land management; natural resource; public sector; resource management; risk perception; segmentation; social network; typology; Corn Belt; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019868565

While lifespan and seed size modify the importance of germination timing, germination traits such as base temperature and base water potential directly translate climatic conditions into germination timing, impacting performance in later life stages. Yet we do not know how base temperature, base water potential, seed mass, lifespan and climate are related. We tested the relationships between base temperature and base water potential for germination, seed size and lifespan while controlling for bioclimatic regions. We also quantified the phylogenetic signal in germination traits and seed size using Pagel's λ. We used a worldwide data set of germination responses to temperature and moisture, seed size and lifespan of 240 seed plants from 49 families. Both germination temperature and moisture are negatively related to seed size. Annual plants show a negative relation between seed size and base water potential, whereas perennials display a negative relation between base temperature and seed mass. Pagel's λ highlighted the slow evolution of base temperature for germination, comparable to seed mass while base water potential was revealed to be labile. In the future, base water potential and seed mass can be used when moisture niches of plants are to be predicted. Lifespan, seed size and base temperature should be taken into account when analysing thermal limits of species distributions.

Lithofacies (composition and texture) and environmental conditions (mainly climate) influence the mechanical properties of rock masses as shown by the investigation presented here. To evaluate these effects, a range of carbonate rocks from Al-Ain arid region in the United Arab Emirates were used for extensive in situ and laboratory SH tests. The results expose a wide range of Schmidt hardness rebound (SHRcor) values for both the in situ and the laboratory tests, but show comparable correlation coefficients between the in situ and laboratory natural surface data. This indicates that field SH measurements can be a simple and reliable tool to obtain data on rock mechanical properties; however, caution should be taken in generalization even in a small locality or a region.

Discovered by Dame and Thaddeus, the OSC lies ∼15 kpc from the Galactic Center. Due to the Galactic warp, it rises to nearly 4° above the Galactic Plane in the first Galactic quadrant, leaving it unsampled by most Galactic plane surveys. Here we observe H ii region candidates spatially coincident with the OSC using the Very Large Array to image radio continuum emission from 65 targets and the Green Bank Telescope to search for ammonia and water maser emission from 75 targets. This sample, drawn from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer Catalog of Galactic H ii Regions, represents every H ii region candidate near the longitude-latitude locus of the OSC. Coupled with their characteristic mid-infrared morphologies, detection of radio continuum emission strongly suggests that a target is a bona fide H ii region. Detections of associated ammonia or water maser emission allow us to derive a kinematic distance and determine if the velocity of the region is consistent with that of the OSC. Nearly 60% of the observed sources were detected in radio continuum, and more than 20% have ammonia or water maser detections. The velocities of these sources mainly place them beyond the Solar orbit. These very distant high-mass stars have stellar spectral types as early as O4. We associate high-mass star formation at 2 new locations with the OSC, increasing the total number of detected H ii regions in the OSC to 12. © 2017. The American Astronomical Society.

One of the main challenges is the necessary cooperation among different entities such as vehicles or infrastructure systems and how to exploit the information available through networks of sensors deployed as infrastructures for smart cities. In this work an algorithm for cooperative control of urban subsystems is proposed to provide a solution for mobility problems in cities. The interconnected traffic lights controller (TLC) network adapts traffic lights cycles, based on traffic and air pollution sensory information, in order to improve the performance of urban traffic networks. The presence of air pollution in cities is not only caused by road traffic but there are other pollution sources that contribute to increase or decrease the pollution level. Due to the distributed and heterogeneous nature of the different components involved, a system of systems engineering approach is applied to design a consensus-based control algorithm. The designed control strategy contains a consensus-based component that uses the information shared in the network for reaching a consensus in the state of TLC network components. Discrete event systems specification is applied for modelling and simulation. The proposed solution is assessed by simulation studies with very promising results to deal with simultaneous responses to both pollution levels and traffic flows in urban traffic networks. © 2017 by the authors.

The problem of choosing the extent, specific system components, and timing of these investments over a long time horizon (e.g., 40–60 years) is modeled as a multi-stage, stochastic, bi-level, mixed-integer program wherein cost-effective investment decisions are taken in the upper level. The effects of possible episodic precipitation events on experienced travel delays are estimated from solution of a lower-level, traffic equilibrium problem. The episodic events and longer-term sea level changes exist on different time scales, making their integration a crucial element in model development. The optimal investment strategy is obtained at a Stackelberg equilibrium that is reached upon solution to the bilevel program. A recursive noisy genetic algorithm (rNGA), designed to address large-scale applications, is proposed for this purpose. The rNGA seeks the optimal combination of investment decisions to take now given only probabilistic information on the predicted sea level rise trend for a long planning horizon and associated likely extreme climatic events (in terms of their frequencies and intensities) that might arise over that planning period. The proposed solution method enables the evaluation of decisions concerning where, when and to what level to make infrastructure investments. The proposed rNGA has broad applicability to more general multi-stage, stochastic, bilevel, nonconvex, mixed integer programs that arise in many applications. The proposed solution methodology is demonstrated on an example representing a portion of the Washington, D.C.

However, the factors introducing variation into niche modeling outcomes are not well understood: To this end, we used seven algorithms to develop models (Maxent, GARP, BIOCLIM, artificial neural networks, support-vector machines, climate envelope, and environmental distance) to estimate the potential geographic distribution of olives (Olea europaea sensu lato, including Olea ferruginea) under two climatic data sets (current 2000 and future 2050). Five general circulation models and two representative concentration pathway scenarios were used as predictor variables in future projections of the geographic potential of this species; models were fit at global extents (10′ spatial resolution) but transferred and interpreted for a region of particular interest in Central Asia, which largely avoids problems with truncation of niche estimates. We found marked differences among approaches in predicted distributions and model performance, as well as in the future distributional pattern reconstructed, from one algorithm to another. These general approaches, when model-to-model variation is managed appropriately, appear promising in predicting the potential geographic distribution of O. europaea sensu lato and thus can be an effective tool in restoration and conservation planning for wild populations, as well as possible commercial plantations of this species. © 2017 Ashraf et al.","Climate change; Ecological niche model; Invasive species; Partial receiver-operating characteristic (ROC); Species distribution model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019846897

Impacts of local GHG reduction measures were investigated in the EU FP7 funded project Urban Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in China and Europe (URGENCHE). Kuopio in Finland was one of the case study cities. The assessed reduction measures were (1) increased use of biomass in local heat and power cogeneration plant, (2) energy efficiency improvements of residences, (3) increased biofuel use in traffic, and (4) increased small scale combustion of wood for residential heating. Impact assessment compared the 2010 baseline with a 2020 BAU (business as usual) scenario and a 2020 CO2 interventions scenario. Changes in emissions were assessed for CO2, particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), NOx, and SO2, and respective impacts were assessed for PM2.5 ambient concentrations and health effects. The assessed measures would reduce the local CO2 emissions in the Kuopio urban area by over 50% and local emissions of PM2.5 would clearly decrease. However, the annual average ambient PM2.5 concentration would decrease by just 4%. Thus, only marginal population level health benefits would be achieved with these assumed local CO2 abatement actions. © 2017 by the authors.","Air pollution; Climate change mitigation; CO2 emissions; Local health effects",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027336544

It was found that widths, antero-posterior lengths and volumes of frontal sinus were higher in populations living in colder climate and higher altitude according to populations living in milder climate and lower altitude. Heights of frontal sinuses were on the contrary of this. These results were found appropriate to increasing of cephalic index in cold climate according to Allen’s Rule.

We analyzed smallholder farmers' climate change adaptation strategy choices with multinomial logit regression. Factors that influence the choice of climate adaptation options include age of the household head, gender of the household head, household size, land ownership, credit access, climate change training, and extension visit. Policy thrust should focus on linking farmers to credit institutions, advocating for labor-saving farm technologies, and intensification of climate change training among smallholder farmers. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Can spatial variation in the effects of cattle grazing exclusion be explained by variation in soil texture?. Location: Shortgrass steppe, northeast Colorado, USA, in the North American Great Plains. Method: We used 16 long-term (72 yr) cattle exclosures to examine the effects of grazers on plant communities and evaluate whether grazer effects interact with soil texture. Results: Although shortgrass steppe communities are relatively unaffected by grazing in the short-term (one to two decades), exclusion of cattle grazing for seven decades caused a compositional shift from dominance by a C4 shortgrass (Bouteloua gracilis) to co-dominance by a C3 midgrass (Pascopyrum smithii) and B. gracilis. The strength of this shift was highly variable across sites. Soil texture was correlated with the abundance of certain plant species, but did not explain variation in the magnitude of grazer effects. Grazed communities contained perennial and annual growth forms with a diversity of strategies to co-exist with grazers and B. gracilis. Ungrazed communities included increased abundance of annual, ruderal forbs and three woody plant species. Grazing effects occurred against a backdrop of changing plant communities: during the past seven decades, C3 perennial graminoids and sub-shrubs have increased in relative abundance in both grazed and ungrazed communities. Conclusions: Our long-term experiment shows that community responses to grazing in this semi-arid grassland occur very slowly, but are predictable, with C4 shortgrasses eventually giving way to taller C3 grasses and ruderal forbs. Spatial variation in grazing effects across sites (and lack of a relationship with soil texture) may reflect the importance of fine-scale heterogeneity in C3 grass abundance, and the slow rate at which taller C3 grasses can coalesce into mono-dominant patches that outcompete C4 shortgrasses. Increased abundance of C3 species over the past seven decades, both in the presence and absence of grazing, may be related to recovery from the severe drought and dust storms of the 1930s as well as enhanced growth of C3 plants under increasing atmospheric [CO2]. © 2017 International Association for Vegetation Science","C3 vs C4 grasses; Climate change; Great Plains; Herbivory; Inverse texture hypothesis; Livestock; Shortgrass steppe","abundance; C3 plant; climate change; coexistence; community composition; dominance; enemy release hypothesis; grass; grazing; hypothesis testing; plant community; plant-herbivore interaction; semiarid region; soil texture; spatial variation; steppe; Colorado; Great Plains; United States; Bos; Bouteloua gracilis; Pascopyrum smithii; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011649670

To this aim, the control problem for a given engine is formulated in the form of the standard Bolza problem, and then, the concepts of Euler–Lagrange equation and Hamiltonian function are taken into account to calculate the optimal states, co-states, and control input signals. An extreme learning machine is also linked to an experimentally validated nonlinear state-space representation of the engine during the coldstart to approximate the values of exhaust gas temperature and engine-out hydrocarbon emissions, which are two key variables for the considered control problem. To solve the resulting system of equations, a cellular variant of the particle swarm optimization technique is implemented and the existing nonlinear system of equations is solved heuristically. In addition, some constraints are exerted on the control signals to guarantee the smooth operation of the engine by applying the calculated controlling commands. Finally, the authenticity of the resulting optimal controller is validated against a classical Pontryagin’s minimum principle-based control system.

PMCA schemes influence the travel decision process of users and accordingly impact the system metrics including travel time and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We develop a multi-user class dynamic user equilibrium model to evaluate the transportation system performance when PMCA scheme is implemented. The results using Sioux-Falls test network indicate that PMCA schemes can achieve the emissions reduction goals for transportation networks. Further, users characterized by high value of travel time are found to be less sensitive to carbon budget in the context of work trips.

Agroforestry systems are common features in Canada's agricultural landscape; however, there are limited empirical data to support implementation of agroforestry practices for GHG mitigation. This shortfall of data may be a contributing factor to the lack of policy that supports the use of agroforestry for GHG mitigation in the Canadian agricultural landscape. We reviewed published studies that compared C stocks in vegetation and soils, and/or GHG emissions in agroforestry systems to traditional agriculture across Canada, with the aims of assessing the benefit of adopting agroforestry for GHG reduction. We then identified data gaps and obstacles that could direct future research. We found that most studies reported increases in vegetation and soil organic C storage in areas with woody species compared to herbaceous crops. Agroforestry systems also reduced the emission of CH4 and N2O, and increased CO2 respiration from soil, but few studies have examined these gases. The small set of studies we reviewed demonstrated the potential of agroforestry to store terrestrial C and mitigate GHG emissions. However, additional research is required to verify this pattern across geographic regions, determine the regional potential for development of agroforestry systems, and assess the potential atmospheric GHG reduction at regional and national scales. © 2017 Published by NRC Research Press.","Carbon flux; Methane; Mitigation; Nitrous oxide; Soil carbon","Digital storage; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Vegetation; Agricultural landscapes; Atmospheric greenhouse; Carbon fluxes; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Mitigation; Nitrous oxide; Pair-wise comparison; Soil carbon; Forestry; agroforestry; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; emission control; future prospect; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrous oxide; respiration; soil carbon; traditional agriculture; Agriculture; Canada; Greenhouse Gases; Land Use; Nitrous Oxide; Plants; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024890425

The planning, management, decision-making of energy conservation and emission reduction of transportation and other aspects should be supported by the analysis and forecasting of large amounts of data. Now, with the development of information technology, such as intelligent city, sensor road and so on, information collection technology in the direction of the Internet of things gradually become popular. The 3G/4G network transmission technology develop rapidly, and a large number of energy conservation and emission reduction of transportation data is growing into a series with different ways.

Design of reserved lanes on existing network is called lane reservation problem. This paper examines the lane reservation problem from a new perspective of carbon emission in real urban transportation network, which incorporates the environmental impact and the traffic state of a city into design of reserved lanes. A carbon emission index is constructed to measure the impact of the reservation strategy. An integer linear programming model is used to improve the efficiency of special transports with the objective of minimizing the carbon emission index. Real urban traffic state is considered when the lane reservation strategy is implemented. The gird approximation method is developed to estimate the traffic state of a city using 30-day trajectory data of 14,000 vehicles in Shenzhen, China. Extensive computational analyses have been presented by several experiments based on real traffic data. The results indicate that lane reservation strategy can bring not only efficient transportation on reserved lanes, but also air pollution. The growth trend of the increased emissions becomes smooth after a sharp rise during the onset of the introduction of the reserved lane. With same improvement, fewer reserved lanes are required, but more emissions are produced under congested traffic than smooth traffic. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Integer programming; Lane reservation problem; Traffic state estimation; Trajectory data","Carbon; Integer programming; Traffic control; Urban transportation; Carbon emissions; Computational analysis; Control and management; Integer linear programming models; Lane reservation problem; Traffic state estimation; Trajectory data; Urban transportation networks; Environmental impact; carbon emission; environmental impact; implementation process; linear programing; traffic congestion; traffic emission; traffic management; urban transport; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018651510

Several studies have investigated the use of roadside features in reducing near-road air pollution concentrations since this method is often one of the few short-term options available. Since roadside vegetation has other potential benefits, the impact of this feature has been of particular interest. The literature has been mixed on whether roadside vegetation reduces nearby pollutant concentrations or whether this feature has no effect or even potentially increases downwind air pollutant concentrations. However, these differences in study results highlight key characteristics of the vegetative barrier that can result in pollutant reductions or increase local pollutant levels. This paper describes the characteristics of roadside vegetation that previous research shows can result in improved local air quality, as well as identify characteristics that should be avoided in order to protect from unintended increases in nearby concentrations. These design conditions include height, thickness, coverage, porosity/density, and species characteristics that promote improved air quality. These design considerations can inform highway departments, urban and transportation planners, and developers in understanding how best to preserve existing roadside vegetation or plant vegetative barriers in order to reduce air pollution impacts near transportation facilities. These designs can also be used to mitigate impacts from other air pollution sources where emissions occur near ground-level. © 2017","Air pollution; Highway landscape design; Particulate matter; Traffic; Vegetation","Air pollution; Air quality; Highway engineering; Highway planning; Plants (botany); Pollution; Pollution control; Roads and streets; Telecommunication traffic; Transportation; Urban transportation; Vegetation; Air pollutant concentrations; Highway landscapes; Particulate Matter; Pollutant concentration; Pollution concentration; Traffic-related air pollution; Transportation facilities; Transportation planners; Roadsides; air quality; atmospheric pollution; landscape; particulate matter; roadside environment; traffic emission; urban design; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016001818

A network topology of nodes and edges, providing accurate geographic representation of the district, is generated using a geographic information system and acts as a constraint. A case study is conducted for a district in Hirosaki city, located in the northernmost prefecture of mainland Japan. The results demonstrate the considerable economic benefits of integrating locally available woodchips in heat-only boilers instead of using city gas due to lower fuel costs. Low temperature operation reduces the fuel costs due to less network heat loss compared to medium temperature operation, but it is overcome by the cost of the larger pipe size and the pumping power. Implementation of the district heating system to the case area encourages sustainable development through economic favorability, decreased primary energy consumption, and considerable CO2 emissions reduction, compared to the current heat supply structure. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Cogeneration; District heating system; Geographical information system; Mixed integer optimization; Structural design","Costs; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Energy utilization; Geographic information systems; Heating; Heating equipment; Information systems; Integer programming; Investments; Low temperature operations; Structural design; Structural optimization; Temperature; Cogeneration; District heating system; Geographic information; Mixed integer linear programming model; Mixed integer optimization; Network structures; Optimal distributions; Primary energy consumption; District heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017505177

This problem is alleviated by randomizing the moments of emission and applying the Monte Carlo method to obtain the realistic expected yearly maxima of hourly concentrations/risks. Emissions are modeled as irregular “pulses,” possibly with additional constraints on timing. Such are major emission sources in important industries: oil refineries, gas extraction, cement production, etc. We have tested the approach in ~100 projects for industrial plants in Russia and obtained considerable reductions in estimated acute health risks: up to two orders of magnitude, depending on the level of intermittency of sources. These corrections to unrealistically high worst-case concentration values at nearby populated areas are, in many cases, a key to obtaining reasonable exclusion/protection zones for plants. To our knowledge, such a body of results on intermittent irregular sources is unique, and it can be useful especially for developing countries where the exact timeline of emissions is often unknown. Taking intermittency into account is also known to be an important step toward compliance with 1-h US National Ambient Air Quality Standard. We provide a detailed description of the Monte Carlo algorithm used. We compare Monte Carlo with the usual quantile-based approach to peak values; they agree when quantile is dependent on intermittency. The non-linearity of maximum function gives rise to some counterintuitive phenomena, which call for refinement of risk definition for intermittent irregular sources. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Acute risk; AERMOD; Air pollution; Environmental health; Intermittent sources; Irregular sources; Monte Carlo","atmospheric pollution; compliance; concentration (composition); developing world; health risk; industrial emission; Monte Carlo analysis; nonlinearity; pollutant source; risk assessment; Russian Federation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983801482

One of the good approaches to understanding temperature variations is to use statistical information across time and space. Spatial statistical techniques are one of the practical approaches for gaining a deep and scientific understanding of the behavior of the spatial variables. The present study was an attempt to model the spatial structure of Iran’s annual temperature. For this purpose, the data gathered from 320 weather stations in Iran including synoptic and climatologic stations from their establishment time to the 2014. In line with this goal, OLS, spatial lag and spatial error models were used to determine the temperature structure and predict its spatial variation based on geographic features (elevation, slope, and aspect). The results showed that the maximum and minimum percentage distribution of Iran’s annual temperature respectively lie in the range of 90% and above in the South, Southwest, and Southeast and in the range of 50% in the Northwest and West of Iran. Moran’s I value for annual temperature was found to be 99%, which is indicative of a positive spatial autocorrelation. Scatter plot and the local Moran’s I map showed that the highest pixel values (temperature points) and their neighbors lie at the subgroups with high–high and low–low values. In other words, Iran’s annual temperature follows a cluster pattern with a high–high temperature value and a cluster pattern with low–low temperature value. Finally, spatial regression modeling on Iran’s annual temperature showed that variables such as latitude and longitude, elevation, slope and aspect show positive and negative correlations with annual temperature at different significance levels in all three methods, i.e., OLS, spatial lag and spatial error. In the OLS method, longitude and in the spatial lag method, latitude were found to have a positive and direct correlation with annual temperature. However, the results from spatial regressions showed that the spatial error is a better model for predicting Iran’s annual temperature. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Iran; Moran’s I; Ordinary least square (OLS); Spatial error; Spatial lag; Temperature","air temperature; climatology; error analysis; least squares method; modeling; spatial analysis; spatial variation; synoptic meteorology; temporal variation; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068601569

One of them is the rise of oil prices. Due to several reasons-large increases in demand from China and India, political instability in several oil producers and various other factors, oil prices have risen almost continuously from early 2002 to 2008. Biomass as a fuel for energy requirements is a better choice as it is renewable and is also low on GHG emissions. Biofuels primarily include bio-ethanol and biodiesel. With advanced technology being developed, cellulosic biomass such as trees is also used as fuel stock for ethanol production. The UN International Biofuel Forum formed by Brazil, China, India, South Africa, United States and European Union, which derive biofuel mainly from agricultural feedstock e. g. corn, wheat etc. but there are various current issues with biofuels production from agricultural feedstock which are presently being discussed in the popular media and scientific journals. These include the food v/s fuel debate, carbon emission levels, sustainable biofuel production, deforestation and soil erosion, and impact on water resources, human right issues, biofuel prices, energy balance and efficiency. On the other hand, biofuels from forest biomass (cellulosic ethanol) have the advantage of reducing GHG emissions by 85% over reformulated gasoline. Among the various forest species desirable for biofuels production, a lot of research has been done on the Salix spp. and Populus spp. belonging to the Salicaceae family.

Jatropha’s popularity stemmed out from different discourses, some real and some perceived, in scientific and non-scientific literature. These discourses positioned jatropha as a crop helpful in producing biodiesel and protecting sustainability by reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels and increasing local, rural development by creating jobs. Consequently, many countries established national policies that incentivized the establishment of jatropha as a bioenergy feedstock crop. In this paper, we explore the case of jatropha bioenergy development in Yucatan, Mexico and argue that the popular discourse around jatropha as a sustainability and rural development tool is flawed. Analyzing our results from 70 semi-structured interviews with community members belonging to a region where plantation-scale jatropha projects were introduced, we found that these projects did not have many significant social sustainability benefits. We conclude from our case that by just adding bioenergy projects cannot help achieve social sustainability in rural areas alone. In ensuring social sustainability of bioenergy projects, future policymaking processes should have a more comprehensive understanding of the rural socioeconomic problems where such projects are promoted and use bioenergy projects as one of the many solutions to local problems rather than creating such policies based just on popular discourses. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Jatropha; Just transition; Mexican bioenergy; Public perception; Social sustainability","Biodiesel; Crops; Environmental protection; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Regional planning; Rural areas; Bio-energy; Jatropha; Just transition; Public perception; Social sustainability; Sustainable development; biodiesel; biofuel; bioenergy; biofuel; biomass power; energy policy; greenhouse gas; incentive; market transition; perception; questionnaire survey; rural development; sustainability; sustainable development; adult; agricultural land; agriculture; Article; bioenergy; biomass; controlled study; employment; environmental policy; female; human; male; plantation; public policy; rural area; semi structured interview; social status; sustainable development; environmental protection; growth, development and aging; Jatropha; Mexico; procedures; public policy; rural population; trends; Mexico [North America]; Yucatan; Jatropha; Biofuels; Conservation of Natural Resources; Jatropha; Mexico; Public Policy; Rural Population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015782466

These temperatures are entropically defined as the ratio of the energy exchanged to the entropy produced. The emission temperature, shown here to be greater than or equal to the effective emission temperature, is relatively well known. In contrast, the absorption temperature requires radiative transfer calculations for its determination and is poorly known. The maximum material (i.e., nonradiative) entropy production of a planet's steady-state climate system is a function of the absorption and emission temperatures. Because a climate system does no work, the material entropy production measures the system's activity. The sensitivity of this production to changes in the emission and absorption temperatures is quantified. If Earth's albedo does not change, material entropy production would increase by about 5% per 1-K increase in absorption temperature. If the absorption temperature does not change, entropy production would decrease by about 4% for a 1% decrease in albedo. It is shown that, as a planet's emission temperature becomes more uniform, its entropy production tends to increase. Conversely, as a planet's absorption temperature or albedo becomes more uniform, its entropy production tends to decrease. These findings underscore the need to monitor the absorption temperature and albedo both in nature and in climate models. The heat-engine analyses for four planets show that the planetary entropy productions are similar for Earth, Mars, and Titan. The production for Venus is close to the maximum production possible for fixed absorption temperature. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","Climate models","Climate models; Engines; Solar radiation; Absorption and emissions; Absorption temperature; Climate system; Entropy production; Non-radiative; Radiative transfer calculations; Solar absorption; Steady state; Entropy; absorption; air temperature; albedo; climate modeling; Earth; entropy; Mars; planetary atmosphere; quantitative analysis; radiative transfer; Titan; Venus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020254442

Among sub-components of subjective satisfaction, reduction in smoke, speed of cooking, and quality of meals dominate over others (difficulty, cost, and safety). Moreover, we identify access to LPG – a modern cooking fuel – as a strong and robust predictor of high subjective satisfaction, mostly through reduction in smoke and increase in speed of cooking. Rural households ascribe a lot of value to access modern cooking fuels that reduce indoor air pollution, and beneficiaries of interventions to improve such access would value it.

Here, we performed a phylogeographical study of Monttea aphylla, an endemic species of the Monte Desert, to understand the evolutionary history of vegetation communities inhabiting the South American Arid Diagonal. We obtained sequences of three chloroplast (trnS-trnfM, trnH-psbA and trnQ-rps16) and one nuclear (ITS) intergenic spacers from 272 individuals of 34 localities throughout the range of the species. Population genetic and Bayesian coalescent analyses were performed to infer genealogical relationships among haplotypes, population genetic structure, and demographic history of the study species. Timing of demographic events was inferred using Bayesian Skyline Plot and the spatio-temporal patterns of lineage diversification was reconstructed using Bayesian relaxed diffusion models. Palaeo-distribution models (PDM) were performed through three different timescales to validate phylogeographical patterns. Twenty-five and 22 haplotypes were identified in the cpDNA and nDNA data, respectively. that clustered into two main genealogical lineages following a latitudinal pattern, the northern and the southern Monte (south of 35° S). The northern Monte showed two lineages of high genetic structure, and more relative stable demography than the southern Monte that retrieved three groups with little phylogenetic structure and a strong signal of demographic expansion that would have started during the Last Interglacial period (ca. 120 Ka). The PDM and diffusion models analyses agreed in the southeast direction of the range expansion. Differential effect of climatic oscillations across the Monte phytogeographic province was observed in Monttea aphylla lineages. In northern Monte, greater genetic structure and more relative stable demography resulted from a more stable climate than in the southern Monte. Pleistocene glaciations drastically decreased the species area in the southern Monte, which expanded in a southeastern direction to the new available areas during the interglacial periods. © 2017 Baranzelli et al.

Understanding this ecosystem service is important but difficult because of complex taxonomic diversity, history and geography of benthic biomass. Using South Georgia as a model location (where the history and geography of benthic biology is relatively well studied) we investigated whether the composition of functional groups were critical to benthic accumulation, immobilization and burial pathway to sequestration±and also aid their study through simplification of identification. We reclassified [1], [2]) morphotype and carbon mass data to 13 functional groups, for each sample of 32 sites around the South Georgia continental shelf. We investigated the influence on carbon accumulation, immobilization and sequestration estimate by multiple factors including the compositions of functional groups. Functional groups showed high diversity within and between sites, and within and between habitat types. Carbon storage was not linked to a functional group in particular but accumulation and immobilization increased with the number of functional groups present and the presence of hard substrata. Functional groups were also important to carbon burial rate, which increased with the presence of mixed (hard and soft substrata). Functional groups showed high surrogacy for taxonomic composition and were useful for examining contrasting habitat categorization. Functional groups not only aid marine carbon storage investigation by reducing time and the need for team size and speciality, but also important to benthic carbon pathways per se.

This paper also proposes a standardised and replicable workflow that can be applied by researchers and practitioners from novices to experts. The results presented here provide evidence that LCZ can be effectively derived from multiple airborne remote sensing datasets, which can then be used to identify morphological profiles to support varied climatological studies.

Centralization, defined as a shift of competences to a higher and more aggregated governance level, offers a number of advantages, including greater policy consistency and fewer market barriers and competitive distortions. However, it also comes at the price of reduced flexibility to accommodate national circumstances, which in turn can undermine domestic political support. As the evolution of climate policy in the EU illustrates, the degree of centralization does not necessarily correlate with the level of policy ambition with respect to climate protection. Tracing the role of centralization debates in the context of emissions trading and of policies to promote renewable energy, this article shows shifting preferences about centralization over time, and attempts to explain the causes of these changes and their implications for climate policy. It also addresses a recent trend towards greater regional cooperation, which is reflected in the emerging notion of a European Energy Union. But it also concludes that generalizations about the impact of centralization–or a lack thereof–fall short of the nuances in each individual case. Policy relevance Following its recent enlargement, and faced with changing economic and political circumstances at the national level, the EU must once again confront difficult questions about the adequate balance between centralized and decentralized approaches as it seeks to operationalize the climate and energy targets for 2030. The need for greater ambition in climate protection, unilateral measures taken by Member States to induce greater greenhouse gas mitigation in the power and industry sectors covered by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, divergent strategies to stabilize electricity markets as these integrate growing shares of variable renewable energy sources, or the ongoing discussion about a European Energy Union all underscore the need for improved understanding of the implications of centralization. This article draws on past experiences with central climate and energy policies to explain factors affecting the decision for or against centralization, as well as the effects of such decisions. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Centralization; climate policy; decentralization; EU ETS; European Union; member states; national policies; renewable energy","alternative energy; centralization; climate change; decentralization; emissions trading; environmental policy; European Union; renewable resource; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006118708

Such use in the United States (US) is limited. Biomass is increasingly being exported from the US to the EU. The complexity of bioenergy systems can be captured using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) techniques. This study utilizes LCA to assess the impact of biomass transportation, including type and distance, on the life cycle GHG emissions of bioenergy. Transportation types considered include truck, train and sea freight and each are assessed at realistic distances expected in bioenergy supply chains. Emission results for biomass firing alone and co-firing with coal at 20% are compared to a baseline coal-fired power plant. Results include life cycle emissions in terms of kg CO2eq per kWhel. For all cases considered, biomass utilization for electricity production results in fewer life cycle GHG emissions compared to the coal baseline, with emission reductions being as high as 80%. Utilization in the US and EU have similar overall emissions. Economic analysis results show that transportation has a significant effect on the additional cost for using biomass, and that costs for use in the US are comparable to costs for exporting to the EU. © 2017, ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

In some parts of the world, dam removal now outpaces their construction and the diminishing cost efficiency of dams in drying regions is likely to further increase the rate of removals. However, the potential influence of climate change on the impact of dam removals has received almost no consideration. Most dams have major biological and ecological impacts and their removal would greatly benefit riverine ecosystems. However, using model regions in the Southern Hemisphere, we highlight that artificial lentic habitats created by dams can act as refuges for increasingly imperiled freshwater fishes, and dams may also prevent the upstream spread of invasive alien species in rivers. We argue that, in these and other regions where the major impact of climate change will be to reduce streamflow and aquatic refuge availability, a shifting balance between the negative and positive environmental impacts of dams requires policy makers to include climate change predictions in prioritisation processes for dam removal. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aquatic refuge; Dam removal; Freshwater fishes; South Africa; South-western Australia; Surface flow decline","Pisces",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013409474

This is reflected in the United Nations’ processes aimed at enrolling governments in mitigation and adaptation programmes. Such an approach begs the question of how global climate change (GCC) responsiveness might proceed if a national government is hostile to the issue, as appears likely to be the case in the USA. This paper addresses this concern by documenting the percentage of the population of the USA who are ‘covered’ by at least one of six examples of GCC responsiveness at sub-federal–state and municipality–levels. Of the population of the USA, 25.8% lives in states where all of the state-level initiatives surveyed are in effect, whereas only 4.4% are not covered by any of the six. This coverage has increased as compared to earlier surveys (Lutsey, N., and D. Sperling. 2008. “America’s Bottom-Up Climate Change Mitigation Policy.” Energy Policy 36: 673–685. doi:10.1016/j.enpol.2007.10.018).

Yet, WBB development is characterized by a multitude of feedstock sources, bioenergy pathways, scales, and end uses, the feasibility of which is contingent upon place-based and context-specific social and environmental factors. We present an exploratory case study that draws on key informant interviews among a cohort of diverse stakeholders in rural western Montana forest communities, which was informed by a social-ecological systems framework and resilience thinking from a social science lens. The purpose of this paper is the following: (a) to document the ways in which key informants define the opportunities and constraints associated with WBB in local contexts; and (b) to understand how, and under what contexts, WBB can contribute to forest and community resilience under change. Interviews were analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach, and supplemented by document analysis. Results illustrate the ways in which historical contingencies (i.e., path dependence), individual and group values, and social context can affect the capacity to implement WBB projects. Results also help identify multiple perspectives and trade-offs, which can provide a step toward identifying the most desirable and plausible options for WBB development. As such, these lessons can be used as a starting point to help determine WBB development pathways that contribute to the social and ecological resilience of local places and people under change. © 2017 by the author(s).","Bioenergy; Path dependence; Renewable energy; Resilience; Rocky mountains; Social-ecological systems","alternative energy; bioenergy; biomass; community forestry; ecosystem resilience; stakeholder; wood; Montana; Rocky Mountains; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021783460

Stable isotopes have been recognized as a powerful tool to complement traditional geochemical and geophysical approaches during mineral exploration, particularly in carbonate replacement and Carlin-type deposits. However, wall-rock alteration and carbonate veining during ore formation is often accompanied by the precipitation of sulfide minerals, complicating stable isotope analysis. The classic phosphoric acid extraction technique for carbonate minerals results in the release of additional H2S gas, interfering with isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), and laser absorption spectrometry (LAS) analysis of CO2. Here we present the first results from a novel off-axis integrated cavity output spectrometer (OA-ICOS) instrument, capable of determining the stable isotope composition (δ13C, δ18O) of mixed CO2-H2S gas evolved from carbonate-sulfide mixtures. Instrument calibration was performed by analyzing in-house and commercially available CaCO3 stable isotope reference materials. Analyses of mixed CO2-H2S tank gas and sulfide-spiked stable isotope reference materials containing up to 40 wt % chalcopyrite and sphalerite demonstrate that the method outlined here is capable of effectively analyzing previously problematic high sulfide samples.

It shows that the top 10% of emitters produce 49% of total emissions while ‘non-daily’ emitters make up 38.5% of the sample. We adopt a quantile regression approach, which reveals significant socioeconomic differences between groups of emitters. Gender, income and home-municipality type are influential in accounting for CO2 emissions for all groups. Educational level appears to be less significant, and occupation shows no significance at all. The study confirms the ineffective nature of toll policy design in the area.

Transmission from dogs to humans is suspected, but has not been clearly demonstrated. Our objectives were to determine the seroprevalence of Bartonella henselae, Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii, Bartonella clarridgeiae, and Bartonella bovis (as a proxy for Candidatus Bartonella merieuxii) in stray dogs from Tunisia, identify the Bartonella species infecting the dogs and evaluate potential risk factors for canine infection. Blood samples were collected between January and November 2013 from 149 dogs in 10 Tunisian governorates covering several climatic zones. Dog-specific and geographic variables were analyzed as potential risk factors for Bartonella spp. seropositivity and PCR-positivity. DNA was extracted from the blood of all dogs and tested by PCR for Bartonella, targeting the ftsZ and rpoB genes. Partial sequencing was performed on PCR-positive dogs. Twenty-nine dogs (19.5%, 95% confidence interval: 14-27.4) were seropositive for one or more Bartonella species, including 17 (11.4%) for B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii, 14 (9.4%) for B. henselae, 13 (8.4%) for B. clarridgeiae, and 7 (4.7%) for B. bovis. Statistical analysis revealed a few potential risk factors, mainly dog's age and breed, latitude and average winter temperature. Twenty-two (14.8%) dogs, including 8 of the 29 seropositive dogs, were PCR-positive for Bartonella based on the ftsZ gene, with 18 (81.8%) of these 22 dogs also positive for the rpoB gene.

It is shown that the increase in the cross section for electron loss and the decrease in the cross section for electron capture by ions in a solid target (carbon) compared with gases is maximum in the region of 0.1–0.2MeV/nucleon. It is also shown that, in the case of a solid target, the energy by ion cross section for electron loss by an ion becomes maximum decreases, which is explained by a decrease in the binding energy of the active electron in the ion because of the presence of excited states. This leads to an increase in the average equilibrium ion charge in solid targets compared with the value in gases. The results of calculations agree with the experimental data in the entire considered energy region. The proposed method for calculating the ion charge-exchange cross sections in solid targets also makes it possible to qualitatively describe the dependence of the average ion charge on the target thickness and calculate the thickness (required to determine the equilibrium charge distribution) for different energies and charges of the ion nucleus. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","average charge of ions; electron-capture cross section; electron-loss cross section; ion charge distribution; ion-atom collisions","Binding energy; Charge distribution; Charge transfer; Electrons; Ion exchange; Ionization of solids; Active electrons; Average ion charge; Electron capture; Electron loss; Electron-capture cross sections; Ion atom collisions; Ion charge; Multi-charged ion; Ions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020533495

This threat is expected to be most acute for small-ranged endemic species, which could see novel climatic conditions develop rapidly across the entirety of their limited geographic ranges. To avoid extinctions, some conservationists have proposed that climateimperiled species might be candidates for ""assisted colonization"" or ""managed relocation"" to new regions, outside their historical ranges. One major concern related to managed relocation is the possibility that some relocated species could later become problematic invasives where they are introduced. In this review, we consider how these emerging conservation challenges might unfold for the flora of New England. A range of evidence suggests that most plant species native to New England might be resilient to immediate extinction risk from climate change, as these species typically have broad geographic ranges and have migrated long distances in response to past climate change. In contrast, regions to the south, particularly hotspots of plant endemism in the southeastern US, harbor numerous small-ranged species whose current climatic niches could rapidly shift beyond their native ranges, leaving them vulnerable to extinction unless they colonize new regions to the north. Consequently, debates surrounding managed relocation in New England are likely to be focused primarily on the ecological risks versus conservation benefits of accepting climate-Threatened endemic plant species from the southeastern US, and to hinge on concerns about the invasive potential of these species. To provide an empirically-grounded estimate of invasion risk from the introduction of US native plant species to New England, we reviewed invasive species lists for New England and tallied those species that are native to other parts of the contiguous US (versus other regions and continents). Between four and ten ""invasive"" or ""potentially invasive"" plant species reported from New England are from other regions of the contiguous US, depending in part on how issues of native versus exotic genotypes within taxa are resolved. A review of current floristic data from New England shows that these 4-10 problematic species are drawn from a larger pool of ~374 US native plant species reported as exotic in the region, suggesting that only 1.1-2.7% of species appearing spontaneously as adventives in the region are viewed as invasive. In light of this analysis, we suggest that managed relocation is not likely to spawn large numbers of new invasives, and might therefore be judiciously evaluated alongside other conservation options for climate-Threatened plant species. We propose a collaborative effort among field botanists, land managers, conservationists, and academics in New England, partnering with botanists in the southeastern US, to initiate fundamental research to experimentally test the viability and ecological effects of climate-Threatened endemic plant species from the southeastern US in the New England region. © Copyright 2017 by the New England Botanical Club.","Assisted colonization; Climate change; Conservation; Dispersal; Endemic plants; Exotic plants; Extinction; Invasions; Managed relocation; Migration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026912524

The main novelty of the paper is the reuse of wood pellet ash, an underestimated environmental problem, by the application of a new technology (COSMOS-RICE) that already involves the reuse of fly ashes from industrial and agricultural origins. The reaction mechanism involves carbonation: this occurs at room temperature and promotes permanent carbon dioxide sequestration. The obtained samples were characterized using XRD and TGA (coupled with mass spectroscopy). This allowed quantification of the mass loss attributed to different calcium carbonate phases. In particular, samples stabilized using wood pellet ash show a weight loss, attributed to the decomposition of carbonates greater than 20%. In view of these results, it is possible to conclude that there are several environmental benefits from wood pellet ash reuse in this way. In particular, using this technology, it is shown that for wood pellet biomass the carbon dioxide conversion can be considered negative. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","COSMOS-RICE, CO2 sequestration, sustainability; Pellet ash reuse; Rice husk ash; Waste","ash; biomass burning; calcium carbonate; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; crop residue; decomposition; domestic waste; greenhouse gas; integrated approach; power generation; processing; recycling; rice; sustainability; waste management; waste technology; carbon; carbon dioxide; biomass; fly ash; incineration; solid waste; wood; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Coal Ash; Incineration; Solid Waste; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018732258

Five new complexes (2-6) have been synthesized in good yields and characterized by cyclic voltammetry, absorption, and photoluminescence studies, by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations, and by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies for complexes 2, 4, and 6. An interesting feature of the complexes is that the HOMO is localized on the Ir d-orbitals and the phenoxylate part of the “ancillary” ligand, while the LUMO is located on the pyridyl ring of the ppy ligands. A few other complexes containing 2′-oxyphenyl-2-oxazoline/oxazole ancillary ligands have been reported previously; however, until now there has not been a systematic investigation into manipulating this unusual frontier orbital distribution to tune the emissive properties. It is shown that exchanging the phenylpyridine (ppy) ligand for 2,4-difluoro-ppy gives a blue shift of 21-22 nm (from 1 to 2 and from 4 to 5), and the introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents (SO2Me, CF3) onto the phenoxylate ring of the (2′-oxyphenyl)-2-oxazole ligand results in a further blue shift of 13-20 nm. Combining these functionalizations gives sky-blue emission with λmaxPL 476 and 479 nm for complexes 5 and 6 in dichloromethane solution. The solution quantum yields of all the complexes are within the range ΦPL 0.42-0.73. The observed lifetimes (τobs = 1.52-3.01 μs) and spectral profiles are indicative of phosphorescence from a mixture of ligand-centered and MLCT excited states. (TD-)DFT calculations are in close agreement with the observed photophysical and electrochemical properties of the complexes. Phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes have been fabricated using complexes 2, 3, 5, and 6 as the emitter, doped in a 4,4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)biphenyl host, giving efficient emission in the blue-green region.

Madagascar contains 2% of the world's mangroves, over 20% of which is estimated to have been deforested through charcoal production, timber extraction and agricultural development. This study presents a carbon stock assessment of the mangroves in Helodrano Fagnemotse in southwest Madagascar alongside an analysis of mangrove land-cover change from 2002 to 2014. Similar to other mangrove ecosystems in East Africa, higher stature, closed-canopy mangroves in southwest Madagascar were estimated to contain 454.92 (±26.58) Mg·C·ha-1. Although the mangrove extent in this area is relatively small (1500 ha), these mangroves are of critical importance to local communities and anthropogenic pressures on coastal resources in the area are increasing. This was evident in both field observations and remote sensing analysis, which indicated an overall net loss of 3.18% between 2002 and 2014. Further dynamics analysis highlighted widespread transitions of dense, higher stature mangroves to more sparse mangrove areas indicating extensive degradation. Harnessing the value that the carbon stored within these mangroves holds on the voluntary carbon market could generate revenue to support and incentivise locally-led sustainable mangrove management, improve livelihoods and alleviate anthropogenic pressures. © 2017 by the authors.","Baie des Assassins; Blue carbon; Helodrano Fagnemotse; Landsat; Madagascar; Mangroves","Charcoal; Climate change; Ecology; Ecosystems; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Baie des Assassins; Helodrano Fagnemotse; LANDSAT; Madagascar; Mangroves; Forestry; carbon cycle; climate change; degradation; ecosystem service; environmental degradation; Landsat; mangrove; vegetation cover; Carbon; Ecosystems; Mangrove; Remote Sensing; Seasonal Variation; East Africa; Madagascar; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020052328

Methodological constraints of measuring SOM decomposition in the field prevent the addressing of real-time rhizosphere effects that regulate nutrient cycling and SOM decomposition. An invasive lineage of Phragmites australis roots deeper than native vegetation (Schoenoplectus americanus and Spartina patens) in coastal marshes of North America and has potential to dramatically alter C cycling and accumulation in these ecosystems. To evaluate the effect of deep rooting on SOM decomposition we designed a mesocosm experiment that differentiates between plant-derived, surface SOM-derived (0–40 cm, active root zone of native marsh vegetation), and deep SOM-derived mineralization (40–80 cm, below active root zone of native vegetation). We found invasive P. australis allocated the highest proportion of roots in deeper soils, differing significantly from the native vegetation in root : shoot ratio and belowground biomass allocation. About half of the CO2 produced came from plant tissue mineralization in invasive and native communities; the rest of the CO2 was produced from SOM mineralization (priming). Under P. australis, 35% of the CO2 was produced from deep SOM priming and 9% from surface SOM. In the native community, 9% was produced from deep SOM priming and 44% from surface SOM. SOM priming in the native community was proportional to belowground biomass, while P. australis showed much higher priming with less belowground biomass. If P. australis deep rooting favors the decomposition of deep-buried SOM accumulated under native vegetation, P. australis invasion into a wetland could fundamentally change SOM dynamics and lead to the loss of the C pool that was previously sequestered at depth under the native vegetation, thereby altering the function of a wetland as a long-term C sink. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","deep root growth; Phragmites australis; priming; Schoenoplectus americanus; Spartina patens","belowground biomass; biomass allocation; carbon cycle; carbon sink; climate change; grass; growth; invasive species; root; soil carbon; soil organic matter; North America; Phragmites australis; Schoenoplectus americanus; Spartina patens; carbon; soil; carbon sequestration; chemistry; climate change; North America; Poaceae; soil; wetland; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; North America; Poaceae; Soil; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002705201

Several states in this region have greenhouse gas (GHG) emission targets and would benefit from information on the amount of carbon stored in tree biomass killed by disturbance. We quantified mean annual tree mortality from fires, bark beetles, and timber harvest from 2003-2012 for each state in this region. We estimated tree mortality from fires and beetles using tree aboveground carbon (AGC) stock and disturbance data sets derived largely from remote sensing. We quantified tree mortality from harvest using data from US Forest Service reports. In both cases, we used Monte Carlo analyses to track uncertainty associated with parameter error and temporal variability. Regional tree mortality from harvest, beetles, and fires (MORTH+B+F) together averaged 45.8 ± 16.0 Tg AGC yr-1 (±95% confidence interval), indicating a mortality rate of 1.10 ± 0.38% yr-1. Harvest accounted for the largest percentage of MORTH+B+F (∼50%), followed by beetles (∼32%), and fires (∼18%). Tree mortality from harvest was concentrated in Washington and Oregon, where harvest accounted for ∼80% of MORTH+B+F in each state. Tree mortality from beetles occurred widely at low levels across the region, yet beetles had pronounced impacts in Colorado and Montana, where they accounted for ∼80% of MORTH+B+F. Tree mortality from fires was highest in California, though fires accounted for the largest percentage of MORTH+B+F in Arizona and New Mexico (∼50%). Drought and human activities shaped regional variation in tree mortality, highlighting opportunities and challenges to managing GHG emissions from forests. Rising temperatures and greater risk of drought will likely increase tree mortality from fires and bark beetles during coming decades in this region. Thus, sustained monitoring and mapping of tree mortality is necessary to inform forest and GHG management. © 2017 The Author(s).

The system’s life cycle climate performance (LCCP) is a widespread metric proposed for the evaluation of the system’s environmental impact. Methods: In this paper, the potential emission reductions in the commercial refrigeration and residential air conditioning systems, made possible by shifting towards more environmentally friendly refrigerants in the US, are presented. First, the current LCCP of the most common commercial refrigeration and residential air conditioning systems is calculated. Then, the LCCP of the baseline systems, when using the potential low GWP alternative refrigerants, is presented. This helps to determine the systems which have the highest potential for emission reductions. Results and discussion: By shifting from the baseline refrigerants, R-404A and R-410A, to the suggested low GWP refrigerants, N-40 and L-41a, in the commercial refrigeration and residential HVAC systems, respectively, a combined drop of 30.43 % in the total emissions (i.e., total equivalent mass of emissions in kg CO2eq) is obtained. This results from a 50.5 and 28.01 % drop in total emissions from supermarket refrigeration systems and residential air conditioning, respectively. Conclusions: Shifting to lower GWP refrigerants in the refrigeration and air conditioning systems helps to reduce the total emissions and negative environmental impacts of these systems. Shifting to a secondary circuit commercial refrigeration system using N-40/L-40 and residential air conditioning and heat pump systems using L-41a helps in reducing the total emissions. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Alternative refrigerant; Environmental impact; GWP; Heat pumps; LCCP; Residential HVAC; Supermarket refrigeration","chemical compound; global warming potential refrigerant; unclassified drug; air conditioning; Article; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental parameters; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; refrigeration; residential home; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983439729

Samples activated by the Yb3+ ion in a wide concentration range were synthesized by three various techniques: high-temperature solid-state reaction, the Pechini method, and the combustion method. The microcrystalline solid solutions obtained by the high-temperature solid-state reaction characterized by intense luminescence are useful for detailed fundamental analysis. The direct excitation of Yb3+ into 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 absorption at 940-980 nm leads to reversed 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transitions giving Yb3+ emission lines in the 970-1100 nm range. The absorption and emission 0-phonon lines of Yb3+ ions were also used as structural probes at a low temperature, and the conjugation with SEM and TEM techniques was particularly useful here. The multisite character of Yb3+ was confirmed in high-resolution site-selective emission spectra. In the case of microcrystalline ceramics, the grains are characterized by a wide 0-phonon line around 976 nm and a high number of multisites and white points by another sharper line around 968 nm. Based on the absorption and emission spectra, the Yb3+ electronic energy level diagram was proposed for the main site. The effect of dopant concentration as well as the grain size influence on the luminescent properties and the decay times were analyzed in order to attempt to understand the concentration quenching mechanism and estimate the parameters useful for a theoretical approach to laser potential first with cubic single crystals and then with cubic transparent ceramics.

Little is known about how important bush encroachment is for climate change mitigation. We estimated woody plant biomass at different Prosopis juliflora cover to quantify above- and below-ground carbon (C) stocks in Afar, northern Ethiopia. We developed allometric models to estimate aboveground biomass (agB) through destructive harvesting based on crown diameter (CrD), diameter at stump height (DSH), and tree height (H) for twenty P. juliflora and 18 Acacia senegal trees. DSH showed the best model fit in predicting above ground biomass compared to H, CrD, and the combination of those predictor parameters, respectively. Models were highly significant for all agB components. Total C stocks of the entire woody species community were about 40% higher (86 Mg C ha−1) at high than at low (50 Mg C ha−1) P. juliflora encroachment categories. We conclude that allometric models using simple dendrometric parameters are highly valuable for assessing P. juliflora biomass. While in lightly invaded areas, eradication and prevention of further spread might be possible, we propose that the high C stocks of rangelands densely invaded by P. juliflora, where eradication attempts have failed, should be considered for potential C trade measures. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Allometric models; Biomass; Climate change mitigation; Ethiopia; Semi-arid grazing system; Woody encroachment","aboveground biomass; allometry; belowground biomass; biomass; carbon sequestration; climate change; grazing; legume; numerical model; phytomass; rangeland; semiarid region; woody plant; Afar; Acacia senegal; Prosopis juliflora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012935732

There are international conventions that require countries to mitigate NH3 emissions but there are no federal or provincial guidelines in Canada stipulating emission targets or best practices for agriculture. This study examines the potential for mitigating atmospheric NH3 using a range of approaches. Taking current farm practices into account, employing proven low-cost measures (low-emission slurry application and slurry storage covers) would reduce annual emissions from livestock operations by 16 kt NH3-N, while using all available low-cost measures would reduce emissions by 79 kt NH3-N or 26% of livestock emissions. Another 36 kt/yr could be avoided by improving fertilizer practices, so that the total potential reduction would be about 29% of all agricultural emissions. Emissions from beef cattle and pig production could be reduced by 18% if consumption was cut by 50%, with greater mitigation if production for export was reduced, although the economic and social consequences need to be considered. Mitigation practices must be viewed in the context of possible pollution swapping especially in surplus nitrogen situations. Emissions must also be considered in terms of atmospheric NH3 transport to and from the USA, therefore bi-national agreements to jointly reduce emissions might be needed. It may be more cost-effective in Canada to strategically reduce emissions to minimize risks to health (from particulate matter) and the environment rather than to reduce annual national emission targets. © 2017 British Society of Soil Science","Ammonia; emissions; livestock; mitigation","agricultural emission; ammonia; atmospheric pollution; emission control; fertilizer application; guideline; health risk; livestock farming; pollution incidence; Canada; Bos; Suidae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017201924

The proposal here is to use energy from the sea in order to obtain hydrogen from water. If plants to obtain hydrogen were to be placed in the ocean, the impact of long submarines piping to the coast will be reduced. Further, this will open the way for the development of ships propelled by hydrogen.

We applied the California Air Resources Board's EMFAC 2011 emission model to estimate the amount of daily average CO2 emissions from personal vehicle travel for 160 households across two waves, before and after the light rail opened. The 160 households were part of an experimental–control group research design. Approximately half of the households live within a half-mile of new Expo light rail stations (the experimental group) and the balance of the sampled households live beyond a half-mile from Expo light rail stations (the control group). Households tracked odometer mileage for all household vehicles for seven days in two sample waves, before the Expo Line opened (fall, 2011) and after the Expo Line opened (fall, 2012). Our analysis indicates that opening the Expo Line had a statistically significant impact on average daily CO2 emissions from motor vehicles. We found that the CO2 emission of households who reside within a half-mile of an Expo Line station was 27.17 percent smaller than those living more than a half-mile from a station after the opening of the light rail, while no significant difference exists before the opening. A difference-in-difference model suggests that the opening of the Expo Line is associated with 3,145 g less of household vehicle CO2 emissions per day as a treatment effect. A sensitivity analysis indicates that the emission reduction effect is also present when the experimental group of households is redefined to be those living within a kilometer from the new light rail stations. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; light rail system; traffic emission; California; Los Angeles [California]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971468055

Local responses are inventive and flexible. However, the distinct politics of post-Soviet Siberia and Alaska play a key role in the pragmatics of strategic planning. The Arctic is a planetary climate driver, but also holds the promise of massive resources in an ice-free future, producing tensions between 'environmental' and 'development' goals. Drawing on material from Siberia and Alaska we argue: (i) that extreme events in the Arctic are becoming normal; material demands are in a state of flux making it difficult to assess future material needs. We must consider material substitutions as much as material reduction; (ii) local-level responsive strategies should be taken into account. Core/periphery thinking tends to assume that answers come from 'the centre'; this is, in our view, limited; (iii) we suggest that 'flexibility' may become a core survival value that is as important for city planners and public health officials as it is for Siberian reindeer herders. In this, we see not only the simultaneous need for mitigation and adaptation policies, but also for a concerted effort in promoting such capacities in young people.

Analytical results suggest that, whether the purpose of the OBR policy is to compensate firms for carbon tax burdens or to maximize welfare (accounting for global emission reductions), the OBR rate should be positive in policy-relevant cases. Numerical simulations for Canada, with the US as the neighbouring trading partner, indicate that the impact of US policies on the OBR rate will depend crucially on the purpose of the Canadian OBR policies. If, for a given US carbon policy, Canada's aim is to restore the competitiveness of domestic emission-intensive and trade-exposed (EITE) firms to the same level as before the introduction of its own carbon taxation, we find that the necessary domestic OBR rates will be insensitive to the foreign carbon policies. However, if not only the Canadian carbon tax but also an equally high US tax is introduced, compensatory Canadian OBR rates will be up to 50% lower, depending on the sector and on US OBR policy. If the policy objective is to increase economy-wide allocative efficiency (welfare) of Canadian policies by accounting for carbon leakage, the US policies will have only a minor downward pressure on desirable OBR rates in Canada. Practical choices of OBR rates hardly affect overall domestic economic performance; thus, output-based rebating qualifies as an instrument for compensating EITE industries without a large sacrifice in terms of economy-wide allocative efficiency. © 2017 Canadian Economics Association",,"competitiveness; environmental economics; input-output analysis; leakage; policy analysis; pollution policy; pollution tax; trade-environment relations; welfare economics; Canada; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019130378

Previous studies suggest that emission pricing combined with border carbon adjustment is a second-best instrument, and more cost-effective than output-based rebating. We show that the combination of output-based rebating and a consumption tax for emission-intensive and trade-exposed goods can be equivalent with border carbon adjustment. Moreover, it is welfare improving for a region that implements emission pricing along with output-based rebating to introduce such a consumption tax. The welfare gain is particularly large if output-based rebating is already implemented for a sector that is not much exposed to leakage, e.g., due to uncertainty about exposure or due to lobbying activities. Thus, supplementing output-based rebating with a consumption tax constitutes robust policies to mitigate carbon leakage. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Border carbon adjustment; Carbon leakage; Consumption tax; Output-based rebating",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016393986

While such participation is desirable, its feasibility has been uncertain. This collection builds the empirical foundations for putting PMRV into practice. The authors of this article identified five crucial considerations: (1) clarify the stakeholders, (2) understand their motivation to participate, (3) integrate knowledge and information from multiple disciplines and sources, (4) convey knowledge and information across multiple levels of governance, and (5) clarify and enable the links to REDD+ safeguards. We conclude that local communities and other local actors can play a major role in achieving REDD+ MRV, however, this requires attention to their needs and motivations.

Moreover the necessity to reduce weight of structural components to contain gas emissions and reduce pollution impels to use lightweight engineering materials, such as composites. Although significant numerical and experimental works on the collapse of fiber-reinforced composite shells have been carried out, studies on the theoretical modeling of the crushing process are quite limited given the complex and brittle fracture mechanisms of composite materials.A mathematical and finite element approach on the failure mechanisms, pertaining to the stable mode of collapse of thin-walled composite frusta subjected to axial loading, are investigated. The theoretical analysis is conducted from an energetic point of view. The main energy contributions to the absorption (bending, petal formation, circumferential delamination, friction) are identified and then, by the conservation law, the total internal energy is equated to the work done by the external load. The total crushing process can be seen as a succession of deformation states, each responsible for a partial absorption. The minimum configuration for each impact force in the specific state of deformation, function of several variables and dependent on geometric and material parameters, is obtained. Moreover the numerical modeling through a finite element analysis is conducted; all parametric values and cards set in the explicit dynamic code LS-DYNA is described in detail. Finally a comparison between theory, finite element approach, and experiments concerning crushing loads and total displacements is presented, showing how the proposed strategy is able to capture the crushing mechanisms of such composite structures despite the simplification adopted. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Composite materials; Crashworthy problems; Energetic approach; FEA; Theoretical analysis","Aerospace applications; Composite materials; Crushing; Deformation; Energy absorption; Fiber reinforced plastics; Finite element method; Gas emissions; Glass ceramics; Thin walled structures; Brittle fracture mechanism; Crashworthy problems; Energetic approach; Fiber reinforced composites; Finite-element approach; Light-weight engineering; Theoretical analysis; Thin-walled composites; Failure (mechanical)",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053742810

Here relationships are found between the models' present-day performance in sea ice-related metrics and future changes in temperature variability. These relations, so-called emergent constraints, can produce ensembles of models calibrated with present-day observations with a narrower spread across their members than across the full ensemble. The underlying assumption is that models in better agreement with observations or reanalyses in a carefully selected metric probably have a more realistic representation of local processes, and therefore are more reliable for projections. Thus, the reliability of this method depends on the availability of high-quality observations or reanalyses. This work represents a step toward formalization of the emergent constraints framework, as so far there is no consensus on how the constraints should be best implemented. The authors quantify the reduction in spread from emerging constraints for various metrics and their combinations, different emission scenarios, and seasons. Some of the general features of emerging constraints are discussed, and how to effectively aggregate information across metrics and seasons to achieve the largest reduction in model spread. It is demonstrated, based on the case of temperature variability, that a robust constraint can be obtained by combining relevant metrics across all seasons. Such a constraint results in a strongly reduced spread across model projections, which is consistent with a process understanding of variability changes due to sea ice retreat. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","Model comparison; Model errors; Model evaluation/performance; Model output statistics","Atmospheric temperature; Ice; Sea ice; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; High-quality observations; Model comparison; Model errors; Model evaluation/performance; Model output statistics; Process understanding; Temperature variability; Climate models; climate change; climate prediction; CMIP; error analysis; modeling; temperature anomaly",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018999390

Over the last decade, hundreds of subnational REDD+ initiatives have emerged, presenting an opportunity to pilot and compare different approaches to quantifying impacts on carbon emissions. This study (1) develops a Before-After-Control-Intervention (BACI) method to assess the effectiveness of these REDD+ initiatives; (2) compares the results at the meso (initiative) and micro (village) scales; and (3) compares BACI with the simpler Before-After (BA) results. Our study covers 23 subnational REDD+ initiatives in Brazil, Peru, Cameroon, Tanzania, Indonesia and Vietnam. As a proxy for deforestation, we use annual tree cover loss. We aggregate data into two periods (before and after the start of each initiative). Analysis using control areas ('control-intervention') suggests better REDD+ performance, although the effect is more pronounced at the micro than at the meso level. Yet, BACI requires more data than BA, and is subject to possible bias in the before period. Selection of proper control areas is vital, but at either scale is not straightforward. Low absolute deforestation numbers and peak years influence both our BA and BACI results. In principle, BACI is superior, with its potential to effectively control for confounding factors. We conclude that the more local the scale of performance assessment, the more relevant is the use of the BACI approach. For various reasons, we find overall minimal impact of REDD+ in reducing deforestation on the ground thus far. Incorporating results from micro and meso level monitoring into national reporting systems is important, since overall REDD+ impact depends on land use decisions on the ground. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","climate; deforestation; forest change; land cover; monitoring; performance assessment; REDD+","Deforestation; Forestry; Monitoring; Testing; climate; Forest change; Land cover; Performance assessment; REDD; Climate change; assessment method; carbon emission; climate change; deforestation; environmental change; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; forest management; international agreement; land cover; land use planning; performance assessment; spatial analysis; vegetation cover; Brazil; Cameroon; Indonesia; Peru; Tanzania; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025600943

These emissions are assumed to increase by 150–250% in 2050 in business-as-usual scenarios with a tripling of world trade, while achieving a 1.5–2 °C climate target requires net zero GHG emissions across all economic sectors. Consequentially, the maritime sector is facing the challenge to significantly reduce its GHG emissions as contribution to the international ambition to limit the effects of climate change. This article presents the results of a review of around 150 studies, to provide a comprehensive overview of the CO2 emissions reduction potentials and measures published in literature. It aims to identify the most promising areas, i.e. technologies and operational practices, and quantify the combined mitigation potential. Results show a significant variation in reported CO2 reduction potentials across reviewed studies. In addition, no single measure is sufficient to achieve meaningful GHG reductions. Emissions can be reduced by more than 75%, based on current technologies and by 2050, through a combination of measures if policies and regulations are focused on achieving these reductions. In terms of emissions per freight unit transported, it is possible to reduce emissions by a factor of 4–6. © 2017 The Authors","Abatement options; Emission reductions; Greenhouse gases; Maritime transport; Shipping and the environment","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Emission control; Gas emissions; International trade; Ships; Abatement options; Emission reduction; Emissions reduction; Maritime transport; Operational practices; Reduction potential; Shipping and the environments; State-of-the-art technology; Greenhouse gases; abatement cost; anthropogenic source; carbon emission; emission control; greenhouse gas; maritime transportation; shipping; technology adoption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016971116

The SOC in the subsoil contributed to SOC potential of mineralization and should not be underestimated, especially in the alluvial cultivated plains.

Oil recovery can be improved by enhancing the following drive mechanisms: • Capillary imbibition with wettability modifiers • Viscous drive by increasing the pressure gradient in the fracture network • Water/oil gravity drainage with low-interfacial-tension (IFT) surfactant formulations that also reduce oil trapping This paper presents an experimental approach that evaluates different chemical-enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) alternatives on the basis of one or several of the three aforementioned recovery mechanisms. The experiments consist of injecting an aqueous chemical solution or a foam containing chemical additives into an artificially fractured carbonate core. The imbibition is monitored with a recent computed-tomography (CT) scanner allowing the local quantitative monitoring of three phases, including accurate quantification of matrix oil recovery. This paper is mainly focused on the impacts of foaming agents and wettability modifiers (WMs), implemented separately or jointly. The experiments have been conducted on several cores of different permeability, resulting in various permeability contrasts between matrix and fracture. A major result concerns the kinetics of oil recovery by chemical additives that is greatly increased when a viscous drive is applied across the matrix medium by means of the circulation of foam in the fracture. Experiments in fractured cores of different permeabilities indicate that foam does not penetrate the matrix, but drives the chemical aqueous phase into the matrix because of the generated pressure gradient. Detailed analysis of oil-mobilization dynamics is provided. These foam-flow experiments are compared with a former chemical imbibition test on a nonfractured core for further insight into the role played by viscous forces.

This is simply part of the new ‘low-carbon economy’, like recycling programs, car-sharing and similar behaviors. Mid-century modern buildings, by the sheer size of their stock, and their current state of maturation, are a major target, as perhaps the single greatest impact on carbon footprint reduction. There is an urgent need for their necessary large-scale sustainable rehabilitation and deep energy retrofit. Therefore, it is argued, the rehabilitation and rejuvenation of Modern-era buildings and urban systems will very rapidly become the major focus of architectural endeavor over the next few years. This will be one of the foci of the move toward increasing the generally prescribed valuation of our existing resources. Preservation professionals have already developed the skills for adaptation and rehabilitation of existing (heritage) resources while protecting (heritage) value. Therefore, they have the opportunity to be leaders of this coming tidal wave of broader architectural conservation work on Modern-era buildings. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Attitude adjustment; Lowcarbon economy; Mid-century modern; Value of the existing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020736777

Estuaries are sites of intense biological production and N2O emissions. We aimed to identify hot spots of N2O production and potential pathways contributing to N2O concentrations in the surface water of the tidal Elbe estuary. During two research cruises in April and June 2015, surface water N2O concentrations were measured along the salinity gradient of the Elbe estuary by using a laser-based on-line analyzer coupled to an equilibrator. Based on these high-resolution N2O profiles, N2O saturations, and fluxes across the surface water/atmosphere interface were calculated. Additional measurements of DIN concentrations, oxygen concentration, and salinity were performed. Highest N2O concentrations were determined in the Hamburg port region reaching maximum values of 32.3 nM in April 2015 and 52.2 nM in June 2015. These results identify the Hamburg port region as a significant hot spot of N2O production, where linear correlations of AOU-N2Oxs indicate nitrification as an important contributor to N2O production in the freshwater part. However, in the region with lowest oxygen saturation, sediment denitrification obviously affected water column N2O saturation. The average N2O saturation over the entire estuary was 201% (SD: ±94%), with an average estuarine N2O flux density of 48 μmol m-2 d-1 and an overall emission of 0.18 Gg N2O y-1. In comparison to previous studies, our data indicate that N2O production pathways over the whole estuarine freshwater part have changed from predominant denitrification in the 1980s toward significant production from nitrification in the present estuary. Despite a significant reduction in N2O saturation compared to the 1980s, N2O concentrations nowadays remain on a high level, comparable to the mid-90s, although a steady decrease of DIN inputs occurred over the last decades. Hence, the Elbe estuary still remains an important source of N2O to the atmosphere. © 2017 Brase, Bange, Lendt, Sanders and Dähnke.","Elbe river; Emissions; Estuary; Laser spectroscopy; N2O; Nitrous oxide; Trace gases",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020076783

Our main contribution is to show that by ignoring spatial heat and moisture transport and the resulting polar amplification, the regulator may overestimate or underestimate the tax on greenhouse gas emissions. The direction of bias depends on the relations between marginal damages from temperature increase in each region. We also determine the welfare cost when a regulator mistakenly ignores polar amplification.

Satellite retrievals of near-surface-sensitive column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of atmospheric methane, i.e. XCH4, can be used to quantify methane emissions. Maps of time-averaged satellite-derived XCH4 show regionally elevated methane over several methane source regions. In order to obtain methane emissions of these source regions we use a simple and fast data-driven method to estimate annual methane emissions and corresponding 1σ uncertainties directly from maps of annually averaged satellite XCH4. From theoretical considerations we expect that our method tends to underestimate emissions. When applying our method to high-resolution atmospheric methane simulations, we typically find agreement within the uncertainty range of our method (often 100%) but also find that our method tends to underestimate emissions by typically about 40%. To what extent these findings are model dependent needs to be assessed. We apply our method to an ensemble of satellite XCH4 data products consisting of two products from SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT and two products from TANSO-FTS/GOSAT covering the time period 2003-2014. We obtain annual emissions of four source areas: Four Corners in the south-western USA, the southern part of Central Valley, California, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan. We find that our estimated emissions are in good agreement with independently derived estimates for Four Corners and Azerbaijan. For the Central Valley and Turkmenistan our estimated annual emissions are higher compared to the EDGAR v4.2 anthropogenic emission inventory. For Turkmenistan we find on average about 50% higher emissions with our annual emission uncertainty estimates overlapping with the EDGAR emissions. For the region around Bakersfield in the Central Valley we find a factor of 5-8 higher emissions compared to EDGAR, albeit with large uncertainty. Major methane emission sources in this region are oil/gas and livestock. Our findings corroborate recently published studies based on aircraft and satellite measurements and new bottom-up estimates reporting significantly underestimated methane emissions of oil/gas and/or livestock in this area in EDGAR. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"atmospheric chemistry; emission inventory; methane; satellite data; Azerbaijan; Bakersfield; California; Central Valley [California]; Turkmenistan; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018926310

This theory has long held promise for understanding the physiological ecology of water use and for informing models of plant-atmosphere interactions. Full realization of this potential hinges on three questions: (i) Are analytical approximations adequate for applying the theory at diurnal time scales? (ii) At what time scale is it realistic and appropriate to apply the theory? (iii) How should gs vary to maximize growth over long time scales? We review the current state of understanding for each of these questions and describe future research frontiers. In particular, we show that analytical solutions represent the theory quite poorly, especially when boundary layer or mesophyll resistances are significant; that diurnal variations in hydraulic conductance may help or hinder maintenance of ∂A/∂E, and the matter requires further study; and that optimal diurnal responses are distinct from optimal long-term variations in gs, which emerge from optimal shifts in carbon partitioning at the whole-plant scale. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","CO2; drought; optimisation; stomata; transpiration","atmosphere-biosphere interaction; carbon dioxide; drought stress; hydraulic conductivity; optimization; physiology; stomata; stomatal conductance; transpiration; carbon; water; atmosphere; biological model; chemistry; circadian rhythm; drought; metabolism; plant development; plant physiology; soil; Atmosphere; Carbon; Circadian Rhythm; Droughts; Models, Biological; Plant Development; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Soil; Water",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991670305

Mycorrhizal symbiosis is a key interaction between fungi and most vascular plants. Whether plants are obligately (OM) or facultatively (FM) mycorrhizal, and which mycorrhizal type they form – arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM), ectomycorrhizal (ECM), ericoid mycorrhizal (ERM) or non-mycorrhizal (NM) – can have strong implications for plant species distribution at the continental scale and on the responses of plants to environmental gradients. Location: Europe, north of 43° latitude and excluding Russia, Belarus and Moldova. Time period: Undefined. Major taxa studied: Vascular plants. Methods: Using published sources, we compiled the most complete dataset yet of plant mycorrhizal and geographical information for Europe, comprising 1442 plant species. We mapped the European distributions of plant mycorrhizal status (OM and FM) and type (AM, ECM, ERM and NM) and analysed their relationships with climatic, edaphic and plant productivity drivers on a 50 km × 50 km equal-area grid. Results: The distribution of mycorrhizal types in Europe was driven by mean temperature, soil pH and productivity. AM plant species predominated throughout the region, but at higher latitudes the share of NM and, to a lesser extent, ECM and ERM species increased. FM species predominated over OM species, and this increased with latitude and was dependent on temperature drivers. The high share of OM species in the central European mountains indicates a possible influence of historical glacial refugia. Main conclusions: Our results challenge the prevailing view of parallel trends in the latitudinal and elevational distribution of mycorrhizal types and demonstrate distinctive responses of plants with different mycorrhizal status to climatic, edaphic and biogeographical drivers at the European scale. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","arbuscular mycorrhiza; climate; ectomycorrhiza; ericoid mycorrhiza; facultative mycorrhizal; non-mycorrhizal; obligate mycorrhizal; soil","climate conditions; ectomycorrhiza; environmental change; facultative behavior; fungus; symbiosis; taxonomy; vascular plant; Europe; Fungi; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017377903

Over a 2-year period, we measured microcystin concentrations in water, sediment and biota (fish and shellfish) at both sites. Across both food webs we found highest levels of microcystin among consumers of suspended particulate matter, including planktivorous fishes and filter-feeding shellfish, and lower levels of toxin among piscivores, scavengers and benthic omnivores. Despite similar levels of microcystin in the water column at the two sites, we observed higher toxin levels in fish and sediments of the Curonian Lagoon. We attribute this difference to the legacy of prior toxic cyanobacteria blooms in the Curonian Lagoon and hydrologic factors that result in a predominance of autochthonously-derived organic matter in the sediments at this site. Our results suggest that a consideration of species-specific differences in feeding habits, and organic matter sources supporting food webs are important to understanding the accumulation and persistence of algal toxins in food webs and should therefore be considered in assessment of risks to aquatic biota and human health. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"assessment method; comparative study; concentration (composition); feeding ecology; food web; hydrological modeling; organic matter; persistence; toxin; water column; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Chesapeake Bay; Curonian Lagoon; United States; algae; Cyanobacteria; Pisces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018472152

With excellent surface reaction kinetics, these catalysts encounter CO2 mass transport limitations at current densities ca. 20 mA cm-2. We show here that - in addition to influencing reaction rates and local reactant concentration - the morphology of nanostructured electrodes enhances long-range CO2 transport via their influence on gas-evolution. Sharper needle morphologies can nucleate and release bubbles as small as 20 μm, leading to a 4-fold increase in the limiting current density compared to a nanoparticle-based catalyst alone. By extending this observation into a diffusion model that accounts for bubble-induced mass transport near the electrode's surface, diffusive transport can be directly linked to current densities and operating conditions, identifying efficient routes to &gt;100 mA cm-2 production. We further extend this model to study the influence of mass transport on achieving simultaneously high selectivity and current density of C2 reduction products, identifying precise control of the local fluid environment as a crucial step necessary for producing C2 over C1 products. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","CO2 reduction; Electrocatalysis; Gas-evolution; Limiting current; Mass transport; Nanomorphology","Carbon dioxide; Catalyst selectivity; Catalysts; Current density; Electrocatalysis; Electrodes; Mass transfer; Reaction kinetics; Reaction rates; Reduction; Surface reactions; Transportation routes; Gas evolution; Limiting current; Limiting current density; Mass transport limitation; Nano-structured electrodes; Nanomorphologies; Reactant concentrations; Reaction selectivity; Transport properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018432963

In the fall of 2013, 23 of the 24 sophomore general education students enrolled in the three courses were surveyed at the beginning and end of the semester; 17 of those same students completed the survey again in the spring of 2016, their senior year. Results, which focus on the 17 students who continued to participate through their senior year, were analyzed with quantitative and qualitative methodologies. The pre/post data from the surveys demonstrated significant improvement in climate literacy, certainty, concern and urgency over the course of the semester; the senior data indicated that those improvements were largely retained. The study also suggests that the nine-credit curriculum improved transferable skills such as interdisciplinary thinking, self-confidence and public speaking. A qualitative analysis of three student cases, informed by a focus group (n = 7) of seniors along with other sources of information, suggested retention of such transferable skills, and, in some cases, deeper involvement in climate and sustainability action. © 2017 by the authors.","Case studies; Climate change; Community based learning; Environmental ethics; Environmental science; Interdisciplinary; Learning community; Longitudinal research; Systems-based design","climate change; curriculum; design; environmental education; environmental research; ethics; interdisciplinary approach; learning; longitudinal gradient; qualitative analysis; student; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019996027

This paper presents an investigation into the operation characteristics of the novel DMHP system under various working modes by theoretical and experimental methods. For each working mode, a dynamic model has been proposed and validated with the experimental data. With the verified model, the switch point between air source and solar energy can be identified by comparing the operation performance of different working modes under a range of boundary conditions. The results indicate that the performance of air source space heating mode is superior to that of solar space heating mode with the ambient temperature above 4 °C, and solar water heating mode is more efficient than air source water heating mode when the ambient temperature is below 3 °C. On this basis, annual performance of the system under different climate conditions reveals that the DMHP system can obtain relatively high COP with the optimal working strategy in the whole year especially for the district with cold winter. Furthermore, the exergy loss ratio in each component of the DMHP system has been discussed to provide the reference for further optimization.

Site-specific abiotic constraints, such as topography and demographic trends may make treelines less responsive to environmental fluctuations. A better understanding on how local processes modulate treelines’ response to warming is thus required. We developed a model of treeline dynamics based on individual data of growth, mortality and reproduction. Specifically, we modeled growth patterns, mortality rates and reproductive size thresholds as a function of temperature and stand structure to evaluate the influence of climate- and stand-related processes on treeline dynamics. In this study, we analyze the dynamics of four Pyrenean mountain pine treeline sites with contrasting stand structures, and subjected to differing rates of climate warming. Our models indicate that Pyrenean treelines could reach basal areas and reproductive potentials similar to those currently observed in high-elevation subalpine forest by the mid twenty-first century. The fastest paces of treeline densification are forecasted by the late twenty-first century and are associated with higher warming rates. We found a common densification response of Pyrenean treelines to climate warming, but contrasting paces arise due to current size structures. Treelines characterized by a multistratified stand structure and subjected to lower mean annual temperatures were the most responsive to climate warming. In monostratified stands, tree growth was less sensitive to temperature than in multistratified stands and trees reached their reproductive size threshold later. Therefore, our simulations highlight that stand structure is paramount in modulating treeline responsiveness to ongoing climate warming. Synthesis. Treeline densification over the twenty-first century is likely to occur at different rates contingent on current stand structure and its effects on individual-level tree growth responses to warming. Accurate projections of future treeline dynamics must thus incorporate site-specific factors other than climate, specifically those related to stand structure and its influence on tree growth. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","climate warming; mountain pine; Pinus uncinata; plant–climate interactions; Pyrenees; reproductive size threshold; stand structure; tree growth; treeline shift","alpine environment; climate change; coniferous tree; ecotone; environmental effect; mortality; range size; stand structure; topography; treeline; vegetation dynamics; Pinus mugo; Pinus uncinata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991044068

SCL and inverse models contain different assumptions about conditions outside the sheath (e.g., the velocity of ions entering the sheath). So it is not yet clear whether both sheaths are possible in practice, or only one. Here we treat the global presheath-sheath problem for a plasma produced volumetrically between two planar walls. We show that all equilibrium requirements (a) floating condition, (b) plasma shielding, and (c) presheath force balance, can indeed be satisfied in two different ways when the emission coefficient γ &gt; 1. There is one solution with SCL sheaths and one with inverse sheaths, each with sharply different presheath distributions. As we show for the first time in 1D-1V simulations, a SCL and inverse equilibrium are both possible in plasmas with the same upstream properties (e.g., same N and Te). However, maintaining a true SCL equilibrium requires no ionization or charge exchange collisions in the sheath, or else cold ion accumulation in the SCL's ""dip"" forces a transition to the inverse. This suggests that only a monotonic inverse type sheath potential should exist at any plasma-facing surface with strong emission, whether be a divertor plate, emissive probe, dust grain, Hall thruster channel wall, sunlit object in space, etc. Nevertheless, SCL sheaths might still be possible if the ions in the dip can escape. Our simulations demonstrate ways in which SCL and inverse regimes might be distinguished experimentally based on large-scale presheath effects, without having to probe inside the sheath. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Charge transfer; Electron emission; Geometry; Hall thrusters; Ion exchange; Ions; Plasma sheaths; Charge exchange collision; Emission coefficient; Floating conditions; Inverse equilibrium; Planar geometries; Plasma equilibria; Plasma facing surfaces; Space-charge limited; Inverse problems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014431117

Iron–sulphur minerals with equivalent structures could have played a key role in the origin of life. However, the ‘iron–sulphur world’ hypothesis has had a mixed reception, with questions raised especially about the feasibility of a pyrites-pulled reverse Krebs cycle. Phylogenetics suggests that the earliest cells drove carbon and energy metabolism via the acetyl CoA pathway, which is also replete in Fe(Ni)S proteins. Deep differences between bacteria and archaea in this pathway obscure the ancestral state. These differences make sense if early cells depended on natural proton gradients in alkaline hydrothermal vents. If so, the acetyl CoA pathway diverged with the origins of active ion pumping, and ancestral CO2 fixation might have been equivalent to methanogens, which depend on a membrane-bound NiFe hydrogenase, energy converting hydrogenase. This uses the proton-motive force to reduce ferredoxin, thence CO2. The mechanism suggests that pH could modulate reduction potential at the active site of the enzyme, facilitating the difficult reduction of CO2 by H2. This mechanism could be generalised under abiotic conditions so that steep pH differences across semi-conducting Fe(Ni)S barriers drives not just the first steps of CO2 fixation to C1 and C2 organics such as CO, CH3SH and CH3COSH, but a series of similar carbonylation and hydrogenation reactions to form longer chain carboxylic acids such as pyruvate, oxaloacetate and α-ketoglutarate, as in the incomplete reverse Krebs cycle found in methanogens. We suggest that the closure of a complete reverse Krebs cycle, by regenerating acetyl CoA directly, displaced the acetyl CoA pathway from many modern groups. A later reliance on acetyl CoA and ATP eliminated the need for the proton-motive force to drive most steps of the reverse Krebs cycle. © 2017 IUBMB Life, 69(6):373–381, 2017. © 2017 The Authors IUBMB Life published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology","acetyl CoA pathway; alkaline hydrothermal vent; ferredoxin; incomplete reverse Krebs cycle; iron–sulphur minerals; origin of life; proton gradients","acetyl coenzyme A; adenosine triphosphate; alkaline earth metal; carbon dioxide; ferredoxin; iron sulfur protein; proton; 2 oxoglutaric acid; acetyl coenzyme A; alpha-ketoglutaric acid; iron; iron sulfur protein; oxaloacetic acid; pyruvic acid; archaeon; Article; bacterium; biogenesis; carbonylation; citric acid cycle; hydrothermal vent; nonhuman; Precambrian; proton motive force; carbon cycle; catalysis; chemistry; metabolism; pH; Acetyl Coenzyme A; Archaea; Bacteria; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Dioxide; Catalysis; Citric Acid Cycle; Ferredoxins; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydrothermal Vents; Iron; Iron-Sulfur Proteins; Ketoglutaric Acids; Origin of Life; Oxaloacetic Acid; Protons; Pyruvic Acid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018248209

New marine invasions have been recorded in dramatically increasing numbers along the world's coasts, due, in part, to the global warming of the oceans and the ability of many successful invasive marine species to tolerate a broader thermal range than native species. As a response to ocean warming, a poleward movement of numerous species has been observed in many biogeographic regions. Our aim was to explore several poorly recognized and thus rarely studied aspects of ocean climate change scenarios in order to advance our understanding of finer-grained aspects of poleward movements. Location: Global. Methods: Three scenarios are investigated in our framework: (1) the existence of networks of complex intraregional origins, routes and destinations of poleward-moving species, (2) the existence of impenetrable termini where no further expansion is possible, linked to potential outflow corridors, and (3) the interplay of a warming ocean with aperiodic cold episodes. Results: Poleward advances consist of distinct regional networks of origins, routes and destinations, largely undefined in most areas, linked in turn to the potential existence of endpoints where no further expansion may be possible without escape routes and/or human-mediated assistance. The interaction of aperiodic cooling periods may result in temporary setbacks or rate reductions in range expansions. Main conclusions: The recognition of potentially complex origin-route-destination networks may significantly advance our predictive capacity of both future invasions and range expansions and potential impacts. Thus, specific focus on high-profile donor region species pools linked to established vector routes may yield far more robust management scenarios than currently in place. While it is probable that the frequency of climate-mediated surges (inevitable warming) and setbacks (cooling periods) of species invasions will increase over time, the net outcome is likely to be positive, resulting in an inexorable poleward expansion of thousands of species. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","African Creep; climate change; cold snaps; invasive species; non-indigenous species; species expansions; surges","aquatic organism; biogeographical region; cold region; creep; global climate; global warming; invasive species; marine environment; native species; outflow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016267246

Previous studies have shown that this complex is required for the rapid induction and relaxation of excess light energy dissipation in a wide range of eukaryotic algae and moss. The ability of cells to rapidly regulate light harvesting between this dissipation state and one favoring photochemistry is believed to be important for reducing oxidative stress and maintaining high photosynthetic efficiency in a rapidly changing light environment. We found that a mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii lacking LHCSR, npq4lhcsr1, displays minimal photoinhibition of photosystem II and minimal inhibition of short term oxygen evolution when grown in constant excess light compared to a wild type strain. We also investigated the impact of no LHCSR during growth in a sinusoidal light regime, which mimics daily changes in photosynthetically active radiation. The absence of LHCSR correlated with a slight reduction in the quantum efficiency of photosystem II and a stimulation of the maximal rates of photosynthesis compared to wild type. However, there was no reduction in carbon accumulation during the day. Another novel finding was that npq4lhcsr1 cultures underwent fewer divisions at night, reducing the overall growth rate compared to the wild type. Our results show that the rapid regulation of light harvesting mediated by LHCSR is required for high growth rates, but it is not required for efficient carbon accumulation during the day in a sinusoidal light environment. This finding has direct implications for engineering strategies directed at increasing photosynthetic productivity in mass cultures. © 2017 Cantrell, Peers.

The Baogutu deposit is a typical reduced porphyry Cu deposit. Amphibole and biotite Fe3+/ΣFe ratios, minerals (feldspar, biotite, amphibole, zircon and apatite), in situ elemental and apatite Nd isotopic compositions were determined by Mössbauer spectroscopy, electron probe microanalysis, and laser ablation multiple-collection inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, respectively, to investigate the magma oxidation state, petrogenesis, source features, and to constrain the carbon species at magmatic stages for the intrusive phases. The results show that the primary plagioclase and amphibole in the mineralized diorite to granodiorite porphyry and post ore hornblende diorite porphyry are distinct (An26-55 versus An60-69; Mg-hornblende versus tschermakite). In particular, the amphibole shows distinct major and trace element compositions with light rare earth element enrichments and negative Eu anomalies in Mg-hornblende and light rare earth element depletions and no Eu anomalies in tschermakite. All the analyzed biotites are primary igneous phases with a biotite phenocryst profile showing significant variations of Zn, Cr, Sc and Sr from core to rim. These results may indicate the occurrence of mixing between two distinct magmas during mineral formation. Titanium in zircon and Si∗ in amphibole thermometries indicate that magma crystallized at &gt;900 °C and continued to ∼650 °C. In situ apatite Nd isotope (εNd(t) = 5.6–7.6, TDM2 = 620–460 Ma), indicate absence of significant reduced sedimentary contamination and the source of juvenile lower crust. Slightly decreasing Fe3+/ΣFe ratios from biotite and amphibole to whole rock indicate decreasing oxygen fugacity during magma crystallization. Recalculated biotite compositions according to Fe3+/ΣFe ratios indicate fO2 values of less than Ni-NiO buffer (NNO) which show slightly lower values than that estimated according to zircon/melt distribution coefficients Ce anomalies (∼ΔNNO + 0.6). These values are consistent with the features of reduced porphyry Cu deposits. Crystallization of other mineral phases significantly affects the reliability of oxybarometer of zircon/melt distribution coefficients Eu anomalies and Mn contents in apatite. This oxidation state suggests that only CO2 was present at the magmatic stage, and implies that CH4 formed during CO2 reduction occurring later hydrothermal alteration. The alteration of primary amphibole to actinolite released Ti, Al, Fe, Mn, Na and K to the fluid with later precipitation of titanite, albite and minor ilmenite and magnetite during actinolite alteration. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Baogutu reduced porphyry Cu deposit; In situ apatite Nd isotope; LA-(MC)-ICPMS; Mössbauer spectroscopy; Oxygen fugacity","Apatite; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Clay alteration; Copper deposits; Deposits; Electron probe microanalysis; Europium compounds; Exploratory geochemistry; Feldspar; Ilmenite; Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; Isotopes; Laser ablation; Magnesium; Manganese; Mass spectrometers; Mass spectrometry; Mica; Minerals; Neodymium; Ores; Petrology; Phosphate minerals; Rare earth compounds; Rare earth elements; Rare earths; Silicate minerals; Structural geology; Trace elements; Zircon; Crystallization conditions; Distribution coefficient; Hydrothermal alterations; Light rare earth elements; Nd isotopes; Oxygen fugacity; Porphyry-cu deposits; Ssbauer spectroscopies; Europium; copper; crystallization; fugacity; granitoid; I-type rock; ilmenite; inductively coupled plasma method; mineralogy; Mossbauer spectroscopy; ore deposit; oxygen; petrogenesis; porphyry; China; Junggar Basin; Xinjiang Uygur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014817054

The results demonstrate that the effect of residential self-selection also exists in Chinese cities, influencing residents’ choice of living environments and ultimately affecting their commute trip CO2 emissions. After controlling for the effect of residential self-selection, built environment variables still have significant effects on CO2 emissions from commuting although some are indirect effects that work through mediating variables (car ownership and commuting trip distance). Specifically, CO2 emissions are negatively affected by land-use mix, residential density, metro station density and road network density. Conversely, bus stop density, distance to city centers and parking availability near the workplace have positive effects on CO2 emissions. To promote low carbon travel, intervention on the built environment would be effective and necessary. © 2017","Built environment; China; CO2 emissions; Commuting trip; Residential self-selection; structural equations model (SEM)","Carbon; Housing; Land use; Motor transportation; Search engines; Subway stations; Built environment; China; Commuting trip; Residential self-selection; Structural equations modeling (SEM); Carbon dioxide; car ownership; carbon emission; commuting; human activity; residential location; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014111308

In Spain, despite being a country with enormous potential for this renewable energy source, little is being done to exploit it, and policies of recent years have even restricted its implementation. These factors constitute an obstacle, both for achieving environmental commitments and for socioeconomic development. This study proposes the installation of PV systems on greenhouses in southeast Spain, the location with the highest concentration of greenhouses in Europe. Following a sensitivity analysis, it is estimated that the utilization of this technology in the self-consumption scenario at farm level produces increased profitability for farms, which can range from 0.88% (worst scenario) to 52.78% (most favorable scenario). Regarding the Spanish environmental policy, the results obtained demonstrate that the impact of applying this technology mounted on greenhouses would bring the country 38% closer to reaching the 2030 greenhouse gas (GHG) target. Furthermore, it would make it possible to nearly achieve the official commitment of 20% renewable energies by 2020. Additionally, it would have considerable effects on the regional socioeconomy, with increases in job creation and contribution to gross domestic product (GDP)/R&D (Research and Development), allowing greater profitability in agrifood activities throughout the entire region. © 2017 by the authors.

Here, an online system of curb parking space reservations is proposed. Reservations eliminate the uncertainties that lead to cruising, and by designing the system within the new paradigm of parking planning and management, transport policy objectives of equity and sustainability can be pursued. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, a case study in Lisbon was conducted. Firstly, cruising for parking was assessed, and showed a daily average of 10% of observed traffic to be cruising, in an area with several transit alternatives. Then, potential demand for the reservations service was also addressed. Next, a model of traffic and cruising behavior was developed and calibrated with the observed data, and a stochastic discrete-event micro-simulator was implemented and validated. Finally, simulations were used to compare scenarios of variable allocation of parking spaces to reservations.

Hence, for this study we explore potential interactions between forest carbon-storage and peacebuilding efforts, with Colombia as a case study. Spatial associations between biomass carbon and three conflict-related variables suggest that such interactions may exist. Nonetheless, while priority areas for carbon-focused conservation are presumably those at highest risks of deforestation, our research indicates that forests with lower risk of deforestation are typically those affected by armed-conflict.

The focus on this object has produced a number of high-cadence transit observations using high-resolution optical spectrographs. Here we present an analysis of seven full Hα transits of HD 189733 b using HARPS on the 3.6 meter La Silla telescope and HIRES on Keck I, taken over the course of nine years from 2006 to 2015. Hα transmission signals are analyzed as a function of the stellar activity level, as measured using the normalized core flux of the Ca ii H and K lines. We find strong variations in the strength of the Hα transmission spectrum from epoch to epoch. However, there is no clear trend between the Ca ii core emission and the strength of the in-transit Hα signal, although the transit showing the largest absorption value also occurs when the star is the most active. We present simulations of the in-transit contrast effect and find that the planet must consistently transit active latitudes with very strong facular and plage emission regions in order to reproduce the observed line strengths. We also investigate the measured velocity centroids with models of planetary rotation and show that the small line profile velocities could be due to large velocities in the upper atmosphere of the planet. Overall, we find it more likely that the measured Hα signals arise in the extended planetary atmosphere, although a better understanding of active region emission for active stars such as HD 189733 is needed. © 2017.

The pathway allows both, to provide the tricarboxylic acid cycle with pyruvate molecules produced from alternative substrates to glucose and, to generate reducing equivalents necessary for the operation of NADPH requiring processes. At the cellular level, pyruvate recycling involves the activity of malic enzyme, or the combined activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and pyruvate kinase, as well as of those transporters of the inner mitochondrial membrane exchanging the corresponding intermediates. Its cellular localization between the neuronal or astrocytic compartments of the in vivo brain has been controversial, with evidences favoring either a primarily neuronal or glial localizations, more recently accepted to occur in both environments.

Understanding this variation is important, as pastures may be a net GHG source or sink depending on these factors. We quantified carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes from subtropical pastures in south Florida for three wet-dry seasonal cycles using eddy covariance, and estimated two annual budgets of CO2, CH4, and GHG equivalent emissions. We also estimated the impact of water retention practices on pasture GHG emissions and assessed the impact of these emissions on stakeholder payments for water retention services in a carbon market framework. The pastures were net CO2 sinks sequestering up to 163 ± 54 g CO2-C·m-2·yr-1 (mean ± 95% CI), but were also strong CH4 sources emitting up to 23.5 ± 2.1 g CH4-C·m-2·yr-1. Accounting for the increased global warming potential of CH4, the pastures were strong net GHG sources emitting up to 584 ± 78 g CO2-C eq.·m-2·yr-1, and all CO2 uptake was offset by wet season CH4 emissions from the flooded landscape. Our analysis suggests that CH4 emissions due to increased flooding from water management practices is a small component of the pasture GHG budget, and water retention likely contributes 2-11% of net pasture GHG emissions. These emissions could reduce water retention payments by up to ~12% if stakeholders were required to pay for current GHG emissions in a carbon market. It would require at least 93.7 kg CH4-C emissions per acre-foot water storage (1 acre-foot = 1233.48 m3) for carbon market costs to exceed water retention payments, and this scenario is highly unlikely as we estimate current practices are responsible for 11.3 ± 7.2 kg CH4-C emissions per acre-foot of water storage. Our results demonstrate that water retention practices aimed at reducing nutrient loading to the Everglades are likely only responsible for a minor increase in pasture GHG emissions and would have a small economic consequence in a carbon market. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America.","carbon dioxide; eddy covariance; Everglades; Florida ranchlands; greenhouse gas budget; water retention","agricultural emission; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; ecosystem service; eddy covariance; gas exchange; greenhouse gas; methane; pasture; source-sink dynamics; subtropical region; water management; water retention; Everglades; Florida [United States]; United States; carbon dioxide; methane; agriculture; analysis; animal; animal husbandry; bovine; Florida; grassland; greenhouse gas; procedures; water conservation; Agriculture; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Carbon Dioxide; Cattle; Conservation of Water Resources; Florida; Grassland; Greenhouse Gases; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020198034

In this study, the applicability of the Laio soil moisture stochastic model on a typical plantation Pinus tabuliformis forestland on the Loess Plateau was studied. On the basis of data concerning soil properties, climate, and plants of the typical forestland during the period 2005-2015 in the Chinese National Ecosystem Research Network (Ji County Station) in Ji County, Shanxi, model results were acquired and compared with observed soil moisture from 2005 to 2015 in the study area. The genetic algorithm method was used to optimize model parameters in the calibration process. In the calibration and validation periods, the relative error between numerical characteristics of simulated and observed soil moisture values was mostly within 10%, and model evaluation index J was close to 1, indicating that the Laio model had good applicability in the study area. When calibrating the model, it was recommended to use soil moisture data with a sampling interval of no more than 10 days so as to reduce the loss of soil moisture fluctuation information. In the study area, the Laio model was strongly sensitive to variations of input parameters, including maximum evapotranspiration rate Emax, average rainfall depth a, and average rainfall frequency λ, which should be paid more attention for stable and reliable simulation results. This study offers a method to obtain soil moisture data at ungauged sites.

Both mitigation and adaptation measures are therefore required for the design and construction of low-income housing to encourage low carbon development and improve resilience to disasters. As self-help housing—the common type of housing for the urban poor in developing countries—is usually built by ordinary people with participatory approach, it is crucial to develop a low-carbon and disaster-resilient assessment tool for assisting them in making informed decisions during planning process. The objective of this article is to propose a new approach for developing a low-carbon and disaster-resilient assessment tool for self-help housing (LoDAT-SH) by combining opinions from experts and community residents to assign weights, identify indicators, and establish benchmarks with the aim to develop a simple, relevant, and practical tool for non-expert users like self-help residents. The application of the proposed methodology to a case study of a developing country, Thailand, shows the ability of LoDAT-SH, which contains 45 indicators in the four categories of low carbon development, disaster resilience, community participation, and financial consideration, in enabling self-help residents to assess the performance of their housing design, identify potential measures to create a low-carbon and disaster-resilient housing, and prioritize such actions. To support the creation of a low-carbon and disaster-resilient housing as the mitigation and adaptation strategy for urban development at the global level, the study suggests that the methodology of LoDAT-SH should be replicated to develop a more comprehensive assessment tool applicable for the use in self-help housing design in other developing countries, which will house about 900 million of the urban poor by 2020. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Assessment tool; Disaster resilience; Low carbon development; Self-help housing","carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; decision making; developing world; disaster; environmental assessment; participatory approach; performance assessment; project design; self help; urban development; vulnerability; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018730610

However, most DGVMs do not yet have detailed representations of permafrost and non-permafrost peatlands, which are an important store of carbon, particularly at high latitudes. We demonstrate a new implementation of peatland dynamics in a customized ""Arctic"" version of the LPJ-GUESS DGVM, simulating the long-term evolution of selected northern peatland ecosystems and assessing the effect of changing climate on peatland carbon balance. Our approach employs a dynamic multi-layer soil with representation of freeze-thaw processes and litter inputs from a dynamically varying mixture of the main peatland plant functional types: mosses, shrubs and graminoids. The model was calibrated and tested for a sub-Arctic mire in Stordalen, Sweden, and validated at a temperate bog site in Mer Bleue, Canada. A regional evaluation of simulated carbon fluxes, hydrology and vegetation dynamics encompassed additional locations spread across Scandinavia. Simulated peat accumulation was found to be generally consistent with published data and the model was able to capture reported long-term vegetation dynamics, water table position and carbon fluxes. A series of sensitivity experiments were carried out to investigate the vulnerability of high-latitude peatlands to climate change. We found that the Stordalen mire may be expected to sequester more carbon in the first half of the 21st century due to milder and wetter climate conditions, a longer growing season, and the CO2 fertilization effect, turning into a carbon source after mid-century because of higher decomposition rates in response to warming soils. © Author(s) 2017.",,"carbon balance; climate variation; freeze-thaw cycle; Holocene; mire; peatland; permafrost; vegetation dynamics; water table; Canada; Mer Bleue; Ontario [Canada]; Scandinavia; Bryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019649453

The key transcriptional regulator, CIA5, affects expression of thousands of genes in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, but the molecular characteristics of this important protein are poorly understood. This study identifies a functional activation domain in CIA5 and demonstrates the functionality of a mini-CIA5 including only the zinc-binding domain and the identified activation domain. A highly conserved 130aa region from CIA5 exhibits auto-activation in yeast and appears responsible for the markedly slow migration of CIA5 when analyzed by SDS-PAGE. This 130aa region or either half of this region also effectively replaced the activation domain of a modified designer Transcription Activator-like Element (dTALE) in targeted activation of an endogenous Chlamydomonas gene. Additionally, a mini-CIA5 combining the conserved zinc-binding domain with the 130aa putative activation domain complemented the growth phenotype of the cia5 mutant and triggered CO2-regulated gene expression patterns similar to wild-type cells or cia5 complemented with the full-length CIA5. Although the mini-CIA5 complementation did not fully restore wild-type growth rates or full gene induction/repression amplitudes, especially in very low CO2, this newly identified activation domain combined with the previously described zinc-binding domain are demonstrated to be the key essential components of CIA5 that permit rapid CIA5-mediated responses to changes in CO2 concentrations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Activation Domain; Chlamydomonas; CIA5; CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM); recombinant mini-CIA5",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016610996

After the new demarcation of administrative areas, the influx and construction of industrial zones and commercial buildings has caused a major change of the original landscape in the Dadu hill area in Taichung City, Taiwan. The aims of this study are to provide recommendations pertaining the design of ecological corridors to improve the connectivity of the remaining green places, and the assessment of the health of habitat for the developed urban area. We compared the biodiversity (birds, mammals, plantation) and carbon flux in three different suburban areas including a campus, a metropolitan park and an undeveloped woodland in regular disturbance by human and fire. According to the results of habitat similarity, the metropolitan park and campus were grouped with the higher diversity of birds, but the woodland had the higher diversity of plantation and mammals. Seasonal change is the main factor which affects the carbon flux and vegetation growth situation, and the disturbance by human activities and canopy and coverage by plantation are the causes of fluctuations. The habitat assessment which integrated the biodiversity and carbon flux provided another angle to evaluate the greenbelt design comprehensively.

In this study, five different tree species were assessed for this function. Kerria japonica, Sophora japonica, Philadelphus pekinensis, Gleditsia sinensis, and Prunus persica 'Atropurpurea' were tested in a deposition chamber using (NH) SO particles. We quantified and compared the capability of all tested trees to remove particles by assessing deposition velocity, a measure of the ability to remove particles. When placed in the deposition chamber, S. japonica had the greatest deposition velocity, followed by Philadelphus pekinensis, G. sinensis, Prunus persica 'Atropurpurea,' and K. japonica, in descending order. In addition, the comparison of deposition velocities among these species suggested that certain leaf geometries and surface characteristics of broadleaf trees, such as trichomes and grooves, increased particle capture. However, these results change under a different simulation condition using ambient air, suggesting that some trees actually increase pollutant number concentrations more than reduce particle concentration. This outcome can be explained by the aerodynamic effect of trees exceeding the filtering capacity of vegetation under some conditions. This highlights the difficulty of generalizing species selection criteria for practice use. Accordingly, our results indicate that using vegetation to reduce particle pollution and improve the air quality is not a universally advisable and viable solution. © 2017 Chen et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"air quality; ambient air; concentration (parameters); filtration; geometry; Gleditsia; nonhuman; particulate matter; peach; pollutant; quantitative study; simulation; Sophora japonica; species; trichome; vegetation; velocity; algorithm; analysis; chemistry; computer simulation; environmental monitoring; indoor air pollution; particle size; plant; plant leaf; procedures; quantitative trait; theoretical model; particulate matter; Air Pollution, Indoor; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Environmental Monitoring; Models, Theoretical; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Plant Leaves; Plants; Quantitative Trait, Heritable",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019650473

Materials and methods: Medline, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases were searched until 9 April 2015 using the following terms: laser, carbon dioxide/CO2, facial wrinkles, rhytides and erbium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet/erbium:YAG/Er:YAG. Two-armed controlled split faced studies that compared CO2 laser and erbium:YAG laser in patients with mild-to-moderate facial wrinkles or rhytides were included. Results: The pooled data in this study and findings of other studies support the greater efficacy with the CO2 laser in improving facial wrinkles, but the erb:YAG laser was associated with a better complication profile compared with the CO2 laser. Except one case of hypopigmentation, other complications (i.e., erythema, hyperpigmentation and crusting) and their rates were reported by studies examining both lasers.

Increasing evidence has shown that exposure to ambient fine particles (PM2.5) is associated with abnormal fetal development. However, its long-term metabolic effects on offspring have not been systematically investigated. Results: To determine if maternal exposure to PM2.5 programs offspring obesity, female C57Bl/6j mice were exposed to filtered air (FA) or concentrated ambient PM2.5 (CAP) during pre-conception, pregnancy, and lactation, and the developmental and metabolic responses of offspring were assessed. The growth trajectory of offspring revealed that maternal exposure to CAP significantly decreased offspring birth weight but increased body weight of adult male but not female offspring, and the latter was expressed as increased adiposity. These adult male offspring had increased food intake, but were sensitive to exogenous leptin. Their hypothalamic expression of Socs3 and Pomc, two target genes of leptin, was not changed, and the hypothalamic expression of NPY, an orexigenic peptide that is inhibited by leptin, was significantly increased. These decreases in central anorexigenic signaling were accompanied by reduced plasma leptin and its expression in adipose tissues, the primary source of circulating leptin. In contrast, maternal exposure did not significantly change any of these indexes in adult female offspring. Pyrosequencing demonstrated that the leptin promoter methylation of adipocytes was significantly increased in CAP-exposed male but not female offspring. Conclusions: Our data indicate that maternal exposure to ambient PM2.5 programs obesity in male offspring probably through alterations in the methylation of the promoter region of the leptin gene. © 2017 The Author(s).","Developmental programing; DNA methylation; Leptin; Maternal exposure to PM2.5; Obesity","leptin; nuclear factor Y; proopiomelanocortin; suppressor of cytokine signaling 3; leptin; neuropeptide Y; proopiomelanocortin; Socs3 protein, mouse; suppressor of cytokine signaling 3; adipocyte; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; body weight; controlled study; female; food intake; gene expression; leptin gene; limit of quantitation; male; maternal exposure; maternal obesity; mouse; nonhuman; Npy gene; particulate matter; Pomc gene; priority journal; progeny; promoter region; protein blood level; pyrosequencing; signal transduction; Socs3 gene; administration and dosage; age; animal; birth weight; blood; body weight gain; C57BL mouse; chemically induced; comparative study; DNA methylation; eating; feeding behavior; gene expression regulation; genetics; gestational age; hypothalamus; lactation; metabolism; obesity; particulate matter; pathophysiology; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; risk assessment; sex factor; toxicity; Adipocytes; Adiposity; Age Factors; Animals; Birth Weight; DNA Methylation; Eating; Feeding Behavior; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gestational Age; Hypothalamus; Lactation; Leptin; Male; Maternal Exposure; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neuropeptide Y; Obesity; Particulate Matter; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Pro-Opiomelanocortin; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Risk Assessment; Sex Factors; Signal Transduction; Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021217119

The critical synthesis factors, including reduction temperature, phosphorus/nickel ratio, pH, and sucrose amount were systematically investigated. Remarkably, the carbon serves as a reducer and plays a determinative role in the transformation of Ni2P2O7 into Ni2P/C. The synthesis strategy is divided into four distinguishable stages: (1) hydrothermal preparation of Ni3(PO4)2·8H2O precursor for stabilizing P sources; (2) dimerization of Ni3(PO4)2·8H2O into more thermal stable Ni2P2O7 amorphous phase along with the generation of NiO; (3) carbothermal reduction and phosphidation of NiO into NixPy (0 ≤ y/x ≤ 0.5); and (4) further phosphidation of mixed-phase NixPy and carbothermal reduction of Ni2P2O7 into single-phase Ni2P. The resultant Ni2P, the highly active phase in electrocatalysis, was applied as counter electrode in a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). The DSSC based on Ni2P with 10.4 wt.% carbon delivers a power conversion efficiency of 9.57%, superior to that of state-of-the-art Pt-based cell (8.12%).

The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between coaching style and attitudes toward doping among Chinese athletes. The potential mediating role of moral disengagement was examined. Participants were 203 athletes (Mean age= 19.0 years, 36.9% females) from the Fujian Provincial Sports Team, China. Athletes’ perception of autonomy-supportive and controlling coaching style was assessed using the adapted Health Care Climate Questionnaire and the Coach Controlling Behaviors Scale, respectively. Moral disengagement in sport was assessed using a scale developed by the authors. The Performance Enhancement Attitude Scale was adapted to measure athletes’ attitudes toward doping. Structural equation modelling was used to establish to assess the mediation effects. The results from structural equation model testing showed that autonomy-supportive coaching style had no direct effect on attitudes toward doping, and the indirect path through moral disengagement was also not significant. Controlling coaching style had an indirect and positive effect on attitudes toward doping through moral disengagement. Results indicated that controlling coaching style was positively associated with attitudes toward doping among Chinese athletes. The relationship was mediated by moral disengagement. Autonomy-supportive coaching style was not associated with attitudes toward doping. The findings provided evidence supporting the important role of moral disengagement in mediating the positive relationship between controlling coaching style and attitudes toward doping among Chinese athletes. The findings indicated that avoiding construction of controlling coaching climate and reducing moral disengagement in sport may be relevant for reducing athletes’ pro-doping attitudes. © The Author(s) 2017.","Anti-doping; Autonomy support; Motivational climate",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022335841

However, direct comparisons between biochar, torrefied biomass, and straw on both labile and recalcitrant soil organic matter (SOM) remain poorly understood. In this study, we explored the impact of biochars produced at different temperatures and torrefied biomass on the simple C substrates (glucose, amino acids), plant residues (Lolium perenne L.), and native SOM breakdown in soil using a 14C labeling approach. Torrefied biomass and biochars produced from wheat straw at four contrasting pyrolysis temperatures (250, 350, 450, and 550 °C) were incorporated into a sandy loam soil and their impact on C turnover compared to an unamended soil or one amended with unprocessed straw. Biochar, torrefied biomass, and straw application induced a shift in the soil microbial community size, activity, and structure with the greatest effects in the straw-amended soil. In addition, they also resulted in changes in microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) leading to more substrate C being partitioned into catabolic processes. While overall the biochar, torrefied biomass, and straw addition increased soil respiration, it reduced the turnover rate of the simple C substrates, plant residues, and native SOM and had no appreciable effect on the turnover rate of the microbial biomass. The negative SOM priming was positively correlated with biochar production temperature. We therefore ascribe the increase in soil CO2 efflux to biochar-derived C rather than that originating from SOM. In conclusion, the SOM priming magnitude is strongly influenced by both the soil organic C quality and the biochar properties. In comparison with straw, biochar has the greatest potential to promote soil C storage. However, straw and torrefied biomass may have other cobenefits which may make them more suitable as a CO2 abatement strategy. © 2016 The Authors.

An unprecedented outbreak happened in Guangzhou, China in 2014, which contributed 52 percent of all dengue cases that occurred in mainland China between 1990 and 2015. Our previous analysis, based on a deterministic model, concluded that the early timing of the first imported case that triggered local transmission and the excessive rainfall thereafter were the most important determinants of the large final epidemic size in 2014. However, the deterministic model did not allow us to explore the driving force of the early local transmission. Here, we expand the model to include stochastic elements and calculate the successful invasion rate of cases that entered Guangzhou at different times under different climate and intervention scenarios. The conclusion is that the higher number of imported cases in May and June was responsible for the early outbreak instead of climate. Although the excessive rainfall in 2014 did increase the success rate, this effect was offset by the low initial water level caused by interventions in late 2013. The success rate is strongly dependent on mosquito abundance during the recovery period of the imported case, since the first step of a successful invasion is infecting at least one local mosquito. The average final epidemic size of successful invasion decreases exponentially with introduction time, which means if an imported case in early summer initiates the infection process, the final number infected can be extremely large. Therefore, dengue outbreaks occurring in Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam in early summer merit greater attention, since the travel volumes between Guangzhou and these countries are large. As the climate changes, destroying mosquito breeding sites in Guangzhou can mitigate the detrimental effects of the probable increase in rainfall in spring and summer. © 2017 Cheng et al.",,"rain; adult; Article; China; climate; climate change; dengue; Dengue virus; disease surveillance; disease transmission; human; import disease; Malaysia; mathematical model; mosquito; mosquito control; nonhuman; seasonal variation; Singapore; temperature; Thailand; travel; Viet Nam; water availability; animal; climate change; dengue; epidemic; isolation and purification; season; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; travel; virology; Animals; China; Climate; Climate Change; Culicidae; Dengue; Dengue Virus; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Malaysia; Models, Theoretical; Seasons; Singapore; Thailand; Travel; Vietnam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021655993

Environmental implications of these non-biodegradable plastics in landfills raise major concerns. Use of biodegradable plastics is the best alternative as they are environmental friendly, with great recycling potential, and can be produced using renewable resources such as waste materials, methane (CH4) and simple carbon sources. Whilst the biodegradable plastics are eco-friendly, they pose a risk of emitting CH4 under anaerobic conditions in landfills. As a cradle-to-cradle approach, landfill CH4 could be effectively used for biodegradable plastic production by methanotrophs. This review briefly reviews approaches to plastic disposal, alternatives to plastic waste management and outlines issues arising. The focus of the review is to examine the potential for cost-effective production of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) using methanotrophs for manufacturing biodegradable plastics. The data input into this analysis is derived from Australian landfill CH4 emissions, the average PHB content of methanotrophs and applied to a case-scenario in Sydney, Australia. The results suggest that this approach to biodegradable plastic production can be economically viable and price-competitive with synthetic plastics. In our case study, landfills were sized small, medium and large (5,000, 35,000 and 230,000 t of waste per year, respectively). In small landfills, 162 t of CH4 can be recovered to produce 71 t of PHB per year, whilst in large landfills 7,480 t of CH4 can be recovered to produce 3,252 t of PHB. The cost of PHB production can be reduced to 1.5–2.0 AUD meeting the market value of synthetic plastic by increasing production volumes through building a centralised extraction and refinement facility suitable for large metropolitan cities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-plastics; Bioremediation; Greenhouse gas emission abatement; Methane; Methanotrophs; Polyhydroxyalkanoates","Biodegradable polymers; Bioremediation; Carbon; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Elastomers; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Methane; Plastic products; Recycling; Waste disposal; Waste management; Bio-plastics; Biodegradable plastics; Cost-effective production; Environmental implications; Environmental-friendly; Greenhouse gas emission abatements; Methanotrophs; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Plastics",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010647585

This paper aims to contribute to a more informed debate on the actual contribution to climate change in terms of GHG emissions of organic and conventional agriculture. For this purpose, the production process of an organic vs conventional wholemeal bread locally produced in central Italy by a small-medium bakery enterprise was compared and the carbon footprint (CF) was assessed by means of the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. We found that the CF of 1 kg of the conventional wholemeal bread was 24% less respect to the same organic bread, with 1,18 and 1,55 kg CO2eq respectively. On the contrary, if the CF is assessed per unit of cultivated area (hectare), wheat organic cultivation showed a better performance in terms of GHG emissions than conventional by 60%, with 1,15 and 2,87 Mg CO2eq ha−1 respectively. The higher CF per unit of organic product is due to the lower yield per unit of area cultivated with organic farming and to the consequent attribution to a smaller amount of products of the GHG emissions generated in the field phase of the life cycle. Whereas, the CF per hectare is higher when conventional practices are applied due to the higher use of raw materials (higher seed density, agrochemicals for fertilization and plant protection) respect to the same organic system. Results of the study demonstrate that organic farming for wheat cultivation in Italy is a low-carbon agriculture with a lower contribution to climate change in terms of GHG emissions per hectare respect to the conventional wheat cultivation, although implications of the reduced productivity and the consequent need of more cultivated land should be considered. However, more research is needed to better explore the potential of organic farming and to improve organic food production, optimizing the balance between the use of resources and yields, to ensure sufficient organic food supply at global level. A more comprehensive assessment of the actual GHG emitted in the atmosphere from both organic and conventional agricultural systems can be provided when the CF is assessed per unit of area, in addition to the CF per product unit, especially if also the carbon sink of the agrosystem is included. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bread; Carbon footprint (CF); Climate change; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Organic and conventional farming; Wheat cultivation","Agricultural chemicals; Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Cultivation; Food products; Food supply; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Seed; Sustainable development; Bread; Comprehensive assessment; Conventional agricultures; Environmental sustainability; Global warming and climate changes; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Low carbon agricultures; Organic and conventional farming; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018505955

The aim of this study was to investigate the miscibility of three- and four- component blends containing pyrolysis oil, 1-butanol, biodiesel (RME) and/or marine gas oil (MGO). The ideal blend would be a stable homogenous product with a minimum amount of butanol, whilst maximising the amount of pyrolysis oil. A successful blend would have properties suitable for use in marine engines. In order to successfully utilise a marine fuel blend in commercial vessels it should meet minimum specification requirements such as a flash point ≥60°C. Blends of pyrolysis oil, RME, MGO and 1-butanol were evaluated and characterised. The mixed blends were inspected after 48 hours for homogeneity and the results plotted on a tri-plot phase diagram.

The Environment Protection Act (EPA) 1986 was enacted to implement India’s commitments as a signatory. The Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification of 1991 was made under the provisions of the EPA in order to protect coastal environments and social and livelihood security of fishing community. This paper assesses the effects of CRZ rules and violations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, which has experienced tremendous growth due to the rapid industrialization and urbanization. This process has led to the destruction of mangroves and other important species of fish which play a crucial role in sustaining the coastal ecology and urban biodiversity; high population density and uneven growth have exacerbated adverse environmental and socioeconomic consequences. The Koli (fishing community) in this region faces huge problems of survival and sustenance in small-scale fishing, due to the rampant commercial fishing by big trawlers and large-scale dumping of waste materials by the industries surrounding the vicinity into the sea. In small but significant ways, the fishing communities through their traditional commons-based resource management and livelihood systems protect the coastal ecology and help the cities in reducing their carbon footprints. On the basis of primary field research in Thane–Mulund Creek Bhandup, Chimbai, and Sewri, this paper attempts to assess CRZ violations taking place on coastal areas and is causing damage to the coastal ecology. The research specifically has focused on the particular fishing-related activities and spaces—such as: jetties, parking of boats, access to sea, weaving and drying of nets, landing grounds, drying and cleaning of fish that are more affected by encroachment of seashore area and by CRZ rules violations. It evaluates the actions taken by Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority and Bombay Municipal Corporation while implementing rules and making Integrated Coastal Zone Management plan for management of marine environment. It raises broader issues relating to the contradictions and complementarities involved in ICZM plans vis-a-vis management of biodiversity, within a larger context of rapid urbanization and demands for real estate growth. The paper argues that urban biodiversity management requires clear valuation of the long-term ecological and socioeconomic benefits of sustenance of coastal ecology and related livelihoods. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","CRZ violations; Environmental vulnerability; Sustainability; Urban development","biodiversity; coastal zone management; commercial activity; environmental impact; environmental legislation; fishing; population growth; resource management; socioeconomic status; sustainability; urban development; urban growth; vulnerability; India; Maharashtra; Mumbai; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961584018

However, imported cases from neighbouring endemic countries continue to sustain local parasite reservoirs and initiate transmission. As certain weather and climatic conditions may trigger or intensify malaria outbreaks, identification of areas prone to these conditions may aid decision-makers in deploying targeted malaria interventions more effectively. Methods: Malaria case-surveillance data for Swaziland were provided by Swaziland’s National Malaria Control Programme. Climate data were derived from local weather stations and remote sensing images. Climate parameters and malaria cases between 2001 and 2015 were then analysed using seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models and distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM). Results: The incidence of malaria in Swaziland increased between 2005 and 2010, especially in the Lubombo and Hhohho regions. A time-series analysis indicated that warmer temperatures and higher precipitation in the Lubombo and Hhohho administrative regions are conducive to malaria transmission. DLNM showed that the risk of malaria increased in Lubombo when the maximum temperature was above 30 °C or monthly precipitation was above 5 in. In Hhohho, the minimum temperature remaining above 15 °C or precipitation being greater than 10 in. might be associated with malaria transmission. Conclusions: This study provides a preliminary assessment of the impact of short-term climate variations on malaria transmission in Swaziland. The geographic separation of imported and locally acquired malaria, as well as population behaviour, highlight the varying modes of transmission, part of which may be relevant to climate conditions. Thus, the impact of changing climate conditions should be noted as Swaziland moves toward malaria elimination. © 2017 The Author(s).","Climate variations; Malaria elimination; Swaziland","behavior; climate; clinical study; disease model; human; malaria control; precipitation; remote sensing; Swaziland; time series analysis; weather; climate change; communicable disease control; incidence; malaria; nonlinear system; Swaziland; transmission; Climate; Climate Change; Communicable Disease Control; Humans; Incidence; Malaria; Nonlinear Dynamics; Swaziland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019998667

Despite numerous studies on CODH over the past decades, its catalytic mechanism is not yet fully understood. In the present combined spectroscopic and theoretical study, we report first evidences for a cyanate (NCO−) to cyanide (CN−) reduction at the C-cluster. The adduct remains bound to the catalytic center to form the so-called CN−-inhibited state. Notably, this conversion does not occur in crystals of the Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans CODH enzyme (CODHIICh), as indicated by the lack of the corresponding CN− stretching mode. The transformation of NCO−, which also acts as an inhibitor of the two-electron-reduced Cred2 state of CODH, could thus mimic CO2 turnover and open new perspectives for elucidation of the detailed catalytic mechanism of CODH. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, it is generally thought that benefits of mitigation are hidden by internal climate variability until later in the century. Here we show that if the likelihood of extremely hot seasons is considered, the benefits of mitigation emerge more quickly than previously thought. It takes less than 20 years of emissions reductions in many regions for the likelihood of extreme seasonal warmth to reduce by more than half following initiation of mitigation. Additionally we show that the latest possible date at which the probability of extreme seasonal temperatures will be halved through emissions reductions consistent with the 2 °C target is in the 2040s. Exposure to climate risk is therefore reduced markedly and rapidly with substantial reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, demonstrating that the early mitigation needed to limit eventual warming below potentially dangerous levels benefits societies in the nearer term not just in the longer-term future. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

In this context, the objective of this work was to determine the yield potential and biomass quality of 12 different perennial grasses, under rain-fed conditions in Fargo, ND. The highest yielding species was tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum) at 11.3 Mg·ha-1 dry matter, and the lowest yielding species was little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) at 4.0 Mg·ha-1 DM. Biomass quality varied among grasses and harvest date. Generally, ash content was higher in the second harvest. Lignin content was similar between cuts except in western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii). Hemicellulose content was higher in the first harvest for both smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis) and meadow bromegrass (Bromus biebersteinii). Cellulose content was generally higher in the second cut for most species,with the exception of sideoats gramma (Bouteloua cutipendula) and intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium) which were higher in the first cut.

Considering the impact of these factors, a stated preference survey approach is adopted to analyze household future preferences for gasoline, hybrid electric, and battery electric vehicles in a dynamic marketplace. The stated choice experiment places respondents in a nine-year hypothetical time window with dynamically changing attributes including vehicle purchasing price, fuel economy, recharging range, and fuel price. A web-based survey was performed during 2014 in the state of Maryland. The collected data include household social-demographics, primary vehicle characteristics, and vehicle purchasing preferences of 456 respondents during the year of 2014–2022. Mixed Multinomial logit (MMNL) models are employed to predict vehicle preferences based on households’ socio-demographics and vehicle characteristics. The estimation results show that young people are more likely to buy vehicles with new technology, especially battery electric vehicles (BEV). Women with a high education level (bachelor degree or higher) prefer to choose hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) while men with a high education level are more likely to buy BEV. The estimated vehicle market elasticities with respect to vehicle price are from −1.1 to −1.8 for HEV and BEV, higher than those for gasoline vehicles from −0.6 to −1.0. The vehicle market cross-elasticities estimated by MMNL models range from 0.2 to 0.6. In addition, willingness to pay (WTP) of vehicle characteristics estimated by MMNL models provide a good understanding of household future vehicle preferences. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"Automotive batteries; Battery electric vehicles; Behavioral research; Commerce; Elasticity; Energy utilization; Fuel economy; Gasoline; Population statistics; Surveys; Cross-elasticities; Estimation results; Reduce energy consumption; Stated choice experiments; Stated preference surveys; Stated preferences; Vehicle characteristics; Vehicle technology; Hybrid vehicles; educational attainment; electric vehicle; household survey; logit analysis; market conditions; technology adoption; willingness to pay; Maryland; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018762666

However, low adoption and use of these stoves in many settings has limited their benefits. We aimed to improve the understanding of improved stove use by describing the patterns and predictors of adoption of a semi-gasifier stove and processed biomass fuel intervention in southwestern China. Of 113 intervention homes interviewed, 79% of homes tried the stove, and the majority of these (92%) continued using it 5-10 months later. One to five months after intervention, the average proportion of days that the semi-gasifier stove was in use was modest (40.4% [95% CI 34.3-46.6]), and further declined over 13 months. Homes that received the stove in the first batch used it more frequently (67.2% [95% CI 42.1-92.3] days in use) than homes that received it in the second batch (29.3% [95% CI 13.8-44.5] days in use), likely because of stove quality and user training. Household stove use was positively associated with reported cooking needs and negatively associated with age of the main cook, household socioeconomic status, and the availability of substitute cleaner-burning stoves. Our results show that even a carefully engineered, multi-purpose semi-gasifier stove and fuel intervention contributed modestly to overall household energy use in rural China. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","adoption; China; household air pollution; solid fuel; stove stacking; uptake","Air pollution; Fuels; Heating; Pollution; adoption; China; Climate forcings; Household energy use; Local environments; Socio-economic status; Solid fuels; uptake; Stoves; advanced technology; atmospheric pollution; biofuel; biomass power; cooking appliance; energy use; heating; household energy; household survey; pollution control; rural area; socioeconomic status; solid; technology adoption; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025594328

Many of these faculty members are incorporating content related to climate change because climate change is arguably the biggest threat to global sustainability. However, the concept of sustainability is complex, interdisciplinary, and potentially difficult to teach. Further, students may feel paralyzed in the face of climate change. Thus, delivering a course that effectively covers the concept of sustainability while also empowering students to take action against climate change is difficult. The goal of this article is to describe a joint effort between four college courses in different disciplines that used service-learning projects focused on climate change as a tool to teach sustainability concepts. Although the four courses were rooted in different disciplines, they intentionally shared common components and assignments, including community service projects, shared readings and reflections, and a symposium that brought all students together. Eighty preproject and 77 postproject reflections were qualitatively analyzed for themes related to learning outcomes. The results demonstrate that students in these classes gained a more sophisticated understanding of climate change and how it affects their respective disciplines, as well as a newfound sense of personal responsibility and agency for addressing climate change. Service-learning is an increasingly popular pedagogy on college campuses. This article highlights how the pedagogy can be used as a tool for integrating climate change into courses from multiple disciplines to teach about sustainability and empower students. © 2017 National Association of Geoscience Teachers.","Interdisciplinary; Learning communities; Pedagogy; Student empowerment","climate change; empowerment; interdisciplinary approach; learning; qualitative analysis; student; sustainability; university sector",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020168558

The next generation of simulation models of forest response to climate change must build upon local observations of species interactions and growth along climatic gradients. We examined whether sugar maple (Acer saccharum) seedlings were disadvantaged with respect to soil nutrient uptake under coniferous canopies, as this species would need to migrate northward into conifer-dominated forests in response to climate change. An experimental design was applied to 3 sites, forming the largest possible latitudinal/climatic gradient for sugar maple in Quebec (Canada) and isolating the effect of conifer presence on its seedling’s nutritional status. We tested whether: (1) both soil and climate and (2) presence of conifers affected foliar nutrient levels of sugar maple seedlings. Climate and soil (through pH) strongly affected nutrient availability for sugar maple seedlings and predicted 63.7% of their foliar nutrient variability. When controlling for site effects, we found a significant negative effect of conifers on foliar Ca and Mg levels of maple seedlings, which can adversely affect their overall health and vigour. When considering projected modifications of the forest environment due to climate change, we suggest that northward migration of sugar maple will be negatively affected by the presence of conifers through reduced foliar nutrition. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Acer saccharum; calcium; ecological gradient; foliar nutrition; magnesium; seedlings; species interactions","boreal forest; calcium; coniferous tree; environmental gradient; interspecific interaction; leaf; magnesium; nutrient availability; nutrient uptake; nutritional status; soil nutrient; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; Acer; Acer saccharum; Coniferophyta; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990943454

New lakes can, thus, form in the future where overdeepenings in the beds of still-existing glaciers are becoming exposed. Such new lakes can be amplifiers of natural hazards to downstream populations, but also constitute tourist attractions, offer new potential for hydropower, and may be of interest for water management. Identification of sites where future lakes will possibly form is, therefore, an essential step to initiate early planning of measures for risk reduction and sustainable use as part of adaptation strategies with respect to impacts from climate change. In order to establish a corresponding knowledge base, a systematic inventory of glacier-bed overdeepenings and possible future lakes was compiled for the still glacierized parts of the Peruvian Andes using the 2003-2010 glacier outlines from the national glacier inventory and the SRTM DEM from the year 2000. The resulting inventory contains 201 sites with overdeepened glacier beds &gt;1 ha (104 m2) where notable future lakes could form, representing a total volume of about 260 million m3.

Discrete-return airborne laser scanning (ALS) is increasingly recognised as a high-quality technology for mapping tropical forest carbon, because it generates 3D point clouds of forest structure from which aboveground carbon density (ACD) can be estimated. Area-based models are state of the art when it comes to estimating ACD from ALS data, but discard tree-level information contained within the ALS point cloud. This paper compares area-based and tree-centric models for estimating ACD in lowland old-growth forests in Sabah, Malaysia. These forests are challenging to map because of their immense height. We compare the performance of (a) an area-based model developed by Asner and Mascaro (2014), and used primarily in the neotropics hitherto, with (b) a tree-centric approach that uses a new algorithm (itcSegment) to locate trees within the ALS canopy height model, measures their heights and crown widths, and calculates biomass from these dimensions. We find that Asner and Mascaro's model needed regional calibration, reflecting the distinctive structure of Southeast Asian forests. We also discover that forest basal area is closely related to canopy gap fraction measured by ALS, and use this finding to refine Asner and Mascaro's model. Finally, we show that our tree-centric approach is less accurate at estimating ACD than the best-performing area-based model (RMSE 18% vs 13%). Tree-centric modelling is appealing because it is based on summing the biomass of individual trees, but until algorithms can detect understory trees reliably and estimate biomass from crown dimensions precisely, areas-based modelling will remain the method of choice. © 2017 The Authors","Aboveground carbon density; Allometry; Biomass estimation; Image analysis; LiDAR; Object recognition; Power-law; Tree delineation; Tropical forests","Biology; Biomass; Carbon; Ecosystems; Image analysis; Laser applications; Mapping; Object recognition; Optical radar; Surface analysis; Tropics; Above-ground carbons; Allometry; Biomass estimation; Power-law; Tree delineations; Tropical forest; Forestry; aboveground biomass; algorithm; allometry; basal area; biomass allocation; canopy gap; forest ecosystem; image analysis; lidar; power law; tropical forest; understory; East Malaysia; Malaysia; Sabah",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016244233

Consequently, two policies, Grain for Green and Western Development Action were established by the Chinese government in response to the demand for ecological protection and economic development in the Loess Plateau. These policies are designed to increase forest cover, expand farmlands, and enhance soil and water conservation, while creating sustainable vegetation restoration. Perennial grasses have gained attention as bioenergy feedstocks due to their high biomass yields, low inputs, and greater ecosystem services compared to annual crops. Moreover, perennial grasses limit nutrient runoff and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and soil losses while sequestering carbon. Additionally, perennial grasses can generate economic returns for local farmers through producing bioenergy feedstock or forage on marginal lands. Here, we suggest a United States model energy crop, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) as a model crop to minimize land degradation and desertification and to generate biomass for energy on the Loess Plateau. © 2017 CAAS.

The spectra were processed with the STARLIGHT full spectral fitting code, and the emission lines measured in the residual spectra. The results are compared with non-interacting control spiral galaxies from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area survey. Merger-induced star formation is extended and recent, as revealed by the young ages (50-80 Myr) and high contributions to light of young stellar populations (50-90 per cent), in agreement with merger simulations in the literature. These early-stage mergers have positive central gradients of the stellar metallicity, with an averagẽ0.6 Z· Compared to non-interacting spirals, they have lower central nebular metallicity, and flatter profiles, in agreement with the gas inflow scenario.We find that they are dominated by star formation, although shock excitation cannot be discarded in some regions, where high velocity dispersion is found (170-200 km s-1). The average SFR in these earlystage mergers (23-32 M· yr-1) is enhanced with respect to main-sequence Sbc galaxies by factors of 6-9, slightly above the predictions from classical merger simulations, but still possible in about 15 per cent of major galaxy mergers, where U/LIRGs belong. © 2017 The Authors.","Evolution-galaxies; Interactions-galaxies; ISM-galaxies; Spectroscopic-galaxies; Star formation-galaxies; Stellar content; Techniques",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022202329

Current methods that predict climate-driven species' range shifts use ecological modelling without eco-evolutionary dynamics. Here we present an eco-evolutionary forecasting framework that combines niche modelling with individual-based demographic and genetic simulations. Applying our approach to four endemic perennial plant species of the Austrian Alps, we show that accounting for eco-evolutionary dynamics when predicting species' responses to climate change is crucial. Perennial species persist in unsuitable habitats longer than predicted by niche modelling, causing delayed range losses; however, their evolutionary responses are constrained because long-lived adults produce increasingly maladapted offspring. Decreasing population size due to maladaptation occurs faster than the contraction of the species range, especially for the most abundant species. Monitoring of species' local abundance rather than their range may likely better inform on species' extinction risks under climate change. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"abundance; adaptation; adult; alpine environment; bioclimatology; climate change; climate effect; demography; ecological modeling; evolutionary biology; extinction; extinction risk; forecasting method; perennial plant; population size; warming; adult; climate change; forecasting; genetic model; habitat; monitoring; muscle contractility; nonhuman; perennial plant; plant model; population size; progeny; simulation; species; warming; adaptation; computer simulation; ecosystem; evolution; metabolism; plant; population dynamics; species difference; theoretical model; time factor; Alps; Austria; Adaptation, Physiological; Biological Evolution; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Ecosystem; Models, Theoretical; Plants; Population Dynamics; Species Specificity; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019033994

Researchers have also reported significant photometric variability at three times the orbital frequency, as yet unexplained. Reflected phase variations of homogeneous planets only contain power at the orbital frequency and its even harmonics. We show that odd harmonics can, however, be produced by an edge-on planet with a time-variable map, or an inclined planet with a north-south (N-S) asymmetric map. For tidally locked planets with thick atmospheres, either of these scenarios entail weather: planets with zero obliquity experience N-S symmetric stellar forcing. North-south asymmetry would therefore suggest stochastic localized features, i.e. weather. However, we find that previous claims of large-amplitude odd modes in Kepler photometry are artefacts of removing planetary transits rather than modelling them. The only reliable claims of odd harmonics remain HAT-P-7b and Kepler-13Ab, for which the third mode amplitude is 6-8 per cent of the planetary flux. Although time-variable albedo maps could in principle explain these odd harmonics, upper-limits on the infrared variability of other hot Jupiters make this scenario unlikely. We recommend further studying the tidal effects of close-in planets on their host stars, as this remains the only plausible hypothesis. © 2016 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society","Planets and satellites: atmospheres; Stars: activity; Techniques: photometric",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039716218

To address the continuing and accelerating alterations that climate change is bringing to SESs, adaptive governance generally will require more flexibility than prior governance institutions have often allowed. However, to function as good governance, adaptive governance must pay real attention to the problem of how to balance this increased need for flexibility with continuing governance stability so that it can foster adaptation to change without being perceived or experienced as perpetually destabilizing, disruptive, and unfair. Flexibility and stability serve different purposes in governance, and a variety of tools exist to strike different balances between them while still preserving the governance institution’s legitimacy among the people governed. After reviewing those purposes and the implications of climate change for environmental governance, we examine psychological insights into the structuring of adaptive governance and the variety of legal tools available to incorporate those insights into adaptive governance regimes. Because the substantive goals of governance systems will differ among specific systems, we do not purport to comment on what the normative or substantive goals of law should be. Instead, we conclude that attention to process and procedure (including participation), as well as increased use of substantive standards (instead of rules), may allow an increased level of substantive flexibility to operate with legitimacy and fairness, providing the requisite levels of psychological, social, and economic stability needed for communities to adapt successfully to the Anthropocene. © 2017 by the author(s).","Adaptive governance; Balance; Due process; Equity; Fairness; Legitimacy; Nonequilibrium; Procedure; Resilience; Rule; Standard","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; environmental legislation; governance approach; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016806792

This process has a strong influence upon the production of hydrogen and methane, which can be subsequently consumed by microbial communities. The Santa Elena Ophiolite (SEO) on the northwestern Pacific coast of Costa Rica comprises ~250 km2 of ultramafic rocks and mafic associations. The climatic conditions, consisting of strongly contrasting wet and dry seasons, make the SEO a unique hydrogeological setting, where water-rock reactions are enhanced by large storm events (up to 200 mm in a single storm). Previous work on hyperalkaline spring fluids collected within the SEO has identified the presence of microorganisms potentially involved in hydrogen, methane, and methanol oxidation (such as Hydrogenophaga, Methylobacterium, and Methylibium spp., respectively), as well as the presence of methanogenic Archaea (such as Methanobacterium). Similar organisms have also been documented at other serpentinizing sites, however their functions have not been confirmed. SEO's hyperalkaline springs have elevated methane concentrations, ranging from 145 to 900 μM, in comparison to the background concentrations (<0.3 μM). The presence and potential activity of microorganisms involved in methane cycling in serpentinization-influenced fluids from different sites within the SEO were investigated using molecular, geochemical, and modeling approaches. These results were combined to elucidate the bioenergetically favorable methane production and/or oxidation reactions in this tropical serpentinizing environment. The hyperalkaline springs at SEO contain a greater proportion of Archaea and methanogens than has been detected in any terrestrial serpentinizing system. Archaea involved in methanogenesis and anaerobic methane oxidation accounted from 40 to 90% of total archaeal sequences. Genes involved in methanogenic metabolisms were detected from the metagenome of one of the alkaline springs. Methanogenic activities are likely to be facilitated by the movement of nutrients, including dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), from surface water and their infiltration into serpentinizing groundwater. These data provide new insight into methane cycle in tropical serpentinizing environments. © 2017 Crespo-Medina, Twing, Sánchez-Murillo, Brazelton, McCollom and Schrenk.","Bioenergetics; Metagenomics; Methane; Methanogenesis; Tropical serpentinization","carbon; ground water; hydrogen; methane; RNA 16S; stable isotope; archaeon; Article; bioenergy; cell count; Costa Rica; DNA extraction; environment; gene sequence; geochemical analysis; geochemistry; metagenomics; methanogenesis; Methylobacterium; nonhuman; oxidation; seashore; tropic climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019725477

This Focus article reviews expert and political commentary and analysis of the repeal, and provides an overview of the Abbott government's dismantling and attempted dismantling of other climate initiatives. It reviews commentary and critiques of the government's substitute Direct Action (DA) policy and its capacity to reduce emissions. The views of the international community on the Abbott government's repositioning of Australia's climate policy are considered, as are the prospects of achieving effective emissions reduction policy under Abbott's successor, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. The paper notes the role of the Senate in both assisting and frustrating government reforms, as well as aspects of policy continuity that could see a form of carbon pricing revived in future.

To gain a deeper understanding about these process links, we incubated a temperate paddy soil under submerged conditions with or without straw and fertilized with either 15N-enriched (99 atom% 15N) or non-enriched (NH4)2SO4. Notably, a change in community structure and a higher abundance of archaeal N2O reductase (arc-nosZ) genes in the no straw treatment was observed. This was attributed to NH4+ assimilation by N2O reducing archaea as was further corroborated by a considerable 15N-enrichment of archaeal glutamate dehydrogenase (gdhA) genes. Moreover, indications were found that denitrifying archaea controlled their chemotrophic and heterotrophic metabolisms in response to different availabilities of inorganic and organic N and C resources. However, in the presence of straw, bacterial nosZ genes may have also contributed to the completion of denitrification. Our results suggest that N assimilation contributes to the last step of archaeal denitrification. Likewise, archaea may play a key role in regulating major N fluxes in fertilized paddy soils, especially in the absence of rice straw. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","15N-DNA-based stable isotope probing; arc-nosZ gene; gdhA gene; total prokaryotic nosZ clade I gene","abundance; agricultural soil; ammonium compound; bacterium; community dynamics; denitrification; gene; immobilization; metabolism; microbial activity; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen isotope; nitrogen oxides; nitrous oxide; paddy field; resource availability; soil nitrogen; stable isotope; straw; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Prokaryota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019727850

Household air pollution has been found to increase risk of pneumonia, especially due to exposure from dirty burning biomass fuels. It has been suggested that advanced stoves, which burn fuel more efficiently and reduce smoke emissions, may help to reduce household air pollution in poor, rural settings. This qualitative study aims to provide an insight into the household costs and perceived benefits from use of the stove in Malawi. It was conducted alongside The Cooking and Pneumonia Study (CAPS), the largest village cluster-level randomised controlled trial of an advanced combustion cookstove intervention to prevent pneumonia in children under five to date. In 2015, using 100 semi-structured interviews this study assessed household time use and perceptions of the stove from both control and intervention participants taking part in the CAPS trial in Chilumba. Household direct and indirect costs associated with the intervention were calculated. Users overwhelming liked using the stove. The main reported benefits were reduced cooking times and reduced fuel consumption. In most interviews, the health benefits were not initially identified as advantages of the stove, although when prompted, respondents stated that reduced smoke emissions contributed to a reduction in respiratory symptoms. The cost of the stove was much higher than most respondents said they would be willing to pay. The stoves were not primarily seen as health products. Perceptions of limited impact on health was subsequently supported by the CAPS trial data which showed no significant effect on pneumonia. While the findings are encouraging from the perspective of acceptability, without innovative financing mechanisms, general uptake and sustained use of the stove may not be possible in this setting. The findings also raise the question of whether the stoves should be marketed and championed as ‘health interventions’. © 2017 The Authors","Benefits; Cookstoves; Economic costs; Malawi; Qualitative; Time savings","fuel; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; child health; combustion; cooking appliance; cost-benefit analysis; household survey; pneumonia; qualitative analysis; Article; biomass; combustion; controlled study; cooking; cookstove; cost; coughing; environmental impact assessment; general device; health hazard; household; human; indoor air pollution; kitchen; Malawi; perception; pneumonia; qualitative research; risk factor; smoke; adolescent; adult; aged; childhood mortality; devices; economics; equipment design; family size; health promotion; indoor air pollution; infant; middle aged; pneumonia; preschool child; prevention and control; procedures; questionnaire; rural population; standards; Malawi; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Air Pollution, Indoor; Biomass; Child Mortality; Child, Preschool; Cooking; Equipment Design; Family Characteristics; Health Promotion; Humans; Infant; Malawi; Middle Aged; Pneumonia; Qualitative Research; Rural Population; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018521552

We determined dissolved methane concentrations (n = 36) and δ13C and δ2H values (n = 31) in methane and groundwater from the 46,000-km2 Gippsland Basin in southeast Australia. The basin contains important water supply aquifers and is a potential target for future unconventional gas development. Dissolved methane concentrations ranged from 0.0035 to 30 mg/L (median = 8.3 mg/L) and were significantly higher in the deep Lower Tertiary Aquifer (median = 19 mg/L) than the shallower Upper Tertiary Aquifer (median = 3.45 mg/L). Groundwater δ13CDIC values ranged from −26.4 to −0.4 ‰ and were generally higher in groundwater with high methane concentrations (mean δ13CDIC = −9.5 ‰ for samples with &gt;3 mg/L CH4 vs. −16.2 ‰ in all others), which is consistent with bacterial methanogenesis. Methane had δ13CCH4 values of −97.5 to −31.8 ‰ and δ2HCH4 values of −391 to −204 ‰ that were also consistent with bacterial methane, excluding one site with δ13CCH4 values of −31.8 to −37.9 ‰, where methane may have been thermogenic. Methane from different regions and aquifers had distinctive stable isotope values, indicating differences in the substrate and/or methanogenesis mechanism. Methane in the Upper Tertiary Aquifer in Central Gippsland had lower δ13CCH4 (−83.7 to −97.5 ‰) and δ2HCH4 (−236 to −391 ‰) values than in the deeper Lower Tertiary Aquifer (δ13CCH4 = −45.8 to −66.2 ‰ and δ2HCH4 = −204 to −311 ‰). The particularly low δ13CCH4 values in the former group may indicate methanogenesis at least partly through carbonate reduction. In deeper groundwater, isotopic values were more consistent with acetate fermentation. Not all methane at a given depth and location is interpreted as being necessarily produced in situ. We propose that high dissolved sulphate concentrations in combination with high methane concentrations can indicate gas resulting from contamination and/or rapid migration as opposed to in situ bacterial production or long-term migration. Isotopes of methane and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) serve as further lines of evidence to distinguish methane sources. The study demonstrates the value of isotopic characterisation of groundwater including dissolved gases in basins containing hydrocarbons. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Gippsland; Groundwater; Isotopes; Methane; Methanogenesis; Unconventional gas","acetate; carbonate system; coal seam; dissolved inorganic carbon; fermentation; gas production; geochemical survey; groundwater resource; isotopic analysis; methane; methanogenesis; water supply; Australia; Gippsland Basin; Bacteria (microorganisms); ground water; methane; water pollutant; Australia; environmental monitoring; water pollutant; Australia; Environmental Monitoring; Groundwater; Methane; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982946463

Among the goals of the New York REV (Reforming the Energy Vision) proceeding launched in 2015 are a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels and a mandate for 50% of the state's electricity to be generated from renewable resources by 2030. In 2014, 25% of New York's electric generation was produced by renewables, of which 80% was from hydropower. In addition to these and other objectives, the New York Public Service Commission has identified the need to establish a distributed system platform provider (DSPP), which will facilitate new markets to accelerate adoption and realize the value of distributed energy resources (DERs). To do this, the incumbent utilities will perform the role of the DSPP and create and operate the distributed system platform (DSP).

Due to the diverse calculation methodologies cities use, inter-city emission reductions and climate action comparisons remain challenging. It is crucial to learn how cities address climate change mitigation and adaptation in terms of the emissions accounting methodologies they use, their links to existing city-level international emission standards, and the consistency of those methods used by cities to improve the quality of emissions standards. Normative case study method was applied to explore these issues in three different case cities: Helsinki (Finland), Stockholm (Sweden), and Copenhagen (Denmark). The current calculation methods used in these cities exclude many indirect emissions, and these cities have not adopted consumption-based emissions. Cities also face several dilemmas in system boundaries and baseline year setting, emissions factors calculations, and data collection methods using current calculation methods. All three case cities have adopted amendable emissions accounting systems which exclude certain amounts of emissions from several sectors. Therefore, emission calculation methods must be improved to include all possible sectors and to produce more robust and transparent calculation methods. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate strategies; Consumption-based emissions; Emissions reductions; Emissions sources; GHG accounting system",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021062816

After a period of abandon, due mainly to the spread of Portland concrete, this building technique has gained a new attention in the last decades, at least in a niche sector of self-builders. Indeed, the main issue that an engineer or an architect must face when he/she decides to build a straw bale house is the absence of certain data about technical performance. The aim of the present paper is to investigate a straw bale wall, both in laboratory and in situ, and to perform a Life Cycle Assessment to identify strong and weak points of this building technique. After a section reporting the state of the art of the main features of straw bale constructions, including the most important physical parameters that affect durability and indoor comfort conditions, the paper reports the results of laboratory measurements aimed at assessing the sound absorption coefficient with an impedance tube and thermal conductivity with a guarded hot plate apparatus. Then, results of in-situ measurements of thermal and sound insulation are reported. Data show that in winter (steady-state) conditions the investigated wall offers adequate thermal insulation, but the lightness of the structure can be detrimental for the summer (unsteady-state) season, leading to possible overheating in warm climates. Furthermore, the sound insulation is limited by the lightness of the structure. Finally, the Life Cycle Assessment demonstrates that the use of straw bales in walls is capable of reducing the energy and carbon embodied in the building. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Embodied energy; Life cycle assessment; Sound insulation; Straw bales; Sustainable building; Thermal insulation","Acoustic wave absorption; Buildings; Carbon; Environmental management; Insulation; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle; Sound insulating materials; Sustainable development; Thermal conductivity; Thermal insulation; Walls (structural partitions); Embodied energy; Environmental performance; Laboratory measurements; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Sound absorption coefficients; Straw bales; Sustainable building; Technical performance; Sound insulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017546291

It is closely related to the main global challenges namely: poverty mitigation, global environmental change and food and water security [1.]. Concentrating solar power (CSP) is steadily gaining more market acceptance as the cost of electricity from CSP power plants progressively declines. The cogeneration of electricity and water is an attractive prospect for future CSP developments as the simultaneous production of power and potable water can have positive economic implications towards increasing the feasibility of CSP plant developments [2.]. The highest concentrations of direct normal irradiation are located relatively close to Western coastal and Middle-Eastern North-African regions. It is for this reason worthwhile investigating the possibility of CSP-desalination (CSP+D) plants as a future sustainable method for providing both electricity and water with significantly reduced carbon emissions and potential cost reductions. This study investigates the techno-economic feasibility of integrating a low-temperature thermal desalination plant to serve as the condenser as opposed to a conventional dry-cooled CSP plant in Arandis, Namibia. It outlines the possible benefits of the integration CSP+D in terms of overall cost of water and electricity. The high capital costs of thermal desalination heat exchangers as well as the pumping of seawater far inland is the most significant barrier in making this approach competitive against more conventional desalination methods such as reverse osmosis. The compromise between the lowest levelized cost of electricity and water depends on the sizing and the top brine temperature of the desalination plant. © 2017 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023614144

In Niger, West Africa, farmers have always had to cope with irregularity and poor distribution of rainfall. In recent years, a variation in the frequency and duration of rainy season were observed, suddenly affecting a drop in agricultural productions with the resulting food crisis. Therefore, it is necessary to find measures to adapt to the climate variability. This study focus on the Tillabéri region (Niger) where pearl millet is one of the main agricultural product. In the last few years, variations in rainfall distribution and quantity have negatively influenced the yield of the millet crops. A climatic assessment of the region has been verified collecting information from both previous studies and satellite data. Two early improved varieties of pearl millet (SOSAT-C88 and HKP) drought resistant have been distributed to local farmers in 16 pilot areas of the Tillabéri region and the crop yields were compared to those of the local traditional variety cultivated in the same area.

Subjective assessments from those directly involved in the negotiations are particularly important, as this may influence strategy and future negotiation participation. Here we analyse the perceived success of the climate negotiations in a sample of 656 experts involved in international climate policy. Respondents were pessimistic when asked for specific assessments of the current approach centred on voluntary pledges, but were more optimistic when asked for general assessments of the outcomes and usefulness of the climate negotiations. Individuals who were more involved in the negotiation process tended to be more optimistic, especially in terms of general assessments. Our results indicate that two reinforcing effects are at work: a high degree of involvement changes individuals'perceptions and more optimistic individuals are more inclined to remain involved in the negotiations. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

More broadly, the characteristics of a MSW management system influence the end-of-life (EOL) impacts of goods consumed by households. We aim to indicate the extent to which greenhouse gas emissions from a MSW management system can be reduced by increasing waste paper recycling. We also address the stakeholders’ contribution for driving transition towards an improved scenario. Life cycle assessment (LCA) addresses the EOL impacts of the paper industry, driven by the characteristics of MSW management in Florianópolis, Brazil, by varying the level of stakeholders’ commitment through different recycling scenarios. The results show that 41% of the climate change impacts from waste paper management could be reduced when increasing the waste paper recycling rates and reducing waste paper landfilling. To achieve such emissions reduction, the industry contribution to the MSW management system would have to increase from 17% in the business-as-usual scenario to 74% in the target scenario. We were able to measure the differences in stakeholders’ contribution by modelling the MSW management system processes that are under the industry’s responsibility separately from the processes that are under the government’s responsibility, based on the Brazilian legal framework. The conclusions indicate that LCA can be used to support policy directions on reducing the impacts of MSW management by increasing resource recovery towards a circular economy. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Circular economy; end-of-life; life cycle assessment; municipal solid waste management; recycling; waste paper","Climate change; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Natural resources; Paper and pulp industry; Recycling; Solid wastes; Waste management; Waste paper; Circular economy; Climate change impact; Emissions reduction; End of lives; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Municipal solid waste (MSW); Natural resource use; Wastepaper recycling; Municipal solid waste; carbon emission; emission control; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; municipal solid waste; recycling; stakeholder; waste management; Article; Brazil; carbon footprint; government; greenhouse gas; human; legal aspect; life cycle assessment; municipal solid waste; paper industry; priority journal; recycling; solid waste management; waste disposal; climate change; greenhouse effect; solid waste; waste management; Economic Analysis; Evaluation; Life Cycle; Recycling; Solid Wastes; Waste Management; Waste Papers; Brazil; Florianopolis; Santa Catarina; Santa Catarina Island; Brazil; Climate Change; Greenhouse Effect; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018753238

Variable renewable energy (VRE) sources, such as wind and solar power, are currently showing rapid growth rates in power systems worldwide, and could also be important in future mitigation strategies. It is therefore important that the electricity sector and the integration of VRE are correctly represented in energy models. This paper presents an improved methodology for representing the electricity sector in the long-term energy simulation model TIMER using a heuristic approach to find cost optimal paths given system requirements and scenario assumptions. Regional residual load duration curves have been included to simulate curtailments, storage use, backup requirements and system load factor decline as the VRE share increases. The results show that for the USA and Western Europe at lower VRE penetration levels, backup costs form the major VRE cost markup. When solar power supplies more than 30% of the electricity demand, the costs of storage and energy curtailments become increasingly important. Storage and curtailments have less influence on wind power cost markups in these regions, as wind power supply is better correlated with electricity demand. Mitigation scenarios show an increasing VRE share in the electricity mix implying also increasing contribution of VRE for peak and mid load capacity. In the current scenarios, this can be achieved by at the same time installing less capital intensive gas fired power plants. Sensitivity analysis showed that greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector in the updated model are particularly sensitive to the availability of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and nuclear power and the costs of VRE. © 2017 The Authors","Curtailment and storage; Electricity system modelling; Global energy system simulation model; Integrated assessment modelling; Variable renewable energy","Carbon; Carbon capture; Climate change; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Electric industry; Electric power systems; Electric power utilization; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Heuristic methods; Nuclear fuels; Sensitivity analysis; Solar energy; Timing circuits; Wind power; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Climate change mitigation; Electricity system; Energy system simulations; Gas-fired power plants; Global energy; Integrated assessment modelling; Variable renewable energies; Renewable energy resources; carbon sequestration; computer simulation; electricity supply; heuristics; modeling; renewable resource; solar power; United States; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009784584

Some argue that the common treatment of biogenic carbon emissions as being carbon neutral in LCA is flawed. From this divergent perspective, biofuels have potential benefits only if additional atmospheric CO2 is captured or feedstocks that would otherwise quickly decompose (e.g. agricultural residues) are utilized. An alternative method, Annual Basis Carbon (ABC) accounting, has recently been demonstrated for a single ethanol facility comparing the year-over-year GHG impacts of the cropland supplying the facility, the fuel production processes (gasoline prior to construction and ethanol after), and vehicle tailpipe emissions. Our review of the ABC method identifies inconsistencies in the treatment of the non-fuel products: corn, soybeans, and distiller's dried grain solubles (DDGS). While these products are also consumed annually, the GHG emissions were not considered in evaluating the system performance. Furthermore, GHG impacts, both in terms of burdens from inputs and crop CO2 uptake, were not allocated to the products leaving the system. Thus in the initial state, the petroleum-fueled system received a substantial benefit from crop CO2 uptake, but none of the subsequent emission burdens associated with the consumption of non-fuel (i.e., food/feed) ‘exports’. In the final state, conversely, most biomass was combusted as ethanol and captured within the considered system. A system expansion is needed to better account for impacts. While concerns about the degree of carbon additionality have some merit, consequential LCA methods provide for more consistent and comprehensive approaches for evaluating biofuel GHG performance. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","additionality; biogenic carbon; GHG emissions; land-use change; life cycle assessment; system boundary","Agricultural wastes; Biofuels; Carbon dioxide; Crashworthiness; Crops; Ethanol; Fuels; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Additionality; GHG emission; Land-use change; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); System boundary; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012164095

The aim of this study is to identify crop adaptation options to face the expected changes in water availability by exploiting the existing intra-specific biodiversity of the tomato crop and accounting for irrigation management and the hydrological properties of soils. The biophysical dimension of crop adaptation is therefore addressed. A study is presented examining an irrigated district in southern Italy. Using as a climatic reference the period 1961–90 and as a future climate the period 2021–2050, a soil water availability indicator was determined by a soil water balance model, at optimal irrigation and at different deficit irrigation strategies, in 23 soil units. For five tomato cultivars, hydrological requirements were determined by means of yield response functions to soil water availability. Cultivar-specific hydrological requirements were evaluated against the soil water availability indicator to determine probabilities of adaptation of each cultivar. These cultivars are not currently being grown in the study area so their potential spatial distribution in the study area was estimated. For instance, with 60% of optimal irrigation, two cultivars were assessed as having probabilities of crop adaptation larger than 0.89, in 90% and 62% of the area. In the future climate, with limited water resources, a proper choice and combination of cultivars, irrigation strategies and soils would allow to maintain the current production system in a large part of the study area. © 2017 IAgrE","Climate change; Crop biodiversity; Deficit irrigation; Irrigation effectiveness; Potential cultivation area; Solanum lycopersicum L","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Fruits; Irrigation; Plants (botany); Soil moisture; Soils; Water management; Water resources; Deficit irrigation; Hydrological properties; Irrigation management; Potential cultivation area; Soil water availability; Soil water balance model; Solanum lycopersicum l; Sustainable agricultural; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014909774

A comparison of the three schools was done by content and thematic analysis of a within-case analysis. Data from the township school revealed that socioeconomic factors and organisational structure promote education for sustainable development. The farm school data revealed that health promotion can be managed within an environmental management system within a hierarchical school structure. The urban school data revealed that an economic inducement brings a school to realise that it can reduce its carbon footprint, gain financially and utilize its resources with innovation. A case is made that the four pillars of sustainable development (environment, society, economy, and governance) endorse education for sustainable development.

Recent observations and modeling studies have suggested that the ice sheet contribution to future sea level rise could have been underestimated in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. The ensuing freshwater discharge coming from ice sheets could have significant impacts on global climate, and especially on the vulnerable tropical areas. During the last glacial/deglacial period, megadrought episodes were observed in the Sahel region at the time of massive iceberg surges, leading to large freshwater discharges. In the future, such episodes have the potential to induce a drastic destabilization of the Sahelian agro-ecosystem. Using a climate modeling approach, we investigate this issue by superimposing on the Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 (RCP8.5) baseline experiment a Greenland flash melting scenario corresponding to an additional sea level rise ranging from 0.5 m to 3 m. Our model response to freshwater discharge coming from Greenland melting reveals a significant decrease of the West African monsoon rainfall, leading to changes in agricultural practices. Combined with a strong population increase, described by different demography projections, important human migration flows could be potentially induced.

Microalgae are unique photosynthetic organisms given that they accumulate storage lipids in substantial quantities and thrive in high-salinity water. Photosynthetic growth requires light, carbon dioxide (CO2), water, and inorganic salts. Temperature must remain generally within 20–30°C. During photosynthesis, algae use solar energy to fix CO2 into algal biomass, so the water used to cultivate algae must be enriched with CO2.

Biogeochemical models can extrapolate site-specificCH4 measurements to larger scales and predict responses of CH4 emissions to environmental changes. However, these models include considerable uncertainties and limitations in representing CH4 production, consumption, and transport processes. To improve predictions of CH4 transformations, we incorporated acetate and stable carbon (C) isotopic dynamics associated with CH4 cycling into a biogeochemistry model, DNDC. By including these new features, DNDC explicitly simulates acetate dynamics and the relative contribution of acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (AM and HM) to CH4 production, and predicts the C isotopic signature (δ13C) in soil C pools and emitted gases. When tested against biogeochemical and microbial community observations at two sites in a zone of thawing permafrost in a subarctic peatland in Sweden, the new formulation substantially improved agreement with CH4 production pathways and δ13C in emitted CH4 (δ13C-CH4), a measure of the integrated effects of microbial production and consumption, and of physical transport. We also investigated the sensitivity of simulated δ13C-CH4 to C isotopic composition of substrates and, to fractionation factors for CH4 production (αAM and αHM), CH4 oxidation (αMO), and plant-mediated CH4 transport (αTP). The sensitivity analysis indicated that the δ13C-CH4 is highly sensitive to the factors associated with microbial metabolism (αAM, αHM, and αMO). The model framework simulating stable C isotopic dynamics provides a robust basis for better constraining and testing microbial mechanisms in predicting CH4 cycling in peatlands. © 2017.

The experimental soil was sodic calcareous having Sawargaon series of isohyperthermic family of Vertic Haplustepts. The experiment was laid out in a randomized block design with nine treatments and three replications. The treatments consisted of varying doses of PBSW (100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 m3 ha−1), absolute control, farmyard manure (FYM) 5 t ha−1 + RDF-AST (recommended dose of fertilizer as per soil test), FYM 5 t ha−1 + 50% GR (gypsum requirement) + RDF-AST and FYM 5 t ha−1 + 100% GR + RDF-AST. The results revealed that the physical properties, namely bulk density and hydraulic conductivity, were improved in sodic soil due to the application of increased doses of PBSW. A significant reduction in pH, calcium carbonate and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) and an increase in organic carbon, cation-exchange capacity (CEC) and electrical conductivity (EC) were observed in the soil, due to the addition of PBSW. The available soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and micronutrient iron, manganese, copper and zinc (Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn) content after the harvest of wheat was the highest in the 500 m3 ha−1 treatment compared with all the other treatments. The exchangeable calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+) increased significantly and exchangeable Sodium (Na+) reduced significantly with increased doses of PBSW. The saturation paste extract analysis also showed the same trend. A significant increase in the EC of the saturation paste of extract of the soil was observed in all PBSW treatments and it was the highest (4.75 dS m−1) in PBSW application @ 500 m3 ha−1. The application of PBSW @ 500, 400, 300 and 200 m3 ha−1 resembled the treatments of FYM + gypsum @ 100 GR + RDF-AST, FYM + gypsum @ 50 GR + RDF-AST and FYM + RDF-AST, respectively, regarding the biological properties of sodic soil. The PBSW application @ 500 m3 ha−1 had recorded the highest grain (47.33 q ha−1) and straw (72.72 q ha−1) yield and the maximum total uptake of N, P, K, Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn by wheat, which was at par with the treatment of FYM (5 t ha−1) + gypsum @ 100% GR + RDF-AST. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","Nutrient availability; primary treated biomethanated spentwash; sodic soil; soil properties; uptake; wheat; yield","bulk density; crop yield; electrical conductivity; experimental study; nutrient availability; nutrient uptake; sodic soil; soil nutrient; soil property; soil test; trace element; wheat; India; Maharashtra; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025128582

The authors take a relational approach to violence, emphasizing how violence's many forms (physical, symbolic, epistemic, structural, etc.) interweave in practice to produce the built tourism environment, creating unequal power relations between “hosts” and “guests”. The special issue's papers provide five historically and geographically specific articulations of tourism, violence and dispossession in Paris, Guatemalan forests, rural Honduras, faux South African shantytowns, and O'ahu, Hawaii. They reveal recurring themes of enclosure and extraction, erasure and commodification, “destructive creation,” and (neo)colonialism. This introductory article draws on the special issue's guest editors’ ethnographic research in Colombia and Guatemala to elaborate on the key concepts of tourism development, violence, dispossession and spatial fetishism underpinning these themes using a critical and geographical approach. Attending to violence in tourism allows contributors to identify more sustainable forms of tourism development. These include redefining “sustainability” as Indigenous and Native sovereignty, advocating for grassroots and collective forms of tourism, reducing tourism's role in climate change by traveling locally, and contesting the reproduction of colonial itineraries and practices of “Othering”. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","(neo)colonialism; commodification; dispossession; enclosure; Tourism development; violence",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017528055

We have chosen as a case study greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction policies chosen by the city of Geneva. The methodological approach consists in analysing EIA, SEA, SA and HIA conducted on three projects in three topic areas: urban planning, heating and transportation. These projects are: a complex urbanisation plan in an urban neighbourhood in Geneva (the Gare des Eaux-Vives project), a sustainable transportation plan for a central district in Geneva (the St-Gervais transportation project) and a strategy to encourage the City’s employees to use sustainable transport for local business travel. The results show some shortcomings in the consideration of health in SEA, EIA and SA. This work highlights a narrow vision of health in SEA and EIA, limiting itself to a review of the effects of projects on the determinants of the physical environment as required by the legislation relating to these tools. EIA does not require the integration of the health dimension. As for SA, our research found that health is treated much more superficially than in HIA and primarily through the analysis of ‘health and safety’ criteria. It appears from this work that HIA is the tool which provides the most elaborate assessment, compared to SA, SEA or EIA, of the consequences for health of the GHG reduction policies chosen by the local decision-makers of a city. However, our study suggests that the HIA community should identify the situations in which HIA should be carried out and in which cases it is better to include health issues within an integrated analysis. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","climate change mitigation; Geneva; health; prospective impact assessment tools; urban","carbon footprint; city planning; climate change; employee; environmental impact assessment; health impact assessment; heating; human; human experiment; law; neighborhood; Switzerland; travel; vision; climate change; decision making; environment; greenhouse effect; health care policy; legislation and jurisprudence; procedures; Switzerland; City Planning; Climate Change; Decision Making; Environment; Greenhouse Effect; Health Impact Assessment; Health Policy; Humans; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021431640

Our aim was to determine if northern peatland plant growth forms alter belowground dissolved carbon chemistry and enhance carbon release through stimulated microbial metabolism. Methods: We used replicated, peat monoliths populated exclusively by Sphagnum mosses, graminoids, or bare peat and quantified changes in belowground dissolved organic carbon chemistry, microbial metabolism, as well as respired CO2. Results: The graminoid growth form was significantly distinct in belowground dissolved organic carbon chemistry with carbon compound lability 20 % and 11 % greater than bare peat and Sphagnum moss respectively. The labile dissolved organic carbon stimulated the microbial community, as indicated by greater microbial metabolic activity and richness values in conjunction with 50 % higher respired CO2 fluxes under the graminoid treatment. Conclusions: Our results provide mechanistic evidence that peatland plant growth forms can drive carbon cycling processes by altering dissolved organic carbon chemistry to prompt cascading effects on the microbial community and carbon release — trends suggestive of microbial priming effects. Should climate change increase graminoid prevalence at the expense of Sphagnum moss northern peatland carbon store stability may be threatened by this mechanism. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Dissolved organic carbon; Ecoplates; Microbial activity; Respired CO2; Sphagnum moss","biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; climate change; dissolved organic carbon; ecosystem dynamics; grass; growth form; metabolism; microbial activity; microbial community; moss; peat; peatland; species richness; Bryophyta; Sphagnum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006371460

Accompanying mineral international trade, there is a huge amount of carbon emission transferred from importing countries to exporting countries, which masks the true distribution of global carbon emission and blurs the lines about the responsibility for preserving the environment. Aiming to explore the embodied carbon emissions, we construct an embodied carbon emissions network of copper concentrates and refined copper international trade (ECCR) for each year during the sample period from 2007 to 2014. We analyze structure features of ECCR international trade. There exists a large amount of potential transfer of carbon emissions. The external dependency on copper concentrates of China is not so high. The trade volume shows that China, Germany and the United States are net importers, Chile, Peru and Zambia are net exporters. Moreover, the trade volumes of main countries change within a narrow range.

We used expert interviews to estimate the likelihood of implementing climate-adapted measures. Whether a local land-use plan stimulates climate change adaptation depends on a combination of different factors, e.g. the setting of the borough councillor in exchange with an investor, in a next step the willingness of the plans' creator to implement adaptation strategies as well as an existing environmental report. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","Bayesian Network; climate change adaptation; urban governance strategies; urban heat","adaptive management; Bayesian analysis; climate change; environmental planning; governance approach; heat island; land use planning; policy implementation; urban planning; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026318669

Although coordinated global collective action for mitigating climate change sufficiently to meet the 2°-C goal is still lacking, a multitude of multilateral, minilateral, transnational, national, subnational, and nonstate actors have emerged. This article offers a critical specification of the attempt by Elinor Ostrom and those influenced by her in the literature to conceptualize this climate governance reality as a polycentric approach. We claim that the concept of polycentricity offers high descriptive value for understanding the horizontal and vertical differentiations of current climate governance, and present systematic analysis of a polycentric approach to deliberately enhance the design of the emerging global climate governance architecture. To systematize the Ostromean literature on poly-centric climate governance, we identify and specify four key features for climate mitigation governance and their related mechanisms: an emphasis on self-organization, a recognition of site-specific conditions, the facilitation of experimentation and learning, and the building of trust. After discussing objections to a polycentric approach, we conclude by tentatively evaluating its potential to enhance the effectiveness of climate mitigation, and identify central tasks for the efficient design of a polycentric global climate governance regime. © 2017 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"environmental planning; environmental policy; experimental study; global climate; governance approach; international relations; literature review; mitigation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018371665

This paper assesses the role of key institutions in Malawi in shaping pathways towards more sustainable land management based on CA by outlining their impact on national policy-making and the design and implementation of agricultural development projects. It draws on interviews at national, district and project levels and a multi-stakeholder workshop that mapped the institutional landscape of decision-making for agricultural land management practices.

As these spaces intersect, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and their allies have reflected on the legitimacy of their interventions in terms of how local farmers view contrasting benefits relative to the changing expectations and promises emerging at the nexus of governance and commodity production. This article explores how a long-standing NGO network on Palawan Island, the Philippines, has drawn on its moral capital and legitimacy in forging a grassroots consortium that has implemented the carbon governance mechanism, REDD+, in a changing rural economy of expectations—one that is contested and differentiated based on its offerings and aspirations. I argue that as the NGO consortium CODE REDD tried to reframe REDD+ as a means of supporting indigenous livelihoods and climate change mitigation, it has placed its integrity and leverage at risk, as other indigenous farmers have rejected the claims and promises of the NGO REDD+ platform. I focus on a case where the NGO consortium's efforts to reframe REDD+ in terms of indigenous, propoor discourse progresses well in some quarters, aligning with anti–oil palm social movements, but fails to meet the growing aspirations of former indigenous allies who question the consortium in favor of investing in oil palm on ancestral lands. I conclude by suggesting that as NGOs adjust their political objectives by adopting market-based governance, they could lose leverage in negotiating the impact of lucrative commodity booms. © 2017 by American Association of Geographers.","Extractivism; local expectations; market-based governance; the Philippines","civil society; commodity; farmers attitude; governance approach; grassroots level; market conditions; morality; nongovernmental organization; social movement; MIMAROPA; Palawan [Mimaropa]; Palawan [Palawan (PRV)]; Philippines; Southeast Asia; Elaeis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012054693

In the present study, we provide an updated record of mercury in yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) caught near Hawaii that confirms an earlier conclusion that mercury concentrations in these fish are increasing at a rate similar to that observed in waters shallower than 1000 m. We also compiled and reanalyzed data from bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and blue marlin (Makaira nigricans) caught near Hawaii in the 1970s and 2000s. Increases in mercury concentrations in bigeye tuna are consistent with the trend found in yellowfin tuna, in both timing and magnitude. The data available for blue marlin do not allow for a fair comparison among years, because mercury concentrations differ between sexes for this species, and sex was identified (or reported) in only 3 of 7 studies. Also, mercury concentrations in blue marlin may be insensitive to modest changes in mercury exposure, because this species appears to have the ability to detoxify mercury. The North Pacific Ocean is a region of both relatively high rates of atmospheric mercury deposition and capture fisheries production. Other data sets that allow temporal comparisons in mercury concentrations, such as pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) in Alaskan waters and albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) off the US Pacific coast, should be explored further, to aid in understanding human health and ecological risks and to develop additional baseline knowledge for assessing changes in a region expected to respond strongly to reductions in anthropogenic mercury emissions.

However, impacts of exotics on native species are often manifest through competition, suggesting disturbance or nutrient management could benefit native species. I therefore asked: does nutrient reduction through carbon addition, or disturbance to reduce biomass, contribute to restoration by increasing occurrence and richness of native plant species?. Location: SE Australia. Methods: Using a field experiment spanning 4 yrs, this study assessed the potential for carbon addition, three types of disturbance (burn, crop, slash) and their interaction with native herbivore grazing to reduce exotic, and increase native, plant species in a critically endangered grassy woodland in SE Australia. Results: Adding carbon reduced occurrence of one native and three exotic species, while increasing one exotic and one native species. The value of adding carbon for restoration was therefore ambiguous. Fencing to exclude the high-density kangaroo population had temporary beneficial effects, suggesting that grazing reduced the number of native and exotic plant species by up to 56% and 21%, respectively. Species richness declined by year 3 in fenced areas, likely through competitive exclusion. Burn, slash and crop treatments also provided disturbance that maintained species richness and occurrence of many species, both native and exotic. Most grazing interactions reflected the benefit of alternative disturbance in the absence of grazing. However, there was also evidence that two species declined when crop and grazing acted in combination. Conclusions: Very high grazing by native herbivores reduced plant species richness in this study. However, grazing or other forms of disturbance appeared critical for preventing a small number of exotic species from driving down occurrence and richness of many other native and exotic plant species. Although increased exotic species richness is undesirable, disturbance led to a better outcome for conservation than the low-disturbance alternatives. © 2017 International Association for Vegetation Science","Eastern grey kangaroo; Fire; Habitat degradation; Habitat loss and fragmentation; Invasive alien species; Loss and fragmentation; Red gum–yellow box woodland","biological invasion; community structure; environmental degradation; environmental disturbance; experimental study; grassland; habitat fragmentation; habitat loss; introduced species; native species; nutrient dynamics; restoration ecology; species richness; ungulate; wildfire; woodland; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013466002

Representation of the spatiotemporal variability in snowmelt processes in continental-scale hydrologic models is critical for assessment of water resource response to continued climate change. Continental-extent hydrologic models such as the U.S. Geological Survey National Hydrologic Model (NHM) represent snowmelt processes through the application of snow depletion curves (SDCs). SDCs relate normalized snow water equivalent (SWE) to normalized snow covered area (SCA) over a snowmelt season for a given modeling unit. SDCs were derived using output from the operational Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) snow model as daily 1-km gridded SWE over the conterminous United States. Daily SNODAS output were aggregated to a predefined watershed-scale geospatial fabric and used to also calculate SCA from October 1, 2004 to September 30, 2013. The spatiotemporal variability in SNODAS output at the watershed scale was evaluated through the spatial distribution of the median and standard deviation for the time period. Representative SDCs for each watershed-scale modeling unit over the conterminous United States (n = 54,104) were selected using a consistent methodology and used to create categories of snowmelt based on SDC shape. The relation of SDC categories to the topographic and climatic variables allow for national-scale categorization of snowmelt processes. © 2017 American Water Resources Association.

Shenzhen, a developed megacity in South China, plays a leadership role in promoting the development of energy efficient vehicles in China. Methods: This paper aims to assess the carbon footprint (CF) of the TS in Shenzhen via a Streamlined Life Cycle Assessment method. Consequently, the current environmental performance of the TS is evaluated and improvement potentials are examined. Results and discussion: The results show that CF has gained rapid growth over the past decade at an annual rate of 15.3 %, closely corresponding with the growth of the Gross Domestic Product (18.9 %) in Shenzhen. The total CF in 2013 was estimated as 50.7 million tons (ranging from 41.7 to 59.9). Road based freight transport accounts for the largest share of the TS’ emissions. The most significant contributors in this sector are: light duty trucks, urban public transport bus service, and passenger air transport. Meanwhile, this study took new energy vehicles into consideration in order to explore the range of CF mitigation potential in Shenzhen. The potential carbon abatement is not significant in comparison with the impact growth derived from the increasing freight and passenger transport based on the assumption that the transport intensity and its annual growth rate maintain at the current levels. Conclusions: This study offers a useful approach to evaluate the available options for sustainable transport system planning in Shenzhen. For carbon emissions reductions from the TS, policies and technological innovations are essential to facilitate the transition to a low carbon TS. In addition, the methodology developed in this study could be used for assessing CF in other sectors. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Carbon footprint; China; Shenzhen; Streamlined life cycle assessment; Transport sector","air pollution control; air quality; Article; carbon footprint; case study; China; energy conservation; environmental impact; exhaust gas; life cycle assessment; traffic and transport; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986267638

This study shows that unmitigated regional emissions by 2050 could rise to 296 542 GgCO2eq from a current level in 2015 of 128 184 GgCO2eq additionally decreasing annually by up to 8.75% falling to 10.16% due to waste characterisation changes as developing countries in the region progress to developed country status. A further annual rise, due to hotter drier climate conditions experienced as desertification, of up to a range of 1.70% increasing to 2.29% is also demonstrated.

We report N2O, CO2, and CH4 emissions from a silage corn (Zea mays L.) (2013)-barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (2014)-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) (2015) rotation under conventional tillage and sprinkler irrigation. We evaluated the effectiveness of an enhanced-efficiency fertilizer (SuperU, a stabilized granular urea with urease and nitrification inhibitors) to reduce N2O emissions compared with granular urea and to determine GHG emissions from fall-applied dairy manure or composted dairy manure and spring-applied dairy manure. Nitrogen was applied during the first 2 yr of the study. SuperU plots emitted 53% less N2O than urea with corn, whereas no emission reductions occurred in 2014 with barley. The N2O-N emission losses as a percentage of total N applied were 0.21 and 0.04% for urea and SuperU in 2013, respectively, with losses of 0.05% from both urea fertilizers in 2014. On average, N2O fluxes from fall and spring manure were statistically similar and greater than the other N treatments in 2014 and a lasting manure treatment effect on emissions occurred under alfalfa. Carbon dioxide fluxes were greatest from fall- A nd spring-applied manure during the first 2 yr. Methane fluxes were negative, indicating microbial oxidation, and no differences occurred among the treatments. Corn, barley, and alfalfa yields were similar among all N treatments.

On the other hand, their production and use require serious attention while they may be seriously harmful to local air quality. The Clean Air Act (CAA) and its subsequent amendments regulate the emissions of hazardous air pollutants to protect public health and welfare in the U.S.A. since 1970. This study aimed to assess the impact of CAA on the rate of patenting in the chemical industry. With this in mind, basic chemical utility patents were analyzed to detect the effects of CAA on the patenting activities. Subsequent to the fitting of the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model (producing the least square of errors), a significant outlier was detected with the Dixon's r22 Ratio Test. This outlier was the number of patents granted in 1972. Contextual queries in the text of those patent documents have shown that there was a considerable increase in the patents of chemistry which takes the sustainability relevant terms (air, emission, pollution, etc.) into consideration. It was concluded that companies in the chemistry industry adapted themselves very rapidly to the changes and CAA was an important incentive to create novel technologies. © 2017 by the author.","Change detection; Chemical industry; Clean air act; Outlier test; Technological information","adaptive management; air quality; atmospheric pollution; chemical industry; detection method; emission control; environmental economics; environmental policy; incentive; industrial production; intellectual property rights; learning; outlier; pollution policy; public health; science and technology; sustainability; testing method; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019964310

Such pollutants could have adverse effects on the plant growth as well as microbial community in soil. Although biochar has been proposed as a ‘carbon negative strategy’ to mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions, the impacts of its application with respect to long-term persistence and bioavailability of hazardous components are not clear. Moreover, the co-occurrence of low molecular weight VOCs with PAHs in biochar may exert further phytotoxic effects. This review describes the basic need to unravel key mechanisms driving the storage vs. emission of these organics and the dynamics between the sorbent (biochar) and soil microbes. Moreover, there is an urgent need for standardized methods for quantitative analysis of PAHs and VOCs in biochar under environmentally relevant conditions. This review is also extended to cover current research gaps including the influence of biochar application on the short- and long-term fate of PAHs and VOCs and the proper control tactics for biochar quality and associated risk. © 2016 The Authors.

To help fill this knowledge gap, we perform a thorough regulatory analysis and use engineering process designs to assess the applicability of federal air regulations and quantify air pollutant emissions for two feasibility-level biorefinery designs. We find that without additional emission-control technologies both biorefineries would likely be required to obtain major source permits under the Clean Air Act's New Source Review program. The permitting classification (so-called ""major"" or ""minor"") has implications for the time and effort required for permitting and therefore affects the cost of capital and the fuel selling price. Consequently, we explore additional technically feasible emission-control technologies and process modifications that have the potential to reduce emissions to achieve a minor source permitting classification.

In order to prepare themselves to welcome the increased number of electric vehicles circulating in the city networks in the near future, they are expected to deploy networks of public electric vehicle chargers. The Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Location Problem is an optimization problem that can be approached by linear programming, multi-objective optimization and genetic algorithms. Methods: In the present paper, a genetic algorithm approach is presented. Since data from electric vehicles usage are still scarce, origin - destination data of conventional vehicles are used and the necessary assumptions to predict electric vehicles’ penetration in the years to come are made. The algorithm and a user-friendly tool have been developed in R and tested for the city of Thessaloniki. Results: The results indicate that 15 stations would be required to cover 80% of the estimated electric vehicles charging demand in 2020 in the city of Thessaloniki and their optimal locations to install them are identified. Conclusions: The tool that has been developed based on the genetic algorithm, is open source and freely available to interested users. The approach can be used to allocate charging stations at high-level, i.e. to zones, and the authors encourage its use by local authorities of other cities too, in Greece and worldwide, in order to deploy a plan for installing adequate charging infrastructure to cover future electric vehicles charging demand and reduce the electric vehicle “driver anxiety” (i.e. the driver’s concern of running out of battery) encouraging the widespread adoption of electromobility. © 2017, The Author(s).","Charging infrastructure; Electric vehicles; Facility location; Genetic algorithm","Carbon; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Genetic algorithms; Linear programming; Location; Multiobjective optimization; Open source software; Optimization; Urban transportation; Vehicles; Carbon emissions reductions; Charging infrastructures; Electric vehicle charging infrastructures; Facility locations; Genetic algorithm approach; Optimization problems; Public electric vehicle; User-friendly tool; Charging (batteries)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019021421

They are best preserved in the Almahata Sitta MS-17, MS-177 fragments, and the ALHA 77295 and MAC 88136 Antarctic meteorites. These conditions induce a stark change of the geochemical behavior of nominally lithophile elements to chalcophile or even siderophile and changes in the elemental partitioning thus leading to formation of unusual mineral assemblages with high abundance of exotic sulfide species and enrichment in the metallic alloys, for example, silicides and phosphides. Origin and mode of formation of these exotic chondrites, and their parental source regions could be best scrutinized by multitask research experiments of the most primitive members covering mineralogical, petrological, cosmochemical, and indispensably short-lived isotopic chronology. The magnitude of temperature and pressure prevailed during their formation in their source regions could eventually be reasonably estimated: pre- and postaccretionary could eventually be deduced. The dual low fugacities are regulated by the carbon to oxygen ratios estimated to be &gt;0.83 and &lt;1.03. These parameters not only induce unusual geochemical behavior of the elements inverting many nominally lithophile elements to chalcophile or even siderophile or anthracophile. Structure and mineral inventories in EL3 and EH3 chondrites are fundamentally different. Yet EH3 and EL3 members store crucial information relevant to eventual source regions and importantly possible variation in C/O ratio in the course of their evolution. EL3 and EH3 chondrites contain trichotomous lithologies (1) chondrules and their fragments, (2) polygonal enstatite-dominated objects, and (3) multiphase metal-rich nodules. Mineralogical and cosmochemical inventories of lithologies in the same EL3 indicate not only similarities (REE inventory and anomalies in oldhamite) but also distinct differences (sinoite-enstatite-graphite relationship). Oldhamite in chondrules and polygonal fragments in EL3 depict negative Eu anomaly attesting a common cosmochemical source. Metal-dominated nodules in both EL3 and EH3 are conglomerates of metal clasts and sulfide fragments in EH3 and concentrically zoned C-bearing metal micropebbles (≥25 μm ≤50 μm) in EL3 thus manifesting a frozen in unique primordial accretionary metal texture and composition.

The policies of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) encourage homeowners to implement permanent static elevation (PSE) to increase their flood resilience. However, substantial elevation can increase a structure's vulnerability to wind. In effect, by protecting against a rare but catastrophic flood occurrence, these houses are made considerably more vulnerable to less severe but more regularly occurring wind events and thus face an increased likelihood of wind damage. This study introduces amphibious construction as an innovative retrofit flood-mitigation and climate-change-adaptation strategy. It also evaluates the increased vulnerability to wind damage that accompanies PSE, to which amphibious retrofit construction is an alternative. The results of our investigation suggest that amphibious construction could provide a beneficial alternative solution to mitigating hurricane damage because it is a strategy that can reduce vulnerability to flood damage without increasing vulnerability to wind damage. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Adaptive flood-risk management; Amphibious construction; Buoyant foundation; Climate change adaptation; Flood mitigation; Hurricane damage risk reduction; Multi-hazard mitigation; Non-structural floodproofing; Permanent static elevation; Wind damage","Climate change; Flood control; Hurricanes; Retrofitting; Risk management; Climate change adaptation; Flood mitigation; Flood risk management; Hurricane damage; Multi-hazards; Non-structural; Permanent static elevation; Wind damage; Floods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017615936

This paper proposes and applies a technology-independent “reference resource-to-service system” framework for concurrent evaluation of urban water and energy system interventions and their ‘nexus’ or ‘interlinkages’. In a concrete application, data that approximate New York City conditions are used to evaluate a limited set of interventions in the residential sector, spanning from low-flow toilet shifts to extensive green roof installations. Results indicate that interventions motivated primarily by water management goals can considerably reduce energy use and contribute to mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, energy efficiency interventions can considerably reduce water use in addition to lowering emissions. However, interventions yielding the greatest reductions in energy use and emissions are not necessarily the most water conserving ones, and vice versa. Useful further research, expanding the present analysis should consider a broader set of resource interactions, towards a full climate, land, energy and water (CLEW) nexus approach. Overall, assessing the impacts, trade-offs and co-benefits from interventions in one urban resource system on others also holds promise as support for increased resource efficiency through integrated decision making. © 2017 The Authors","Integrated resource assessment; Multi-resource impacts; New York City; Urban service provision; Urban sustainability; Water-energy nexus","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Water management; Integrated resources; Multi-resource; New York city; Urban services; Urban sustainability; Water energy; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014923125

Regionally, a large fraction of the emitted dust is produced in northern Africa; however, the total emission flux from there is still highly uncertain. In order to reduce these uncertainties, emission estimates through top-down approaches (i.e. usually models constrained by observations) have been successfully developed and implemented. Such studies usually rely on a single observational dataset and propagate the possible observational errors of this dataset onto the emission estimates. In this study, aerosol optical depth (AOD) products from five different satellites are assimilated one by one in a source inversion system to estimate dust emission fluxes over northern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. We estimate mineral dust emissions for the year 2006 and discuss the impact of the assimilated dataset on the analysis. We find a relatively large dispersion in flux estimates among the five experiments, which can likely be attributed to differences in the assimilated observation datasets and their associated error statistics. © Author(s) 2017.",,"aerosol; data assimilation; data set; dust; emission; optical depth; Africa; Arabian Peninsula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020903295

This paper presents a method for assessing impacts and adaptation strategies to global change in a river basin system at different temporal horizons using a hydro-economic model. First, a multiobjective analysis selects climate change projections based on the fitting of the climate models to the historical conditions for the historical period. Inflows for climate change scenarios are generated using calibrated rainfall-runoff models, perturbing observed meteorological time series according to the projected anomalies in mean and standard deviation. Demands are projected for the different scenarios and characterized using economic demand curves. With the new water resource and demand scenarios, the impact of global change on system performance is assessed using a hydro-economic model with reliability and economic indices. A new economic loss index is defined to assess the economic equity of the system. Selected adaptation strategies are simulated to compare performance with the business-as-usual scenario. The approach is applied to the Jucar River water resource system, in eastern Spain, using climate projections from the European Union (EU) ENSEMBLES project. Results show that the system is vulnerable to global change, especially over the long term, and that adaptation actions can save €3-65-million/year. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Climate models; Economics; Losses; Water management; Water resources; Climate change adaptation; Climate change projections; Climate change scenarios; Impacts and adaptation; Mean and standard deviations; Multi-objective analysis; Rainfall-runoff models; Water resource systems; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; rainfall-runoff modeling; river basin; water management; water resource; Jucar Basin; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016756376

Analysis of a well-composed program for Mex¬ico City indicates that the emission reductions would cost 24 percent more if a tax on gasoline was not introduced. A simple analytical framework is developed to analyze the use of abatement require¬ments to make cars cleaner, and a gasoline tax to economize on the use of cars. The two instruments should be combined to mimic the incentives that would have been provided by an emissions fee. Thus, cleaner cars and fewer trips are analogous to competing suppliers of emission reductions; the planner should buy from both so that marginal costs are equal. Applying that rule, the marginal cost of emission reductions is, simply, the gasoline tax rate divided by emissions per liter. © 2006 Adrian Muller and Thomas Sterner.

Several large cities are taking climate change into account in long-term strategies, for which it is important to have information on the costs and benefits of adaptation. Studies on climate change impacts in cities mostly focus on a limited set of countries and risks, for example sea-level rise, health and water resources. Most of these studies are qualitative, except for the costs of sea-level rise in cities. These impact estimates do not take into account that large cities will experience additional warming due to the urban heat island effect, that is, the change of local climate patterns caused by urbanization. Here we provide a quantitative assessment of the economic costs of the joint impacts of local and global climate change for all main cities around the world. Cost-benefit analyses are presented of urban heat island mitigation options, including green and cool roofs and cool pavements. It is shown that local actions can be a climate risk-reduction instrument. Furthermore, limiting the urban heat island through city adaptation plans can significantly amplify the benefits of international mitigation efforts. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

However, few studies have compared the general effect of different feedstock-derived biochars on the various gaseous reactive nitrogen emissions (GNrEs) of N2O, NO and NH3 simultaneously across the typical vegetable soils in China. A greenhouse pot experiment with five consecutive vegetable crops was conducted to investigate the effects of two contrasting biochars, namely wheat straw biochar (Bw) and swine manure biochar (Bm) on GNrEs, vegetable yield and gaseous reactive nitrogen intensity (GNrI) in four typical soils which are representative of the intensive vegetable cropping systems across mainland China: An Acrisol from Hunan Province, an Anthrosol from Shanxi Province, a Cambisol from Shandong Province and a Phaeozem from Heilongjiang Province. Results showed that remarkable GNrE mitigation induced by biochar occurred in Anthrosol and Phaeozem, whereas enhancement of yield occurred in Cambisol and Phaeozem. Additionally, both biochars decreased GNrI through reducing N2O and NO emissions by 36.4-59.1 and 37.0-49.5% for Bw (except for Cambisol), respectively, and by improving yield by 13.5-30.5% for Bm (except for Acrisol and Anthrosol). Biochar amendments generally stimulated the NH3 emissions with greater enhancement from Bm than Bw. We can infer that the biochar's effects on the GNrEs and vegetable yield strongly depend on the attributes of the soil and biochar. Therefore, in order to achieve the maximum benefits under intensive greenhouse vegetable agriculture, both soil type and biochar characteristics should be seriously considered before conducting large-scale biochar applications. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"carbon sequestration; charcoal; crop production; experimental study; manure; nitrogen; reaction kinetics; soil amendment; soil emission; China; Suidae; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020742918

Chinese government facilitated eco-industrial development of industrial park, aiming to output more with less environmental burden. In our study, the eco-efficiency levels of 40 Chinese industrial parks in 2012 were assessed and ranked by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). This paper applied indicators relevant to resource, economy, and environment from industrial parks which can well reflect the characteristics of eco-efficiency conforming to the concept of sustainability. This paper introduced how to adjust less sustainable parks to be more sustainable according to the DEA results. The roles of industrial added value per capita, industrial structure, environmental policy and development scale as influence factors of eco-efficiency were discussed. The results show that large differences exist in the eco-efficiency of different industrial parks. It is shown that 20% of the parks are relatively efficient. 47% of the study parks being inefficient in terms of scale efficiency show decreasing returns to scale. Policy implementations for the management of industrial parks were also discussed based on the results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; Data envelopment analysis; Eco-efficiency; Eco-industrial development; Industrial parks; Policy making","data envelopment analysis; environmental policy; industrial emission; industrial enterprise; policy making; regional economy; state role; sustainability; China; economic aspect; environmental policy; industrialization; management; China; environmental protection; industry; China; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Policy; Industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010901194

A novel carbon tax attractor is achieved through the discussion of the dynamic behavior of the new system. Based on the genetic algorithm-back propagation neural network, the quantitative coefficients of the actual system are identified. The scenario analysis results show that, under the same tax rate and constraint conditions, the ESER system in YRD urban agglomerations is superior to the average case in China, in which the impacts on economic growth are almost the same. The former's energy intensity is lower and the shock resistance is stronger. It is found that economic property of YRD urban agglomerations is the main cause for the ESER system of YRD urban agglomerations being superior. In the current YRD urban agglomerations’ ESER system, energy intensity cannot be adjusted to an ideal level by commercialization management and government control; however, it is under effective control of carbon tax incentives. Therefore, strengthening the economic property of YRD urban agglomerations and effective utilization of carbon tax incentives could perfectly control energy intensity, without obvious potential negative impact on economic growth. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon tax constraints; Economic growth; Energy intensity; ESER system; Yangtze River Delta urban agglomerations (YRD)","Agglomeration; Backpropagation; Backpropagation algorithms; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Energy conservation; Genetic algorithms; Neural networks; Taxation; Carbon taxes; Economic growths; Energy intensity; ESER system; Urban agglomerations; Urban growth; agglomeration; economic conditions; economic growth; emission control; energy intensity; government; pollution tax; scenario analysis; urban economy; China; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020681488

Emissions reductions stem from changes in output composition and lower energy use, despite an offsetting increase in emissions induced by the final consumption of non-energy products due to higher income. Particularly, removing import barriers completely (i.e. full liberalization) would increase Iran's GDP by 8.9%, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in CO2 equivalents by 3%.

This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of irrigation levels (75% [deficit], 100% [full], and 125% [excess] of reference crop evapotranspiration requirements), and organic amendments (OA) type (chicken manure [CM] and bone meal [BM]) and OA application rates (0,168, 336 and 672 kg total N ha−1) on (i) soil physical properties (bulk density, organic matter content and soil moisture content) and (ii) soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from a highly weathered tropical Hawai'ian soil. Carbon dioxide readings were consistently taken once or twice a week for the duration of the cropping season. A drip irrigation system was used to apply the appropriate amount of irrigation water to the treatment plots. Treatments were randomly selected and corresponding organic amendments were manually incorporated into the soil. Plots were cultivated with sweet corn (Zea mays ‘SS-16’). Soil moisture content within and below the rootzone was monitored using a TDR 300 soil moisture sensor (Spectrum Technologies, Inc., Plainfield, IL, USA) connected with 12 cm long prongs. Soil bulk density and organic matter content were determined at the end of the cropping season. Analysis of variance results revealed that OA type, rate, and their interaction had significant effect on soil CO2 flux (P &lt; 0.05). Among the OA rates, all CM mostly resulted in significantly higher soil CO2 fluxes compared to BM and control treatment (p &lt; 0.05). The two highest rates of BM treatment were not significantly different from the control with regard to soil CO2 flux. In addition, organic amendments affected soil moisture dynamics during the crop growing season and organic matter content measured after the crop harvest. While additional studies are needed to further investigate the effect of irrigation levels on soil CO2 flux, it is recommended that in order to minimize soil CO2 emissions, BM soil amendments could be a potential option to reduce soil CO2 fluxes from agricultural fields similar to the one used in this study. © 2017 The Author(s).

For this reason, the objective of this research work was to evaluate the impacts of changing traffic-related parameters on particulate matter (PM) concentration for several hierarchical street levels using real-world data for the city of Lisbon, Portugal. For that purpose, 2014 data regarding meteorological conditions, traffic volumes, typical vehicle speed, and a vehicle representative of the fleet was used in an air quality dispersion model (CALINE4). The available data allowed building a baseline case for several streets that are representative of the traffic circulation conditions in Lisbon, which was compared with different scenarios: hypothetical introduction of a cordon toll (S1.1 to S1.4) and the implementation of a low emission zone (S2.1 and 2.2). The results indicate that reductions on PM2.5 concentrations from 5 to 42 % may be obtained from the implementation of the scenarios. Overall, this study demonstrates that modeling tools based on real-world data can provide a good approach to study urban policies regarding traffic-related PM exposure. Additionally, implementation of such measures requires an integrated strategy that enables proper enforcement and monitoring, as well as an adequate management of traffic flows between the implementation boundaries. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Cordon toll; LEZ; Modeling; PM2.5 concentration; Scenarios; Urban policies","air quality; atmospheric modeling; baseline conditions; concentration (composition); data assimilation; emission control; particle size; particulate matter; policy implementation; scenario analysis; traffic emission; urban policy; urban pollution; Lisboa [Portugal]; Lisbon; Portugal; air pollutant; exhaust gas; particulate matter; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; city; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; particulate matter; Portugal; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Portugal; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944931130

The true success, however, of this trend depends on the successful integration of electric transportation modes into the infrastructure systems that support them. Left unmanaged, plug-in electric vehicles may suffer from delays due to charging or cause destabilizing charging loads on the electrical grid. Online electric vehicles have emerged to remediate the need for stationary charging and its effects. While many works have sought to mitigate these effects with advanced control functionality, such as coordinated charging, vehicle-to-grid stabilization, and charging queue management, few works have assessed these impacts as a holistic transportation-electricity nexus. This paper develops a hybrid dynamic system model for transportation electrification. It also includes next generation traffic simulation concepts of multimodality and multiagency. Such a model can be used by electrified transportation fleet operators to not just assess but also improve their operations and control. The hybrid dynamic system model is composed of a marked Petri-net model superimposed on the continuous time kinematic and electrical state evolution. The model is demonstrated on an illustrative example of moderate size and functional heterogeneity. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Axiomatic design; heterofunctional networks; hybrid dynamic system; multimodal transportation; Petri nets; power systems; transportation electrification","Continuous time systems; Continuous time systems; Crashworthiness; Crashworthiness; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Electric utilities; Emission control; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy efficiency; Multimodal transportation; Multimodal transportation; Nonlinear control systems; Nonlinear control systems; Petri nets; Petri nets; Plug-in electric vehicles; Plug-in electric vehicles; Traffic control; Traffic control; Transportation; Transportation; Vehicles; Vehicles; Coordinated charging; Coordinated charging; Electric transportation; Electric transportation; Functional heterogeneity; Functional heterogeneity; Hybrid dynamic systems; Hybrid dynamic systems; Infrastructure systems; Infrastructure systems; Operations and control; Operations and control; Transportation electrifications; Transportation electrifications; Transportation fleet; Transportation fleet; Fleet operations; Fleet operations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978881290

To de-risk and support the sustainable development, regulation and management of ground source heating systems in urban areas, detailed baseline mapping of groundwater temperatures is required. Groundwater temperatures were measured in 168 monitoring boreholes primarily within a Quaternary sand and gravel aquifer in the city of Cardiff, UK. The data have been used to create the first city-wide map of shallow groundwater temperatures in the UK. This map can be used both to support development of ground source heating and to act as a detailed baseline from which to measure change. Shallow groundwater temperatures under the city were found to be 2°C warmer than the UK average groundwater temperature and this additional heat is attributed to the urban heat island. The zone of seasonal fluctuation varies from 7.1 and 15.5 m below ground level (mbgl) within the shallow Quaternary aquifer, averaging 9.5 mbgl.

Despite the need, concrete production and its use have a number of environmental consequences. The production of concrete creates a substantial need for water that directly causes a burden on the already scare natural resource. In United Arab Emirates the majority of the water used for concrete production is obtained through desalination of the seawater. Desalination of seawater produces highly saline wastewater commonly known as reject brine or concentrated brine that has numerous negative environmental effects. The production of cement, the primary ingredient in the production of concrete is responsible for the generation of nearly 5% of the global carbon dioxide that is a potent greenhouse gas. With the intent of reducing the carbon footprint of concrete production, a study was carried out to determine the effect of using reject brine as the source of water and the use of ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) as a replacement for cement. Concrete samples having three different cement contents were prepared with normal tap water and reject brine. Results showed that the use of GGBS and reject brine improved the strength of concrete produced by 16.5%. Replacing 50% of the cement with GGBS and using reject brine as the source of water has a potential for reducing 176 kg CO2 and 1.7–3.4 kg of CO2 equivalents per one cubic meter of concrete, respectively. The use of the waste reject brine can potentially save USD 170–340 per cubic meter of concrete produced. © 2017 The Gulf Organisation for Research and Development","Brine; Concrete; GGBS; Reject water; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020072774

Usually, state-of-the-art combustion appliances are optimized for a particular fuel quality and typically approved only for utilization of standardized wood pellets or wood chips. Research activities within the GrateAdvance project focus on fuel flexible grate technologies being capable of adapting conditions in the combustion zone by a systematic and targeted adjustment of grate parameters in order to minimize emissions and slagging problems, thus setting the basis for a new generation of biomass technologies.

However, only recently have ecologists begun to synthetically assess responses to climate extremes across multiple levels of ecological organization. We review the literature to examine how plant responses vary and interact across levels of organization, focusing on how individual, population and community responses may inform ecosystem-level responses in herbaceous and forest plant communities. We report a high degree of variability at the individual level, and a consequential inconsistency in the translation of individual or population responses to directional changes in community- or ecosystem-level processes. The scaling of individual or population responses to community or ecosystem responses is often predicated upon the functional identity of the species in the community, in particular, the dominant species. Furthermore, the reported stability in plant community composition and functioning with respect to extremes is often driven by processes that operate at the community level, such as species niche partitioning and compensatory responses during or after the event. Future research efforts would benefit from assessing ecological responses across multiple levels of organization, as this will provide both a holistic and mechanistic understanding of ecosystem responses to increasing climatic variability.

The data for all years as well as the eight years (excluding El Niño events) were studied to examine the effect of climate variation on the spatial distribution of D. gigas. Five spatial clusters reflecting the spatial distribution were computed using K-means and Getis-Ord Gi* for a detailed comparative study. Our results showed that clusters identified by the two methods were quite different in terms of their spatial patterns, and K-means was not as accurate as Getis-Ord Gi*, as inferred from the agreement degree and receiver operating characteristic. There were more areas of hot and cold spots in years without the impact of El Niño, suggesting that such large-scale climate variations could reduce the clustering level of D. gigas. The catches also showed that warm El Niño conditions and high water temperature were less favorable for D. gigas offshore Peru. The results suggested that the use of K-means is preferable if the aim is to discover the spatial distribution of each sub-region (cluster) of the study area, while Getis-Ord Gi* is preferable if the aim is to identify statistically significant hot spots that may indicate the central fishing ground. © 2017, Science Press, Ocean University of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Dosidicus gigas; El Niño; Getis-Ord Gi*; K-means; offshore Peru; sea surface temperature (SST); spatial cluster",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019062657

In Chimoio municipality cases of malaria are increasing annually, contrary to the decreasing trend in Africa. As malaria transmission is influenced to a large extent by climatic conditions, modelling this relationship can provide useful insights for designing precision health measures for malaria control. There is a scarcity of information on the association between climatic variability and malaria transmission risk in Mozambique in general, and in Chimoio in particular. Therefore, the aim of this study is to model the association between climatic variables and malaria cases on a weekly basis, to help policy makers find adequate measures for malaria control and eradication. Methods: Time series analysis was conducted using data on weekly climatic variables and weekly malaria cases (counts) in Chimoio municipality, from 2006 to 2014. All data were analysed using SPSS-20, R 3.3.2 and BioEstat 5.0. Cross-correlation analysis, linear processes, namely ARIMA models and regression modelling, were used to develop the final model. Results: Between 2006 and 2014, 490,561 cases of malaria were recorded in Chimoio. Both malaria and climatic data exhibit weekly and yearly systematic fluctuations. Cross-correlation analysis showed that mean temperature and precipitation present significantly lagged correlations with malaria cases. An ARIMA model (2,1,0) (2,1,1)52, and a regression model for a Box-Cox transformed number of malaria cases with lags 1, 2 and 3 of weekly malaria cases and lags 6 and 7 of weekly mean temperature and lags 12 of precipitation were fitted. Although, both produced similar widths for prediction intervals, the last was able to anticipate malaria outbreak more accurately. Conclusion: The Chimoio climate seems ideal for malaria occurrence. Malaria occurrence peaks during January to March in Chimoio. As the lag effect between climatic events and malaria occurrence is important for the prediction of malaria cases, this can be used for designing public precision health measures. The model can be used for planning specific measures for Chimoio municipality. Prospective and multidisciplinary research involving researchers from different fields is welcomed to improve the effect of climatic factors and other factors in malaria cases. © 2017 The Author(s).","Chimoio; Malaria; Modelling; Precision public health","Article; climate change; correlation analysis; epidemic; human; humidity; malaria; malaria control; mathematical model; Mozambique; precipitation; prediction; temperature; time series analysis; climate; incidence; season; statistical model; transmission; Climate; Humans; Humidity; Incidence; Malaria; Models, Statistical; Mozambique; Seasons; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019704675

Significant hydrocarbon discoveries and exploration licenses in the Labrador Sea underscore the need for quantitative information on seabird seasonal distribution and abundance, as this region is known to provide important habitat for seabirds year-round. We explore the utility of density surface modeling (DSM) to improve seabird information available for regional conservation and management decision making. We, (1) develop seasonal density surface models for seabirds in the Labrador Sea using data from vessel-based surveys (2006-2014; 13,783 linear km of surveys), (2) present measures of uncertainty in model predictions, (3) discuss how density surface models can inform conservation and management decision making, and 4) explore challenges and potential pitfalls associated with using these modeling procedures. Models predicted large areas of high seabird density in fall over continental shelf waters (max. ~80 birds·km-2) driven largely by the southward migration of murres (Uria spp.) and dovekies (Alle alle) from Arctic breeding colonies. The continental shelf break was also highlighted as an important habitat feature, with predictions of high seabird densities particularly during summer (max. ~70 birds·km-2). Notable concentrations of seabirds overlapped with several significant hydrocarbon discoveries on the continental shelf and large areas in the vicinity of the southern shelf break, which are in the early stages of exploration. Some, but not all, areas of high seabird density were within current Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area (EBSA) boundaries. Building predictive spatial models required knowledge of Distance Sampling and GAMs, and significant investments of time and computational power-resource needs that are becoming more common in ecological modeling. Visualization of predictions and their uncertainty needed to be considered for appropriate interpretation by end users. Model uncertainty tended to be greater where survey effort was limited or where predictor covariates exceeded the range of those observed. Predictive spatial models proved useful in generating defensible estimates of seabird densities in many areas of interest to the oil and gas industry in the Labrador Sea, and will have continued use in marine risk assessments and spatial planning activities in the region and beyond. © 2017 Fifield, Hedd, Avery-Gomm, Robertson, Gjerdrum and McFarlane Tranquilla.","Conservation planning; Density surface models; Labrador Sea; Predictive spatial models; Seabirds",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020172265

The orbital and rotational effects of the sun and moon create tidal patterns which may be reasonably predicted as opposed to other forms of renewable energy. The energy available can be measured by the difference in tide heights or velocities depending on the application of the tidal device. Today's challenges focus on overcoming the minimum energy necessary to effectively power the turbines, initial project costs, meeting peak load demands, and low impacts to the environment. The United States Navy is currently on a tenacious path to explore energy saving technology that could be used in isolated and remote locations as well as various climate conditions to supplement the Navy's power generation requirements. Executive Orders 13693 and 13514 mandate the reduction of energy intensity coupled with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of approximately 28% by Fiscal year 2020 from a year 2008 baseline. The purpose of this research is to conduct a technical review of companies capable of supporting the Navy's global goal in reduction of greenhouse gases for future Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation or financed energy type contracts. The methodology for technical review will include examining the company's corporate experience, past performance, environmental compliance, permitting, and the ability to operate internationally.

However, when one focuses on the entire city region, there is ever-increasing car-dependent development. This paper focuses on the exurban region of the two cities investigating transport-created CO2emissions. The research is based on the analysis of data of the National Travel Surveys of Great Britain and the USA through a quantification of personal travel and a top-down estimation of CO2emissions. It is the exurban region that accounts for the vast majority of CO2emissions: 77% for London and 87% for New York. In the wider region for both cities there is a policy vacuum and dearth of regional planning mechanisms to deliver policies to reduce CO2emissions. The paper argues that transport needs to be planned at the city-regional scale. © 2016 Newcastle University.","exurbia; London; New York; transport emissions","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; pollution policy; sustainability; traffic emission; urban pollution; England; London [England]; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United Kingdom; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988649760

The present study is aimed at studying what happens if decision-makers do not take any prominent measures to ensure that the building sector realizes more efficient performance. The current European tendencies indicate that the most common approach is to attempt to renovate the existing building stock. However, this is not always the best solution. In Central and Eastern European countries, such as Hungary, the greatest problem encountered in renovations is the outdated heating and electricity supply of the old buildings. Many experts are convinced that these buildings should be demolished now and replaced with new ones in order to achieve more effective performance. This study, besides the environmental matters presents a climate policy-related economic evaluation which strengthens the latter opinion. The purpose of this novel cost effectiveness analysis is to examine the long-term viability of these two approaches (retrofitting strategy vs. the building of new houses) from the aspect of both environmental conformity (climate friendliness) and sustainable economics between 2020 and 2030. © The Author(s) 2017.","Building sector; carbon strategy; climate friendly investment; climate policy CBA model; GHG management; retrofitting trends",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039853494

These forests are shaped by complex interactions among vegetation, climate, and disturbances. Thus, climate change and shifting disturbances may lead to significant changes in species composition and biomass. Individual tree-based modeling allows various climate change scenarios and their effects on forest dynamics to be tested. We use an updated individual-based gap model, the University of Virginia Forest Model Enhanced (UVAFME) at four sites in the southern Rocky Mountains. UVAFME is quantitatively and qualitatively validated at these sites against inventory data and descriptions of vegetation zonation and successional dynamics. Results show that UVAFME can be used to reasonably simulate the expected change in species composition with elevation for the southern Rocky Mountains region. UVAFME output on size structure (stems size class−1 ha−1) and species-specific biomass (tonnes C ha−1) is comparable to forest inventory data at these locations. UVAFME can also simulate successional dynamics to accurately predict changes in species dominance with landscape age. We then perform a hypothetical climate sensitivity test in which temperature is first increased linearly by 2 °C over 100 years, stabilized for 200 years, cooled back to present climate values over 100 years, and again stabilized for 200 years. Results show that elevated temperatures within the southern Rocky Mountains may lead to decreases in biomass and shifts upslope in species composition, especially that of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). At some ecotones these changes are also likely to be fairly long lasting for at least 100 years. The results from these tests suggest that UVAFME and other individual-based gap models can be used to inform forest management and climate mitigation strategies for this region. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Forest dynamics; Individual-based gap models; Model validation; UVAFME; Vegetation modeling","Biomass; C (programming language); Climate models; Digital storage; Dynamics; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Landforms; Vegetation; Forest dynamics; Gap model; Model validation; UVAFME; Vegetation model; Climate change; biomass; carbon sequestration; climate change; coniferous tree; ecosystem service; forest dynamics; forest inventory; forest management; forestry modeling; individual-based model; model validation; vegetation structure; water retention; water storage; zonation; Rocky Mountains; Pinus contorta; Pinus ponderosa; Pseudotsuga; Pseudotsuga menziesii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015032197

As a consequence, a variety of new spatial development visions, strategies, plans and programmes are being developed by city governments in delta regions to address these risks and challenges. Based on a general conceptual framework, this paper examines the nature of visions, strategies, plans and programmes in the delta cities of Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Rotterdam which are highly exposed to flooding and connected through a network of epistemic communities. The paper follows two main lines of inquiry. First, it examines the terms, concepts, and dominant institutional characteristics associated with the development of these visions, strategies, plans and programmes as a way of constructing a conceptual framework for understanding and explaining their connectivity. Second, it explores how and why cities’ spatial plans and governance dynamics are shaping climate adaptation responses. The systematic development of conceptual frameworks and in-depth analyses of varied, representative case studies is needed as their findings have important implications for vulnerability and adaptation to climate change in terms of policy options and cities as the optimal level for adaptation. The paper finds that dominant institutional characteristics critically affect the steering capacity of organisations/agencies (including their coordination capacity) to address climate-related risks. The findings have important implications for vulnerability and adaptation to climate change in cities, in general and delta cities, in particular. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Delta cities; Flood risk management; Governance; Strategic spatial planning","adaptive management; climate change; flood control; governance approach; spatial planning; strategic approach; urban planning; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou; Hong Kong; Netherlands; Rotterdam; South Holland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953215118

However, greenhouse gas emission data from agroforestry systems are not available in the southeastern USA, thus limiting our ability to optimize agroforestry management strategies for the region. We hypothesized that tree-crop interactions could prevent excess N from being released to the atmosphere as nitrous oxide (N2O). We determined N2O and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, soil temperature, water content, and surface-soil inorganic N in an 8-year-old agroforestry site at the Center for Environmental Farming Systems in Goldsboro, North Carolina, USA. The experimental design was a factorial arrangement of soil texture (loamy sand, sandy loam, and clay loam) and canopy cover (cropped alley, margin between crops and trees, and under Pinus palustris, Pinus taeda, and Quercus pagoda) with three replications. Sampling occurred 42 times within a year using static, vented chambers exposed to the soil for 1-h periods. Soil N2O emission was lower under tree canopies than in cropped alleys, and margin areas were intermediate. Soil texture, water content, and inorganic N were key determinants of the magnitude of N2O emission. Soil CO2 emission was controlled by temperature and water content as expected, but surprisingly not by their interaction. Soil temperature was 1.8 ± 1.3 °C lower and soil water content was 0.043 ± 0.15 m3 m−3 lower under tree canopy than in cropped alleys, which helped to reduce CO2 emission under trees relative to that in cropped alleys. Our results provide a foundation for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in complex agricultural landscapes with varying soil texture by introducing timber production without abandoning agricultural operations. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).","Agroforestry; Carbon dioxide; Nitrous oxide; Pinus; Quercus; Soil texture","agricultural emission; agricultural management; agricultural soil; agroforestry; carbon emission; coniferous tree; deciduous tree; ecosystem service; experimental design; greenhouse gas; nitrous oxide; nutrient cycling; soil emission; soil texture; Goldsboro; North Carolina; United States; Pinus palustris; Pinus taeda; Quercus; Quercus pagoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994453224

Although energy limitation is often invoked as a basis for decreased calcification under ocean acidification, energy-relevant measurements related to this process are scant. In this study we focus on first-shell (prodissoconch I) formation in larvae of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. The energy cost of calcification was empirically derived to be≤.1 μJ (ng CaCO3)-1. Regardless of the saturation state of aragonite (2.77 vs. 0.77), larvae utilize the same amount of total energy to complete first-shell formation. Even though there was a 56% reduction of shell mass and an increase in dissolution at aragonite undersaturation, first-shell formation is not energy limited because sufficient endogenous reserves are available to meet metabolic demand. Further studies were undertaken on larvae from genetic crosses of pedigreed lines to test for variance in response to aragonite undersaturation. Larval families show variation in response to ocean acidification, with loss of shell size ranging from no effect to 28%. These differences show that resilience to ocean acidification may exist among genotypes. Combined studies of bioenergetics and genetics are promising approaches for understanding climate change impacts on marine organisms that undergo calcification. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2016.

Intense rainfall events, which are predicted to increase in frequency with changes in global climate, increase the risk of denitrification losses from agro-ecosystems. Nitrification inhibitors (NI) have been promoted to mitigate N losses, however their effect on total denitrification (N2 and N2O) and therefore their agronomic viability remains largely unknown. This study investigated the efficacy of the NI 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) to reduce N2 and N2O emissions after heavy rainfall from three pastures with different soil textures in subtropical Australia. Emissions of N2 and N2O were measured over three weeks following the application of 15N urea (36.8 kg N ha−1) with and without DMPP. An intense rainfall event was simulated 10 days after fertilization to create saturated conditions in the topsoil. Emissions of N2O decreased after day 1, reflecting a rapid shift towards complete denitrification. Unlike N2O, N2 fluxes responded to the rainfall event with peak fluxes up to 3.8 kg N2-N ha−1 day−1. The main product of denitrification was N2, which accounted for more than 95% of cumulative denitrification losses across sites. Cumulative N2 losses over 21 days remained below 4 kg N ha−1 for the well-drained sandy loam, while up to 28 kg N2-N ha−1 were emitted from the clay and loam soils, demonstrating N2 emissions as a major pathway of N loss from intensively managed pastures. The magnitude of N2 losses across pasture sites reflects the combined effect of reduced soil gas diffusivity and microbial oxygen consumption on denitrification. DMPP reduced these N2 losses by more than 70%, but had no effect on N2O emissions, providing the first field based evidence that DMPP can substantially reduce N2 emissions. The reduction of agronomically significant N2 losses highlights the potential of DMPP to mitigate the impact of increased rainfall intensity on denitrification losses thereby improving N use efficiency for intensively managed pastures. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Denitrification; DMPP; N2 emissions; N2O emissions; Nitrification inhibitor; Pastures","Agriculture; Denitrification; Nitrification; Soils; Urea; DMPP; Intense rainfalls; Intensive rainfall; Nitrification inhibitor; Oxygen consumption; Pastures; Rainfall intensity; Saturated conditions; Rain; agricultural ecosystem; chemical compound; denitrification; diffusivity; fertilizer application; inhibitor; land management; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; pasture; rainfall; reduction; soil chemistry; soil emission; soil gas; subtropical region; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012305497

This paper describes the effect of land-use change on the variation of urban net carbon emissions, and discusses the probable spatiotemporal impact on the dynamics of carbon emissions using coupled SD (system dynamics) and CLUE-S (the conversion of land use and its effects at small regional extent) models. The results show that: increase in construction land and decrease in agricultural land have positive and negative effects on land-use emissions, respectively; under the Basic Policy scenario, total net carbon emissions will continue to increase, from 39.43 to 80.28 Mt, with a decreasing growth rate; the increase/decrease in carbon emissions occurs mainly in urban–rural fringes and source water areas; the conversion of all land-use types to construction land is the main carbon source, while the conversion of agricultural land to ecological land is the main carbon sink. Two land-use strategies are suggested for the mitigation of carbon emissions in Shanghai. It is also shown that the coupled models are suitable for simulating and predicting spatiotemporal city-level net carbon emissions and are applicable to similar cities in developing countries. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","CLUE-S model; land-use change; scenario analysis; SD model; spatiotemporal dynamics; Urban net carbon emissions","Agriculture; Developing countries; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Urban growth; Carbon emissions; CLUE-S models; Land-use change; Scenario analysis; Sd models; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Land use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018166555

We showed that such changes in allometry need to be taken into account for estimating tree AGB in Masson pine. Context: As a native species and being widely distributed in subtropical China, Masson pine (Pinus massoniana Lamb.) forests play a pivotal role in maintaining forest ecosystem functions and mitigation of carbon concentration increase at the atmosphere. Traditional biomass allometric equations do not account for a potential effect of climate on the diameter–biomass relationships. The amplitude of such an effect remains poorly documented. Aims: We presented a novel method for detecting the long-term (2041–2080) effects of climate change on the diameter–biomass relationships and the potential consequences for long-term changes of biomass accumulation for Masson pine. Methods: Our approach was based on a climate-sensitive AGB model developed using a combined nonlinear mixed-effects model and dummy variable approach. Various climate-related variables were evaluated for their contributions to model improvement. Heteroscedasticity was accounted for by three residual variance functions: exponential function, power function, and constant plus function. Results: The results showed that diameter at breast height, together with the long-term average of growing season temperature, total growing season precipitation, mean temperature of wettest quarter, and precipitation of wettest quarter, had significant effects on values of AGB. Excessive rain during the growing season and high mean temperature in the wettest quarter reduced the AGB, while a warm growing season and abundant precipitation in the wettest quarter increased the AGB. Conclusion: Climate change significantly affected the allometric scale of biomass equation. The new climate-sensitive allometric model developed in this study may improve biomass predictions compared with the traditional model without climate effects. Our findings suggested that the AGB of Masson pine trees with the same diameter at breast height under three climate scenarios including representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5 in the future period 2041–2080 would increase by 24.8 ± 32.7% (mean ± standard deviation), 27.0 ± 33.4%, and 27.7 ± 33.8% compared with the constant climate (1950–2000), respectively. As a consequence, we may expect a significant regional variability and uncertainty in biomass estimates under climate change. © 2017, INRA and Springer-Verlag France.","Climate change; Climate-sensitive aboveground biomass model; Dummy variable approach; Masson pine; Nonlinear mixed-effects model; Subtropical China","aboveground biomass; allometry; climate change; concentration (composition); coniferous tree; forest ecosystem; native species; regional climate; subtropical region; uncertainty analysis; China; Pinus massoniana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019433179

However, the performance of eco and low-carbon cities in China has long been heatedly debated, with many negative arguments delineating them as profit-seeking and image-building projects simply capped with impressive names. In reality, while some projects have not fulfilled expectations, most are still at the first stage of construction, so it is too early to regard eco and low-carbon cities as a failure. In this paper, the question of how eco and low-carbon new towns differ from conventional ones in their social, environmental and economic characteristics is posed. Compared to conventional new town plans, the eco and low-carbon city plans incorporate more of a focus on sustainability principles. We examine such perceptions by comparing the master plans of eco, low-carbon and conventional new towns in various aspects ranging from general principles to specific design. The analysis indicates the master plans of the three groups of new towns vary in different ways. The eco-cities and low-carbon cities reflect two trends to promote urban sustainability. The eco new towns are more concerned with the promotion of a sustainable way of life, with its planning focus evenly distributed among all aspects. They particularly stress the creation of an aesthetically pleasing livable environment. In contrast, low-carbon new towns are concerned with the promotion of a sustainable way of production, with an uneven emphasis on the economic sectors such as industrial integration and transformation. However, the master plans only reveal how eco/low-carbon cities are originally intended to differ from non-eco/low-carbon-cities when they start and more comprehensive studies are needed for it to be possible to predict where they will go in the future. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Content analysis; Eco-cities; Low-carbon cities; Master plan; New town development; Nvivo; Sustainability","carbon emission; comparative study; emission control; sustainability; sustainable development; town planning; urban planning; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016077829

One of the objectives of these strategies is to stimulate the development of new energy technologies or the improvement of the efficiency of the current generation schemes. This work evaluates the impact of carbon policies on the design of combined heat and power systems (CHP) involving biogas usage. This paper presents a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model for designing a CHP system interconnected to the grid that allows selecting and sizing the prime mover and the thermal storage tank for supplying the energy demand in a housing complex. A case study from Mexico is presented, where the multiobjective problem presents different strategies used for monetizing the externalities associated with the carbon dioxide emissions, which are compared with the results of using compromise solutions. The results show that the strategies of monetization do not have a significant effect on the design and they do not result in an incentive for biogas consumption. On the other hand, the compromise solutions result in a trade-off between the economic and environmental objectives and they stimulate the developing of local biogas markets. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","Biogas; Carbon policies; Cogeneration; Combined heat and power; Multiobjective optimization","Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Cooling systems; Economic and social effects; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Heat storage; Integer programming; Multiobjective optimization; Nonlinear programming; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon policy; Cogeneration; Combined heat and power; Combined heat and power system; Environmental objectives; Mixed integer nonlinear programming models; Multi-objective problem; Cogeneration plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018430723

Over the past twenty years, normative disagreements about appropriate behavior have shaped international governance of the phenomenon. Prior to 2007, firms lobbied governments to treat the oceans as a carbon sink and to allow corporations that dumped iron to sell carbon credits on the international market. However, after 2007 a transnational coalition of oceanographers and advocates opposed this agenda by linking it to an emergent antigeoengineering discourse. Crucial to their efforts was their interpretation of uncertainty: for opponents, scientific uncertainty implied possibly devastating consequences of iron dumping, which was thus best addressed with extreme caution. This normative approach ultimately shaped governance, since advocates successfully used it to lobby institutions in ocean governance to prevent carbon credits from being issued for ocean fertilization. Since these subjective understandings of certainty influenced global ocean governance, this article explains international behavior as a consequence of changing norms. © 2017 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"carbon sink; climate change; development discourse; global ocean; governance approach; growth rate; international aid; iron; lobbying; plankton; pollution tax",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018409417

Using three different methods to calculate river water levels and discharges, the potential power generation by MHP was estimated for six rivers in Beppu City. New hydrological insights Our results show that installation of MHP facilities can provide stable electricity for tens to hundreds of residents in local communities along the rivers. However, the results are based on the existing infrastructure, such as roads and electric lines. This means that greater potential is expected if additional infrastructures are built to develop further MHP facilities. On the other hand, in Japan, river laws and irrigation right regulations currently restrict new entry by actors to rivers. Therefore, to further develop MHP, deregulation of the existing laws relevant to rivers and further incentives for business owners of MHP facilities, along with the current feed-in tariffs, are required. Meanwhile, possible influences to riverine ecosystems when installing new MHP facilities should also be taken into account. © 2015 The Authors","Discharge; Generated power; Hot spring water; Mini/micro hydropower (MHP); Riverine ecosystem; Water level",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949034399

Due to the difference in the physical properties of hydrogen compared to other fuels such as natural gas, well-established gas turbine combustion systems cannot be directly applied to dry low NOx (DLN) hydrogen combustion. The DLN micromix combustion of hydrogen has been under development for many years, since it has the promise to significantly reduce NOx emissions. This combustion principle for air-breathing engines is based on crossflow mixing of air and gaseous hydrogen. Air and hydrogen react in multiple miniaturized diffusion-type flames with an inherent safety against flashback and with low NOx emissions due to a very short residence time of the reactants in the flame region. The paper presents an advanced DLN micromix hydrogen application. The experimental and numerical study shows a combustor configuration with a significantly reduced number of enlarged fuel injectors with high-thermal power output at constant energy density. Larger fuel injectors reduce manufacturing costs, are more robust and less sensitive to fuel contamination and blockage in industrial environments. The experimental and numerical results confirm the successful application of high-energy injectors, while the DLN micromix characteristics of the design point, under part-load conditions, and under off-design operation are maintained. Atmospheric test rig data on NOx emissions, optical flame-structure, and combustor material temperatures are compared to numerical simulations and show good agreement.

The purpose of this work is to promote awareness of the impacts, not only economically but also those to cultural properties. Public and private organizations show little interest in introduce projects that consider variable of risks impacts of climate change on cultural heritage. Even when the intensity of extreme climate events impacts are increasing every year, both the national infrastructure and the cultural heritage. This work intends to highlights the importance of adaptation and prevention of the effects of climate, particularly those examples of heritage that are related to cultural musical activity, such as documentary collections of sheet music, and musical instruments. Many properties of cultural heritage are at risk of deterioration due to environmental degradation and global warming. Consider that impacts in isolation are not enough to know their effects in the cultural field. Better understanding and management of risks demands an integral vision for preserving both historical buildings such as concert halls and the conditions for the musical instruments that kept within their walls. In conclusion, climate impacts to society, for better or for worse, and climate change can definitely affect our own political, economic and social future.

These vehicles are often seen as a means of reducing climate and health damaging emissions, and their development is directly supported by some countries and endorsed by the EU. Aside from questions of rebound effects, embedded emissions and cleanness of electricity generation, there are unanswered questions about the energy performance of such cars under a range of driving conditions, and the results of existing studies are not easily interpretable by policymakers and drivers. This study uses the results of extensive dynamometer tests on eight commonly sold electric vehicles. It develops a multivariate model, with regression coefficients around 0.97, to map power demand and energy consumption for all likely combinations of speed and acceleration, producing accessible, easily interpretable displays. While electric vehicles are frequently marketed on the basis of their high acceleration, an important finding is that episodes of modest to high acceleration severely compromise their range and energy efficiency, regardless of speed. This also raises questions as to how well such vehicles perform in the erratic driving conditions of urban traffic. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Car acceleration; Dynamometer tests; Electric vehicles; Transport energy consumption","Acceleration; Dynamometers; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Energy utilization; Vehicles; Driving conditions; Electricity generation; Energy performance; High acceleration; Multivariate modeling; Rebound effect; Regression coefficient; Transport energy; Energy efficiency; automobile; electric vehicle; electricity generation; energy efficiency; energy use; urban transport; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018300767

Since the hydrogen bonds are formed between H2O and oxygen functional group, the H2O cluster more easily adsorbs on the coal micropore than CO2 molecule. The coal micropores are occupied by H2O molecules that cannot provide extra space for CO2 adsorption, which may leads to the reduction of CO2 adsorption capacity. However, without considering factors of micropore and oxygen functional groups, the co-adsorption mechanisms of CO2 and adsorbed H2O molecule are not clear. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the effect of adsorbed H2O to CO2 adsorption. This study reports some typical coal-H2O···CO2 complexes, along with a detailed analysis of the geometry, energy, electrostatic potential (ESP), atoms in molecules (AIM), reduced density gradient (RDG), and energy decomposition analysis (EDA). The results show that H2O molecule can more stably adsorb on the aromatic ring surface than CO2 molecule, and the absolute values of local ESP maximum and minimum of H2O cluster are greater than CO2. AIM analysis shows a detailed interaction path and strength between atoms in CO2 and H2O, and RDG analysis shows that the interactions among CO2, H2O, and coal model belong to weak van der Waals force. EDA indicates that electrostatic and long-range dispersion terms play a primary role in the co-adsorption of CO2 and H2O. According to the DFT calculated results without considering micropore structure and functional group, it is shown that the adsorbed H2O can promote CO2 adsorption on the coal surface. These results demonstrate that the micropore factor plays a dominant role in affecting CO2 adsorption capacity, the attractive interaction of adsorbed H2O to CO2 makes little contribution. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Atoms in molecules; CO2 adsorption; DFT simulation; Electrostatic potential; Energy decomposition analysis; H2O adsorption; Reduced density gradient","carbon dioxide; coal; water; adsorption kinetics; Article; decomposition; density functional theory; density gradient; dispersion; priority journal; static electricity; surface property",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019263940

However, this condition is used for isolation in the laboratory because it is considered a necessary property for pathogenesis. In this context, revealing how gene expression enables V. parahaemolyticus to adapt to this particular condition -common to almost all V. parahaemolyticus isolates- will improve our understanding of the biology of this important pathogen. To determine the genes of V. parahaemolyticus differentially expressed when growing in isolation condition (37 °C, 0.9% NaCl, and 0.04% bile salts) referred to those at the temperature and salt concentration prevailing in ocean south of Chile (marine-like condition; 12 °C, 3% NaCl, and absence of bile salts) we used high-throughput sequencing of RNA. Results: Our results showed that in the isolation condition, among the 5034 genes annotated in the V. parahaemolyticus RIMD2210633 genome, 344 were upregulated and 433 downregulated referred to the marine-like condition, managing an adjusted P-value (Padj) < E−5. Between the 50 more highly expressed genes, among the small RNAs (sRNA), the three carbon storage regulators B (CsrB) were up four to six times, while RyhB, related to iron metabolism besides motility control, was down about eight times. Among proteins, BfdA, a hemolysin-co-regulated protein (Hcp1) secreted by T6SS1, one of the most highly expressed genes, was about 140 times downregulated in isolation condition. The highest changes in relative expression were found among neighboring genes coding for proteins related to respiration, which were about 40 times upregulated. Conclusions: When V. parahaemolyticus is grown in conditions used for laboratory isolation 777 genes are up- or downregulated referred to conditions prevailing in the marine-like condition; the most significantly overrepresented categories among upregulated processes were those related to transport and localization, while secretion and pathogenesis were overrepresented among downregulated genes. Genes with the highest differential expression included the sRNAs CsrB and RhyB and the mRNAs related with secretion, nutritional upshift, respiration and rapid growing. © 2017 The Author(s).","Bioinformatics; Genome; mRNA; RNA seq; sRNA; Vibrio parahaemolyticus","Article; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bacterium isolation; BfdA gene; carbon storage; controlled study; CsrB gene; down regulation; gene expression; gene location; gene sequence; Hcp1 gene; iron metabolism; nonhuman; RyhB gene; upregulation; Vibrio parahaemolyticus; chemistry; Chile; culture medium; environment; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; high throughput screening; isolation and purification; microbiology; nucleotide sequence; pathogenicity; physiology; sea; secretion (process); sequence alignment; temperature; Vibrio parahaemolyticus; vibriosis; bacterial protein; bacterial RNA; sea water; Bacterial Proteins; Base Sequence; Chile; Culture Media; Environment; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Genes, Bacterial; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Oceans and Seas; RNA, Bacterial; Seawater; Sequence Alignment; Temperature; Vibrio Infections; Vibrio parahaemolyticus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019966541

The selected case study, a Community Centre located in London, underwent a deep-energy retrofit in 2011, becoming the first ‘non-domestic Passivhaus’ retrofit in the country. As the building was retrofitted per Passivhaus standards, which is based solely on First Law analysis, a thermodynamic investigation can provide a novel means by which to assess its exergy efficiency and cost-effectiveness. As such, the aim of this paper is to conduct a comprehensive exergy and exergoeconomic analysis, presenting novel performance indicators for the pre-retrofit and post-retrofit Passivhaus building. First law outputs show that the improvement presents high levels of energy savings (75.6%), reductions in carbon emissions (64.5%), and occupant thermal comfort improvement (28.8%). Second law outputs present a reduction in primary exergy input reduction of 56.4% and exergy destructions of 60.4%, leading to improve building exergy efficiency from 9.8% to 18.0%. Nevertheless, exergoeconomically the building did not perform as expected due to high capital cost and exergy destructions cost rates. These results give an insight into the thermodynamic impact of the Passivhaus approach, providing a critical assessment of the strengths and limitations of the standard under both thermodynamic laws. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Building simulation; Energy; Exergoeconomics; Exergy; Passivhaus; Retrofits","Buildings; Cost effectiveness; Energy conservation; Exergy; Retrofitting; Building simulation; Energy; Exergoeconomics; Passivhaus; Retrofits; Cost benefit analysis; building; energy efficiency; exergy; thermodynamic property; England; London [England]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014871702

The coupled Community Multiscale Air Quality Bidirectional and Environmental Policy Integrated Climate modeling system incorporates agricultural management practices and N exchange processes between the soil and atmosphere to estimate levels of N that may volatilize into the atmosphere, re-deposit, and seep or flow into surface and groundwater. Simulated values from this modeling system were used in a land-use regression model to examine associations between groundwater nitrate-N measurements and a suite of factors related to N fertilizer and groundwater nitrate contamination. Multi-variable modeling analysis revealed that the N-fertilizer rate (versus total) applied to irrigated (versus rainfed) grain corn (versus other crops) was the strongest N-related predictor variable of groundwater nitrate-N concentrations. Application of this multi-variable model considered groundwater nitrate-N concentration responses under two corn production scenarios. Findings suggest that increased corn production between 2002 and 2022 could result in 56% to 79% increase in areas vulnerable to groundwater nitrate-N concentrations ≥ 5 mg/L. These above-threshold areas occur on soils with a hydraulic conductivity 13% higher than the rest of the domain. Additionally, the average number of animal feeding operations (AFOs) for these areas was nearly 5 times higher, and the mean N-fertilizer rate was 4 times higher. Finally, we found that areas prone to high groundwater nitrate-N concentrations attributable to the expansion scenario did not occur in new grid cells of irrigated grain-corn croplands, but were clustered around areas of existing corn crops. This application demonstrates the value of the coupled modeling system in developing spatially refined multi-variable models to provide information for geographic locations lacking complete observational data; and in projecting possible groundwater nitrate-N concentration outcomes under alternative future crop production scenarios. © 2017","Agricultural impacts; Biosphere modeling; Groundwater quality; Regression modeling","Agriculture; Air quality; Case based reasoning; Crops; Cultivation; Environmental protection; Fertilizers; Grain (agricultural product); Groundwater; Land use; Multivariable systems; Nitrates; Nitrogen fertilizers; Regression analysis; Water quality; Agricultural impacts; Agricultural management practice; Animal feeding operation (AFOs); Biosphere models; Community multi-scale air qualities; Environmental policy integrated climate models; Land-use regression models; Regression model; Groundwater pollution; alcohol; ground water; nitrate; nitrogen fertilizer; biosphere; concentration (composition); crop production; groundwater pollution; maize; modeling; nitrate; regression analysis; water quality; agricultural management; animal feeding operation; Article; atmosphere; coupled modeling system; crop production; environmental impact assessment; feeding; hydraulic conductivity; irrigation (agriculture); land use; leaching; maize; multivariate analysis; nonhuman; predictor variable; proportional hazards model; soil; statistical model; volatilization; water quality; Animalia; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012292698

Two downscaling approaches: direct and indirect, two versions: SP and surrounding pixel information and three functional forms: linear regression, quantile regression and generalized additive models are considered to prepare the method ensemble. To evaluate method performance, a leave-one-out cross-validation approach is adopted. Results indicate that SP method and its variants have comparable skill to SDSM. Further method skill is found to be only marginally influenced by the choice of method version and functional form, and considerably influenced by the choice of approach.

However, the attribution of vulnerability to CC alone may misdirect these programs because it is only one of multiple factors that affect rural livelihoods. Therefore, it is important to examine how CC interacts with historical socioeconomic, institutional and biophysical structures, as well as current policies and development to shape vulnerability. In this paper, we assessed the role of CC on food insecurity in the context of multiple interacting stressors in Humla district in west Nepal. Results suggested that the major features of climatic variabilities pertinent to food security included increasing dry spells, delayed monsoon and more frequent extreme events having direct negative impacts on agriculture. However, the most significant agricultural impacts were induced by socio-institutional changes. Environmental management through a community forestry program regulated livestock population, decreased manure supply to farms and significantly decreased soil productivity. This was synergized by a recent trend of school attendance among the young population which led to farm labor shortage and poor land management. Due to unequal land distribution, the low-caste households were more food insecure than households in higher tiers of the caste hierarchy. Their preexisting deprivation led to the adoption of modest or counterproductive coping strategies which would make them more vulnerable to future shocks. From these findings, we conclude that although CC is critical, it is not the only or the most significant factor of vulnerability. Its impacts are pre-configured by social relations, antecedent entitlement distributions and concurrent socio-institutional changes. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Caste inequality; Climate change; Food security; Multiple stressors; Nepal",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011580076

However, species’ range shifts are often idiosyncratic and inconsistent with climatic shift predictions. At the community scale, this discrepancy can be measured by comparing the spatial shift in the relative composition of cold- vs. warm-adapted species in a local assemblage [the community temperature index (CTI)] with the spatial shift in temperature isotherms. While the local distribution of climate change velocity is a promising approach to downscaling climate change pressure and responses, CTI velocity has only been investigated on a continental or national scale. In this study, we coupled French Breeding Bird Survey data, collected from 2133 sites monitored between 2001 and 2012, with climatic data in order to estimate the local magnitude and direction of breeding season temperature shift, CTI shift, and their spatiotemporal divergence – the local climatic debt. We also tested whether landscape characteristics that are known to affect climate velocity and spatial tracking of climate change mediated the climatic debt on the local scale. We found a clear spatial structure, together with heterogeneity in both temperature and CTI spatial shifts. Local climatic debt decreased as the elevation, habitat diversity, and the naturalness of the landscape increased. These results suggest the complementary effects of the local topographic patterns sheltering more diverse microclimates and the increasing permeability of natural and diversified landscape. Our findings suggest that a more nuanced evaluation of spatial variability in climatic and biotic shifts is necessary in order to properly describe biodiversity responses to climate change rather than the oversimplified descriptions of uniform poleward shifts. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; community temperature index; directionality; habitat; isotherm shifts; temperature; velocity","biodiversity; bird; climate change; climate effect; habitat structure; landscape; temperature effect; topography; Aves; animal; biodiversity; bird; climate change; ecosystem; season; Animals; Biodiversity; Birds; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991471658

Then, a carbon-emissions inventory of these villages was conducted, collecting data on the emissions-activity levels and emissions factors. Finally, a method of evaluating the villages’ carbon emissions was developed. Meanwhile, four types of landforms (mountains, hills, plains and islands) and eight villages with different industry types in the Yangtze River Delta region were selected for the case study and evaluation of carbon emissions. These villages’ carbon emissions had a range of 1.302–3.296 t per capita, except for Xinligang, which had the highest emissions, at 36.206 t per capita. The mountain villages had the highest carbon sinks (0.7–1.89 t per capita), while the sinks of villages in other landforms were much lower (0–0.43 t per capita). Based on the evaluation results, the villages’ carbon emissions were divided into four types. The villages’ characteristics were analysed according to the different types of carbon emissions, and then optimisation suggestions to reduce emissions and increase sinks were proposed.

Here, we quantified the geographical distribution of evergreen versus deciduous broad-leaved tree species in subtropical China. The Relative Importance Value index (RIV) was used to examine regional patterns in tree species dominance and was related to three key climatic variables: mean annual temperature (MAT), minimum temperature of the coldest month (MinT), and mean annual precipitation (MAP). We found the RIV of evergreen species to decrease with latitude at a lapse rate of 10% per degree between 23.5 and 25°N, 1% per degree at 25–29.1°N, and 15% per degree at 29.1–34°N. The RIV of evergreen species increased with: MinT at a lapse rate of 10% per °C between −4.5 and 2.5°C and 2% per °C at 2.5–10.5°C; MAP at a lapse rate of 10% per 100 mm between 900 and 1,600 mm and 4% per 100 mm between 1,600 and 2,250 mm. All selected climatic variables cumulatively explained 71% of the geographical variation in dominance of evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved tree species and the climatic variables, ranked in order of decreasing effects were as follows: MinT > MAP > MAT. We further proposed that the latitudinal limit of evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved mixed forests was 29.1–32°N, corresponding with MAT of 11–18.1°C, MinT of −2.5 to 2.51°C, and MAP of 1,000–1,630 mm. This study is the first quantitative assessment of climatic correlates with the evergreenness and deciduousness of broad-leaved forests in subtropical China and underscores that extreme cold temperature is the most important climatic determinant of evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved tree species’ distributions, a finding that confirms earlier qualitative studies. Our findings also offer new insight into the definition and distribution of the mixed forest and an accurate assessment of vulnerability of mixed forests to future climate change. © 2017 The Authors.

One of the goals of classification was to get beyond urban-rural dichotomy which enabled to study urban air temperature field in more detail. Based on empirical and modelling work LCZ have proven effective in examining intra-urban air temperature differences, however a robust examination of intra-urban land surface temperatures using the LCZ framework remains elusive. In this study a GIS-based method is used for LCZ delimitation in Prague and Brno (Czech Republic), while land surface temperatures (LSTs) derived from LANDSAT and ASTER satellite data are employed for exploring the extent to which LCZ classes discriminate with respect to LSTs. Results indicate that LCZs demonstrate the features typical of LST variability, and thus typical surface temperatures differ significantly among most LCZs. ANOVA and subsequent multiple comparison tests demonstrated that significant temperature differences between the various LCZs prevail in both cities (89.3% and 91.6% significant LST differences for Brno and Prague respectively). In general, LCZ 8 (large low-rise buildings), LCZ 10 (heavy industry) and LCZ D (low plants) are well-distinguishable, while LCZ 2 (compact midrise), LCZ 4 (open high-rise), and LCZ 9 (sparsely built-up) are less distinguishable in terms of their LST. In most of the scenes LCZ 10 (heavy industry), LCZ 2 (mid-rise buildings) and LCZ 3 (low-rise building) are the warmest and LCZ G (water bodies) and LCZ A (dense forest) are the coolest zones in term of their LST. Further studies are needed to account for observational errors (such as seasons differences or thermal anisotropy) on LCZ LST patterns. © 2017 IEEE.","Analysis of variance; ASTER; Land Surface Temperature; LANDSAT; Local Climate Zones","Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Climatology; Remote sensing; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Urban growth; ASTER; Land surface temperature; LANDSAT; Local climate; Multiple comparison test; Surface temperatures; Temperature differences; Urban land surface temperature; Atmospheric temperature",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020206607

If the air quality is low and pollutants are difficult to diffuse, few additional emissions should be allowed to avoid further deteriorating the air quality. Wind power helps reducing pollution levels as it substitutes polluting thermal production. However, wind and air pollution are generally anti-correlated. Storage can be used to shift wind power production from hours when higher pollution levels are allowed to hours when lower pollution levels are allowed to help meeting emission constraints at critical hours. Storage availability also achieves a comparatively lower production cost for the system as a whole. To represent the stochastic nature of wind power production and weather-dependent emission limits, the authors propose a two-stage stochastic programming model to analyse the trade-off emission versus cost in an electric energy system with storage facilities. The first stage represents the day-ahead scheduling, while the second one represents the real-time operation under different scenarios. The authors analyse the impact of emission limits and/or storage on generation scheduling by comparing different models using an illustrative example and a case study based on the IEEE 118-node system. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.",,"Air quality; Electric power systems; Pollution; Scheduling; Stages; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Thermal pollution; Wind power; Day-ahead scheduling; Electric energy systems; Emission constraints; Generation scheduling; Real-time operation; Stochastic scheduling; Two-stage stochastic programming; Wind power production; Stochastic models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021831095

Using transactional data, we analyzed annual spending by private and public organizations on commercial weather and climate information in more than 180 countries by industrial sector, region, per capita, and percentage of GDP (gross domestic product) and against the country's climate and extreme weather risk. There are major imbalances regarding access to these essential services between different countries based on region and development status. There is also no relationship between the level of climate and weather risks that a country faces and the level of per capita spending on commercial weather and climate information in that country.

Moreover, the study is carried out a significant recommendation to improve the SDHW performance, decrease the gas energy consumption and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The SDHW performance depends mainly on DHW flow rate, draw time and duration, city water temperature, DHW recirculation loop control strategy and system layout. The performance analysis results show that 91.5% of the collected solar energy is transferred to the DHW heating load through the solar tank.

Coal fly ash and mine tailings include a conglomerate of heavy metals such as Cr, Pb, Hg, As, Ni, Cd, Cu, Mn, and Fe depending on the source of coal/ore and cause large-scale ecotoxicity. Unreclaimed mine tailing sites and coal fly ash dumpsites are a worldwide problem, presenting a source of contamination for nearby communities. The disposal sites are subject to erosion and are major causes of air pollution. Phytoremediation using plants for in situ stabilization and immobilization of these heavy metal-contaminated sites has gained momentum in the past few decades due to its cost-effectiveness and environmental sustainability. In this regard, the use of grasses is of prime importance due to their rapid growth, large biomass, resistance to phytotoxicity, and genotoxicity by heavy metals as compared to herbs, shrubs, and trees. Phytostabilization by the compact root system of grasses retards the formation, mobility, and bioavailability of hazardous leachates by high uptake and accumulation of the complex mixtures of heavy metals within them. Such grasses prevent natural succession by weeds and other plants leading to safe grazing by animals. Among the members of Poaceae, aromatic grasses are economically important plants due to their essential oil production. They rank higher than edible grasses, which are susceptible to heavy metal contamination in their edible parts. Various biochemical and molecular mechanisms govern the ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) of heavy metal contaminants in grasses growing in mine tailings and fly ash dumpsites. Metal-binding phytochelatins, metallothioneins, and antioxidant enzymes have key functions in these mechanisms. This chapter encompasses the role of members of Poaceae and aromatic grasses in phytoremediation of mine soil and coal fly ash with emphasis on their biochemical and molecular mechanisms. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Aromatic grass; Fly ash; Heavy metals; Mine tailings; Phytoremediation; Poaceae",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033585653

Accurate separation of the Galactic foregrounds therefore binds this quest to our understanding of the magnetized interstellar medium. The two most relevant empirical results from analysis of Planck data are line of sight depolarization arising from fluctuations of the Galactic magnetic field orientation and alignment of filamentary dust structures with the magnetic field at high Galactic latitude. Furthermore, Planck and Hi emission data in combination indicate that most of the filamentary dust structures are in the cold neutral medium. The goal of this paper is to test whether these salient observational results, taken together, can account fully for the statistical properties of the dust polarization over a selected low column density region comprising 34% of the southern Galactic cap (b ≤ -30°). To do this, we construct a dust model that incorporates Hi column density maps as tracers of the dust intensity structures and a phenomenological description of the Galactic magnetic field. By adjusting the parameters of the dust model, we were able to reproduce the Planck dust observations at 353 GHz in the selected region. Realistic simulations of the polarized dust emission enabled by such a dust model are useful for testing the accuracy of component separation methods, studying non-Gaussianity, and constraining the amount of decorrelation with frequency. © ESO 2017.","Dust extinction; Galaxy: general; ISM: magnetic fields; ISM: structure; Polarization; Submillimeter: ISM","Cosmology; Magnetic fields; Polarization; Dust extinctions; Galaxy: general; ISM: magnetic fields; ISM: structure; Submillimeter: isms; Dust",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019139032

Big data is said to transform city governments into being more efficient, effective and evidence-based. However, critics point towards the limited capacity of government to overcome the siloed structure of data storage and manage the diverse stakeholders involved in setting up a data ecosystem. On the basis of this, the paper investigates the challenges city governments face when dealing with big data in the context of carbon emission reduction. Through the lens of the evidence-based policy and policy capacity literature, the cities of Copenhagen (Denmark), London (UK), Malmö (Sweden), Oxford (UK) and Vienna (Austria) are analysed. The cases reveal that the institutional complexity underlying big data integration limits local government capacity to set up data management structures that would allow further utilization of big data and that current solutions focus on local pilot sites and outsourcing of data analytics. © 2017 The Author(s).

At the UNFCCC (Conference of the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change) held in Paris in December 2015 Indonesia committed to reduce GHG; one way by promoting clean energy use for example biogas. Agricultural industry produces organic waste which contributes to global warming and climate change. In Karo District, mostly the people were farmers, either horticulture or fruit and produces massive organic waste. Biogas research was conducted in Karo District in May until July 2016 used 5 biodigesters. The purpose was to determine benefits of using biogas technology in order to reduct GHG emissions. The used design was Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with treatments: T1 (100% cow feces), T2 (75% cow feces + 25% horticultural waste), T3 (50% cow feces + 50% horticultural waste), T4 (25% cow feces + 75% horticultural waste) and T5 (100% horticultural waste). Parameter research were gas production, pH and temperature. The research result showed that T1 produced the highest methane ( P&lt;0.05) compared to other treatments while T2 produced methane higher (P&lt;0.05) compared to T4 or T5. There was no difference on methane production between T4 and T5.

This living lab aims at testing the ability of the alluvial deposits of the north-western Po Plain to store the thermal energy collected by solar thermal panels and the efficiency of energy storage systems in this climatic context. Different monitoring approaches have been tested and analyzed since the start of the thermal injection in April 2014. Underground temperature monitoring is constantly undertaken by means of several temperature sensors located along the borehole heat exchangers and within the hydraulic circuit. Nevertheless, this can provide only pointwise information about underground temperature distribution. For this reason, a geophysical approach is proposed in order to image the thermally affected zone (TAZ) caused by the heat injection: surface electrical resistivity measurements were carried out with this purpose. In the present paper, results of time-lapse acquisitions during a heating day are reported with the aim of imaging the thermal plume evolution within the subsoil. Resistivity data, calibrated on local temperature measurements, have shown their potentiality in imaging the heated plume of the system and depicting its evolution throughout the day. Different types of data processing were adopted in order to face issues mainly related to a highly urbanized environment. The use of apparent resistivity proved to be in valid agreement with the results of different inversion approaches. The inversion processes did not significantly improve the qualitative and quantitative TAZ imaging in comparison to the pseudo-sections. This suggested the usefulness of apparent resistivity data alone for a rough monitoring of TAZ in this kind of applications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Borehole Thermal Energy Storage; Electrical resistivity; Thermally affected zone","Ability testing; Data handling; Electric conductivity; Energy storage; Heat storage; Hydraulic equipment; Hydraulic machinery; Imaging techniques; Soils; Temperature distribution; Temperature measurement; Temperature sensors; Thermal energy; Apparent resistivity; Borehole heat exchangers; Borehole thermal energy storage; Electrical resistivity imaging; Electrical resistivity measurements; Energy storage systems; Local temperature measurements; Underground temperature; Digital storage; alluvial deposit; borehole; data processing; electrical resistivity; imaging method; thermal power; Italy; Piedmont [Italy]; Torino [Piedmont]; Turin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017197619

Tunable and reproducible culture conditions are crucial for the study of environment-sensitive cells, and can also be used for mimicking pathophysiological conditions related with alterations of temperature, pressure and pH. Here, we present the SUITE (Supervising Unit for In Vitro Testing) system, a platform able to monitor and adjust local environmental variables in dynamic cell culture experiments. The physical core of the control system is a mixing chamber, which can be connected to different bioreactors and acts as a media reservoir equipped with a pH meter and pressure sensors. The chamber is heated by external resistive elements and the temperature is controlled using a thermistor. A purpose-built electronic control unit gathers all data from the sensors and controls the pH and hydrostatic pressure by regulating air and CO2 overpressure and flux. The system's modularity and the possibility of imposing different pressure conditions were used to implement a model of portal hypertension with both endothelial and hepatic cells. The results show that the SUITE platform is able to control and maintain cell culture parameters at fixed values that represent either physiological or pathological conditions. Thus, it represents a fundamental tool for the design of biomimetic in vitro models, with applications in disease modelling or toxicity testing. © 2017 by the authors.","Bioreactors; Environmental control; In vitro models; Portal hypertension models",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034236362

Drawing on a vast array of literature and personal experiences, this review analyzed particular features and challenges that REDD+ implementation has faced on the continent. The distinct contexts and major challenges regarding governance, finance and technical capacities are discussed, and mechanisms to fill these gaps are suggested. Radical land tenure reform and a perfect safeguard mechanism that transfers forest land and carbon to the communities are unlikely. REDD+ should rather look for systems that respect local institutional arrangements, and allow forest-based communities to participate in decision-making and benefit sharing, particularly benefits from emerging REDD+. Finances for REDD+ infrastructure and the results-based payment are in short supply. While negotiating for potential external sources in the short term, Africa should generate domestic financial resources and look for additional payments for ecosystem services. Africa should also negotiate for forest monitoring capacity building, while strengthening local community forest monitoring. This review contributes to an improved understanding of the contexts and challenges to consider in the capacity and policy development for REDD+ implementation. © 2017 The Authors.

However, plant expansion and carbon uptake substantially predate glaciation. Here we use climate and carbon cycle simulations to investigate the potential effects of the uplift of the equatorial Hercynian mountains and the assembly of Pangaea on the late Palaeozoic carbon cycle. In our simulations, mountain uplift during the Late Carboniferous caused an increase in physical weathering that removed the thick soil cover that had inhibited silicate weathering. The resulting increase in chemical weathering was sufficient to cause atmospheric CO 2 concentrations to fall below the levels required to initiate glaciation. During the Permian, the lowering of the mountains led to a re-establishment of thick soils, whilst the assembly of Pangaea promoted arid conditions in continental interiors that were unfavourable for silicate weathering. These changes allowed CO 2 concentrations to rise to levels sufficient to terminate the glacial event. Based on our simulations, we suggest that tectonically influenced carbon cycle changes during the late Palaeozoic were sufficient to initiate and terminate the late Palaeozoic ice age. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Mx., C.P. 04510, Mexico","Climate change and land use/land cover change (LULCC) are associated with local vulnerability, defined as the intrinsic tendency of a system to be negatively affected by an event or phenomenon, but this can be ameliorated by ecosystem conservation. In Mexico, extensive Wildlife Management Units (eWMUs) are environmental policy instruments designed to promote ecosystem conservation and rural development via the sustainable use of wildlife by local populations. However, evidence of the successful reduction of LULCC by eWMUs is contradictory, and there has been no investigation into their potential as an action to promote climate change adaptation. In this study, we focused on the overall patterns of LULCC associated with eWMU throughout the country and examined strengths and weaknesses of eWMUs as policy instruments to address climate change. In particular, we analyzed how differences in areas with eWMUs influence LULCC and assessed how eWMUs could contribute to reducing vulnerability, particularly in double exposure municipalities. We calculated the percentage of eWMUs per municipality from official information and estimated LULCC from vegetation changes between 2002 and 2011. We then used the Kruskal-Wallis test to find statistically significant differences in vegetation changes based on the percentage of eWMUs and performed between-group comparisons using a post hoc Dunn test. Although Mexico has 2456 municipalities, only 37% have eWMUs. Furthermore, 64% of Mexico's municipalities have lost vegetation cover, whereas only 36% have either gained vegetation or remained stable. In municipalities that recorded changes to the vegetation, those changes were, overall, minimal and involved less than 10% of the total area of those municipalities. In general, municipalities with less than 10% of their total area dedicated to eWMUs experienced higher vegetation losses than those with more than 10% of their total area dedicated to eWMUs. We detected twelve double exposure municipalities, i.e. they are vulnerable to climate change and lost more than 10% of their vegetation. Double exposure municipalities dedicated less than 2% of their total area to eWMUs as well. Our results suggest that incremental increases in the area dedicated to eWMUs may reduce LULCC and protect vegetation, particularly in double exposure municipalities. Based on the literature, some ecological, economic and socio-cultural factors may determine the success of eWMUs and strongly impact LULCC. Therefore, additional efforts must be made to enhance our understanding of ecological and climatic processes; habitats must be monitored using a standardized methodology; biological, cultural, economic and institutional diversity must be incorporated into the planning, implementation and monitoring of eWMUs; and agreements must be established to strengthen social organization and human capital. Taking all this into account, we suggest that reducing vulnerability and improving double exposure areas by increasing the number and interconnectedness of eWMUs could represent an effective strategic approach at the municipal level to address LULCC and climate change. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Conservation; LULCC; Policy instrument; Vegetation cover","adaptive management; climate change; conservation management; environmental policy; land cover; land use change; vegetation cover; vulnerability; wildlife management; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015398339

Until very recently the carbon leakage literature has focused mainly on ‘industrial’ carbon leakage. However, there is another potential channel that has received little attention so far: the carbon leakage triggered by land-use change (‘terrestrial’ carbon leakage). In this article we use an integrated assessment model to explore these two forms of leakage in a situation where CO2 emissions in all sectors, including those from land-use change, are taxed equally. Our results show that under different fragmentation scenarios terrestrial carbon leakage may be the dominant type of leakage up to 2050. When participating regions tax land-use emissions, forest area expands partly by shifting food and bioenergy production to non-participating regions. This reduces forest area in non-participating regions and increases their land-use emissions. Policy relevance Preventing industrial carbon leakage has been an important aspect of climate policy design. One clear policy implication of our study is that anti-leakage policy measures should also be considered for land-use change sources. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AFOLU; carbon leakage; climate change; deforestation; energy","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; deforestation; environmental policy; habitat fragmentation; land use change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999622332

Morskaya 67, St.-Petersburg, 190000, Russian Federation","Stimulated emission observed experimentally in an aluminum laser induced plasma is modeled via a kinetic approach. The simulated emission at several cascade transitions is created by a pump laser guided through the plasma at several microseconds after its creation and tuned in resonance with the strong 3s23p-3s24s transition at 266 nm. A two-dimensional space-time collisional radiative plasma model explains the creation of the population inversion and lasing at wavelengths of 2100 n m and 396.1 nm. The population inversion for lasing at 2100 n m is created by depopulation of the ground 3s23p state and population of the 3s25s state via the absorption of the resonant radiation at 266 nm. The population inversion for lasing at 396.1 nm occurs during the laser pulse via the decay of the population of the pumped 3s25s state to the excited 3s24s state via cascade transitions driven optically and by collisions. In particular, efficient are the mixing transitions between neighboring states separated by small gaps on the order of k T at plasma temperatures of 5000-10 000 K. The model predicts that the population inversion and corresponding gain may reach high values even at very moderate pump energy of several μJ per pulse. The efficiency of lasing at 2100 n m and 396.1 nm is estimated to be ∼3% and 0.05%, correspondingly with respect to the pump laser intensity. The gain for lasing at 396.1 nm can reach as high as ∼40 cm-1. The polarization effect that the pump radiation at 266 nm imposes on the stimulated emission at 396.1 nm is discussed. The calculated results are favorably compared to experimental data. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Aluminum; Excited states; Laser produced plasmas; Optical pumping; Optically pumped lasers; Plasma diagnostics; Pumping (laser); Stimulated emission; Cascade transitions; Laser induced plasma; Plasma temperature; Polarization effect; Population inversions; Radiative plasma models; Simulated emission; Two dimensional spaces; Collisional plasmas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020475727

More than 50% small ruminants of the world are located in arid region, indicating their adaptability and future suitability to increasing temperatures. Sheep graze in the ranches, wastelands particularly in Asian and African countries, and also in pasture-lands of Australia; this not only reduces emission of the greenhouse gases (GHG) but also increases fertility of land. Increased temperatures will be the first impact of cli mate change. Cyclones, droughts, heavy rainfall, unpredictable climate, and diseases are other factors which will affect the sheep husbandry; however threats posed by these factors can also be ameliorated with scientific planning and execution. Disease resilience in genomics of sheep can be exploited apart from nutritional interventions for mitigating these challenges. 2050 will see a high demand of food from exisiting resources to feed ~10 billion people, and sheep will play a major role with advanced genomic selection. In sheep, growth traits and meat quality are important criteria. Selection of sheep breeds and candidates that are high producing and also tolerant to the adverse effects can be a mitigating option. Reaction norms in genotype by envi ronment interaction are important, and selection of genotypes for suitability in the future needs considerable research inputs. Revised selection criteria may be a need of the future, where production in the compromised environment seems to be the need of time. The decline in profitability of wool and environmental impacts have forced wool to take backstage, however, wool fiber production consumes significantly less energy than popular man-made fibers. Importance of the sheep husbandry as sustain able livelihood option for landless, marginal, and small farmers needs to be realized along with its global emergence as the desired food animal in the climate change era. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Climate change; Growth; Heat stress; Meat; Milk; Sheep; Wool",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034079664

However, conflicting results have emerged regarding species-specific responses to pCO2 enrichment and thus community responses have been difficult to predict. To assess community level effects (e.g., production) of altered carbonate chemistry, studies are needed that capitalize on the benefits of controlled experiments but also retain features of intact ecosystems that may exacerbate or ameliorate the effects observed in single-species or single cohort experiments. We performed incubations of natural plankton communities from Narragansett Bay, RI, USA in winter at ambient bay temperatures (5–13 °C), light and nutrient concentrations. Three levels of controlled and constant CO2 concentrations were imposed, simulating past, present and future conditions at mean pCO2 levels of 224, 361, and 724 μatm respectively. Samples for carbonate analysis, chlorophyll a, plankton size-abundance, and plankton species composition were collected daily and phytoplankton growth rates in three different size fractions (&lt;5, 5–20, and &gt;20 μm) were measured at the end of the 7-day incubation period. Community composition changed during the incubation period with major increases in relative diatom abundance, which were similar across pCO2 treatments. At the end of the experiment, 24-hr growth responses to pCO2 levels varied as a function of cell size. The smallest size fraction (&lt;5 μm) grew faster at the elevated pCO2 level. In contrast, the 5–20 μm size fraction grew fastest in the Present treatment and there were no significant differences in growth rate among treatments in the &gt;20 μm size fraction. Cell size distribution shifted toward smaller cells in both the Past and Future treatments but remained unchanged in the Present treatment. Similarity in Past and Future treatments for cell size distribution and growth rate (5–20 μm size fraction) illustrate non-monotonic effects of altered pCO2 on ecological indicators and may be related to opposing physiological effects of high CO2 and low pH both within and among species. Interaction of these effects with other factors (e.g., nutrients, light, temperature, grazing, initial species composition) may explain variability among published studies. The absence of clear treatment-specific effects at the community level suggests that extrapolation of species-specific responses or experiments with only present day and future pCO2 treatments levels could produce misleading predictions of ocean acidification impacts on plankton production. © 2017","Carbon dioxide; Carbonate chemistry; Cell size; Chemostat; Community; Composition; Ecostat; Incubation; Mesocosm; Ocean acidification; pH; Phytoplankton; Plankton","acidification; carbon dioxide; carbonate; cells and cell components; chemostat; community composition; community response; concentration (composition); environmental effect; estuarine environment; growth rate; mesocosm; pH; phytoplankton; plankton; Narragansett Bay; Rhode Island; United States; Bacillariophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016800285

The CO2 flux across the water–air interface was measured using the “static chamber” method. The measured fluxes of CO2 (FCO2) ranged from − 30.64 to 183.78 mmol/m2/day, and the average values varied in the range from − 3.52 to 82.11 mmol/m2/day. In most of the cases, emission of CO2 to the atmosphere was observed. The obtained values of CO2 fluxes were comparable to values typical for other temperate reservoirs. Analysis of the influence of selected environmental factors on the FCO2 showed that it depends on parameters characterizing both the sediments and surface water. The CO2 flux at the water–air interface was positively correlated with parameters of bottom sediments such as porosity, content of organic carbon and total nitrogen; and negatively with pH value and δ13C of organic carbon. In the case of the parameters characterizing surface water, positive dependences on the concentrations of nitrate and total nitrogen, and negative relationships with water temperature and chlorophyll a concentrations, were found. © 2016","Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gases; Reservoir; Sediment","Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Phase interfaces; Reservoirs (water); Sediments; Surface waters; Carbon dioxide flux; Chlorophyll-a concentration; Environmental factors; Parameters characterizing; Positive dependence; Static chamber method; Water temperatures; Water-air interface; Carbon dioxide; air-water interaction; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon flux; environmental factor; greenhouse gas; reservoir; Poland [Central Europe]; air pollutant; carbon dioxide; water pollutant; air pollutant; analysis; atmosphere; chemistry; environmental monitoring; Poland; water pollutant; Air Pollutants; Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Monitoring; Poland; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006952485

However, public concern and related research mostly deal with tropospheric NO2 columns rather than ground-level NO2 concentrations, but actually ground-level NO2 concentrations are more closely related to anthropogenic emissions, and directly affect human health. This paper presents one method to derive the ground-level NO2 concentrations using the total column of NO2 observed from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the simulations from the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model in China. One year's worth of data from 2014 was processed and the results compared with ground-based NO2 measurements from a network of China's National Environmental Monitoring Centre (CNEMC). The standard deviation between ground-level NO2 concentrations over China, the CMAQ simulated measurements and in-situ measurements by CNEMC for January was 21.79 μg/m3, which was improved to a standard deviation of 18.90 μg/m3 between our method and CNEMC data.

We develop and apply new incremental four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) capabilities in WRFDA-Chem to find optimal spatially and temporally distributed biomass burning (BB) and anthropogenic black carbon (BC) aerosol emissions. The constraints are provided by aircraft BC concentrations from the Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites in collaboration with the California Air Resources Board (ARCTAS-CARB) field campaign and surface BC concentrations from the Interagency Monitoring of PROtected Visual Environment (IMPROVE) network on 22, 23, and 24 June 2008. We consider three BB inventories, including Fire INventory from NCAR (FINN) v1.0 and v1.5 and Quick Fire Emissions Database (QFED) v2.4r8. On 22 June, aircraft observations are able to reduce the spread between a customized QFED inventory and FINNv1.0 from a factor of 3. 5 ( × 3. 5) to only × 2. 1. On 23 and 24 June, the spread is reduced from × 3. 4 to × 1. 4. The posterior corrections to emissions are heterogeneous in time and space, and exhibit similar spatial patterns of sign for both inventories. The posterior diurnal BB patterns indicate that multiple daily emission peaks might be warranted in specific regions of California. The US EPA's 2005 National Emissions Inventory (NEI05) is used as the anthropogenic prior. On 23 and 24 June, the coastal California posterior is reduced by × 2, where highway sources dominate, while inland sources are increased near Barstow by × 5. Relative BB emission variances are reduced from the prior by up to 35 % in grid cells close to aircraft flight paths and by up to 60 % for fires near surface measurements. Anthropogenic variance reduction is as high as 40 % and is similarly limited to sources close to observations. We find that the 22 June aircraft observations are able to constrain approximately 14 degrees of freedom of signal (DOF), while surface and aircraft observations together on 23/24 June constrain 23 DOF. Improving hourly- to daily-scale concentration predictions of BC and other aerosols during BB events will require more comprehensive and/or targeted measurements and a more complete accounting of sources of error besides the emissions. © Author(s) 2017.",,"aerosol; air quality; airborne survey; atmospheric chemistry; biomass burning; black carbon; carbon emission; concentration (composition); emission inventory; four-dimensional modeling; troposphere; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021211091

Starch synthesis IV (SSIV) is one of the important starch synthase isoforms, but its impact on wheat starch synthesis has not yet been reported due to the lack of mutant lines. Results: Using the TILLING approach, we identified 54 mutations in the wheat gene TaSSIVb-D, with a mutation density of 1/165 Kb. Among these, three missense mutations and one nonsense mutation were predicted to have severe impacts on protein function. In the mutants, TaSSIVb-D was significantly down-regulated without compensatory increases in the homoeologous genes TaSSIVb-A and TaSSIVb-B. Altered expression of TaSSIVb-D affected granule number per chloroplast; compared with wild type, the number of chloroplasts containing 0-2 granules was significantly increased, while the number containing 3-4 granules was decreased. Photosynthesis was affected accordingly; the maximum quantum yield and yield of PSII were significantly reduced in the nonsense mutant at the heading stage. Conclusions: These results indicate that TaSSIVb-D plays an important role in the formation of transient starch granules in wheat, which in turn impact the efficiency of photosynthesis. The mutagenized population created in this study allows the efficient identification of novel alleles of target genes and could be used as a resource for wheat functional genomics. © 2017 The Author(s).","Gene expression; Mutant; Starch granule; TaSSIVb-D; TILLING; Wheat","starch; plant protein; starch; allele; Article; carbohydrate synthesis; chloroplast; controlled study; down regulation; gene expression; gene synthesis; genotype; missense mutation; mutant; nonhuman; nonsense mutation; photosynthesis; plant gene; plant growth; promoter region; protein function; quantum yield; sequence analysis; TaSSIVb D gene; wheat; wild type; biosynthesis; chloroplast; cytology; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; mutation; photosystem II; wheat; Alleles; Chloroplasts; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Mutation; Photosynthesis; Photosystem II Protein Complex; Plant Proteins; Starch; Triticum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018420943

Chinese government has adopted various pro-wind energy policies, including fixed feed-in-tariff and priority dispatch. Remarkable progress in wind energy development has been achieved over the last two decades, especially in terms of installed energy capacity. Currently, China tops the world in wind energy capacity. However, wind energy output is less well performed. Barriers to full deployment of wind energy in China remain, ranging from overcapacity in electricity generation, wind curtailment, poor grid connectivity, lack of an ancillary service market, absence of demand response (DR) and energy storage, differential priorities between the central and the local governments, to vested interests among coal-fired power plants and the local governments. Several initiatives have been undertaken by the Chinese government to address and eliminate these barriers, including: energy coordination, coal-fired power plant retrofit, smart DR, development of a well-functioned ancillary service market, setting of a legal binding carbon reduction target, and a mature carbon-trading market. To ensure sustainable development of wind energy industry and the smooth integration of wind to the grid, China needs to substantially transform its current electricity system, including the development of distributed generation, proactive transmission planning, smart grid development, merit-based dispatch, and continual electricity market reform via pricing improvement. A low-carbon and clean energy pathway can be foreseeable in China, through continuous investments in wind and other forms of renewable energy and addressing the above technological and market challenges. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This attention is the result of several factors, of which should be highlighted the expansion of the possibilities in instrumental analysis (HPLC, HPLC-MS, ICP-OES, ICP-MS), as well as the often changing factors closely related to cultivation technology (varieties, hybrid, plant protection, fertilization, frequency of weather extremes). As a result, over the past two decades, researchers have been focusing more and more on the question whether the chemical, as well as the feedstock and nutritional physiology quality of crops, including wheat, changed because of intensive agrotechnics and the genetic capabilities of the new varieties. My intention was to provide satisfying answers, based on the analytical data of the large number of samples coming from different experiments (long-term experiments), to the questions that had been raised, one of the most important of which is the question how the mineral content of winter wheat, a staple food, had changed over the last hundred years. To this end, I used samples that had been archived at different locations of Hungary and analyzed using state-of-the-art measurement methods. Mineral content is the quality indicator that can be used reliably to estimate and interpret long-term effects (fertilization, plant protection, SO2 emission, atmospheric nuclear explosions, accompanying elements of fertilizers, climate change, switching varieties), because it changes very little in archived samples. Phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese, zinc, copper and strontium were included in the analyses. The results obtained can help researchers and practical experts of nutritional science interested in the topic to form a realistic picture about the effect of environmental factors and agrotechnics on the composition of cereals. © 2017, Wessling International Research and Educational Centre Nonprofit Beneficial Ltd.

Historians, critics and theorists since the 1980s have contributed to a discourse that relates regionalism to vernacular conventions in architecture and describes location-specific interactions between architects and modern architecture. In contrast, for architects practising in South Asia today, regionalism offers fresh opportunities for addressing the spatial operations, material configurations and climatic strategies that best structure and amplify the quality of life in rapidly growing cities in Asia. Referencing the design of housing in Dhaka during the last decade as a case study, this paper explores how, through regionalism, architects speculate about new forms of urban life in Asian cities. It shows how contemporary architects in Dhaka engage an evolving conceptualisation of regionalism alongside the historic legacies of vernacular architecture and the disciplinary frameworks created in Bangladesh during the 1970s. This paper argues that while addressing the local realities of materials, environment and urbanisation in Dhaka today, architects also engage global thematics such as the aesthetics of atmosphere and “the unfinished” in architectural projects where regionalism manifests as speculation. © 2017 The Society of Architectural Historians, Australia and New Zealand.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020041872

This work presents development of a dynamic model of CSP plant concept, in which sCO2 is used for extracting the solar heat in Linear Fresnel collector field, and directly applied as the working fluid in the recuperative Brayton cycle; these both in a single flow loop. We consider the dynamic model is capable to predict the system behavior in typical operational transients in a physically plausible way.

The results suggest that the concept can be successfully controlled and operated in the supercritical region to generate electric power during the daytime, and perform start-up and shut down procedures in order to stay overnight in sub-critical conditions.

However, while there is an abundance of thermophysical data for hydrocarbons in the literature, only limited studies have been performed that report the properties of the corresponding fluorinated species. Predictive approaches are therefore needed to accurately and reliably determine the physical properties of these molecules. The statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT) is a commonly used molecular-based equation of state that in its various forms has been applied to study a wide range of fluid systems. In recent work, several group contribution (GC) SAFT equations of state have been proposed, such as the GC-SAFT-VR equation that combines the SAFT equation for potentials of variable range (VR) with a group contribution approach that uniquely allows for the description of hetero-segmented chains. The GC-SAFT-VR equation has been shown to provide an excellent description of the phase behavior of pure associating and non-associating fluids and their mixtures, with a minimal reliance on fitting the model parameters to experimental data. Specifically, parameters for key functional groups (such as CH3, CH2, CH, CH2=CH, C=O, C6H5, ether and ester, OH, NH2, CH=O, COOH) have been obtained by fitting to experimental vapor pressure and saturated liquid density data for selected low molecular weight fluids and then used to predict the phase behavior of pure fluids and their mixtures without further adjusting the group parameters. To expand upon this effort, here we report parameters for the CF3, CF2, CF, CH2F, CHF2, and CHF functional groups and their cross interactions. The theoretical predictions are compared with experimental data for pure PFAs, PFAAs, and HFEs, as well as binary mixtures of alkanes, alkenes, PFAs, PFAAs, and CO2 in order to test the transferability of the new group parameters. The GC-SAFT-VR approach is found to accurately predict the phase behavior of the systems studied. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Alkanes; Binary mixture; Carbon dioxide; Fluoroalkanes; Group contribution; Heteronuclear; Hydrofluoroethers; Liquid-liquid equilibrium; Perfluoroalkanes; Perfluoroalkylalkanes; Phase equilibrium; Pure fluid; Vapor liquid equilibrium","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Derivatives; Equations of state; Fluids; Forecasting; Hydrocarbons; Liquids; Mixtures; Molecules; Paraffins; Phase behavior; Phase equilibria; Physical properties; Fluoroalkanes; Group contributions; Heteronuclear; Hydrofluoroethers; Liquid liquid equilibrium; Perfluoroalkanes; Perfluoroalkylalkanes; Pure fluids; Binary mixtures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015371249

Yet, there are few theory-rich discussions about how this orientation structures the efforts of sustainability science. We argue that Niklas Luhmann’s social system theory, which explains how societies communicate problems, conceptualize solutions, and identify pathways towards implementation of solutions, is valuable in explaining the general structure of sustainability science. From Luhmann, we focus on two key concepts. First, his notion of resonance offers us a way to account for how sustainability science has attended and responded to environmental risks. As a product of resonance, we reveal solution-oriented research as the strategic coordination of capacities, resources, and information. Second, Luhmann’s interests in self-organizing processes explain how sustainability science can simultaneously advance multiple innovations. The value logic that supports this multiplicity of self-organizing activities as a recognition that human and natural systems are complex coupled and mutually influencing. To give form to this theoretical framework, we offer case evidence of renewable energy policy formation in Texas. Although the state’s wealth is rooted in a fossil-fuel heritage, Texas generates more electricity from wind than any US state. It is politically antagonistic towards climate-change policy, yet the state’s reception of wind energy technology illustrates how social and environmental systems can be strategically aligned to generate solutions that address diverse needs simultaneously. This case demonstrates that isolating climate change—as politicians do as a separate and discrete problem—is incapable of achieving sustainable solutions, and resonance offers researchers a framework for conceptualizing, designing, and communicating meaningfully integrated actions. © 2017, Springer Japan.","Climate-change communication; Knowledge to action; Macro-level theory; Renewable portfolio standard; Transformational sustainability science; Wind energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011854095

In this study, a new approach to decrease these has been performed. Methane, a hydrocarbon gas, has been employed as a reductant with better reducing properties than solid carbon and hydrogen separately. Reduction of a titano magnetite ore has been executed at temperature ranging from 800 to 1200 °C using methane contents between 10 and 30 vol% in the hydrogen–methane gas mixture. Due to the high carbon activity reaching up to approximately aC = 200, higher reduction degrees has been achieved at lower temperatures compared to ordinary carbothermic reductions. Kinetically, the reduction of titano magnetite ore was most likely mix controlled regardless of the methane contents used. The reduction process especially at the early stages displayed shrinking core behaviour. The calculated activation energies, based on the obtained experimental metallisation data, varied when assuming the reaction is controlled by diffusion (iron 25–28 kJ/mol, titanium: 335–355 kJ/mol) or chemical reaction rate (iron 21–25 kJ/mol, titanium 178–184 kJ/mol) indicating a likely mixed control process. Iron was fully reduced at 1000 °C after 1 h and at 1200 °C in half an hour. The calculated rate constants for metallisation of titanium, vanadium and iron varied too, i.e. Fe from 0.00454 to 0.01150. The possible reduction mechanism is presented and discussed based on the kinetics results achieved and SEM–EDS observations. © 2016, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society (TMS).","Kinetics; Mechanism; Methane; Solid state reduction; Titano magnetite","Activation energy; Carbon footprint; Enzyme kinetics; Hydrogen; Iron; Kinetics; Magnetite; Mechanisms; Methanation; Methane; Process control; Rate constants; Titanium; Hydrocarbon gas; Lower temperatures; Magnetite ores; Methane content; Reduction degree; Reduction mechanisms; Reduction process; Solid state reduction; Ore reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079705622

To estimate the potential for diet change to reduce GHGE and improve public health, we analyzed the effect of adopting healthier model diets in the USA on the risk of disease, health care costs, and GHGE. We found that adoption of healthier diets reduced the relative risk of coronary heart disease, colorectal cancer, and type 2 diabetes by 20–45%, US health care costs by US$B 77–93 per year, and direct GHGE by 222–826 kg CO2e capita−1 year−1 (69–84 kg from the health care system, 153–742 kg from the food system). Emission reductions were equivalent to 6–23% of the US Climate Action Plan’s target of a 17% reduction in 2005 GHGE by 2020, and 24–134% of California’s target of 1990 GHGE levels by 2020. However, there is potential for investment of health care savings to result in rebound up to and greater than 100%, which would increase net GHGE.

With reference to this urgent circumstance, policy frameworks executed by the international organizations, governments and ministries of nations on the consequences of adaptation to climate change have been on the agenda over the last decade. This study is derived from Turkey’s policy of approach that excludes the investments of infrastructure and economic sectors from the scope of the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan (2011) as a critic from the perspective of balanced development that is also an instrument of sustainability. Therefore, to clarify this deficiency, factors of infrastructure and economic sectors exacerbating the process of climate change and their mutual interaction with other sectors and nature is identified and discussed over remarkable samples from three geographically and socio-economically different basins in Turkey, studied since 2005 by the researchers of this paper. In order to coordinate adaptation to climate change, this study designates: (1) the essential role of water-soil-vegetation integrity of the life cycle with human activities, (2) controllable and observable scale for the management of risks and hazardous events, (3) opportunity to determine capacities and thresholds based on cross-sector interaction in terms of the characteristics of the local natural environment and (4) co-existence of communities and settlement system patterns sharing a fate of union of particular bases for implementing holistic basin-scale as a strategy of smart planning. As a result, compelling impacts of climate change once again verify and remind us of the significance of interdisciplinary and holistic political decision-making and modules that should involve all sectors in the strategy of smart planning for the future. © 2017 WIT Press.","Basin scale; Climate change; Strategy of smart planning",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047916584

Short-rotation coppice willow is a potentially high-yielding energy crop that can be grown to supply a local energy facility. This study assessed the energy performance and climate impacts when establishing willow on current fallow land in a Swedish region with the purpose of supplying a bio-based combined heat and power plant. Time-dependent life cycle assessment (LCA) was combined with geographic information system (GIS) mapping to include spatial variation in terms of transport distance, initial soil organic carbon content, soil texture and yield. Two climate metrics were used [global warming potential (GWP) and absolute global temperature change potential (AGTP)], and the energy performance was determined by calculating the energy ratio (energy produced per unit of energy used). The results showed that when current fallow land in a Swedish region was used for willow energy, an average energy ratio of 30 MJ MJ−1 (including heat, power and flue gas condensation) was obtained and on average 84.3 Mg carbon per ha was sequestered in the soil during a 100-year time frame (compared with the reference land use). The processes contributing most to the energy use during one willow rotation were the production and application of fertilizers (~40%), followed by harvest (~35%) and transport (~20%). The temperature response after 100 years of willow cultivation was −6·10−16K MJ−1 heat, which is much lower compared with fossil coal and natural gas (70·10−16K MJ−1 heat and 35·10−16 K MJ−1 heat, respectively). The combined GIS and time-dependent LCA approach developed here can be a useful tool in systematic analysis of bioenergy production systems and related land use effects. © 2016 The Authors.

Unlike typical reservoir rocks, in which pore pressures can be directly measured, pore pressures in shale must be inferred via their state of compaction.We have used the shale acoustic properties to accomplish this. Shale P- and S-wave velocities were first calculated using an anisotropic differential effective medium model. This model was built using elastic properties of wet clay mineralogy, and the total porosity of the shale was obtained from basic open-hole well-log measurements. These simulated shale velocities were systematically higher than sonic velocities observed on a test data set from a Gulf of Mexico well, penetrating a 1200 m vertical section of overpressured shale. The difference between the modeled velocities and the sonic measurements was then evaluated to estimate the abnormal pore pressure based on an exponential relationship between the pore pressure and the ratio of measured to modeled velocity. Using a reasonable exponent, the predicted pore pressure was shown to be in good agreement with direct pore-pressure measurements either made in adjacent sand layers that are thought to be in pressure equilibrium with the shales or inferred from drilling mud weights. © 2017 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

However, most of the dyes exhibit enhanced emission only when bound to mature fibrils, and significantly weaker signals are obtained in the presence of amyloid oligomers. In the concept of population inversion, a laser is used as an excitation source to keep the major fraction of molecules in the excited state to create the pathways for the occurrence of stimulated emission. In the case of the proteins, the conformational changes lead to the self-ordering and thus different light scattering conditions that can influence the optical signatures of the generated light. Using this methodology, we show it is possible to optically detect amyloid oligomers using commonly available staining dyes in which population inversion can be induced. The results indicate that rhodamine 6G molecules are complexed with oligomers, and using a laser-assisted methodology, weakly emissive states can be detected. Significant spectral red-shifting of rhodamine 6G dispersed with amyloid oligomers and a notable difference determined by comparison of spectra of the fibrils suggest the existence of specific dye aggregates around the oligomer binding sites. This approach can provide new insights into intermediate oligomer states that are believed to be responsible for toxic seeding in neurodegeneration diseases. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Binding sites; Bins; Excited states; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Fluorophores; Glycoproteins; Laser excitation; Light scattering; Molecules; Neurodegenerative diseases; Proteins; Conformational change; Enhanced Emission; Excitation sources; Neurodegeneration; Optical signatures; Organic fluorophores; Population inversions; Scattering conditions; Oligomers; dye; lysozyme; oligomer; rhodamine 6G; biopolymer; lysozyme; rhodamine; rhodamine 6G; Article; chemical structure; fiber; light scattering; neodymium YAG laser; priority journal; chemistry; laser; spectrofluorometry; Biopolymers; Lasers; Muramidase; Rhodamines; Spectrometry, Fluorescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020310722

Given the need for carbon in chemistry, possible political disruptions in oil and gas producing regions and the rise of renewable energy, lignite, as a secure domestic raw material, can serve as a chemical feedstock. Furthermore, it can serve as an energy storage using polygeneration, i.e. the ratio between power and hydrocarbon products can follow the fluctuating grid requirements. In North-Rhine Westphalia (NRW), a committee for inquiry regarding the future of the chemical industry advocates this idea in its final report released in April 2015. This is in line with the position of RWE Generation (RWEG), which has been pursuing an alternative use of lignite besides the generation of electricity and has been expediting the related technology development for decades. So far, economical reasons prevented this option to be realized in commercial scale in Germany during the last 30 years. Together with partners from science, as well as industry and partly government-funded, RWEG develops innovative plant concepts and technologies for Coal-to-Product concepts. Especially the challenges and chances are taken into consideration resulting from the given circumstances, a changing market situation and shifting political goals. To meet the challenge of high investment costs, RWEG pursues a so called annex approach to improve the economic viability of the alternative use of lignite. Annex means to use synergies on infrastructure at established power plant or chemical sites, when planning a CtL/CtG plant. In addition, the process steps are critically questioned, here the gas treatment plant, whether amine-scrubbing can be applied as a less costly alternative to the commonly used Rectisol scrubbing. To reduce the CO2 footprint and to use renewable energy for hydrocarbon products, there is, next to the way of integrating electrolytically produced H2 into the process, another way, to substitute carbon consumption needed for the gasification temperatures by electrical heating. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Coal to liquid; Gas treatment; Gasification; Lignite; Synthesis","Carbon dioxide; Chemical industry; Coal; Coal industry; Electric energy storage; Gas generators; Gasification; Hydrocarbons; Investments; Synthesis (chemical); Chemical feedstocks; Coal To Liquid; Domestic raw materials; Gas treatment; Gas treatment plants; Gasification temperatures; Hydrocarbon product; Technology development; Lignite",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012933037

Laser created kernels expand into a cold ambient with high velocities during their early lifetime followed by confinement of the plasma kernel and eventually collapse. However, the plasma kernels produced during laser breakdown of gases are also capable of exciting and ionizing the surrounding ambient medium. Two mechanisms can be responsible for excitation and ionization of the surrounding ambient: photoexcitation and ionization by intense ultraviolet emission from the sparks produced during the early times of their creation and/or heating by strong shocks generated by the kernel during its expansion into the ambient. In this study, an investigation is made on the spectral features of on- and off-axis emission of laser-induced plasma breakdown kernels generated in atmospheric pressure conditions with an aim to elucidate the mechanisms leading to ambient excitation and emission. Pulses from an Nd:YAG laser emitting at 1064 nm with a pulse duration of 6 ns are used to generate plasma kernels. Laser sparks were generated in air, argon, and helium gases to provide different physical properties of expansion dynamics and plasma chemistry considering the differences in laser absorption properties, mass density, and speciation. Point shadowgraphy and time-resolved imaging were used to evaluate the shock wave and spark self-emission morphology at early and late times, while space and time resolved spectroscopy is used for evaluating the emission features and for inferring plasma physical conditions at on- and off-axis positions. The structure and dynamics of the plasma kernel obtained using imaging techniques are also compared to numerical simulations using the computational fluid dynamics code. The emission from the kernel showed that spectral features from ions, atoms, and molecules are separated in time with early time temperatures and densities in excess of 35 000 K and 4 × 1018/cm3 with an existence of thermal equilibrium. However, the emission from the off-kernel positions from the breakdown plasmas showed enhanced ultraviolet radiation with the presence of N2 bands and is represented by non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) conditions. Our results also highlight that the ultraviolet radiation emitted during the early time of spark evolution is the predominant source of the photo-excitation of the surrounding medium. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Argon; Argon lasers; Atmospheric pressure; Computational fluid dynamics; Dynamics; Electric breakdown; Electric breakdown of gases; Imaging techniques; Ionization; Ionization of gases; Laser excitation; Laser produced plasmas; Laser spectroscopy; Neodymium lasers; Partial discharges; Plasma diagnostics; Shock waves; Ultraviolet radiation; Computational Fluid Dynamics codes; Electromagnetic spectra; Laser induced plasma; Physical conditions; Structure and dynamics; Thermal equilibriums; Time resolved imaging; Ultraviolet emission; Density of gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020507925

This has led to the introduction of downsized engines, incorporating turbocharging to maintain output power. As downsized engines have higher combustion pressures, the resulting torsional oscillations (engine order vibrations) are of broadband nature with an increasing severity, which affect noise and vibration response of the drive train system. Palliative devices, such as clutch pre-dampers and dual mass flywheel have been used to mitigate the effect of transmitted engine torsional oscillations. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these palliative measures is confined to a narrow band of response frequencies. The nonlinear targeted energy transfer is a promising approach to study vibration mitigation within a broader range of frequencies, using nonlinear vibration absorbers (or nonlinear energy sinks – NESs). These devices would either redistribute vibration energy within the modal space of the primary structure, thus dissipating the vibrational energy more efficiently through structural damping, or passively absorb and locally dissipate a part of this energy (in a nearly irreversible manner) from the primary structure. The absence of a linear resonance frequency of an NES, enables its broadband operation (in contrast to the narrowband operation of current linear tuned mass dampers).

However, there is a growing awareness that ultimate success depends upon involving subnational government, particularly cities, which are uniquely placed to address climate change in terms of both policy development and implementation of mitigation actions. In recent years the theory of multi-level governance has been used to analyse governments' roles as effective climate actors. This article uses this theory to examine legal and policy developments in New Zealand that have a direct influence on the ability of local government to contribute to climate change mitigation. New Zealand's former leadership in this area has been progressively eroded since 2004. As a result, local government is left with limited direct capacity to contribute to mitigation. Given the failure of New Zealand's national mitigation policies, the disempowerment of local government is an additional impediment to achieving emission reductions. While New Zealand may not be unique in its current lack of support for local government (and their communities), what is novel is the co-ordinated and deliberate trend away from multi-level governance. Policy relevance There is a growing awareness of the interdependence between international climate change obligations, national commitments and the role of sub-national government, cities in particular. States are being encouraged to empower subnational government to take a complementary role in climate change mitigation policy and action. This article demonstrates that the paradoxical trend in New Zealand is part of a co-ordinated policy approach favouring increased centralization and economic development over a commitment to sustainability. This deliberate disempowerment of local government leaves its most populous city with an aspirational action plan it will find difficult to deliver on. It also compounds New Zealand's current failure to undertake strong climate change mitigation action. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change mitigation; climate policy and law; Multi-level governance; subnational government; sustainability","action plan; climate change; environmental legislation; governance approach; local government; mitigation; negotiation process; policy development; policy implementation; New Zealand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955086966

In response to pressure from civil society, the European Union (EU) has introduced sustainability criteria for biofuels. A hybrid regulatory system involving state and non-state actors stipulates that retailers and producers must comply to be eligible for fiscal support such as tax exemptions. Flexibility in the system allows choice between different means of compliance, including a range of voluntary schemes. We present an analysis of views within the Swedish liquid transport biofuel sector in 2012 – a year after the introduction of EU sustainability criteria. Using document analysis, official statistics, and a survey, we use four key structures of global value chains — input–output structure, territorial configuration, institutional framework, and firm-level chain governance structure — to structure an analysis of biofuel value chain coordination. This yields three main findings regarding how the Swedish liquid transport biofuel system operates within, and views, the new regulatory framework. Firstly that it uses a broad portfolio of feedstock mainly from within Europe, seemingly avoiding countries where any supply conditions may be in doubt; second, larger retailers and producers achieve compliance without the need to provide additional social sustainability information; third, that actors exhibit predominantly Eurocentric perspectives on sustainability, express confidence that their supply chains have strong 'sustainability performance’ and desire long-term policy stability. We conclude that despite a deep critique of the sustainability of biofuels amongst civil society and academia, EU regulation allows for production systems that reflect a European- and climate change mitigation-centred view on biofuel 'sustainability’. © 2015 The Authors","Biofuel; Certification; Global value chains; Sustainability; Sustainability criteria","Chains; Climate change; Laws and legislation; Liquids; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Taxation; Certification; Climate change mitigation; Global value chain; Institutional framework; New regulatory frameworks; Social sustainability; Sustainability criteria; Sustainability performance; Biofuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951853875

Formulation of a National Climate Change Policy subsequently took place with a view to providing direction towards fulfilling UNFCCC obligations. The National Climate Change Policy identified that coastal areas of Trinidad and Tobago were particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts. As a small island State, the country cannot afford its productive sectors operating in and/or reliant upon coastal resources to be at risk, even as some contribute to the climate change phenomenon. The increasing threat to socio-cultural, economic and environmental sustainability posed by climate change, was acknowledged in the Draft National Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) Policy Framework which aims to treat with climate change impacts in the coastal zone and reduce vulnerability to associated hazards. Given the stated objectives of the National Climate Change Policy and the Draft National ICZM Policy Framework, this paper examined the policy and plans in place to integrate climate change considerations into management for the coastal sectors of fisheries, energy, tourism and maritime transport. It found that the mainstreaming of climate change mitigation and adaptation responses in these coastal sectors has not been as effective as needed. Progress in this regard was constrained by human, financial and technical resource availability. Proposed are rationalised institutional arrangements which, if statutorily grounded, will better allow for achieving co-ordinated climate change mitigation and adaptation outcomes in Trinidad and Tobago. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change policy; Integrated Coastal Zone Management; Small Island States; Trinidad and Tobago","Coastal engineering; Coastal zones; Environmental regulations; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Climate change mitigation; Climate change policies; Environmental sustainability; Institutional arrangement; Integrated coastal zone management; Small island; Trinidad and Tobago; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; coastal zone management; emission control; environmental management; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; integrated approach; mitigation; small island state; sustainability; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; vulnerability; Trinidad and Tobago",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017113237

Future ecohydrological threats, however, are difficult to quantify using the cascade of climate and hydrological models due to various uncertainties involved. This study instead uses a fully bottom-up approach to evaluate the ecohydrological vulnerability of the Saskatchewan River Delta (SRD), the largest inland delta in North America, to changing streamflow regime and irrigation expansion. An ensemble of perturbed streamflow sequences, along with scenarios of current and expanded irrigation, was generated and fed into a regional water resource system model. Results show that the streamflow regime in the delta is more sensitive to upstream changes in annual flow volume than peak flow timing and/or irrigation expansion. The sensitivity to changes in flow volume, however, may be intensified when combined with changes in peak timing. Shifts in the upstream peak flow timing can alter the magnitude and timing of peak flow to the delta, with prime importance to aquatic biota that are adapted to historical rhythmicity in peak flows and timing. Irrigation expansion decreases the magnitude and frequency of the peak flows, alters the frequency of average and low flows, and slightly shifts the timing of the mean annual peak flow in the SRD. This can lead to isolation of lakes and wetlands from the main stream. Our results highlight the ecohydrological vulnerability of the SRD under potential changing conditions and can assist in proposing adaptation policies to protect this ecosystem.

Although forest conversion is known to influence soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes, measurements from oil palm and rubber plantations are scarce (for N2O) or nonexistent (for NO). Our study aimed to (1) quantify changes in soil-atmosphere fluxes of N oxides with forest conversion to rubber and oil palm plantations and (2) determine their controlling factors. In Jambi, Sumatra, we selected two landscapes that mainly differed in texture but were both on heavily weathered soils: loam and clay Acrisol soils. Within each landscape, we investigated lowland forests, rubber trees interspersed in secondary forest (termed as ""jungle rubber""), both as reference land uses and smallholder rubber and oil palm plantations as converted land uses. In the loam Acrisol landscape, we conducted a follow-on study in a large-scale oil palm plantation (called PTPN VI) for comparison of soil N2O fluxes with smallholder oil palm plantations. Land-use conversion to smallholder plantations had no effect on soil N-oxide fluxes (P = 0. 58 to 0.76) due to the generally low soil N availability in the reference land uses that further decreased with land-use conversion. Soil N2O fluxes from the large-scale oil palm plantation did not differ with those from smallholder plantations (P = 0. 15). Over 1-year measurements, the temporal patterns of soil N-oxide fluxes were influenced by soil mineral N and water contents. Across landscapes, annual soil N2O emissions were controlled by gross nitrification and sand content, which also suggest the influence of soil N and water availability. Soil N2O fluxes (μg N m-2h-1) were 7 ± 2 to 14 ± 7 (reference land uses), 6 ± 3 to 9 ± 2 (rubber), 12 ± 3 to 12 ± 6 (smallholder oil palm) and 42 ± 24 (large-scale oil palm). Soil NO fluxes (μg N m-2 h-1) were -0.6 ± 0.7 to 5.7 ± 5.8 (reference land uses), -1.2 ± 0.5 to -1.0 ± 0.2 (rubber) and -0.2 ± 1.2 to 0.7 ± 0.7 (smallholder oil palm). To improve the estimate of soil N-oxide fluxes from oil palm plantations in this region, studies should focus on large-scale plantations (which usually have 2 to 4 times higher N fertilization rates than smallholders) with frequent measurements following fertilizer application. © Author(s) 2017.",,"Acrisol; lowland environment; nitric oxide; nitrous oxide; nutrient dynamics; plantation forestry; rainforest; rubber; secondary forest; smallholder; soil nitrogen; water availability; Indonesia; Jambi [Indonesia]; Elaeis; Elaeis guineensis; Hevea brasiliensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020243003

Analysing higher education institutes’ (HEIs) divestment press releases and news reports shows how institutional alignment with cultures of sustainability and social justice efforts played key roles in HEIs’ decisions to divest from fossil fuels. Key stated reasons for rejection were: minimal or unknown impact of divestment, risk to the endowment, and fiduciary duty. Participant observation and interviews with protagonists reveal the intricate power structures and vested business interests that influence boardroom divestment decision-making. While some HEIs embrace transformative climate actions, we contend that higher education largely embraces a business-as-usual sustainability framework characterised by a reformist green-economy discourse and a reluctance to move beyond business-interest responses to climate politics. Nonetheless, the FFD movement is pushing HEIs to move from compliance-oriented sustainability behaviour towards a more proactive and highly politicised focus on HEIs’ stance in the modern fossil fuel economy. We offer conceptual approaches and practical directions for reorienting sustainability within HEIs to prioritise the intergenerational equity of its students and recognise climate change as a social justice issue. Fully integrating sustainability into the core business of HEIs requires leadership to address fundamental moral questions of both equity and responsibility for endowment investments. We contend that HEIs must re-evaluate their role in averting catastrophic climate change, and extend their influence in catalysing public climate discourse and actions through a broader range of external channels, approaches, and actors. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change; fossil fuel divestment; Higher education; justice and ethics; sustainability","climate change; environmental justice; ethics; fossil fuel; higher education; investment; social justice; sustainability; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002194798

Favorably, the final result of this work will be an alternative bus arrival time predicting model, which can help encourage citizens to choose public transportation and consequently to reduce the carbon dioxide emission by decreasing the number of personal vehicles in the traffic. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Bus transportation; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Mass transportation; Urban transportation; Accurate prediction; Carbon dioxide emissions; Machine learning models; Neural network model; Personal vehicles; Predicting models; Public transit; Public transportation; Forecasting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023167454

In many cases problems related to climate change concern primarily scientists who analyze vast amounts of data aiming at forecasting potential effects of climate change. However, if climate change adaptation measures are developed, and implemented, this concerns not only science, but especially local administrations, as well as companies, organizations and the public. They look at the problems from their specific perspectives, and evaluate potential measures in close relation to their context. In order to achieve sustainable and widely accepted problem solutions, it is essential to integrate the different views and related contextual information. Within the framework of a pilot project, aimed at the development and implementation of climate change adaptation measures, this article envisages to present the underlying research process. The development and critical evaluation of the project will be described, proving that only the close cooperation of all relevant actors from concerned sectors, accompanied by scientists, leads to sustainable decisions and problem solutions aimed at the mitigation of risks and adaptation to potential threats. The pilot project, carried out in two phases between 2011 and 2016 in the administrative district of Mansfeld-Südharz, Germany, embraces the development of a local climate change adaptation strategy, and the implementation of specific adaptation measures.

However, the planning of land management interventions is hindered by the lack of information at relevant spatial resolution. We examined predictive models for mapping various tree, soil and species diversity attributes with a comparison of RapidEye and Landsat imagery. The field data was collected in the vicinity of the community-managed forest in southern Burkina Faso, where the main environmental threats are agricultural expansion and fuelwood extraction. The modelling was done using Random Forest algorithm. According to our results, tree crown cover and correlated attributes, such as basal area and tree species richness, were predicted most accurately. High spatial resolution RapidEye imagery provided the best accuracy but difference to medium resolution Landsat imagery was negligible for most attributes. Burn scar masked Landsat time series performed similar to dry season single date Landsat imagery, but the former avoids image selection and mosaicking, and could be less sensitive to artifacts due to the burn scars.

A model based approach is typically pursued, where an estimated quantity of NH3 stored on the SCR catalyst is controlled to a temperature dependent setpoint. The choice of setpoint, however, is typically defined heuristically which leads to suboptimal NOx and NH3 emission trade-offs. Alternatively, this paper approaches SCR control from a stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) perspective. The dosing control law is formulated by solving an infinite-horizon stochastic optimization problem using a probabilistic model of the future SCR disturbances. Simulations over standard drive cycles show the SDP based SCR control laws outperform a standard model based PI control approach, in terms of total NOx emissions for a given level of NH3 slip, by between 5% and 15%. The SDP controllers are shown to move closer to the global optimal result found via deterministic dynamic programming. Additionally, the SDP approach provides a framework to evaluate potential controller performance improvements made available by adding parameters to the control law. In this way, the incremental benefit of having an additional state in the state-feedback control law can be weighed against the increased memory cost of the extra dimension. © 2017 American Automatic Control Council (AACC).",,"Catalysts; Control theory; Controllers; Dynamic programming; Economic and social effects; Metabolism; Nitrogen oxides; Optimization; Robust control; State feedback; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Urea; Controller performance; Model based approach; Probabilistic modeling; State feedback control law; Stochastic dynamic programming; Stochastic optimization problems; Temperature dependent; Transient disturbances; Selective catalytic reduction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027005484

For example, how can fresh and cold air production zones be incorporated in urban planning? Furthermore, the potential of the hardly noticed green roofs in order to enhance the urban micro climate is investigated, especially in arid and semi-arid zones. In addition, a database of roadside greenery and canopy is developed to characterize the influences on urban air quality. Parameters that are taken into account are amongst others canopy density and emission of volatile organic compounds. A dense canopy can reduce air movement leading to the accumulation of air pollution like within an urban canyon. Several tree species emit volatile organic compounds that contribute as a precursor to the formation of ground level ozone and are therefore not suitable for planting as urban green.

Its most representative land cover on peat is a Mauritia flexuosa dominated palm swamp (thereafter called dense PS), which has been under human pressure over decades due to the high demand for the M. flexuosa fruit often collected by cutting down the entire palm. Degradation of these carbon dense forests can substantially affect emissions of greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change. The first objective of this research was to assess the impact of dense PS degradation on forest structure and biomass carbon stocks. The second one was to explore the potential of mapping the distribution of dense PS with different degradation levels using remote sensing data and methods. Biomass stocks were measured in 0.25 ha plots established in areas of dense PS with low (n = 2 plots), medium (n = 2) and high degradation (n = 4). We combined field and remote sensing data from the satellites Landsat TM and ALOS/PALSAR to discriminate between areas typifying dense PS with low, medium and high degradation and terra firme, restinga and mixed PS (not M. flexuosa dominated) forests. For this we used a Random Forest machine learning classification algorithm. Results suggest a shift in forest composition from palm to woody tree dominated forest following degradation. We also found that human intervention in dense PS translates into significant reductions in tree carbon stocks with initial (above and below-ground) biomass stocks (135.4 ± 4.8 Mg C ha−1) decreased by 11 and 17% following medium and high degradation. The remote sensing analysis indicates a high separability between dense PS with low degradation from all other categories. Dense PS with medium and high degradation were highly separable from most categories except for restinga forests and mixed PS. Results also showed that data from both active and passive remote sensing sensors are important for the mapping of dense PS degradation. Overall land cover classification accuracy was high (91%). Results from this pilot analysis are encouraging to further explore the use of remote sensing data and methods for monitoring dense PS degradation at broader scales in the Peruvian Amazon. Providing precise estimates on the spatial extent of dense PS degradation and on biomass and peat derived emissions is required for assessing national emissions from forest degradation in Peru and is essential for supporting initiatives aiming at reducing degradation activities. © 2017 The Authors","Aguajal; CO2; Land cover classification; Mauritia flexuosa; Remote sensing; Satellite data; Tropical peatland","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Decision trees; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Learning systems; Mapping; Peat; Space optics; Wetlands; Aguajal; Land cover classification; Mauritia flexuosa; Peatland; Satellite data; Remote sensing; accuracy assessment; algorithm; ALOS; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; forest dynamics; greenhouse gas; image classification; land cover; land degradation; Landsat thematic mapper; machine learning; monocotyledon; PALSAR; peatland; phytomass; remote sensing; satellite data; stand structure; swamp forest; tropical region; Data; Remote Sensing; Satellites; Amazonia; Peru; Mauritia flexuosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015909264

However, isolated lifestyle interventions to address this in pregnancy appear to have only modest benefit and responses can be variable. This paper aims to address the question of why the success of lifestyle interventions to prevent excessive GWG is suboptimal and variable. We suggest that there are inherent barriers to lifestyle change within pregnancy as a life stage, including the short window available for habit formation; the choice for women not to prioritise their weight; competing demands including physiological, financial, relationship, and social situations; and lack of self-efficacy among healthcare professionals on this topic. In order to address this problem, we propose that just like all successful public health approaches seeking to change behaviour, individual lifestyle interventions must be provided in the context of a supportive environment that enables, incentivises and rewards healthy changes. Future research should focus on a systems approach that integrates the needs of individuals with the context within which they exist. Borrowing from the social marketing principle of ‘audience segmentation’, we also need to truly understand the needs of individuals to design appropriately tailored interventions. This approach should also be applied to the preconception period for comprehensive prevention approaches. Additionally, relevant policy needs to reflect the changing evidence-based climate. Interventions in the clinical setting need to be integrally linked to multipronged obesity prevention efforts in the community, so that healthy weight goals are reinforced throughout the system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Gestational weight gain; Maternal obesity; Preconception; Prevention; Systems approach","adult; body mass; body weight gain; female; human; maternal welfare; obesity; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; research; risk factor; risk reduction; trends; Adult; Body Mass Index; Female; Humans; Maternal Health; Obesity; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Research; Risk Factors; Risk Reduction Behavior; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001577555

Large-scale CO2 observations can provide information about the carbon cycle, but are not directly useful for GPP. Recently carbonyl sulfide (COS or OCS) has been proposed as a potential tracer for regional and global GPP. Here we present the first regional assessment of GPP using COS. We focus on the North American growing season - a global hotspot for COS air-monitoring and GPP uncertainty. Regional variability in simulated vertical COS concentration gradients was driven by variation in GPP rather than other modelled COS sources and sinks.

It is increasingly realised that enacting such policies will have unintended implications for public health, but there has been less focus on their implications for wellbeing. Wellbeing can be defined as a positive mental state which is influenced by living conditions. As part of URGENCHE, an EU funded project to identify health and wellbeing outcomes of city greenhouse gas emission reduction policies, a survey designed to measure these living conditions and levels of wellbeing in Kuopio, Finland was collected in December 2013. Kuopio was the northmost among seven cities in Europe and China studied. Generalised estimating equation modelling was used to determine which living conditions were associated with subjective wellbeing (measured through the WHO-5 Scale). Local greenspace and spending time in nature were associated with higher levels of wellbeing whereas cold housing and poor quality indoor air were associated with lower levels of wellbeing. Thus adaption policies to increase greenspace might, in addition to reducing heat island effects, have the co-benefit of increasing wellbeing and improving housing insulation. © 2017","Climate change; Finland; Greenspace; Housing; Resilience; Wellbeing","active transport; air quality; ambient air; Article; burn; carbon footprint; China; city; climate change; cold; ecosystem resilience; environmental health; environmental policy; environmental stress; Europe; Finland; heating; housing; human; priority journal; social life; wellbeing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017111049

There is a growing body of literature examining water-related discourses which identifies the ability of powerful actors and institutions to influence policy. Concern about the effects of future climate change has featured strongly in research on the Nile River for several decades. It is therefore timely to consider whether and how these concerns are reflected in regional policy documents and policy discourse. This study analyzes discourse framings of water resources management and climate change in policy documents (27, published between 2001 and 2013) and as elicited in interviews (38) with water managers in the EQNB. Three main discursive framings are identified which are present in the discourses on both subjects: a problem-oriented environmental risk frame and two solution-oriented frames, on governance and infrastructure development. Climate change discourse only emerges as a common topic around 2007. The framings found in the water resources management discourse and the climate change discourse are almost identical, suggesting that discursive framings were adopted from the former for use in the latter. We infer that the climate change discourse may have offered a less politically sensitive route to circumvent political sensitivities around water allocation and distribution between riparian countries in the EQNB. However, the climate change discourse does not offer a lasting solution to the more fundamental political dispute over water allocation. Moreover, in cases where the climate change discourse is subsumed within a water resources management discourse, there are dangers that it will not fully address the needs of effective adaptation. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","case study; climate change; discourse analysis; Nile Basin; water governance","climate change; dispute resolution; governance approach; policy approach; resource allocation; resource availability; water management; water resource; Nile Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019442247

South Africa has been declared ready to institute malaria elimination. However, research on the factors that would affect this policy implementation is inadequate. Objective: To investigate the stakeholders' understanding of the malaria elimination policy in South Africa, including their perceived barriers and facilitators to effective policy implementation. Methods: The study followed a constructivist epistemological approach which manifests in phenomenological study design. Twelve purposively selected key informants from malaria researchers, provincial and national malaria programmes were interviewed using semi-structured interviews. Interview questions elicited interviewees' knowledge of the policy and its achievability, including any perceived barriers and facilitating factors to effective implementation. The hybrid approach was used to perform thematic data analysis. Results: The dominant view was that malaria remains a problem in South Africa, exacerbated by staffattitudes and poor capacity, lack of resources, lack of new effective intervention tools, lack of intra- and inter-departmental collaboration, poor cross-border collaboration and weak stakeholder collaboration. Informants were concerned about the target year (2018) for elimination, and about the process followed in developing the policy, including the perceived malaria epidemiology shortfalls, regulatory issues and political context of the policy. Conclusions: Achievability of malaria elimination remains a subject of intense debate for a variety of reasons. These include the sporadic nature of malaria resurgence, raising questions about the contributions of malaria control interventions and climate to the transmission trends in South Africa. The shortage of resources, inadequate staffcapacity, lack of any new effective intervention tools, and gaps in malaria epidemiology were key concerns, as was the superficially participative nature of the consultation process followed in developing the policy. © 2017 The Author(s).","Achievability; Epidemiology; Interventions; Malaria programme; Researchers","climate; consultation; data analysis; human; malaria control; phenomenology; scientist; semi structured interview; South Africa; communicable disease control; cooperation; economics; health care policy; legislation and jurisprudence; malaria; migration; organization and management; public relations; South Africa; Communicable Disease Control; Cooperative Behavior; Emigration and Immigration; Health Policy; Humans; Interinstitutional Relations; Malaria; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019368992

The major degradation product has been identified as N-formyl edivoxetine. Experimental evidence including solution and solid-state investigations, is consistent with the N-formylation degradation pathway resulting from a direct reaction of edivoxetine with (1) formic acid (generated from decomposition of microcrystalline cellulose or residual glucose) and (2) the reducing sugar ends (aldehydic carbons) of either residual glucose or the microcrystalline cellulose polymer. Results of labeling experiments indicate that the primary source of the formyl group is the C1 position from reducing sugars. Presence of water or moisture accelerates this degradation pathway. Investigations in solid and solution states support that the glucose Amadori Rearrangement Product does not appear to be a direct intermediate leading to N-formyl degradation of edivoxetine, and oxygen does not appear to play a significant role. Solution-phase studies, developed to rapidly assess propensity of amines toward Maillard reactivity and formylation, were extended to show comparative behavior with example systems. The cyclic amine systems, such as edivoxetine, showed the highest propensity toward these side reactions. © 2017 American Pharmacists Association®","analysis; analytical chemistry; chemical stability; chromatography; excipients; mass spectrometry; oxidation; polymer chemical degradation; solid dosage form; solid state stability","amine; edivoxetine; formic acid; glucose; microcrystalline cellulose; oxygen; adrenergic receptor affecting agent; alpha-((5-fluoro-2-methoxyphenyl)methyl)-alpha-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)-2-morpholinemethanol; morpholine derivative; phenethyl alcohol; Amadori rearrangement; Article; controlled study; drug decomposition; drug degradation; drug oxidation; formylation; high performance liquid chromatography; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; mass; pH; retention time; solid state; tablet; tautomerization; analogs and derivatives; chemistry; drug dosage form; drug formulation; oral drug administration; procedures; Administration, Oral; Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors; Dosage Forms; Drug Compounding; Morpholines; Phenylethyl Alcohol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014127530

Warm-water coral reefs, for example, occupy shallow sunlit, warm, and alkaline waters in order to grow and calcify at the high rates necessary to build and maintain their calcium carbonate structures. At deeper locations (40-150 m), ""mesophotic"" (low light) coral reefs accumulate calcium carbonate at much lower rates (if at all in some cases) yet remain important as habitat for a wide range of organisms, including those important for fisheries. Finally, even deeper, down to 2,000 m or more, the so-called ""cold-water"" coral reefs are found in the dark depths. Despite their importance, coral reefs are facing significant challenges from human activities including pollution, over-harvesting, physical destruction, and climate change. In the latter case, even lower greenhouse gas emission scenarios (such as Representative Concentration Pathway RCP 4.5) are likely drive the elimination of most warm-water coral reefs by 2040-2050. Cold-water corals are also threatened by warming temperatures and ocean acidification although evidence of the direct effect of climate change is less clear. Evidence that coral reefs can adapt at rates which are sufficient for them to keep up with rapid ocean warming and acidification is minimal, especially given that corals are long-lived and hence have slow rates of evolution. Conclusions that coral reefs will migrate to higher latitudes as they warm are equally unfounded, with the observations of tropical species appearing at high latitudes ""necessary but not sufficient"" evidence that entire coral reef ecosystems are shifting. On the contrary, coral reefs are likely to degrade rapidly over the next 20 years, presenting fundamental challenges for the 500 million people who derive food, income, coastal protection, and a range of other services from coral reefs. Unless rapid advances to the goals of the Paris Climate Change Agreement occur over the next decade, hundreds of millions of people are likely to face increasing amounts of poverty and social disruption, and, in some cases, regional insecurity. © 2017 Hoegh-Guldberg, Poloczanska, Skirving and Dove.","Climate change; Corals; Decline; Ecosystems goods and services; Ocean acidification; Warming ocean",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020174680

In this paper, we apply the IMAGE integrated assessment model to estimate the annual abatement costs of achieving the NDC reduction targets, and the additional costs if countries would take targets in line with keeping global warming well below 2 °C and “pursue efforts” towards 1.5 °C. We have found that abatement costs are very sensitive to socio-economic assumptions: under Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 3 (SSP3) assumptions of slow economic growth, rapidly growing population, and high inequality, global abatement costs of achieving the unconditional NDCs are estimated at USD135 billion by 2030, which is more than twice the level as under the more sustainable socio-economic assumptions of SSP1. Furthermore, we project that the additional costs of full implementation of the conditional NDCs are substantial, ranging from 40 to 55 billion USD, depending on socio-economic assumptions. Of the ten major emitting economies, Brazil, Canada and the USA are projected to have the highest cots as share of GDP to implement the conditional NDCs, while the costs for Japan, China, Russia, and India are relatively low. Allowing for emission trading could decrease global costs substantially, by more than half for the unconditional NDCs and almost by half for the conditional NDCs. Finally, the required effort in terms of abatement costs of achieving 2030 emission levels consistent with 2 °C pathways would be at least three times higher than the costs of achieving the conditional NDCs – even though reductions need to be twice as much. For 1.5 °C, the costs would be 5–6 times as high. © 2017 The Authors","Abatement costs; Emission trading; Greenhouse gas emissions; INDCs; NDCs; Paris agreement","Article; Brazil; Canada; carbon footprint; China; cost control; economic development; greenhouse effect; gross national product; India; Japan; priority journal; Russian Federation; socioeconomics; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014406644

Regardless of these local events, global climatic processes significantly influenced the palaeoenvironment within the marine basin. Warm intervals are characterized by a stable, humid climate and a high-nutrient regime, due primarily to increased continental input of phytodetritus and also locally due to seasonal upwelling. Coarse clastics deposited in a hyposaline environment characterize the marginal part of the basin. Aridification events causing decreased riverine input and consequent nutrient decreases, characterized cold intervals. Apparent seasonality, as well as catastrophic climatic events, induced stress conditions and the expansion of opportunistic taxa. Carbonate production and hypersaline facies characterize the marginal part of the basins. Hypersaline surface water triggered downwelling circulation and mixing of water masses. Decreased abundance or extinction of K-specialists during each cold interval accelerated their speciation in the subsequent warm interval. Local tectonic events led to discordances between local and global sea-level changes (tectonically triggered uplift or subsidence) or to local salt formation (in the rain shadows of newly-created mountains). © 2017 Geologica Carpathica.","Calcareous nannoplankton; Central Paratethys; Climate; Foraminifera; Miocene; Oligocene","carbonate ramp; catastrophic event; climate variation; foraminifera; global warming; hypersaline environment; Miocene; nanoplankton; Oligocene; paleogeography; Paratethys; water mass; Carpathian Basin; Foraminifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020480366

We investigated the boundaries for dose escalation of an 18F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine positron emission tomography defined target by intensity-modulated photon therapy (IMRT), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT). Materials and methods: Standard dose (60 Gy) and dose-escalated plans were calculated for seven patients using IMRT, VMAT and IMPT. The achieved boost dose, the dose to the organs at risk (OAR), the dose homogeneity (defined as overdose volume, ODV) and the ratio of the 30 Gy isodose curve and the boost volume (R30) were compared. The risk of radionecrosis was estimated using the ratio of the dose volume histograms of the brain (range 30–60 Gy). Results: The mean boost dose was 77.1 Gy for IMRT, 79.2 Gy for VMAT and 85.1 GyE for IMPT. Compared with the standard plan, the ODV was unchanged and the R30 increased (17%) for IMRT. For VMAT, the ODV decreased (7%) and the R30 was unchanged whereas IMPT substantially decreased ODV (61%), R30 (22%), OAR doses as well as the risk of radionecrosis. Conclusions: Dose escalation can be achieved with IMRT, VMAT and IMPT while respecting normal tissue constraints, yet with IMPT being most favorable. © 2017 Acta Oncologica Foundation.",,"fluoro ethyl tyrosine f 18; tracer; unclassified drug; adult; aged; Article; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; clinical article; glioma; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; intermethod comparison; PET-CT scanner; photon therapy; positron emission tomography; priority journal; proton therapy; radiation dose; radiation dose distribution; radiation dose escalation; radiotherapy planning system; treatment planning; volumetric modulated arc therapy; brain tumor; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; female; glioma; image guided radiotherapy; image processing; intensity modulated radiation therapy; male; middle aged; organs at risk; pathology; photon; positron emission tomography; procedures; radiation response; radiotherapy dosage; therapeutic use; tumor recurrence; Adult; Aged; Brain Neoplasms; Female; Glioma; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Organs at Risk; Photons; Positron-Emission Tomography; Proton Therapy; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Radiotherapy, Image-Guided; Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014450217

We use this approach to construct spatially explicit, probabilistic, and empirically derived estimates of economic damage in the United States from climate change. The combined value of market and nonmarket damage across analyzed sectors - agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor - increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2% of gross domestic product per +1°C on average. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality.

However, issues about CO2 mitigation, water consumption, and the overall viability associated with the crop intensification have become a concern. The main objective of this study was to investigate how the yield related environmental factors, i.e. soil CO2 emission and crop water use would responsed to wheat-maize intercropping with conservation practices. Here we determined crop yield, plant biomass carbon, soil CO2 emission, and crop water use in various cropping systems. The field experiment was conducted at Wuwei Experimental Station in an arid oasis region (37°57′N, 102°37′E), in 2011 and 2012. Four tillage and crop residue options were applied to wheat-maize intercropping. They were (a) no-till with stubble standing (NTS), (b) no-till with stubble mulching (NTM), (c) reduced tillage with stubble incorporated into the soil (RTS), and (d) conventional tillage without stubble retention (CT). Averaged across two years, wheat-maize intercropping integrated with no-till and stubble mulching yielded 1.6 t ha−1 more grains and 7.1 MJ ha−1 more energy, while emitted 1.2 t ha−1 less soil CO2 than conventional wheat-maize intercropping; at the same time, the system increased plant biomass carbon by 16%, and enhanced CO2 emission efficiency per unit of grain yield by 39%, compared with the conventional system. Also, the integrated system decreased soil evaporation by 11%, increased energy yield per unit of water by 19%, and lowered CO2 emission per unit of water by 9%. Among the wheat-maize intercropping systems evaluated, the treatment with no-till and crop residue mulched on the soil surface had the highest evaluation index at 0.82; this was attributable to the increases of carbon emission efficiency by 48% and water use efficiency by 22%, compared with the conventional system. Wheat-maize intercropping integrated with no-till and stubble retention can be used to increase crop yield efficiently while reducing soil CO2 emission and enhancing crop water use effectively in dry areas. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Conservation intercropping; Soil CO2 emission; Water use","Agricultural machinery; Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Biomass; Crops; Developing countries; Food supply; Grain (agricultural product); Soil conservation; Soils; Water supply; Carbon emission efficiencies; Conservation practices; Emission efficiencies; Environmental factors; Experimental stations; Intercropping systems; Soil CO; Water use; Carbon dioxide; agricultural emission; arid region; carbon emission; conservation tillage; crop residue; crop yield; environmental factor; intercropping; maize; management practice; mulching; oasis; soil emission; water use efficiency; wheat; China; Gansu; Wuwei; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011564424

The landmass of China was divided into four latitudinal zones, each of c. 8°. Based on a total of 1664 indigenous genera of Chinese endemic seed plants which were grouped into fifteen geographical elements, belonging to three major categories (cosmopolitan, tropical and temperate) and which were absent or present in 28 provinces in China, we analyzed the phytogeographical patterns of genera of Chinese endemic seed plants and detected the relationships between them and main climatic factors. Our results showed that the proportion of tropical genera decreases with the increase in latitude; the proportion of temperate genera increases with the increase in latitude; and the proportion of cosmopolitan genera increased gradually increased gradually with latitude. There are a slow decrease in the proportion of tropical genera and slow increase in the proportion of temperate genera at latitudes 35°–40°. Alternatively, the tropical genera and the temperate genera have the same proportion at latitude c. 25°. These changes and issues about the different genera also appeared in main climate factors. In general, the genera present in a more northerly flora are a subset of the genera present in a more southerly flora. In summary, the large-scale patterns of phytogeography of endemic flora in China are strongly related to latitude, which covary with several climatic variables such as temperature. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien.","Biogeography; China flora; Endemic flora; Latitudinal gradients; Seed plants",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016105178

In the Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution experiment phase 1 (HTAP1), various global models were used to determine the O3 source-receptor (SR) relationships among three continents in the Northern Hemisphere in 2001. In support of the HTAP phase 2 (HTAP2) experiment that studies more recent years and involves higher-resolution global models and regional models' participation, we conduct a number of regional-scale Sulfur Transport and dEposition Model (STEM) air quality base and sensitivity simulations over North America during May-June 2010. STEM's top and lateral chemical boundary conditions were downscaled from three global chemical transport models' (i.e., GEOS-Chem, RAQMS, and ECMWF C-IFS) base and sensitivity simulations in which the East Asian (EAS) anthropogenic emissions were reduced by 20%. The mean differences between STEM surface O3 sensitivities to the emission changes and its corresponding boundary condition model's are smaller than those among its boundary condition models, in terms of the regional/period-mean (&lt;10%) and the spatial distributions. An additional STEM simulation was performed in which the boundary conditions were downscaled from a RAQMS (Realtime Air Quality Modeling System) simulation without EAS anthropogenic emissions. The scalability of O3 sensitivities to the size of the emission perturbation is spatially varying, and the full (i.e., based on a 100% emission reduction) source contribution obtained from linearly scaling the North American mean O3 sensitivities to a 20% reduction in the EAS anthropogenic emissions may be underestimated by at least 10%. The three boundary condition models' mean O3 sensitivities to the 20% EAS emission perturbations are 8% (May-June 2010) 11% (2010 annual) lower than those estimated by eight global models, and the multi-model ensemble estimates are higher than the HTAP1 reported 2001 conditions. GEOS-Chem sensitivities indicate that the EAS anthropogenic NO emissions matter more than the other EAS O3 precursors to the North American O3, qualitatively consistent with previous adjoint sensitivity calculations. In addition to the analyses on large spatial-temporal scales relative to the HTAP1, we also show results on subcontinental and event scales that are more relevant to the US air quality management. The EAS pollution impacts are weaker during observed O3 exceedances than on all days in most US regions except over some high-terrain western US rural/remote areas. Satellite O3 (TES, JPL-IASI, and AIRS) and carbon monoxide (TES and AIRS) products, along with surface measurements and model calculations, show that during certain episodes stratospheric O3 intrusions and the transported EAS pollution influenced O3 in the western and the eastern US differently. Free-running (i.e., without chemical data assimilation) global models underpredicted the transported background O3 during these episodes, posing difficulties for STEM to accurately simulate the surface O3 and its source contribution. Although we effectively improved the modeled O3 by incorporating satellite O3 (OMI and MLS) and evaluated the quality of the HTAP2 emission inventory with the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute-Ozone Monitoring Instrument (KNMI-OMI) nitrogen dioxide, using observations to evaluate and improve O3 source attribution still remains to be further explored. © 2017 Author(s).",,"air quality; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; boundary condition; Northern Hemisphere; ozone; pollutant source; pollutant transport; pollution monitoring; spatial distribution; Netherlands; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019135632

On the one hand, the shortage of water resources restricts the development of economy and society; On the other hand, flood control and storm drainage are carried out to protect the safety of life and property of people during flood seasons. The phenomenon of the shortage of water and flood also creates opportunities for the utilization of flood resources. As the determination of limited water level is the key for reservoir to keep a balance between impounding and flood control regulation, adjusting it appropriately can make better use of flood water resources. In this paper, based on the determination of the staged design flood, flood routing is carried out under different frequencies of upland water. The dynamic control scheme of limited water level is obtained by the method of comparing. Through the analysis, in the case that the upstream water of reservoir has obvious seasonal change, design flood by stages can be used to calculate the limited water level by stages. According to the transformation rules of local climate and rainfall, the flood season is staged; Based on the flood control standard of engineering, the design flood by stages is calculated. And the initial water level is determined to carry out flood routing for design flood by stages according to the primary operation regulations and rules. Calculation was carried out on the stage design flood respectively. The value of limited water level by stages is selected according to the results of flood routing, which simultaneously satisfy flood control standards of reservoir and downstream at different initial water level. Furthermore, the benefit after performing is calculated by the use of value-added of industry, as well as the method of share coefficient of benefit, which contains industrial water supply, irrigation and living water supply. Shilianghe reservoir is taken as a case study. The results show that the average annual benefit of flood resources utilization can be increased by 41.625 million RMB. The research results will draw some reference to the potential benefit of existing reservoir. © 2017 Desalination Publications.

We aimed to evaluate the biochemical mechanisms underlying how N2-fixing species influences soil organic carbon chemical composition through soil microbial functional groups and enzyme activities. Methods: We examined the effects of N2-fixing species mixed with Eucalyptus on soil carbon storage, and the chemical composition of an 8-year-old pure Eucalyptus urophylla plantation (PP) and a mixed E.urophylla and Acacia mangium plantation (MP). Results: The soil carbon stock and recalcitrant carbon chemical component significantly increased in surface soil in MP. The total PLFAs and bacterial PLFAs increased by 29.1% and 27.0% in cool-dry season, while in the warm-wet season, the total PLFAs and bacterial PLFAs increased by 13.1% and 27.3%, respectively. However, the fungal PLFAs decreased significantly in warm-wet season in MP. The total activity of the cellulose-degrading enzyme β-glucosidase was significantly greater with mixed N2-fixing species in both dry-cool and wet-warm season. The increase in the Alk-C/O-Alk-C ratio and SOC was strongly associated with both C-acquisition activity and bacterial community. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the importance of N2-fixing species in regulating both soil microbial communities and their functioning in association with soil extracellular enzyme activities, which contribute to the increased soil carbon storage and recalcitrant carbon composition in Eucalyptus plantations. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Eucalyptus plantation; N2-fixing species; Path analysis; SOC chemical composition; Soil enzymes activity; Soil microbial functional groups","chemical composition; enzyme activity; evergreen tree; functional group; microbial community; nitrogen fixation; plantation; rhizobacterium; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; subtropical region; China; Acacia mangium; Bacteria (microorganisms); Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus urophylla",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85000671189

Recent studies have revealed that Neolithic farmers and nomads extensively settled in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from 5.2 ka (ka = cal ka BP); however, it is unclear how and to what extent human activity has affected its vegetation. Here we combine the results of the pollen analysis of a sediment core from Genggahai Lake, a shallow lake in Gonghe Basin on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, with archaeological evidence and use them to assess the extent and nature of human impacts on the regional vegetation during the middle and late Holocene. The pollen record indicates that Stellera, an indicator of the extent of grazing-induced grassland degradation, first appeared at 4.7 ka, expanded during 3.6–3.0 ka, and finally increased significantly after 1.6 ka. In support of this finding, archaeological data indicate that the agro-pastoral Majiayao people arrived at ∼5 ka and groups of Kayue people, who practiced pastoralism, intensively colonized the Gonghe Basin and nearby Qinghai Lake basin during 3.6–3.0 ka. After ∼1.6 ka, from the Tang Dynasty onwards, human settlement and grazing activity intensified on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and this is in accord with the observed high percentages of Stellera in the pollen record. Based on comparison with other records, we conclude that the sediments of Genggahai Lake provide a record of anthropogenic impacts on vegetation, and that human activity may have contributed to regional forest decline during the middle Holocene, and to grassland degradation in the late Holocene. Grassland degradation caused by human activity may be an indicator of the start of the Anthropocene and potentially may have contributed to global climate change via increased dust emission to the atmosphere. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Anthropocene; grazing activity; human impact on vegetation; Neolithic; Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau; Stellera pollen","Anthropocene; anthropogenic effect; archaeological evidence; grazing; Neolithic; palynology; pollen; sediment core; vegetation; China; Genggahai Lake; Gonghe Basin; Qinghai; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Stellera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020865609

With substantial interests in the aviation and aircraft manufacturing industries, China is an important player in the implementation of the ICAO’s plan. This article argues that the prospect of China’s participation will be shaped by both normative and economic considerations, including state sovereignty, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and industrial interests in aviation and aircraft manufacturing. It suggests that among the options considered by the ICAO, China prefers the ‘baseline-and-credit’ approach, which is to decentralize and incorporate energy-efficiency standards. It highlights that the impact of the ICAO’s plan on the international competitiveness of the Chinese aircraft manufacturing industry might concern China in the long term. With the stances of the EU, the US and other major economies taken into account, it concludes by making policy recommendations for the ICAO to help reconcile the discrepancies between China and the other major players. Policy relevance While a general consensus has been reached on the necessity of using MBMs to reduce international aviation emissions, the details of the ICAO’s global MBM scheme are still subject to further negotiations, which with no doubt will be tough. Engaging China is be crucial to the implementation of the ICAO’s plan. By exploring China’s perception of international norms and its economic interests, this article presents an initial attempt to understand China’s preferences and the direction of its future interactions with the ICAO and other major economies. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Baseline-and-credit; China; energy efficiency; ICAO; market-based measures","air transportation; aircraft; competitiveness; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental economics; European Union; implementation process; international organization; sovereignty; China; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973637708

Internally inconsistent instrumentation has developed on the go, not fit for deep reduction. Mainly national technology-specific instruments, for example, have made the EU pure cap-and-trade system superfluous and have fragmented electricity markets. Systematic instrumentation design requires an adequate categorization of instruments, newly developed here for that purpose. This instrument ordering links to generality and bindingness. Starting points for any instrumentation design are sparseness, completeness, and non-overlap. Details in instrumentations may further depend on specific circumstances in different countries and regions. Planning &amp; Control starts with technology-specific instrumentation, with subsidies and standards to reduce fossil emissions in electricity production; effective Fleet Standards for transport; dynamic standards and permits regarding industry emissions; and standards and technology subsidies squeezing out fossils use in buildings and appliances. Subsidies create learning curves. Consistency and effectiveness tend to require centralization. Institutionalism uses two core institutional instruments. A comprehensive upstream emission tax with proceeds to the country or state level creates incentives. An open-to-all, real-time priced electricity market enables also small-scale renewables and secondary producers on the grid. Infrastructure is provided publicly. A level playing field results for mostly decentral climate action, both public and private. Policy relevance Technical instrument choices may seem neutral but cannot be so: policy is about choices. Two governance strategies are now mutually competing and counteracting. Planning &amp; Control links to welfare theory and optimization, with broad integration of several policy goals, measurable targets, and deep public–private cooperation. Institutionalism has a background in history, economics, sociology, and political science, with institutions driving long-term development. Incentives and option creation are central, indicating results only roughly. There is strict public–private delimitation. These different views on governance lead to mutually exclusive sets of instruments. Explicit instrumentation strategies are required for consistency, effectiveness, and legitimacy. Internationally, Planning &amp; Control requires binding country caps for (almost) all countries, UN-type. Institutionalism requires a limited agreement on a high rising emission tax, open for all countries to join a starting group, WTO-type. Choices are ultimately based on governance preferences. © 2016 The Author(s).

Different technologies have been developed and introduced in last decades for algae growth. Algae plays a very imperative role in the aquatic ecosystem regarding CO2 reduction and micro-nutrient removal. In present investigation, eight locally isolated (microalgae) strains and two pure strains were studied. The selected microalgae were grown under variable CO2 concentration and CO2 biofixation efficiencies along with micro-nutrient removal were monitored. Among selected strains, three strains (UMN266, UMN268 and UTEX 2714 showed adaptability up to 20% CO2 concentration with high biomass production of 1.3, 1.4 and 1.21 g/L, respectively, whereas UTEX 78 and UMN 230 growth was slow under high CO2 concentration (20% CO2). However, in step wise CO2 feeding, the growth of UTEX 78 and UMN 230 improved considerably and up to 0.9 and 0.97 (g/L) biomasses were recorded, respectively. All algae strains showed high growth rate at 2% CO2 feeding and nitrogen, phosphorus and ammonia removal from the simulated media were also significant. The fast-growing microalgae species tolerant up to 20% CO2 concentration and could be used for flue gas mitigation and valuable products production. These results can contribute to understand the nature of CO2 bio-fixation and microalgae could be a potential alternative for CO2 fixation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","High CO2 tolerance; Microalgae; Nutrient removal","ammonia; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; phosphorus; ammonia; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; phosphorus; trace element; algal growth; Article; Auxenochlorella protothecoides; biomass production; Chlorella vulgaris; controlled study; microalga; nonhuman; priority journal; stress; waste water treatment plant; biomass; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; metabolism; microalga; spectrophotometry; Ammonia; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Microalgae; Micronutrients; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Spectrophotometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017316384

A combined top-down and bottom-up EI was conducted using fossil fuel consumption data of TPPs and industrial activities collected at the provincial level. Emission factors (EFs) were selected from literature considering the relevancy to the country emission sources. The best emission estimates, collectively from TPPs and industry activities, in Gg, was: 361 CO, 320 NOx, 529 SO2, 52 NMVOC, 13 NH3, 266 PM10, 79 PM2.5, 2.6 BC, 4.7 OC and 105,856 CO2, which were mainly contributed by the industrial activities. The range between low and high emission estimates were determined for each species and the largest ranges were found for BC and SO2. Spatial emission distributions showed higher intensities over major economic zones of the country. The lowest monthly emissions were seen in February coinciding with the Lunar New Year holiday which were followed by the peaks in March when the economic activities resumed. The net GWP of the emissions in 20-yr CO2 equivalent was 59.7 Tg with CO2 emissions having the largest share (87%) followed by BC (6%), whereas sulfates were the main cooling agent. Fuel switching to natural gas would significantly reduce emissions from TPPs while better combustion and emission control technologies applied in small and medium industries would reduce emissions of PM species including BC.

We construct an endogenous learning model with fat-tailed uncertainty about the equilibrium climate sensitivity. We find that a decision maker with a possibility of learning lowers efforts to reduce carbon emissions relative to the no-learning case. The larger the tail effect, the larger the counteracting learning effect because learning reduces the marginal benefit of emissions control compared to the case where there is no learning. The optimal decisions (summarized by the carbon tax level) in the learning case are less sensitive to the true value of the uncertain variable than the decisions in the uncertainty case. Learning lets uncertainty converge to the true value of the state in the sense that the variance approaches zero as information accumulates. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian learning; Climate policy; Dynamic programming; Fat tailed risk; Integrated assessment","Climate change; Decision making; Dynamic programming; Risk assessment; Bayesian learning; Climate policy; Climate sensitivity; Emissions control; Integrated assessment; Optimal decisions; Uncertain variables; Variance approaches; Climate models; Bayesian analysis; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; environmental policy; risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010310647

The focus rests on the South Korean government's Green Growth (GG) strategy and the efforts to export this strategy as a role model to emerging economies worldwide through the establishment of the Global Green Growth Institute. We begin with the question why the Korean government is going global with a political program that is heavily disputed at home. We then study the practices by which the state manages to maintain its territoriality under the conditions of global climate change.

The invariant mass spectrum, derived from the momenta of the forward going beam velocity 18C fragment and neutrons, was found to be dominated by a very narrow near threshold (Erel=0.036(1) MeV) peak. Two less strongly populated resonance-like features were also observed at Erel=0.84(4) and 2.31(3) MeV, both of which exhibit characteristics consistent with neutron p-shell hole states. Comparisons of the energies, measured cross sections and parallel momentum distributions to the results of shell-model and eikonal reaction calculations lead to spin-parity assignments of 5/21 + and 1/21 − for the levels at Ex=0.62(9) and 2.89(10) MeV with Sn=0.58(9) MeV. Spectroscopic factors were also deduced and found to be in reasonable accord with shell-model calculations. The valence neutron configuration of the 20C ground state is thus seen to include, in addition to the known 1s1/2 2 component, a significant 0d5/2 2 contribution. The level scheme of 19C, including significantly the 1/21 − cross-shell state, is well accounted for by the YSOX shell-model interaction developed from the monopole-based universal interaction. © 2017 The Author(s)","Heavy-ion knockout; Invariant mass spectroscopy; Shell evolution",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026295691

Here, we investigate the role of the substrate in the photoluminescence response of MoSe2 and WSe2 monolayers exfoliated either on SiO2 or epitaxially grown InGaP substrates. In the case of MoSe2, we observe a significant qualitative modification of the emission spectrum, which is widely dominated by the trion resonance on InGaP substrates. However, the effects of inhomogeneous broadening of the emission features are strongly reduced. Even more striking, in sheets of WSe2, we could routinely observe emission lines from localized excitons with linewidths down to the resolution limit of 70 μeV. This is in stark contrast to reference samples featuring WSe2 monolayers on SiO2 surfaces, where the emission spectra from localized defects are widely dominated by spectral diffusion and blinking behavior.

At 20°С, carbon monoxide forms carbonyl and monodentate carbonate complexes on Com 2+On 2- clusters located on the surface of crystallites of tetragonal ZrO2. With an increasing CoO content of the clusters, the amount of these complexes increases and the temperature of carbonate decomposition, accompanied by CO2 desorption, decreases from 400 to 304°С. On the 5%CoO/ZrО2 sample, the carbonyls formed on the Со2+ and Со+ cations and Со0 atoms decompose at 20, 90, and 200–220°С, respectively, releasing CO. At 20°С, they are oxidized by oxygen to monodentate carbonates, which decompose at 180°С. Adsorbed oxygen decreases the temperature of their decomposition on oxidation sites by ~40°C, and the sample remains in an oxidized state ensuring the possibility of subsequent CO adsorption and oxidation. The rate of the oxidation of 5%CoO/ZrО2 containing adsorbed CO by oxygen is higher than the rate of the oxidation of the same sample reduced by carbon monoxide, because the latter reaction is an activated one. In view of the properties of the complexes, it can be concluded that the carbonates decomposing at 180°С are involved in CO oxidation by oxygen from the gas phase in the presence of hydrogen, a process occurring at 50–200°С.

The areas of dense water formation are, indeed, preferential sites for atmospheric carbon dioxide absorption and through them the ocean acidification process can quickly propagate into the deep layers. In this study we estimated the concentration of anthropogenic CO2 (Cant) in the dense water formation areas of the middle and southern Adriatic Sea. Using the composite tracer TrOCA (Tracer combining Oxygen, inorganic Carbon, and total Alkalinity) and carbonate chemistry data collected throughout March 2013, our results revealed that a massive amount of Cant has invaded all the identified water masses. High Cant concentration was detected at the bottom layer of the Pomo Pit (middle Adriatic, 96.8±9.7 µmol kg−1) and Southern Adriatic Pit (SAP, 85.2±9.4 µmol kg−1), associated respectively with the presence of North Adriatic Dense Water (NAdDW) and Adriatic Dense Water (AdDW). This anthropogenic contamination was clearly linked to the dense water formation events, which govern strong CO2 flux from the atmosphere to the sea and the sinking of dense, CO2-rich surface waters to the deep sea. However, a very high Cant level (94.5±12.5 µmol kg−1) was also estimated at the intermediate layer, as a consequence of a recent vertical mixing that determined the physical and biogeochemical modification of the water of Levantine origin (i.e. Modified Levantine Intermediate Water, MLIW) and favoured the atmospheric CO2 intrusion. The penetration of Cant in the Adriatic Sea determined a significant pH reduction since the pre-industrial era (– 0.139±0.019 pH units on average). This estimation was very similar to the global Mediterranean Sea acidification, but it was again more pronounced at the bottom of the Pomo Pit, within the layer occupied by NAdDW (– 0.157±0.018 pH units), and at the intermediate layer of the recently formed MLIW (– 0.143±0.020 pH units). Our results indicate that the Adriatic Sea could potentially be one of the Mediterranean regions most affected by the ocean acidification and also demonstrate its active role in sequestering and storing Cant. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adriatic Sea; Anthropogenic CO2; Carbonate system; Mediterranean Sea; Ocean acidification","Acidification; Alkalinity; Atmospheric chemistry; Oceanography; Stream flow; Water absorption; Adriatic Sea; Anthropogenic CO; Carbonate system; Mediterranean sea; Ocean acidifications; Carbon dioxide; anthropogenic effect; biogeochemical cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; carbonate system; dense water; ocean acidification; surface water; Adriatic Sea; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017460493

Rocky shores of the Antarctic Peninsula are dominated by canopy-forming Desmarestiales. This study investigates the physiological and transcriptomic responses of the endemic macroalga Desmarestia anceps to a combination of different levels of temperature (2 and 7 °C), dissolved CO2 (380 and 1000 ppm), and irradiance (65 and 145 μmol photons m-2 s-1). Growth and photosynthesis increased at high CO2 conditions, and strongly decreased at 2 °C plus high irradiance, in comparison to the other treatments. Photoinhibition at 2 °C plus high irradiance was evidenced by the photochemical performance and intensive release of dissolved organic carbon. The highest number of differentially regulated transcripts was observed in thalli exposed to 2 °C plus high irradiance. Algal 13C isotopic discrimination values suggested an absence of down-regulation of carbon-concentrating mechanisms at high CO2. CO2 enrichment induced few transcriptomic changes. There was high and constitutive gene expression of many photochemical and inorganic carbon utilization components, which might be related to the strong adaptation of D. anceps to the Antarctic environment. These results suggest that increased temperature and CO2 will allow D. anceps to maintain its productivity while tolerating higher irradiances than at present conditions. © 2017 The Author.

The energy demand–supply system including CO2-free hydrogen was assumed, though there are still large uncertainties as to whether a global CO2-free hydrogen energy system will be deployed. System analysis was conducted using the global and long-term intertemporal optimization energy model GRAPE under severe CO2 emission constraints. Applied global CO2 constraints for 2050 were a 50% reduction from 1990 levels. CO2 constraints accounting for Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) in each region were also considered. A variety of energy resources and technologies were considered in this model. Hydrogen can be produced from low-grade coal or natural gas with CO2 capture and electricity from renewable energy. The hydrogen CIF (cost, insurance, and freight) price for Japan was about 3.2 cents/MJ in 2030. Hydrogen demand technologies considered in this paper are hydrogen-fired power plants, direct combustion, combined heat and power (fuel cells, gas engines, and gas turbines), fuel cell vehicles, and hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles. The majority of CO2-free hydrogen was deployed in the transportation sector. CO2-free hydrogen was utilized in the power sector, where deployment of other zero emission technology has some constraints. From an economic viewpoint, CO2-free hydrogen can reduce the global energy system cost. From the viewpoint of a localized region, such as Japan, deployment of CO2-free hydrogen can improve energy security and environmental indicators. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","CO2-free hydrogen; Demand–supply structure; Energy model","Coal combustion; Cogeneration plants; Combustion; Costs; Energy policy; Energy resources; Energy security; Engines; Fuel cell power plants; Fuel cells; Gas plants; Gas turbines; Heat engines; Hydrogen; Internal combustion engines; Systems analysis; Combined heat and power; Demand supplies; Energy model; Environmental indicators; Hydrogen energy systems; Hydrogen internal combustion engines; Intertemporal optimization; Transportation sector; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015706946

The analysis of the policy documents is qualitative: drawing out explicit themes and implicit acknowledgements through close reading of the text. The evaluation of their treatment of households' social networks is based on a combination of field research, including disaster practitioner and policymaker interviews, meetings with local journalists and local government officials, and NGO workshops, and a review of the literature. The findings show that despite the importance of social networks in disaster resilience and recovery, these networks are not given adequate emphasis in government policies. Organisations' linking social networks (i.e. governments' links with foreign states, donors, and others) are emphasised in policies, but households’ bonding networks (households' relationships with immediate family members and relatives), bridging networks (households' relationships with neighbours and friends), and their local linking relationships (notably with NGOs and local government) are largely ignored.

The work is focused on the local transient analysis of CO2 thermophysical properties, in order to see how these transient changes affect the heat transfer rate and the effectiveness of internal heat exchanger, as well as the coefficient of performance during the start-up of the system. The study is conducted through a numerical simulation using the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software Ansys Fluent. Validation of numerical results is carried out by using seven different empirical correlations applied for the Nusselt number. It is observed that the thermophysical properties of the hot CO2 stream experience large changes during the transient period. This instability is accompanied by a decrease in the heat transfer rate. Finally, the change in the internal heat exchanger effectiveness during the start-up results in a loss of about 12% of the coefficient of performance.

This study develops an inventory of carbon footprints associated with household consumption for 177 regions in 27 EU countries, thus, making a key contribution for the incorporation of consumption-based accounting into local decision-making. Footprint calculations are based on consumer expenditure surveys and environmental and trade detail from the EXIOBASE 2.3 multiregional input-output database describing the world economy in 2007 at the detail of 43 countries, 5 rest-of-the-world regions and 200 product sectors. Our analysis highlights the spatial heterogeneity of embodied GHG emissions within multiregional countries with subnational ranges varying widely between 0.6 and 6.5 tCO2e/cap. The significant differences in regional contribution in terms of total and per capita emissions suggest notable differences with regards to climate change responsibility. The study further provides a breakdown of regional emissions by consumption categories (e.g. housing, mobility, food). In addition, our region-level study evaluates driving forces of carbon footprints through a set of socio-economic, geographic and technical factors. Income is singled out as the most important driver for a region's carbon footprint, although its explanatory power varies significantly across consumption domains. Additional factors that stand out as important on the regional level include household size, urban-rural typology, level of education, expenditure patterns, temperature, resource availability and carbon intensity of the electricity mix. The lack of cross-national region-level studies has so far prevented analysts from drawing broader policy conclusions that hold beyond national and regional borders. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","carbon footprint; climate policy; consumer expenditure surveys; environmentally extended multiregional input-output analysis; greenhouse gas emissions; household consumption; regional assessment","Climate change; Decision making; Economic analysis; Economics; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Surveys; Climate policy; Consumer expenditure; Household Consumption; Input output analysis; regional assessment; Carbon footprint; assessment method; carbon footprint; climate change; decision making; emission inventory; environmental economics; environmental policy; European Union; expenditure; greenhouse gas; household energy; input-output analysis; mapping method; regional planning; resource availability; trade-environment relations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019622861

More efficient gasoline engines, coupled with varying degrees of micro and mild hybridization will also close the gap in CO2 emissions with light-duty diesel engines, further reducing the role for diesel. Also, the diesel engine is likely to remain dominant for heavy-duty applications where further reductions in air quality emissions and step changes in efficiency will deliver substantial environmental benefits.

While the bond dissociation energy, enthalpy change, and free energy change are computed to show the stability of the complexes with respect to the dissociation into [M-(bipy)]+ and free gas molecule (L), natural bond orbital, electron density, and energy decomposition analyses in conjunction with natural orbitals for chemical valence are carried out to characterize the nature of L-M bonds. For a given L, the L binding ability is the highest for Au followed by Cu and Ag complexes, except for quite loosely bound CO2. For all ligand cases, the dissociation processes from the respective bound complexes are endergonic in nature at room temperature, except for the H2-, CH4-, and C2H6-bound Ag complexes and CO2-bound Ag and Au complexes. The interaction between L and M centers is supported by orbital and ionic interactions with latter being more dominant over the former. The delocalization index and local energy density values support the covalent character in L-M bonds in most of the cases. These M centers can act as a mild bond activation agent for L, Au being the best candidate in this series for this purpose. Particularly, the H-H bond in H2, C=C bond in C2H4, C≡C bond in C2H2, and C-H bonds in CH4 and C2H6 (the last two are for Au) are elongated along with a significant red-shift in the corresponding stretching frequency, compared to those in free molecules.

Regional projections of climate change and forest response are becoming more readily available, but managers are still searching for practical ways to apply this information. We propose that commonly collected forest inventory data be used in conjunction with species distribution models to better understand the potential response of forests to climate change and inform management at the site level. In this article, we propose a new climate risk metric that incorporates stand-level forest inventory data with projections of tree species habitat from the Climate Change Tree Atlas. This climate risk metric can serve as a starting point for managers to consider how forests may be altered by climate change. We also describe two examples of how this metric was used in real-world management situations. © 2017, Society of American Foresters.

In Dar es Salaam, such research efforts include assessing the vulnerability of exposed communities in informal settlements, developing risks maps, investigating landscapes based storm water management for increasing climate resilience and supporting participatory decision-making and prioritization of actions on climate change adaptation. Often, scholars face high expectations and must generate knowledge and provide solutions in a short amount of time regardless of the challenges they face. This paper provides an overview of the opportunities and barriers for research and implementation of climate change adaptation in Tanzania. It pinpoints the necessity of overcoming traditional assessments that largely focus on the deficits and/or failures of urban systems in Africa. Instead, university scholars aim to provide context-based solutions through techniques such as urban morphology types, participative design charretes or multi criteria analysis to steer adaptation efforts. Yet, the available scholarly work comes with many challenges. The results show a need to manoeuver around rigid bureaucracies and reluctance to change, technocratic urban ideals, short time spent for project implementation and lack of reliable information. This suggests that high education institutions require other ways of advocating and communicating climate change adaptation and planning in rapidly urbarnising African cities. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Barriers; Climate change adaptation; Opportunities; Tanzania; Universities",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075696212

The motivation stems from a set of field observations, following seismic events and vibrational tests, suggesting that shaking an oil reservoir is likely to improve oil production rates. This maximization problem is cast into an inverse-source problem, seeking an optimal loading signal that minimizes an objective functional–the reciprocal of kinetic energy in terms of relative pore-fluid wave motion within target poroelastic layers. We use the finite element method to obtain the solution of the governing wave physics of a multi-layered system, where the wave equations for the target poroelastic layers and the elastic wave equation for the surrounding non-permeable layers are coupled with each other. We use a partial-differential-equation-constrained-optimization framework (a state-adjoint-control problem approach) to tackle the minimization problem. The numerical results show that the numerical optimizer recovers optimal loading signals, whose dominant frequencies correspond to amplification frequencies, which can also be obtained by a frequency sweep, leading to larger amplitudes of relative pore-fluid wave motion within the target hydrocarbon formation than other signals. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","amplification frequencies; inverse-source problem; PDE-constrained optimization; pore-fluid flow hysteresis model; pore-fluid oscillation; poroelastic solids; Wave-based enhanced oil recovery","Amplification; Constrained optimization; Elastic waves; Enhanced recovery; Finite element method; Flow of fluids; Hysteresis; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Oil well flooding; Oscillating flow; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Wave equations; Enhanced oil recovery; Hysteresis modeling; Inverse source problem; PDE-constrained optimization; Pore fluids; Poroelastic solid; Inverse problems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976883829

Species will need to track changing environmental conditions through fragmented and transformed landscapes such as KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Landscape connectivity is an important tool for maintaining resilience to global change. We develop a coarse-grained connectivity map between protected areas to aid decision-making for implementing corridors to maintain floristic diversity in the face of global change. The spatial location of corridors was prioritised using a biological underpinning of floristic composition that incorporated high beta diversity regions, important plant areas, climate refugia, and aligned to major climatic gradients driving floristic pattern. We used Linkage Mapper to develop the connectivity network. The resistance layer was based on land-cover categories with natural areas discounted according to their contribution towards meeting the biological objectives. Three corridor maps were developed; a conservative option for meeting minimum corridor requirements, an optimal option for meeting a target amount of 50% of the landscape and an option including linkages in highly transformed areas. The importance of various protected areas and critical linkages in maintaining landscape connectivity are discussed, disconnected protected areas and pinch points identified where the loss of small areas could compromise landscape connectivity. This framework is suggested as a way to conserve floristic diversity into the future and is recommended as an approach for other global connectivity initiatives. A lack of implementation of corridors will lead to further habitat loss and fragmentation, resulting in further risk to plant diversity. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Beta diversity; Climate refugia; Corridors; Ecological processes; Gradients; Protected areas","Biodiversity; Conservation; Decision making; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Plants (botany); Beta diversities; Climate refugia; Corridors; Ecological process; Gradients; Protected areas; Climate change; biodiversity; climate change; decision making; environmental gradient; floristics; habitat corridor; habitat loss; land cover; protected area; refugium; climate change; decision making; global change; habitat; land use; landscape; refugium; ecosystem; environmental protection; plant; South Africa; KwaZulu-Natal; South Africa; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Plants; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011672613

This paper focuses on the model and algorithm for a certain kind of IT, namely multi-objective multi-sourcing intermodal transportation network design problem (MO_MITNDP), in which carbon emission factors are specially considered. The MO_MITNDP is concerned with determining optimal transportation routes and modes for a series of freight provided by multiple sourcing places to find good balance between the total costs and time efficiencies. First, we establish a multi-objective integer programming model to formulate the MO_MITNDP with total cost (TTC) and maximum flow time (MFT) criteria. Specifically, carbon emission costs distinguished by the different transportation mode and route are included in the cost function. Second, to solve the MO_MITNDP, a hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm (HEDA) combined with a heterogeneous marginal distribution and a multi-objective local search is proposed, in which the from the Pareto dominance scenario.

In order to accurately capture the trajectories and microstructure of methane nano-fluidics, the present modification of OPLS fully atomic model is employed. Meanwhile, we introduce the corresponding coarse-grained model to solve the problem of wall–fluid interaction for methane Poiseuille flow within silicon atomic walls using the classical Lorentz–Berthelot mixing rules. The geometries of the upper wall roughness are modeled by rectangular waves with different amplitudes and wavelengths. The three-dimensional number densities of C (H) atom and kinetic energy distribution plots give a clear observation of the impacts of surface roughness on the localization micro-information of methane fluid. Moreover, the slip length of fluid over rough surface decreases with the increase in amplitude. The diffusion coefficients appear anisotropic, and the radial distribution functions decrease with the increase in the amplitude. These properties should be taken into account in the design of energy-saving emission reduction nano-fluidic devices. All numerical results also indicate that the presented method not only can well solve the issue of wall–fluid interactions, but also could accurately predict the micro-information and dynamic properties of methane Poiseuille flow. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Coarse-grained; Lorentz–Berthelot; Molecular dynamics; Multiscale; Poiseuille flow; Roughness","Atoms; Diffusion in liquids; Distribution functions; Emission control; Energy conservation; Fluidics; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Mass transfer; Methane; Numerical methods; Surface roughness; Berthelot; Coarse-grained; Energy-saving emission reductions; Molecular dynamics simulation methods; Molecular dynamics simulations; Multiscale; Poiseuille flow; Radial distribution functions; Molecular dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018396544

The expressions of all above engineered genes were under the control of Gal promoter for alleviating product toxicity. Geraniol production varied from trace amount to 43.19 mg/L (CrGES, GES from Catharanthus roseus) by screening of nine GESs from diverse species. Further through protein structure analysis and site-directed mutation in CrGES, it was firstly demonstrated that among the high-conserved amino acid residues located in active pocket, Y436 and D501 with strong affinity to diphosphate function group, were critical for the dephosphorylation (the core step for geraniol formation). Moreover, the truncation position of the transit peptide from the N-terminus of CrGES was found to influence protein expression and activity significantly, obtaining a titer of 191.61 mg/L geraniol in strain with CrGES truncated at S43 (t3CrGES). Furthermore, directed by surface electrostatics distribution of t3CrGES and Erg20WW (Erg20F96W-N127W), co-expression of the reverse fusion of Erg20ww/t3CrGES and another copy of Erg20WW promoted the geraniol titer to 523.96 mg/L at shakes flask level, due to enhancing GPP accessibility led by protein interaction of t3CrGES-Erg20WW and the free Erg20WW. Eventually, a highest reported titer of 1.68 g/L geraniol in eukaryote cells was achieved in 2.0 L fed-batch fermentation under carbon restriction strategy. Our research opens large opportunities for other microbial production of monoterpenes. It also sets a good reference for desired compounds overproduction in microorganisms in terms of manipulation of key enzymes by protein engineering and metabolic engineering. © 2017 International Metabolic Engineering Society","Enzyme species; Geraniol; Geraniol synthase; Metabolic engineering; Synthetic biology; Truncation position","Biochemical engineering; Carbon; Enzymes; Gene expression; Metabolic engineering; Metabolism; Molecular biology; Plants (botany); Proteins; Toxicity; Yeast; Farnesyl diphosphate synthase; Geraniol; Isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI); Protein structure analysis; Surface electrostatics; Synthases; Synthetic biology; Truncation position; Monoterpenes; 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme reductase; fungal enzyme; geraniol; geraniol synthase; geranyltransferase; isopentenyl diphosphate delta isomerase; unclassified drug; geraniol; geranyltransferase; phosphatase; plant protein; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; terpene; amino terminal sequence; Article; carboxy terminal sequence; Catharanthus roseus; controlled study; fed batch fermentation; fermentation optimization; gene expression; gene overexpression; hydrogen bond; metabolic engineering; molecular docking; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein dephosphorylation; protein engineering; protein function; protein protein interaction; protein structure; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; site directed mutagenesis; static electricity; synthetic biology; biosynthesis; Catharanthus; enzymology; genetics; metabolic engineering; metabolism; Catharanthus; Geranyltranstransferase; Metabolic Engineering; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Plant Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Terpenes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017177957

Herein, we initially built clear models of two-dimensional atomic layers with tunable defect concentrations, and hence directly disclose the defect type and distribution at atomic level. As a prototype, defective one-unit-cell ZnIn2S4 atomic layers are successfully synthesized for the first time. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy directly manifests their distinct zinc vacancy concentrations, confirmed by positron annihilation spectrometry and electron spin resonance analysis. Density-functional calculations reveal that the presence of zinc vacancies ensures higher charge density and efficient carrier transport, verified by ultrafast photogenerated electron transfer time of ∼15 ps from the conduction band of ZnIn2S4 to the trap states. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy manifests the higher zinc vacancy concentration that allows for ∼1.7-fold increase in average recovery lifetime, confirmed by surface photovoltage spectroscopy and PL spectroscopy analysis, which ensures promoted carrier separation rates. As a result, the one-unit-cell ZnIn2S4 layers with rich zinc vacancies exhibit a carbon monoxide formation rate of 33.2 μmol g-1 h-1, roughly 3.6 times higher than that of the one-unit-cell ZnIn2S4 layers with poor zinc vacancies, while the former's photocatalytic activity shows negligible loss after 24 h photocatalysis. This present work uncovers the role of defects in affecting electron-hole separation at atomic level, opening new opportunities for achieving highly efficient solar CO2 reduction performances. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Atoms; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Carrier concentration; Cells; Cytology; Electrons; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Magnetic moments; Photocatalysis; Scanning electron microscopy; Separation; Spectrum analysis; Transmission electron microscopy; Vacancies; Zinc; Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopies; Average recovery; Carrier separation; Electron-hole separation; Photocatalytic activities; Photogenerated electrons; Surface photovoltage spectroscopy; Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; unclassified drug; zinc; zinc derivative; zinc thioindate; absorption spectroscopy; Article; crystal structure; density functional theory; electron; electron spin resonance; electron transport; photocatalysis; positron annihilation spectrometry; reduction (chemistry); scanning transmission electron microscopy; separation technique; spectrometry; spectroscopy; surface photovoltage spectroscopy; ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020381024

However, experimental determination of these fundamental properties of excitons in monolayer WSe2 is largely limited, because the commonly used measurement, such as (time-resolved) photoluminescence, is inherently difficult to probe the intrinsic properties. For example, dark states below bright exciton can change the photoluminescence emission rate by orders of magnitude and gives an “effective” radiative lifetime distinctive from the intrinsic one. On the other hand, such “effective” radiative lifetime becomes important itself because it describes how dark states affect exciton dynamics. Unfortunately, the “effective” radiative lifetime in monolayer WSe2 is also not determined as it requires photoluminescence measurement with resonant excitation, which is technically difficult. These difficulties are overcome here to obtain both the “intrinsic” and “effective” radiative lifetime experimentally. A framework is developed to determine the dipole moment and “intrinsic” radiative lifetime of delocalized excitons in monolayer WSe2 from the absorption measurements. In addition, the “effective” radiative lifetime in WSe2 is obtained through time-resolved photoluminescence and absolute quantum-yield measurement at resonant excitation. These results provide helpful information for fundamental understanding of exciton light–matter interaction in WSe2. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Angiosperms with this form of nutrition possess exceptionally small ‘dust seeds’ which after germination develop ‘seedlings’ that remain subterranean for several years, fully dependent on fungi for supply of carbon. Mycoheterotrophs which as adults have photosynthesis thus develop from full to partial mycoheterotrophy, or autotrophy, during ontogeny. Mycoheterotrophic plants may represent a gradient of variation in a parasitism–mutualism continuum, both among and within species. Previous studies on plant–fungal associations in mycoheterotrophs have focused on either germination or the adult life stages of the plant. Much less is known about the fungal associations during development of the subterranean seedlings. We investigated germination and seedling development and the diversity of fungi associated with germinating seeds and subterranean seedlings (juveniles) in five Monotropoideae (Ericaceae) species, the full mycoheterotroph Monotropa hypopitys and the putatively partial mycoheterotrophs Pyrola chlorantha, P. rotundifolia, Moneses uniflora and Chimaphila umbellata. Seedlings retrieved from seed sowing experiments in the field were used to examine diversity of fungal associates, using pyrosequencing analysis of ITS2 region for fungal identification. The investigated species varied with regard to germination, seedling development and diversity of associated fungi during juvenile ontogeny. Results suggest that fungal host specificity increases during juvenile ontogeny, most pronounced in the fully mycoheterotrophic species, but a narrowing of fungal associates was found also in two partially mycoheterotrophic species. We suggest that variation in specificity of associated fungi during seedling ontogeny in mycoheterotrophs represents ongoing evolution along a parasitism–mutualism continuum. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","dust seeds; ectomycorrhizal fungal community; monotropoideae; mycoheterotrophy; next-generation sequencing; symbiotic germination","Ericaceae; germination; microbiology; mycorrhiza; physiology; seedling; symbiosis; Ericaceae; Germination; Mycorrhizae; Seedlings; Symbiosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017216883

In turn, climate patterns may affect inter- or intra-specific competition, favoring certain individuals over others. Using dendrochronological methods, we sampled cores from dominant pine trees and their nearby competitors in 40 stands in the northern Sierra Nevada. Our dendroclimatological analyses showed complex responses to climate for the dominant pine and their competitors. Pinus lambertiana Dougl. and Pinus ponderosa Dougl. Ex P. & C. Laws benefited from cooler temperatures in the past May; all species benefited from warmer winter temperatures; Calocedrus decurrens (Torr.) Florin benefited from cooler temperatures in the past summer, while Abies concolor (Gord. & Glend.) Lindl.) and the two pine species benefited from cooler temperatures in the present summer. All species showed consistently positive effects from increased precipitation and increased moisture availability. A competition ratio calculated as the ratio between the dominant tree's radial increments to the competitor's indicated that climate could influence competition through one of two mechanisms. One, negative responses to climate conditions that were negative for one species but neutral for another tended to drive the competition ratios. Two, conditions that were negative for both competing trees tended to hurt competitors more than dominant trees, while conditions that were generally positive tended to help competitors more than dominant trees. These results suggest that the dominant pine trees may be more resilient to climate stress than competitors. Reducing competition via management such as thinning may increase climatic resilience for all species and possibly have positive competitive results for competitors.

However, these models often include very little temporal resolution and thus have difficulty in representing the integration costs that arise from mismatches between electricity supply and demand. The global integrated assessment model, MESSAGE, has been updated to explicitly model the trade-offs between variable renewable energy (VRE) deployment and its impacts on the electricity system, including the implications for electricity curtailment, backup capacity, and system flexibility. These impacts have been parameterized using a reduced-form approach, which allows VRE integration impacts to be quantified on a regional basis. In addition, thermoelectric technologies were updated to include two modes of operation, baseload and flexible, to better account for the cost, efficiency, and availability penalties associated with flexible operation. In this paper, the modeling approach used in MESSAGE is explained and the implications for VRE deployment in mitigation scenarios are assessed. Three important stylized facts associated with integrating high VRE shares are successfully reproduced by our modeling approach: (1) the significant reduction in the utilization of non-VRE power plants; (2) the diminishing role for traditional baseload generators, such as nuclear and coal, and the transition to more flexible technologies; and (3) the importance of electricity storage and hydrogen electrolysis in facilitating the deployment of VRE. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Integrated assessment modeling; Integration of renewables; Renewable energy; Residual load duration curves","Climate models; Coal storage; Economic and social effects; Economics; Electric energy storage; Energy policy; Hydrogen storage; Renewable energy resources; Electricity supply and demands; Global integrated assessments; Integrated assessment models; Integration of renewables; Renewable energies; Renewable energy technologies; Residual load; Variable renewable energies; Climate change; alternative energy; electricity supply; integrated approach; modeling; photovoltaic system; solar power; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009776786

High spatial variability in surface water pH and saturation states (Ω) for two biologically-important calcium carbonate minerals calcite and aragonite was observed in Ryder Bay, in the coastal sea-ice zone of the West Antarctic Peninsula. Glacial meltwater and melting sea ice stratified the water column and facilitated the development of large phytoplankton blooms and subsequent strong uptake of atmospheric CO2 of up to 55 mmol m-2 day-1 during austral summer. Concurrent high pH (8.48) and calcium carbonate mineral supersaturation (Ωaragonite ~3.1) occurred in the meltwater-influenced surface ocean. Biologically-induced increases in calcium carbonate mineral saturation states counteracted any effects of carbonate ion dilution. Accumulation of CO2 through remineralisation of additional organic matter from productive coastal waters lowered the pH (7.84) and caused deep-water corrosivity (Ωaragonite ~0.9) in regions impacted by Circumpolar Deep Water. Episodic mixing events enabled CO2-rich subsurface water to become entrained into the surface and eroded seasonal stratification to lower surface water pH (8.21) and saturation states (Ωaragonite ~1.8) relative to all surface waters across Ryder Bay. Uptake of atmospheric CO2 of 28 mmol m-2 day-1 in regions of vertical mixing may enhance the susceptibility of the surface layer to future ocean acidification in dynamic coastal environments. Spatially-resolved studies are essential to elucidate the natural variability in carbonate chemistry in order to better understand and predict carbon cycling and the response of marine organisms to future ocean acidification in the Antarctic coastal zone. © 2017","Carbonate chemistry; glacial meltwater; Ocean acidification; Ryder Bay; Sea ice; West Antarctic Peninsula","Acidification; Atmospheric chemistry; Calcium; Carbon dioxide; Carbonate minerals; Carbonation; Coastal zones; Glacial geology; Ice; Marine biology; Minerals; Mixing; Oceanography; pH; Sea ice; Surface waters; Antarctic Peninsula; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Carbonate saturations; Dynamic coastal environment; Glacial meltwater; Ocean acidifications; Ryder Bay; Spatial variability; Calcium carbonate; aragonite; calcite; calcium carbonate; carbonate; coastal water; coastal zone; dilution; melting; meltwater; ocean acidification; pH; saturation; sea ice; stratification; supersaturation; vertical mixing; Antarctic Peninsula; Antarctica; Ryder Bay; West Antarctica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009997030

The occurrences of HFRS and leptospirosis are influenced by climatic variability. However, few studies have examined the effects of local climatic variables on the development of these infections. The purpose of this study was to estimate the effect of climatic factors on the occurrence of HFRS and leptospirosis in Korea. Methods: Daily records on human cases of HFRS and leptospirosis between January 2001 to December 2009 were analyzed. The associations of climatic factors with these cases in high incidence provinces were estimated using the time-series method and multivariate generalized linear Poisson models with a maximal lag of 12 weeks. Results: From 2001 to 2009, a total of 2912 HFRS and 889 leptospirosis cases were reported, with overall incidences of 0.67 and 0.21 cases per 100,000, respectively, in the study areas. The increase in minimum temperature (1 °C) at a lag of 11 weeks was associated with 17.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 15.1, 20.6%] and 22.7% (95% CI: 16.5, 29.3%) increases in HFRS and leptospirosis cases, respectively. A 1-h increase in the daily sunshine was related to a 27.5% (95% CI: 18.2, 37.6%) increase in HFRS at a lag of 0 week. A 1% increase in daily minimum relative humidity and a 1 mm increase in daily rainfall were associated with 4.0% (95% CI:1.8, 6.1) and 2.0% (95% CI: 1.2, 2.8%) increases in weekly leptospirosis cases at 11 and 6 weeks later, respectively. A 1 mJ/m2 increase in daily solar radiation was associated with a 13.7% (95% CI: 4.9, 23.2%) increase in leptospirosis cases, maximized at a 2-week lag. Conclusions: During the peak season in Korea, climatic factors play a significant role in the development of HFRS and leptospirosis.

The development of predictive, mechanistic models of Spartina has been hindered by the lack of information on below-ground biomass and its dynamics, and in particular the storage of resources that can be used for spring re-growth. We studied the dynamics of non-structural carbohydrates (glucose, fructose, sucrose, and starch) and biomass in 8 different above- and below-ground tissues in S. alterniflora over the course of a year in a salt marsh on Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA. We found greater seasonal variability in non-structural carbohydrates in S. alterniflora than had been previously reported, with concentrations varying between 3.3% through 17.3% of the total biomass and between 0% and 19.5% of dry weight depending on the type of tissue, with statistical differences between the different tissues. We found that sucrose was the dominant non-structural carbohydrate in above- and below-ground tissue, and that this sugar was likely used for long-term storage during winter months and as a resource for early spring growth. Glucose, fructose, and starch showed less variability, with glucose following changes in above-ground biomass more closely indicating their use as short-term storage. We were unable to develop a coherent carbon budget for the plants largely because of uncertainties in modeled net primary production and heterogeneity in below-ground biomass. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon allocation; Model; Net primary production; Non-structural carbohydrate; Salt marsh grass; Sapelo Island; Spartina alterniflora; Spartina biomass","aboveground biomass; belowground biomass; biomass allocation; carbohydrate; carbon budget; concentration (composition); grass; heterogeneity; net primary production; saltmarsh; seasonal variation; Georgia; Sapelo Island; Sea Islands; United States; Hymenachne; Spartina; Spartina alterniflora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018365095

Farmers’ adaptation measures included changes in cropping systems, cropping calendars, crop varieties, agronomic practices, crop diversification and improved animal husbandry. Reducing environmental stress, ensuring self-sufficiency in staple crops (mainly rice) and other crop production practices, and enhancing economic viability of farm enterprises have underpinned these adaptations. Off-farm and non-farm wage employment, temporary migration, self-employment and educating children, constituted the core non-farm adaptation strategies. Emerging cropping systems like maize/cucumber and maize/stem amaranth/rice were economically more viable than the traditional rice/rice and rice/maize systems. Despite some uncertainties, farming was preferred to off-farm work, generating higher returns to labour for all cropping systems. Limited access to stress-tolerant varieties, extension services and affordable agricultural credit, combined with high production costs, variability in crop yields and output prices, are the main barriers to adaptation.

We used these scores to determine whether mixed hardwood-softwood stands or “mixedwoods” were better suited to projected future climates than pure hardwood or pure softwood stands. We also examined the quantity of aboveground carbon (C) sequestered in the overstory of these mixtures. In the four different mixedwood types that we examined, we found that Pinus echinata-Quercus mixtures in the Ozark Highlands had greater Compatibility scores than hardwood stands and greater Adaptability scores than pure Pinus echinata stands; however, these mixtures did not store more aboveground overstory C than pure stands. For Pinus strobus-Quercus rubra, Picea-Abies-hardwood, and Tsuga canadensis-hardwood mixtures, scores indicated that there were no advantages or disadvantages related to climate compatibility. Those mixtures generally had greater Adaptability scores than their pure softwood analogs but stored less aboveground overstory C.

To assess the importance of these projections and understand adaptation challenges at farm level, detailed farm-scale model simulations of climate change impacts were undertaken for six representative pasture-based dairy farms located in the major dairying regions of New Zealand. The analysis suggested that without adaptation, climate change is likely to have a negative impact in most of the study locations. However, the level and type of impact depends to a large degree on regional climate variability as well as on the management practices of each farm. Under current management, responses to projected climate changes ranged from no change to an 18% decrease in average annual pasture production. A number of modelled adaptations demonstrated the potential to reduce climate change impacts under current management.

Based on a literature review and selected stakeholder interviews in two Northern (The Netherland and UK) and two Southern EU Member States (Italy and Spain), we conclude that the current policy mix is far from optimal. There are currently no EU-wide policy instruments to address GHG emissions in the agri-food sector, and little Member State level action. A number of initiatives from the private sector (particularly retailers) are present, although they are limited in scope and objectives. Looking forward, three concrete recommendations for improvements may be identified. First, stakeholders identify the need for the development of EU-wide policy instrumentation for GHG abatement from the agri-food sector, to provide a ‘level playing field’ for farmers and other economic agents in the sector. Second, many stakeholders consider it crucial that a holistic, ‘whole supply chain’ in contrast to a ‘piecemeal’ approach is taken. Third, the role of government is considered important, but predominantly in terms of providing a general framework within which more ambitious voluntary approaches could develop. Policy relevance From a policy perspective, this article aims to assist the EU develop more ‘optimal’ climate policies for the agri-food sector by taking into account the views and perspectives of different stakeholders involved in different countries on three main ‘optimality’ criteria, namely, environmental effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and political feasibility. © 2016 The Author(s).

In the paper, a new CCHP system is proposed which consists of a power generation unit (PGU), an absorption chiller, a storage tank and a ground source heat pump (GSHP) to substitute conventional electric chiller and auxiliary boiler to supply the deficient cooling or heating load. In the study, three basic load following strategies: following electric load (FEL), following thermal load (FTL) and following hybrid load (FHL) are employed to analyze the annual total cost (ATC), operational cost (COST), carbon dioxide emissions (CDE) and primary energy consumption (PEC) based on a case study of a regional energy system in Sino-Singapore eco-city. For the evaluated case, carbon tax and electricity feed in tariff are both considered to compare with the performances of following maximum electric efficiency of the PGU (Max-eff) strategy. The results show that the proposed system performed well on COST, CDE and PEC reduction and the ATC are all increased except that of Max-eff strategy with carbon tax and electricity feed in tariff. When carbon tax and electricity feed in tariff are considered, performances of the Max-eff strategy is the best. Otherwise, the application of FEL is better.

The Malawi Farmer to Farmer Agroecology project (MAFFA) encourages farmer experimentation, community involvement and farmer-to-farmer teaching on agroecology, nutrition and gender equity. Recent international assessments of agriculture have highlighted the urgent need for changes in farming practices in Sub-Saharan Africa, due to land degradation, high levels of food insecurity and anticipated climate change impacts. Agroecological approaches have shown great potential to address these multiple needs. Using a longitudinal panel survey data and propensity score matching to account for selection bias in project participation, we analyzed the impact of the project on household income and food security in Malawi in 2012 (Wave 1 = 1200 households) and in 2014 (Wave 2 = 1000 households). We used the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) for impact evaluation. Estimates of average treatment-effects using difference in difference methods showed that participating in MAFFA has led to a significant increase in household wealth (β = 3.54, p = 0.01) and a large reduction in food insecurity (β = −3.21, p = 0.01) compared to non-participants, after 2 years, even after accounting for covariates and selection bias. These results indicate that agroecological methods combined with farmer led knowledge exchanges can be welfare enhancing, both in terms of food security and in terms of income for family farm households. Agroecological approaches should be promoted through upscaling of farmer-to-farmer knowledge exchanges, community involvement and attention to nutrition and social equity to enhance farmer learning and household welfare benefits. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology.","Agroecology; Food insecurity; Household wealth; Impact analysis; Malawi","agricultural worker; agroecology; climate change; equity; farmers knowledge; food security; household income; participatory approach; project management; social impact assessment; welfare impact; Malawi; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018284339

This information can be useful in designing air quality management strategies and in understanding the potential benefits of reducing emissions from a particular source category. The Comprehensive Air quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) offers unique source attribution tools, called the Ozone and Particulate Source Apportionment Technology (OSAT/PSAT), which track source contributions. We present results from a CAMx source attribution modeling study for a summer month and a winter month using a recently evaluated European CAMx modeling database developed for Phase 3 of the Air Quality Model Evaluation International Initiative (AQMEII). The contributions of several source sectors (including model boundary conditions of chemical species representing transport of emissions from outside the modeling domain as well as initial conditions of these species) to O3 or PM2.5 concentrations in Europe were calculated using OSAT and PSAT, respectively. A 1-week spin-up period was used to reduce the influence of initial conditions. Evaluation focused on 16 major cities and on identifying source sectors that contributed above 5 %. Boundary conditions have a large impact on summer and winter ozone in Europe and on summer PM2.5, but they are only a minor contributor to winter PM2.5. Biogenic emissions are important for summer ozone and PM2.5. The important anthropogenic sectors for summer ozone are transportation (both on-road and non-road), energy production and conversion, and industry. In two of the 16 cities, solvent and product also contributed above 5 % to summertime ozone. For summertime PM2.5, the important anthropogenic source sectors are energy, transportation, industry, and agriculture. Residential wood combustion is an important anthropogenic sector in winter for PM2.5 over most of Europe, with larger contributions in central and eastern Europe and the Nordic cities. Other anthropogenic sectors with large contributions to wintertime PM2.5 include energy, transportation, and agriculture. © Author(s) 2017.",,"air quality; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric transport; concentration (composition); emission control; ozone; particulate matter; source apportionment; source identification; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019073841

Beyond the formidable human cost of maintaining a divided world, the possibility of incomplete globalisation also gives rise to a number of environmental risks. While environmental political theory generally sees strength in localism, history rather shows that a robust world trade system is crucial to offset local resource scarcities and that cosmopolitan norms of solidarity are essential for helping communities to rebuild after environmental catastrophe.

The occurrence of ecological environment-driven shifts was studied in the Southern Caspian Sea using the ""shiftogram"" method on available fisheries-related (i.e. commercially important benthopelagic fish stocks) ecological and climatic variables. As indicators of potential environmentally driven shift patterns we used indices for the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Southern Oscillation, the Siberian High, the East Atlantic-West Russia pattern, as well as Sea Surface Temperature and surface chlorophyll-a concentration. Given the explorative findings from the serial shift analyses, the cascading and serial order of multiple shift events in climaticecologic conditions of the southern Caspian Sea suggested a linkage between external forces and dynamics of ecosystem components and structures in the following order: global-scale climate forces lead to local environmental processes, which in turn lead to biological components dynamics. For the first time, this study indicates that ecological shifts are an integral component of bentho-pelagic subsystem regulatory processes and dynamics. Qualitative correspondence of biological responses of bentho-pelagic stocks to climatic events is one of the supporting evidences that overall Caspian ecosystem structures and functioning might have-at least partially-been impacted by global-scale climatic or local environmental shifts. These findings may help to foster a regional Ecosystem-based Approach to Management (EAM) as an integral part of bentho-pelagic fisheries management plans. © 2017 Beyraghdar Kashkooli et al.

Understanding the drivers of animal movement across multiple scales is crucial for understanding the fundamentals of movement ecology, predicting changes in distribution, describing disease dynamics, and identifying efficient methods of wildlife conservation and management. Methods: We obtained over 400,000 GPS locations of wild pigs from 13 different studies spanning six states in southern U.S.A., and quantified movement rates and home range size within a single analytical framework. We used a generalized additive mixed model framework to quantify the effects of five broad predictor categories on movement: individual-level attributes, geographic factors, landscape attributes, meteorological conditions, and temporal variables. We examined effects of predictors across three temporal scales: daily, monthly, and using all data during the study period. We considered both local environmental factors such as daily weather data and distance to various resources on the landscape, as well as factors acting at a broader spatial scale such as ecoregion and season. Results: We found meteorological variables (temperature and pressure), landscape features (distance to water sources), a broad-scale geographic factor (ecoregion), and individual-level characteristics (sex-age class), drove wild pig movement across all scales, but both the magnitude and shape of covariate relationships to movement differed across temporal scales. Conclusions: The analytical framework we present can be used to assess movement patterns arising from multiple data sources for a range of species while accounting for spatio-temporal correlations. Our analyses show the magnitude by which reaction norms can change based on the temporal scale of response data, illustrating the importance of appropriately defining temporal scales of both the movement response and covariates depending on the intended implications of research (e.g., predicting effects of movement due to climate change versus planning local-scale management). We argue that consideration of multiple spatial scales within the same framework (rather than comparing across separate studies post-hoc) gives a more accurate quantification of cross-scale spatial effects by appropriately accounting for error correlation. © 2017 The Author(s).","AKDE; Animal movement; Feral swine; GPS; Home range; MCP; Reaction norm; Sus scrofa; Wild pig",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020734367

However, there has been relatively little exploration of climate-variability related yield shocks. The short observational yield record does not adequately sample natural inter-annual variability thereby limiting the accuracy of probability assessments. Focusing on the United States and China, we present an innovative use of initialised ensemble climate simulations and a new agro-climatic indicator, to calculate the risk of severe water stress. Combined, these regions provide 60% of the world's maize, and therefore, are crucial to global food security. To probe a greater range of inter-annual variability, the indicator is applied to 1400 simulations of the present day climate. The probability of severe water stress in the major maize producing regions is quantified, and in many regions an increased risk is found compared to calculations from observed historical data. Analysis suggests that the present day climate is also capable of producing unprecedented severe water stress conditions. Therefore, adaptation plans and policies based solely on observed events from the recent past may considerably under-estimate the true risk of climate-related maize shocks. The probability of a major impact event occurring simultaneously across both regions - a multi-breadbasket failure - is estimated to be up to 6% per decade and arises from a physically plausible climate state. This novel approach highlights the significance of climate impacts on crop production shocks and provides a platform for considerably improving food security assessments, in the present day or under a changing climate, as well as development of new risk based climate services. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","climate; crop; maize; shocks; yield","Crops; Cultivation; Food supply; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Agricultural productions; climate; Climate model simulations; Interannual variability; maize; Probability assessments; shocks; yield; Climate models; agricultural production; annual variation; climate modeling; crop production; crop yield; food security; maize; simulation; water stress; China; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019612015

Scenarios are explored using the ANSWER-MARKAL model with a modified version of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 9-region database. Modified cost and performance projections for LDV technologies are adapted from the National Research Council (2013) optimistic case. Under our optimistic scenario (OPT) we find 15% and 47% adoption of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in 2030 and 2050, respectively. In contrast, gasoline vehicles (ICEVs) remain dominant through 2050 in the EPA reference case (BAU). Compared to BAU, OPT gives 16% and 36% reductions in LDV greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for 2030 and 2050, respectively, corresponding to 5% and 9% reductions in economy-wide emissions. Total nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and SO2 emissions are similar in the two scenarios due to intersectoral shifts. Moderate, economy-wide GHG fees have little effect on GHG emissions from the LDV sector but are more effective in the electricity sector. In the OPT scenario, estimated well-to-wheels GHG emissions from full-size BEVs with 100-mile range are 62 gCO2-e mi-1 in 2050, while those from full-size ICEVs are 121 gCO2-e mi-1.

The question for policy makers is whether the impacts of water-related risk accrue to manifest as a drag on economic growth at a scale suggesting policy intervention. In this study, the average drag on economic growth from water-related hazards faced by society at a global level is estimated. We use panel regressions with various specifications to investigate the relationship between economic growth and hydroclimatic variables at the country-river basin level. In doing so, we make use of surface water runoff variables never used before. The analysis of the climate variables shows that water availability and water hazards have significant effects on economic growth, providing further evidence beyond earlier studies finding that precipitation extremes were at least as important or likely more important than temperature effects. We then incorporate a broad set of variables representing the areas of infrastructure, institutions, and information to identify the characteristics of a region that determine its vulnerability to water-related risks. The results identify water scarcity, governance, and agricultural intensity as the most relevant measures affecting vulnerabilities to climate variability effects. © 2017. American Geophysical Union.

Ceria (CeO2)-titania (TiO2) oxide supports of different compositions were employed and their effects on photothermal CO2 conversion examined. Two factors are shown to be crucial for instigating photothermal CO2 methanation activity: ① Fine nickel deposits are required for both higher active catalyst area and greater light absorption capacity for the initial heating of the catalyst bed; and ② the presence of defect sites on the support are necessary to promote adsorption of CO2 for its subsequent activation. Titania inclusion within the support plays a crucial role in maintaining the oxygen vacancy defect sites on the (titanium-doped) cerium oxide.

Five criteria were used in this analysis included 1) mitigation potential, 2) total costs, 3) feasibility, 4) owner of benefits and 5) environmental benefits. Although, the action plan which focused on improving electricity consumption of the building and promoting electricity conservation campaign for Bangkok resident was expected to the highest reduction of greenhouse gases (2.7 million tons of CO2 reduction). However, effort on expanding of the park area was evaluated as the most appropriate initiative when consider both of its effectiveness in reducing emissions, and its implementation cost. Carbon removal rate of trees in Bangkok's park was also evaluated through an intensive study at selected parks using data collected over the period of 10 years (2005-2015). It was found that the park in Bangkok could store carbon of about 1.86 tC/y (6.82 tCO2/y) or 0.58 tC/ha/y. These predicted results were coincided with actual outcomes evaluated from the implementation of each policy in the metropolitan area.

We have previously identified the transcription factor TCF21 as the causal CAD gene at 6q23.2 and characterized its downstream transcriptional network that is enriched for CAD GWAS genes. Here we investigate the hypothesis that TCF21 interacts with a downstream target gene, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates the cellular response to environmental contaminants, including dioxin and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., tobacco smoke). Perturbation of TCF21 expression in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC) revealed that TCF21 promotes expression of AHR, its heterodimerization partner ARNT, and cooperates with these factors to upregulate a number of inflammatory downstream disease related genes including IL1A, MMP1, and CYP1A1. TCF21 was shown to bind in AHR, ARNT and downstream target gene loci, and co-localization was noted for AHR-ARNT and TCF21 binding sites genome-wide in regions of HCASMC open chromatin. These regions of co-localization were found to be enriched for GWAS signals associated with cardio-metabolic as well as chronic inflammatory disease phenotypes. Finally, we show that similar to TCF21, AHR gene expression is increased in atherosclerotic lesions in mice in vivo using laser capture microdissection, and AHR protein is localized in human carotid atherosclerotic lesions where it is associated with protein kinases with a critical role in innate immune response. These data suggest that TCF21 can cooperate with AHR to activate an inflammatory gene expression program that is exacerbated by environmental stimuli, and may contribute to the overall risk for CAD. © 2017 Kim et al.",,"aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; cytochrome P450 1A1; dioxin; interleukin 1alpha; interstitial collagenase; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; transcription factor; transcription factor TCF21; unclassified drug; AHR protein, human; ARNT protein, human; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; basic helix loop helix transcription factor; CYP1A1 protein, human; cytochrome P450 1A1; hypoxia inducible factor 1beta; IL1A protein, human; interleukin 1alpha; interstitial collagenase; MMP1 protein, human; protein binding; TCF21 protein, human; AHR gene; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; ARNT gene; Article; atherosclerosis; binding affinity; binding site; cardiovascular risk; controlled study; coronary artery; coronary artery disease; CYP1A1 gene; gene; gene expression; gene function; gene locus; gene targeting; genome-wide association study; genotype environment interaction; human; human cell; IL1A gene; innate immunity; MMP1 gene; mouse; nonhuman; promoter region; protein interaction; protein localization; quantitative trait locus; regulatory mechanism; single nucleotide polymorphism; smooth muscle cell; TCF21 gene; upregulation; animal; C57BL mouse; cell culture; coronary blood vessel; cytology; genetics; HEK293 cell line; metabolism; smooth muscle cell; Animals; Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator; Atherosclerosis; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Cells, Cultured; Coronary Vessels; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Interleukin-1alpha; Matrix Metalloproteinase 1; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle; Protein Binding; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020172478

First, ground horizontal irradiance(GHI) and direct normal irradiance(DNI) from the model was compared with those of ground stations throughout South Korea to evaluate the uncertainty of the GHI-derived DNI. Then solar thermal resource potential was assessed using a DNI map. Uncertainty of irradiances appeared highly dependent on sky conditions.

Unravelling the relationship between climate variables and malaria transmission dynamics is therefore instrumental in developing effective malaria control strategies. The main aim of this study was to describe the effects of variability of rainfall, maximum temperature and vegetation indices on seasonal trends of malaria in selected health facilities within Baringo County, Kenya. Methods: Climate variables sourced from the International Research Institute (IRI)/Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) climate database and malaria cases reported in 10 health facilities spread across four ecological zones (riverine, lowland, mid-altitude and highland) between 2004 and 2014 were subjected to a time series analysis. A negative binomial regression model with lagged climate variables was used to model long-term monthly malaria cases. The seasonal Mann-Kendall trend test was then used to detect overall monotonic trends in malaria cases. Results: Malaria cases increased significantly in the highland and midland zones over the study period. Changes in malaria prevalence corresponded to variations in rainfall and maximum temperature. Rainfall at a time lag of 2 months resulted in an increase in malaria transmission across the four zones while an increase in temperature at time lags of 0 and 1 month resulted in an increase in malaria cases in the riverine and highland zones, respectively. Conclusion: Given the existence of a time lag between climatic variables more so rainfall and peak malaria transmission, appropriate control measures can be initiated at the onset of short and after long rains seasons. © 2017 The Author(s).","Baringo County; Kenya; Malaria transmission; Rainfall; Seasonal trends; Temperature","rain; Article; climate; disease transmission; environmental temperature; geographic distribution; human; Kenya; malaria; prevalence; risk factor; seasonal variation; trend study; vegetation; climate change; ecosystem; malaria; parasitology; season; statistical model; theoretical model; transmission; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Humans; Kenya; Malaria; Models, Statistical; Models, Theoretical; Prevalence; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019931823

In order to better understand poisoning mechanisms and guide strategies for developing more durable materials and devices, we have used operando optical methods combined with electrochemical measurements to investigate the effects of sulfur (170 ppm H2S) on SOFC Ni/YSZ anodes operating on methane at high temperature (700 °C). There is clear evidence of reduced anode catalytic activity based on near infrared thermal imaging which shows not only that the cooling associated with endothermic methane cracking is reduced but also that an elevated temperature is observed that is temporally correlated with drastic electrochemical changes indicative of substantial anode degradation. Mid infrared emission measurements indicate less fuel consumption and fewer oxidation products in agreement with the trend of suppressed anode activity. The effects are compared to similar studies of chlorine contamination where reversibility and degradation mechanisms have been mapped out more extensively to show they depend sensitively on temperature and type of fuel; the effects are more pronounced and seem to be promoted in electrochemically active regions for sulfur. © The Electrochemical Society.",,"Anodes; Catalyst activity; Catalytic cracking; Degradation; Gas fuel purification; Infrared devices; Infrared imaging; Methane; Nickel compounds; Sulfur; Chlorine contamination; Degradation mechanism; Electrochemical measurements; Elevated temperature; Generate electricity; Mid-infrared emission; Optical investigation; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs); Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028458633

There is a growing interest in using the C services of wetlands to help reduce habitat loss and finance restoration projects. However, including wetlands in C markets worldwide requires a better mechanistic understanding of CO2 and methane exchange and instruments and models that can accurately and inexpensively monitor and predict these fluxes across global wetlands. Remote sensing technology, including near-surface and satellite instruments/approaches, is an effective tool for modeling C fluxes including gross primary productivity (GPP) from the site to global scale. In this study, we evaluate the potential of using digital cameras as a simple, cost-effective means of estimating GPP in restored wetlands, and assess the suitability of using Landsat data to model GPP in these environments for regional upscaling. Our research focused on restored temperate freshwater marshes due to their high C sequestration potential. As observed in other ecosystems, daily GPP was strongly correlated with site greenness derived from camera imagery (GCCcam). Based on this, we show the potential of using GCCcam and eddy covariance data to adapt and parameterize a light use efficiency (LUE) model to predict daily GPP. The LUE model combining GCCcam and meteorological data was able to explain up to 91% of the variation in daily GPP at the restored marshes, and predict annual GPP budgets within 0% to 20% of observed budgets. However, model performance decreased with increasing site complexity, highlighting the need to explicitly consider spatial heterogeneity in LUE models. We also tested a similar model using Landsat-derived indices, and found that although model performance was high at a homogeneous wetland dominated by emergent vegetation, data-model agreement decreased at a site comprised of a mixture of open water and vegetation, reflecting limitations of Landsat data. Nonetheless, we show that digital camera and Landsat imagery can be used to model photosynthesis in restored wetlands, providing low-cost methods for monitoring C capture that can be used in C market-funded wetland conservation and restoration. © 2017","Eddy covariance; Landsat; Light use efficiency model; PhenoCam; Photosynthesis; Wetlands","carbon budget; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; digital image; ecological modeling; eddy covariance; Landsat; light use efficiency; net primary production; photosynthesis; restoration ecology; satellite data; satellite imagery; wetland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013795846

This study presents a comparison of past and present distribution of rare alpine species in the high-mountain zone of the Ukrainian Carpathians, as well as trends in their monitored populations. Cold-adapted species proved to be the most vulnerable at the lower limit of their distribution, which has been undergoing an upward shift. Declines or extinctions have been noted in species typical of snowbed (Cerastium cerastoides, Salix herbacea, Saxifraga carpatica, Veronica alpina), glareophytic (Cardaminopsis neglecta, Oxyria digyna, Saxifraga oppositifolia), saxicolous (Erigeron atticus, Lloydia serotina, Veronica bellidioides) and hygrophytic habitats (Pedicularis oederi, Saxifraga aizoides). On the other hand, there are examples of positive responses of other species (Gentiana punctata, Loiseleuria procumbens) resulting from the decrease of snow cover and consequent frost damage to vegetation, which reduce competition and/or create microsites suitable for seed recruitment. Restricted to atypically low elevations, outlying populations of many declining alpine species are geographically peripheral in the Ukrainian Carpathians, and their extinction causes contraction of the species’ geographical ranges and significant irreversible loss of biodiversity in the region. The current decline of cold-adapted species results not only from warming during the most recent period, but is also triggered by an extinction debt accumulated in the past. © 2017, Institute of Botany, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.","alpine species; Carpathians; climate change; extinction; population","alpine environment; climate change; climate effect; competition (ecology); extinction; mountain region; plant; population decline; rare species; seedling establishment; Carpathians; Ukraine; Arabidopsis neglecta; Cerastium cerastoides; Erigeron; Gentiana punctata; Kalmia procumbens; Lloydia serotina; Oxyria digyna; Pedicularis oederi; Salix herbacea; Saxifraga; Saxifraga aizoides; Saxifraga oppositifolia; Veronica alpina; Veronica bellidioides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021760181

Forests provide food, generate incomes, provide supporting (nutrient cycling, pollination), and regulating (climate, diseases, water regulation and purification) services for agriculture, in addition to their aesthetic, cultural and spiritual role. However, most of the studies on forest resource use do not focus on the role of landscape organization in addressing the impact of climate variability and the risk of food insecurity. This study aims to examine the contribution of woodlands and trees towards decreasing the risk of food insecurity and the importance of landscape structure and composition in coping with food shortages. It took place in two villages in Burkina Faso, on both ends of the woodlands and tree-cover spectrum. We demonstrate that in both landscapes, ecosystem goods, such as shea nuts and fuelwood, represent a safety net for households during food shortage periods. We demonstrate that households shape their adaptive strategies differently depending on the resources available and the structure of the landscape. People living in a landscape with a savannah matrix (Sorobouly) rely on fuelwood trade to purchase cereals, while those living in a landscape with a parkland matrix (Kalembouly) rely on shea nuts. Agricultural, environmental and climate change policies that reinforce the rights of the most vulnerable to access key resources provided by these landscapes and development programs which assure their sustainable use will simultaneously enhance food security and increase their adaptive capacity in the face of climate change and variability. © 2016, The Author(s).","Adaptive strategies; Climate variability; Food shortage; Forest resource; Landscape diversity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962019823

However, a vast majority of the existing photocatalysts are only capable of harnessing ultraviolet (UV) or/and visible light (Vis), whereas the near-infrared (NIR) region still remains unexplored. In this study, carbon quantum dots (CQDs)-decorated ultrathin Bi2WO6 nanosheets (UBW) were demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst for CO2 photoreduction over the Vis–NIR broad spectrum. It is noteworthy that the synthesis procedure of the CQDs/UBW hybrid nanocomposites was highly facile, involving a one-pot hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-assisted hydrothermal process. Under visible light irradiation, the optimized 1CQDs/UBW (1 wt.% CQD content) exhibited a remarkable 9.5-fold and 3.1-fold enhancement of CH4 production over pristine Bi2WO6 nanoplatelets (PBW) and bare UBW, respectively. More importantly, the photocatalytic responsiveness of CQDs/UBW was successfully extended to the NIR region, which was achieved without involving any rare earth or noble metals. The realization of NIR-driven CO2 reduction could be attributed to the synergistic effects of (i) the ultrathin nanostructures and highly exposed {001} active facets of UBW, (ii) the excellent spectral coupling of UBW and CQDs, where UBW could be excited by the up-converted photoluminescence of CQDs, and (iii) the electron-withdrawing nature of the CQDs to trap the photogenerated electrons and retard the recombination of charge carriers.

Altheimer Dr., Fayetteville, AR  72704, United States","This review addresses short- and long-term adaptation strategies in rain fed and irrigated rice production systems under two climate change scenarios, specifically temperature increases and drought incidence. Each scenario is discussed based on rice plant physiological responses to abiotic stress and, where applicable, consequent yield losses. Possible short- and long-term adaptation measures, mainly focused on crop management strategies and germplasm development, are suggested to overcome production losses. Increased temperature, for example, can adversely affect rice yields either as a result of spikelet sterility or reduced accumulation of assimilates. Most agronomic operations to minimize the impact of increased temperatures involve early sowing or the use of early maturing rice cultivars to avoid high temperatures at grain filling. These measures might be feasible, but inadequate, as periods of increased temperature become more frequent and severe particularly in regions where temperatures are already above optimum for rice growth. On the other hand, rice germplasm from exceedingly warm environments can be used for selecting traits which are appropriate for the development of high temperature stress-tolerant rice cultivars. Drought incidence causes stomata closure, which reduces the leaf CO2/O2 ratio, resulting in photosynthesis inhibition and subsequent reductions in biomass production and the life cycle of the plant. These are manifested in significant yield losses. Drought is a common phenomenon in many rice growing environments, and research on developing cultivars capable of escaping, avoiding and/or tolerating drought merits further attention. Crop management, including water management techniques, to mitigate drought stress has also advanced. The implementation of a water-saving technology called alternate-wetting and drying, for example, enables optimum use of irrigation water and reduces methane emissions by 48% compared to continuous flooding of rice fields.

Research shows that over recent decades local people have observed environmental changes and a significant decrease in the number of fish caught. Fishing regulations introduced after the collapse of the Soviet Union burdened fishers with quotas and temporal limitations that have hindered their fishing activities.

While earlier studies estimate magnitudes of future exposure or project rates of sea level rise, here, we estimate growth rates of exposure, likely to be a key factor in how effectively coastal communities can adapt. These rates may not correlate well with sea level rise rates due to varying patterns of topography and development. We integrate exposure assessments based on LiDAR elevation data with extreme flood event distributions and sea level rise projections to compute the expected annual exposure of population, housing, roads, and property value in 327 medium-tolarge coastal municipalities circumscribing the contiguous USA, and identify those localities that could experience rapid exposure growth sometime this century.We define a rate threshold of 0.25% additive increase in expected annual exposure per year, based on its rarity of present-day exceedance. With unchecked carbon emissions under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, the number of cities exceeding the threshold reaches 33 (18-59, 90%CI) by 2050 and 90 (22-196) by 2100, including the cities of Boston and Miami.

These cylindrical carbon molecules have unusual properties, which are valuable for nanotechnology, electronics, optics and other fields of materials science and technology. With this intention, we investigate the three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic convective heat and mass transfer of nanofluid over a slendering stretching sheet filled with porous medium and heat source/sink. For balancing the flow, temperature and concentration slip mechanisms are also taken into account. In this investigation simulation performed by mixing the two types of carbon nanotubes, namely single- and multi-walled carbon nanotubes, into water as base fluid. The governing system of partial differential equations is transformed into nonlinear ordinary differential equations which answered by using R–K–Fehlberg-integration scheme. The impact of various pertinent parameters on velocity, temperature and concentration as well as the friction factor coefficient, local Nusselt and local Sherwood number is derived and discussed through graphs and tables for both single- and multi-walled carbon nanotubes cases. It is found that the momentum boundary layer thickness of SWCNTs is thicker than MWCNTs. These results can help us to conclude that SWCNTs are helpful for minimizing the friction between the particles, whereas MWCNTs are helpful for boosting the heat and mass transfer rate. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Carbon nanotubes; Heat source; Magnetohydrodynamic; Multiple slips; Porous medium; Variable thickness sheet","Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Carbon nanotubes; Continuum mechanics; Friction; Heat transfer; Magnetohydrodynamics; Mass transfer; Nanotubes; Nonlinear equations; Ordinary differential equations; Porous materials; Suspensions (fluids); Convective heat and mass transfers; Cylindrical nanostructures; Heat sources; Materials science and technology; Multiple slips; Nonlinear ordinary differential equation; Porous medium; Variable thickness; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN)",Retracted,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016110898

The different pictures in orbital interactions between the pyrene core and the D-A substituents led to the outcome that 1,6-substituted pyrene derivative 1 had stronger electron-donating and electron-accepting properties in conjunction with a small HOMO-LUMO gap, as compared to the 2,7-substituted derivative. For these pyrene derivatives, modest (φF = 0.2) to strong (φF = 1.0) fluorescence was detected in degassed organic solvents; 1 exhibited a typical intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) emission obeying energy-gap law, while 2 displayed a moderate inverse energy-gap law, originating from the different substitution patterns. Although theoretical calculations predicted that both 1 and 2 adopt highly twisted ICT excited states (TICT excited states) even in the gas phase, but practically, it was suggested that the observed photophysical properties could be determined by the extent of twist angle of the TICT-like excited state in accordance with the solvent polarity. Moreover, the bulky D-A substituents inhibit the intermolecular direct π-π interactions, thereby resulting in the bright and moderate solid-state emissions for 1 (φF = 0.76) and 2 (φF = 0.21), respectively. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Charge transfer; Energy gap; Excited states; Organic polymers; Solvents; Electron-accepting; Intramolecular charge transfers; Orbital interaction; Photophysical properties; Pyrene derivatives; Solid state emission; Substitution patterns; Theoretical calculations; Pyrene; 1,6 pyrene; 2,7 pyrene; pyrene derivative; unclassified drug; Article; chemical structure; conformational transition; crystal structure; density functional theory; dielectric constant; dipole; electricity; electrochemistry; intramolecular charge transfer; light related phenomena; molecular size; oxidation reduction potential; photoluminescence; photophysics; quantum yield; solid state; synthesis; X ray crystallography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019394645

For example, O3 spectra in the stratosphere are stronger during the day than at night. Conversely, spectra in the MLT region at night are stronger than those occurring during the day due to diurnal variations in O3 behavior. These opposing behaviors cause problems, including oscillations and inaccuracies particularly for O3 vertical profiles in the MLT region retrieved with an application of one retrieval procedure for the entire vertical range (stratosphere to thermosphere). Recently, we developed an optimal retrieval method for O3 in the MLT region for spectra, observed by the Superconducting Submillimeter-Wave Limb-Emission Sounder (SMILES) instrument on the International Space Station. Optimizations were performed for frequency window range, retrieval vertical range, vertical grids, and a priori information for O3 and temperature. Precision and accuracy were evaluated by error analysis and comparisons with previous products. The random error was estimated to be about 5% and 35% in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, respectively, for nighttime O3 profiles in the MLT region. The total systematic error was about 6% in the MLT region. Certain improvements for both random noise (from 50% to 35%) and systematic error (from 10% to 6%) were obtained. We succeeded in revealing the positive correlation between O3 and ClO at nighttime in the upper mesosphere using the optimized O3 profiles; furthermore, its chemical mechanism was explained quantitatively. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","MLT region; Ozone; SMILES","Emission spectroscopy; Errors; Information retrieval; Ozone; Space stations; Submillimeter waves; Chemical mechanism; International Space stations; Limb emission spectra; Mesosphere and lower thermosphere; MLT region; Positive correlations; Retrieval procedures; SMILES; Ionosphere; accuracy assessment; atmospheric chemistry; error analysis; mesosphere; optimization; ozone; precision; spectral analysis; stratosphere; thermosphere; vertical profile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013812867

Previous theories of giant planet cooling assume that the atmospheric composition is unchanged throughout the evolution. Planet formation theories, however, suggest that the atmospheres especially of ice giants are rich in heavy elements in the early stages. These heavy elements include condensable species such as H2O, NH3, and CH4, which are expected to have a great impact on atmospheric temperature and thus on radiative emission through latent heat release. In this study we investigate the effect of such condensation on the planetary emission flux and quantify the impact on the cooling timescale. We then demonstrate that the latent heat of these species keeps the atmosphere hot and thus the emission flux high for billions of years, resulting in an acceleration of the cooling of ice giants. This sheds light on the long-standing problem that Uranus is much less bright than theoretically predicted and is different in brightness from Neptune in spite of the similarity in mass and radius. We also find that young ice giants with highly enriched atmospheres are much brighter in the mid-infrared than ice giants with non-enriched atmospheres. This provides important implications for future direct imaging of extrasolar ice giants. © 2017. The American Astronomical Society.

We describe a case of SIPE in a combat swimmer in warm tropical waters. Case report: A 21-year old diver trainee developed dyspnea, chest discomfort and hemoptysis after performing a 2-km sea swim in water temperatures of around 30°C. Over a two-hour period, his oxygen saturations deteriorated. Chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema. He was admitted to the general ward for observation and was given supportive treatment. His symptoms resolved over two days. Repeat CXR was normal. He was reviewed and certified fit to continue with diver training. Discussion: Much of the earlier literature on SIPE describes the development of symptoms after exposure to temperate waters as one main risk factor. This case highlights the risk of development of SIPE in warm tropical waters. With a low reported incidence of SIPE in warm waters, this condition is likely to be underdiagnosed. There is therefore a need to increase local awareness of SIPE in the medical community. A deliberate effort to collate data on SIPE in our local community will help us to better understand the pathophysiology of SIPE in the context of a tropical climate. Conclusion: Development of SIPE in tropical waters suggests that other risk factors may be predominant. There should be a high index of suspicion when any strenuous in-water activity is conducted so that timely treatment may be instituted. © 2017 Undersea & Hyperbaric Medical Society, Inc.","Swimming-induced pulmonary edema","water; case report; diagnostic imaging; diving; human; lung edema; male; swimming; temperature; tropic climate; young adult; Diving; Humans; Male; Pulmonary Edema; Swimming; Temperature; Tropical Climate; Water; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020741366

Arctic wetlands are large sources of CH4, and investigating effects of soil hydrology on CH4 fluxes is of great importance for predicting ecosystem feedback in response to climate change. In this study, we investigate how a decade-long drying manipulation on an Arctic floodplain influences CH4-associated microorganisms, soil thermal regimes, and plant communities. Moreover, we examine how these drainage-induced changes may then modify CH4 fluxes in the growing and nongrowing seasons. This study shows that drainage substantially lowered the abundance of methanogens along with methanotrophic bacteria, which may have reduced CH4 cycling. Soil temperatures of the drained areas were lower in deep, anoxic soil layers (below 30 cm), but higher in oxic topsoil layers (0–15 cm) compared to the control wet areas. This pattern of soil temperatures may have reduced the rates of methanogenesis while elevating those of CH4 oxidation, thereby decreasing net CH4 fluxes. The abundance of Eriophorum angustifolium, an aerenchymatous plant species, diminished significantly in the drained areas. Due to this decrease, a higher fraction of CH4 was alternatively emitted to the atmosphere by diffusion, possibly increasing the potential for CH4 oxidation and leading to a decrease in net CH4 fluxes compared to a control site. Drainage lowered CH4 fluxes by a factor of 20 during the growing season, with postdrainage changes in microbial communities, soil temperatures, and plant communities also contributing to this reduction. In contrast, we observed CH4 emissions increased by 10% in the drained areas during the nongrowing season, although this difference was insignificant given the small magnitudes of fluxes. This study showed that long-term drainage considerably reduced CH4 fluxes through modified ecosystem properties. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","aerenchyma; closed dynamic chamber; fall methane fluxes; methanogens; Siberia","bacterium; floodplain; methane; methanogenesis; microorganism; plant; soil temperature; topsoil; Arctic; Siberia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Eriophorum angustifolium; methane; soil; Arctic; chemistry; climate change; soil; temperature; Arctic Regions; Climate Change; Methane; Soil; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018392962

While the effects of early springs across North America are widely documented, changes in their frequency and likelihood under the combined influences of climate change and natural variability are poorly understood. Extremely early springs, such as March 2012, can lead to severe economical losses and agricultural damage when these are followed by hard freeze events. Here we use the new Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble project and Extended Spring Indices to simulate historical and future spring onsets across the United States and in the particular the Great Lakes region. We found a marked increase in the frequency of March 2012-like springs by midcentury in addition to an overall trend towards earlier spring onsets, which nearly doubles that of observational records. However, changes in the date of last freeze do not occur at the same rate, therefore, causing a potential increase in the threat of plant tissue damage. Although large-scale climate modes, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, have previously dominated decadal to multidecadal spring onset trends, our results indicate a decreased role in natural climate variability and hence a greater forced response by the end of the century for modulating trends. Without a major reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, our study suggests that years like 2012 in the US could become normal by mid-century. © 2016, The Author(s).","Climate variability; Phenology; Seasonal dynamics; Spring onset","agricultural production; atmospheric dynamics; ensemble forecasting; extreme event; future prospect; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; phenology; seasonal variation; spring (season); weather forecasting; Great Lakes [North America]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982272547

A comparison of these with high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of gaseous nebulae reveals that previous discrepancies found between theory and observation are not fully resolved by the latest atomic data. Blending is ruled out as a likely cause of the discrepancies, because temperature- and density-independent ratios (arising from lines with common upper levels) match well with those predicted by theory. For a typical nebular plasma with electron temperature K and electron density , cascading of electrons from the levels 3G5, 3G4 and 3G3 plays an important role in determining the populations of lower levels, such as 3F4, which provide the density diagnostic emission lines of Fe iii, such as 5D4-3F4 at 4658 Å. Hence, further work on the A-values for these transitions is recommended, ideally including measurements if possible. However, some Fe iii ratios do provide reliable Ne-diagnostics, such as 4986/4658. The Fe iii cooling function, calculated with Cloudy using the most recent atomic data, is found to be significantly greater at Te ≃ 30,000 K than predicted with the existing Cloudy model. This is due to the presence of additional emission lines with the new data, particularly in the 1000-4000 Å wavelength region. © 2017. The American Astronomical Society.

To shed light on the mechanism of this important and unusual reductive coupling reaction, extensive and systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations on several possible pathways and spin states were performed in which a realistic system up to 164 atoms was adopted. Our calculations support the observation that oxalate formation is energetically more favorable than the formation of carbonate and CO products in this cationic Cu(I) complex. Spatial confinement of the realistic catalyst (a long metal-metal distance) was found to further destabilize the carbonate formation, whereas it slightly promotes oxalate formation. Our study does not support the proposed diradical coupling mechanism. Instead, our calculations suggest a new mechanism in which one CO2 molecule is first reduced cooperatively by two Cu(I) metals to give a new, fully delocalized mixed-valence Cu2 I/II(CO2 •-) radical anion intermediate (analogues to Type 4 Cu center, CuA), followed by further partial reduction of the metal-ligated CO2 molecule and (metal-mediated) nucleophilic-like attack on the carbon atom of an incoming second CO2 molecule to afford the dinuclear Cu(II)-oxalate product. Overall, our proposed reaction mechanism involves a closed-shell reactant as well as two open-shell transition states and products. The effects of size, charge, and catalyst metal on the oxalate formation were also investigated and compared. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020915702

They occur in at least three families of the Alismatales. All have chloroplasts mainly in the cells of the epidermis. Living in seawater, the supply of inorganic carbon (Ci) to the chloroplasts is diffusion limited, especially under unstirred conditions. Therefore, the supply of CO2 and bicarbonate across the diffusive boundary layer on the outer side of the epidermis is often a limiting factor. Here we discuss the evidence for mechanisms that enhance the uptake of Ci into the epidermal cells. Since bicarbonate is plentiful in seawater, a bicarbonate pump might be expected; however, the evidence for such a pump is not strongly supported. There is evidence for a carbonic anhydrase outside the outer plasmalemma. This, together with evidence for an outward proton pump, suggests the possibility that local acidification leads to enhanced concentrations of CO2 adjacent to the outer tangential epidermal walls, which enhances the uptake of CO2, and this could be followed by a carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM) in the cytoplasm and/or chloroplasts. The lines of evidence for such an epidermal CCM are discussed, including evidence for special 'transfer cells' in some but not all seagrass leaves in the tangential inner walls of the epidermal cells. It is concluded that seagrasses have a CCM but that the case for concentration of CO2 at the site of Rubisco carboxylation is not proven. © The Author 2017.

The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that killed 230.000 people, served as a catalyst that convinced many skeptics of the importance of DRR. In 2015, policy-makers and practitioners from 168 countries came together in Hyogo, Japan and adopted the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) 2005-2015: Building the Resilience for Nations and Communities to Disasters. However, HFA had many gaps. Compared to the HFA, the Sendai Framework for DRR (2015-2030) is more far-reaching, holistic and inclusive, and emphasizes the need to address disaster risk management, to reduce existing vulnerability and to prevent the creation of new risks. However, it too has its setbacks. The aim of this paper is to examine the four conceptual or paradigm shifts that occurred in the field of disaster resilience and risk reduction: first, the nature of disasters; second, the shift from disaster management to disaster risk management; third, the shift from monistic to holistic approach that combines DRR, Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) and Sustainable Development (SD); fourth, from voluntary to obligatory risk reduction. Following the fourth paradigm shift, an upgraded Disaster Resilience Index (DRI) is proposed by Macedonia as an analytical tool that can help policymakers in disaster risk assessment and preparedness. © 2017, Goce Delchev University of Shtip.

The present paper analyzes the value of climate services which are aimed at improving agricultural productivity through a reduction in weather-associated risks. The first part provides a theoretical foundation for estimating the value of climate services based on a stochastic life-cycle model of a rural household which faces uncertainty with respect to the timing and the size of an adverse weather shock. We subsequently calibrate the model to match the environment of coffee producers in the Cusco region of Peru and provide a range of estimates for the value of climate services for a single average household, the region, and the country as a whole. In the second part of the paper we use empirical data to corroborate the numerical estimates. We assess the value of climate services in the agricultural sector in Cusco based on a choice experiment approach. Data are analyzed using a standard as well as a random parameter logit model allowing for preference heterogeneity. Farmers show a significant willingness-to-pay for enhanced climate services which is particularly related to the service accuracy and geographic resolution. On average, the yearly value of a climate service in the coffee sector is found to be $21 per ha and $8.2 million for Peru as a whole. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; Choice experiment; Climate change adaptation; Coffee farming; Coffee rust; Uncertainty","adaptive management; agri-environmental policy; agricultural management; climate change; coffee; crop production; ecosystem service; environmental policy; uncertainty analysis; willingness to pay; Cuzco [Peru]; Peru",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014756606

The fuel was heated to 553 K (280 °C) using an induction heater, at an upstream pressure of up to 1.0 MPa, and injected to atmospheric pressure conditions through a sharp-edged orifice of diameter 0.7 mm and length 4.3 mm. It has been observed that the isothermal lines on the plane of the mass flow rate versus the square root of the pressure drop (ΔP) were clearly affected by increased fuel temperatures, and the discharge coefficient (Cd) decreased sharply with increasing fuel injection temperature (Tinj) above the fuel boiling point of 460 K. The Reynolds number (Re) for three ΔPs with respect to Tinj reached maxima and then began to decrease as Tinj increased for each ΔP case, and the fuel temperature of maximum Re at a given pressure condition increased as ΔP increased. The effects of cavitation on the hydraulic characteristics of the high temperature fuel were explored by representing Cd with respect to three cavitation numbers and dissipation efficiency. The behaviors of Cd showed a clear dependency on cavitation number, and all of the results collapsed to a single curve, regardless of ΔP. In addition, the curve indicated that the Cd characteristics was divided into non-cavitating and cavitating regions by the critical cavitation numbers near the fuel boiling point, and a sharp decrease in Cd was found to be typical in the cavitating region. The relationship between Cd and Re showed that when Tinj exceeded the boiling point the high temperature liquid jets experienced a sharp decrease in Cd at a determined Reynolds number, due to the collapse of the mass flow rate induced by the choked cavitaiton. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Cavitation; Discharge coefficient; Fuel temperature; Mass flow choking; Orifice injector","Atmospheric pressure; Automobile cooling systems; Boiling point; Buoyancy; Cavitation; Hydrocarbons; Induction heating; Jets; Liquids; Mass transfer; Orifices; Reynolds number; Discharge coefficients; Fuel temperature; High temperature hydrocarbons; High-temperature liquids; Hydraulic characteristic; Hydraulic characterization; Hypersonic flight vehicles; Mass flow; Fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018993392

However, how this target came about is rarely substantiated in the scientific literature. We review and document the history of this target and the rapidly emerging scientific evidence to support it. The target was initially proposed after evaluating observed ranges of climate variation over the last 1000 and 1 000 000 years by an US economist, Nordhaus, in 1975. His conclusion was supported in 1980 by paleo-ecologists, who, on basis of the recolonizing vegetation after the retreat of the ice-sheets after the last glaciation, calculated that tree species could cope with a 2 °C temperature increase per century. A more elaborated target including tolerable rates of temperature and sea-level change was presented by Vellinga and Swart at the Second World Climate Conference in 1990. The target was illustrated by means of a traffic light: 1 °C global temperature rise meets an orange light, 2 °C meets red. These notions led first to the 1989 Noordwijk Ministerial Declaration and later to the UNFCCC's 1992 objective to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Although the scientific evidence was limited, the European environment ministers in 1996 endorsed the 2 °C target politically, after which it surfaced again in UNFCCC's 2009 Copenhagen summit. The ‘well below 2 °C’ target was scientifically further analysed in 2000 and motivated as part of the IPCC's third assessment report in its synthesis chapter, which assessed dangerous climate change. The resulting ‘burning ember’ diagram indicated that beyond 2 °C warming adaptation possibilities rapidly deteriorated and vulnerabilities increased, especially for unique ecosystems and extreme events. The evidence that emerged since this assessment report, on observed climate-change impacts show that vulnerabilities nowadays likely are larger. Recently, accelerated and higher levels of sea-level rise and more frequent extreme events are reported. All these insights were likely considered in the wording (i.e. ‘well below 2 °C’) of the 2015 Paris Agreement. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,"anthropogenic effect; climate change; environmental protection; extreme event; historical perspective; ice retreat; ice sheet; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; last glaciation; sea level change; temperature effect; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Copenhagen [(CTY) Hovedstaden]; Denmark; France; Hovedstaden; Ile de France; Paris; United States; Ville de Paris",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029105410

A new algorithm is put forward for 3D temperature distribution reconstruction (3DTDR) tasks according to the given finite temperature observation data. Owing to the distinct advantages, including fast learning speed, good generalisation ability etc. A new robust regularised extreme learning machine (RRELM) algorithm is developed for the 3DTDR task. Unlike existing tomography-based measurement methods and local point measurement technologies, the proposed algorithm can reconstruct 3D temperature distributions on the basis of the given local temperature observation information. Furthermore, different from available inverse heat transfer problems, the proposed reconstruction method does not solve complicated partial differential equations. Numerical simulation results verify the effectiveness of the RRELM algorithm for 3DTDR problems. Furthermore, the proposed RRELM method has a satisfactory robustness for the noises in the measurement data and can achieve the high-quality reconstruction when the sampling ratio is low. As a result, an effective algorithm is introduced for the 3DTDR problem. © 2017.

It will be demonstrated that a fundamental understanding of the combustion process can be instrumental to derive design criteria for the molecular structure of fuel candidates, which can then be targets for the analysis of synthetic pathways and the development of catalytic production routes.

Often, public discourse turns from engagement into impasse, as in the fractured politics of climate policy in the USA. Existing theories are unclear about how such an “adversarial turn” develops. We theorize that an important aspect of the adversarial turn is the evolution of a group’s narrative into what can be understood as an ideology, the formation of which is observable through certain textual-linguistic properties. Analysis “of” these narrative properties elucidates the role of narrative in fostering (1) coalescence around a group ideology, and (2) group isolation and isolation of ideological coalitions from others’ influence. By examining a climate skeptical narrative, we demonstrate how to analyze ideological properties of narrative, and illustrate the role of ideological narratives in galvanizing and, subsequently, isolating groups in society. We end the piece with a reflection on further issues suggested by the narrative analysis, such as the possibility that climate skepticism is founded upon a more “genetic” meta-narrative that has roots in social issues far removed from climate, which means efforts at better communicating climate change science may not suffice to support action on climate change. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Climate policy; Ideology; Policy process","environmental policy; environmental politics; ideology; planning process; policy approach; policy making; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008640861

Using a rich sub-national dataset for Russia covering 1995–2009, we estimate the impacts of changes in climatic conditions through short-term variation and medium-term changes in average regional temperatures and precipitation. We show a strong and robust negative (but non-linear) relation between regional budget expenditures and population-weighted temperature. The results indicate that an increase in temperature results in a decrease in public expenditures and that the magnitude of this effect diminishes the warmer the region. Further, our results suggest that the benefits from warming accumulate and that adaptation measures could help leverage those benefits. The estimated decreases in regional government expenditure are, however, quite small. In mild warming scenarios, according to our estimates Russia saves roughly USD 3–4 billion in regional government expenditures between 2000 and the 2020s without undertaking adaptation measures, depending on the scenario. It should be noted that our results are estimated for a scenario of mild temperature increase (1–2 ∘C). Larger temperature increases are likely to have dramatic consequences e.g. from loss of permafrost and methane release that are impossible to predict with available historical data. © 2015, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Climate change; Non-linearity; Public expenditures; Russia","Budget control; Economics; Statistics; Adaptation; Climatic conditions; Government expenditure; Non-linearity; Public expenditures; Russia; Short-term variations; Temperature increase; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; econometrics; nature-society relations; nonlinearity; precipitation assessment; public spending; temperature profile; warming; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944916565

In recent years, AHR has also been reported to exert positive or negative effects on epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), the crucial step in tumor malignant progression. However, the detailed mechanism remains controversial. Analysis of AHR-expression levels in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines and lung cancer tissues revealed an inverse correlation between AHR protein levels and tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Overexpression of wild-type AHR in H1299 cells (AHR poorly expressed, potently invasive) not only accelerated mesenchymal vimentin degradation, but also prevented cell invasion in vitro and in vivo. In the absence of AHR agonists, the overexpressed AHR protein was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, where it interacted with vimentin and functioned as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. A 6-h incubation with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 fully rescued vimentin from AHR-mediated proteasomal degradation. In AHR-overexpressing H1299 cells, either vimentin degradation or invasive suppression could be reversed when glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) was inactivated by CHIR-99021 treatment. In contrast, silencing of AHR in A549 cells (AHR highly expressed, weakly invasive) resulted in the downregulation of epithelial biomarkers (E-cadherin and claudin-1), augmentation of mesenchymal vimentin level, and GSK3β Ser-9 hyper-phosphorylation, which led to enhanced invasiveness. This work demonstrates that cytoplasmic, resting AHR protein may act as an EMT suppressor via a non-genomic pathway. Depletion of cytoplasmic AHR content represents a potential switch for EMT, thereby leading to the scattering of tumor cells. © 2016, The Author(s).","Aryl hydrocarbon receptor; Epithelial–mesenchymal transition; Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta; Ubiquitin; Vimentin","6 [[2 [[4 (2,4 dichlorophenyl) 5 (4 methyl 1h imidazol 2 yl) 2 pyrimidinyl]amino]ethyl]amino]nicotinonitrile; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; benzyloxycarbonylleucylleucylleucinal; beta catenin; claudin 1; cytochrome P450 1A1; cytochrome P450 1B1; cytoplasmic aryl hydrocarbon receptor; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; junctional adhesion molecule A; messenger RNA; nerve cell adhesion molecule; proteasome; protein ZO1; ubiquitin protein ligase E3; unclassified drug; uvomorulin; vimentin; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; GSK3B protein, human; proteasome; vimentin; A-549 cell line; adult; Article; cancer cell; cancer tissue; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell structure; cellular distribution; controlled study; cytosol; down regulation; enzyme phosphorylation; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; human; human cell; human tissue; immunofluorescence test; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; lymph node metastasis; male; middle aged; non small cell lung cancer; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; protein interaction; aged; animal; C57BL mouse; cytoplasm; drug screening; epithelial mesenchymal transition; genetics; lung tumor; metabolism; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; tumor cell line; Aged; Animals; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Cytoplasm; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Female; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Middle Aged; Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Vimentin; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991726015

The cluster analyses showed that Beijing was affected by trajectories from the south and southeast in summer and autumn. In winter and spring, Beijing was not only affected by the trajectories from the south and southeast, but was also affected by trajectories from the north and northwest. In addition, the analyses of the pressure profile of backward trajectories showed that backward trajectories, which have important influence on Beijing, were mainly distributed above 970 hPa in summer and autumn and below 950 hPa in spring and winter. This indicates that PM2.5 and PM10 were strongly affected by the near surface air masses in summer and autumn and by high altitude air masses in winter and spring. Results of PSCF and CWT analyses showed that the largest potential source areas were identified in spring, followed by winter and autumn, then summer. In addition, potential source regions of PM10 were similar to those of PM2.5. There were a clear seasonal and spatial variation of the potential source areas of Beijing and the airflow in the horizontal and vertical directions. Therefore, more effective regional emission reduction measures in Beijing's surrounding provinces should be implemented to reduce emissions of regional sources in different seasons. © 2016","Beijing; Cluster analyses; CWT; PM10; PM2.5; PSCF","Cluster analysis; Emission control; Trajectories; Backward trajectory; Beijing; Long range transport; Potential source contribution function; Potential source regions; PSCF; Trajectory clustering; Vertical direction; Particles (particulate matter); air mass; airflow; cluster analysis; long range transport; particulate matter; seasonal variation; spatial variation; trajectory; Beijing [China]; China; air pollutant; particulate matter; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; China; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; statistics and numerical data; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008263795

Effective conservation efforts require projections of vulnerability of the giant panda in facing climate change and proactive strategies to reduce emerging climate-related threats. We used the maximum entropy model to assess the vulnerability of giant panda to climate change in the Qinling Mountains of China. The results of modeling included the following findings: (1) the area of suitable habitat for giant pandas was projected to decrease by 281 km2 from climate change by the 2050s; (2) the mean elevation of suitable habitat of giant panda was predicted to shift 30 m higher due to climate change over this period; (3) the network of nature reserves protect 61.73% of current suitable habitat for the species, and 59.23% of future suitable habitat; (4) current suitable habitat mainly located in Chenggu, Taibai, and Yangxian counties (with a total area of 987 km2) was predicted to be vulnerable. Assessing the vulnerability of giant panda provided adaptive strategies for conservation programs and national park construction. We proposed adaptation strategies to ameliorate the predicted impacts of climate change on giant panda, including establishing and adjusting reserves, establishing habitat corridors, improving adaptive capacity to climate change, and strengthening monitoring of giant panda. © 2017 The Authors.

As well as acting to photo-degrade the organic contaminant and decrease the toxicity, β-In2S3 is chosen as a potential semiconductors for photocatalysts. Relative good photocatalytic properties delivered on β-In2S3, however, the fast recombination of photogenerated charge carriers are often appeared, causing reduced further application. Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) involve the introduction of plasma effect into the zero-dimensional nanomaterials in order to arouse an effect: either promoting the charge carriers transfer or plasma energy conversion of the photo-excited CQDs. However, state of the two components also encompass the poor quantum yield existed in the CQDs by its serious agglomeration. Thereby, the delivery of extraordinary ballistic electrical and thermal conductivity on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), have shown potential for use in a variety of semiconductors decorating application.

It is loaded into phloem of mature leaves for long-distance translocation to non-photosynthetic organs where it is unloaded for diverse uses. Clearly, Suc transport and metabolism is central to plant growth and development and the functionality of the entire vascular system. Despite vast information in the literature about the physiological roles of individual sugar metabolic enzymes and transporters, there is a lack of systematic evaluation about their molecular regulation from transcriptional to post-translational levels. Knowledge on this topic is essential for understanding and improving plant development, optimizing resource distribution and increasing crop productivity. We therefore focused our analyses on molecular control of key players in Suc metabolism and transport, including: (i) the identification of promoter elements responsive to sugars and hormones or targeted by transcription factors and microRNAs degrading transcripts of target genes; and (ii) modulation of enzyme and transporter activities through protein-protein interactions and other post-translational modifications.

Comprehensively assessing PM2.5 pollution levels and the cumulative health effects is difficult because PM2.5 monitoring data for prior time periods and certain regions are not available. In this paper, we propose a promising approach for robustly predicting PM2.5 concentrations. In our approach, a generalized additive model is first used to quantify the non-linear associations between predictors and PM2.5, the bagging method is used to sample the dataset and train different models to reduce the bias in prediction, and the variogram for the daily residuals of the ensemble predictions is then simulated to improve our predictions. Shandong Province, China, is the study region, and data from 96 monitoring stations were included. To train and validate the models, we used PM2.5 measurement data from 2014 with other predictors, including PM10 data, meteorological parameters, remote sensing data, and land-use data. The validation results revealed that the R2 value was improved and reached 0.89 when PM10 was used as a predictor and a kriging interpolation was performed for the residuals. However, when PM10 was not used as a predictor, our method still achieved a CV R2 value of up to 0.86. The ensemble of spatial characteristics of relevant factors explained approximately 32% of the variance and improved the PM2.5 predictions. The spatiotemporal modeling approach to estimating PM2.5 concentrations presented in this paper has important implications for assessing PM2.5 exposure and its cumulative health effects. © 2017 by the authors.

In this account, strong CO2 adsorption on a boron antisite (BN) in boron-rich porous boron nitrides (p-BN) was developed and studied. The results indicated that the material achieved larger adsorption energies of 2.09 eV (201.66 kJ/mol, PBE-D). The electronic structure calculations suggested that the introduction of BN in p-BN induced defect electronic states in the energy gap region, which strongly impacted the adsorption properties of the material. The bonding between the BN defect and the CO2 molecule was clarified, and it was found that the electron donation first occurred from CO2 to the BN double-acceptor state then, followed by electron back-donation from BN to CO2 accompanied by the formation of a BN-C bond. The thermodynamic properties indicated that the adsorption of CO2 on the BN defect to form anionic CO2δ− species was spontaneous at temperatures below 350 K. Both the large adsorption energies and the thermodynamic properties ensured that p-BN with a BN defect could effectively capture CO2 under ambient conditions. Finally, to evaluate the energetic stability, the defect formation energies were estimated. The formation energy of the BN defects was found to strongly depend on the chemical environment, and the selection of different reactants (B or N sources) would achieve the goal of reducing the formation energy. These findings provided a useful guidance for the design and fabrication of a porous BN sorbent for CO2 capture. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","adsorption; boron antisite defect; carbon dioxide capture; density functional calculations; Porous boron nitrides","Adsorption; Boron nitride; Carbon capture; Chemical bonds; Climate change; Defect density; Defects; Density functional theory; Electronic structure; Nitrides; Point defects; Thermodynamic properties; Adsorption energies; Adsorption properties; Anti-site defect; Carbon dioxide capture; Chemical environment; Defect formation energies; Electronic structure calculations; Porous boron nitrides; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019195796

Many researchers have studied the unique mechanisms and communities of respiratory Fe (III) reducers. However, the contributions and communities of fermentative microbes have rarely been studied. This study aimed to investigate the response of the metabolically active Clostridium community to glucose additions and to assess its contribution to microbial Fe (III) reduction in flooded paddy soils. Materials and methods: Paddy soils were amended with three different concentrations of glucose (0, 0.1, and 0.5 mol C kg−1 dry soil) and incubated anaerobically for 40 days. A combination of reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) based on reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) approaches were used to measure the abundance and structure of the metabolically active Clostridium community. Concurrently, the dynamics of soil pH, hydrogen partial pressure (ppH2), and Fe (II) concentration were investigated to assess their relationship with the metabolically active Clostridium community. Results and discussion: Increased glucose concentrations led to a sharp increase in ppH2 and a rapid decline in soil pH. The addition of glucose at a low concentration significantly increased microbial Fe (III) reduction, while a high glucose concentration enhanced the later Fe (II) accumulation. Meanwhile, the glucose additions greatly stimulated the growth of Clostridium and led to a higher Clostridium relative abundance. In addition, this process resulted in significantly differences in the structure of the metabolically active Clostridium community. Most of the metabolically active Clostridium spp., especially in the glucose addition treatments, were closely related to Fe (III)-reducing and H2-producing bacteria. The metabolically active Clostridium community was closely correlated with hydrogen production and microbial Fe (III) reduction in flooded paddy soils amended with glucose. Conclusions: These results reveal that glucose-stimulated Clostridium is responsible for hydrogen production in flooded paddy soils. Moreover, Clostridium spp., as representative of fermentative microbes, play an important role in microbial Fe (III) reduction in flooded paddy soils, with the organic carbon content being the main driving force. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Active Clostridium; Flooded paddy soil; Glucose addition; Hydrogen production; Microbial Fe (III) reduction","abundance; agricultural soil; bacterium; biogeochemistry; biological production; community dynamics; community structure; correlation; electrokinesis; glucose; growth; hydrogen; iron; microbial activity; microbial community; organic carbon; paddy field; reduction; soil microorganism; Clostridium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007500924

Given the interconnectedness between freshwater availability and many ecosystem services, including food provisioning, it is important to evaluate the drought implications on freshwater provisioning and food provisioning services. Studies about drought implications on streamflow, nutrient loads, and crop yields have been increased and these variables are all process-based model outputs that could represent ecosystem functions that contribute to the ecosystem services. However, few studies evaluate drought effects on ecosystem services such as freshwater and food provisioning and quantify these services using an index-based ecosystem service approach. In this study, the drought implications on freshwater and food provisioning services were evaluated for 14 four-digit HUC (Hydrological Unit Codes) subbasins in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB), using three drought indices: standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized soil water content index (SSWI), and standardized streamflow index (SSI). The results showed that the seasonal freshwater provisioning was highly affected by the precipitation deficits and/or surpluses in summer and autumn. A greater importance of hydrological drought than meteorological drought implications on freshwater provisioning was evident for the majority of the subbasins, as evidenced by higher correlations between freshwater provisioning and SSI12 than SPI12. Food provisioning was substantially affected by the precipitation and soil water deficits during summer and early autumn, with relatively less effect observed in winter. A greater importance of agricultural drought effects on food provisioning was evident for most of the subbasins during crop reproductive stages. Results from this study may provide insights to help make effective land management decisions in responding to extreme climate conditions in order to protect and restore freshwater provisioning and food provisioning services in the UMRB. © 2017 by the authors.

Nevertheless, whether better air quality will improve the willingness to use nonmotorized transport remains unclear. If such a reciprocal effect could be identified, a sort of virtuous circle could be created (i.e., better air quality could result in higher nonmotorized transport demand, which in turn could further reduce air pollution). Developing countries may, therefore, be more incentivized to work on air pollution reduction from other sources to exploit the extra gains in urban transport. This study investigated the impact of air pollution on mode choices and whether nonmotorized transport was preferred when air quality was better. Revealed preference data about the mode choice behavior of the same individuals was collected during two seasons (summer and winter) with different air pollution levels. Two discrete mode choice models were developed (one for each season) to quantify and compare the impacts of different air pollution levels on mode choices. Trip and socioeconomic characteristics also were included in the model to identify changes in their impacts across seasons. Taiyuan, a Chinese city that operates a successful bikesharing scheme, was selected for a case study. The study results showed that air quality improvement had a significant, positive impact on nonmotorized transport use, which suggested that improvements in air quality and promotion of nonmotorized transport must be undertaken simultaneously because of their interdependence. The results of the study could act as a harbinger to policy makers and encourage them to design measures and policies that lead to sustainable travel behavior.",,"Air pollution; Air quality; Crashworthiness; Developing countries; Pollution; Pollution control; Transportation; Urban transportation; Air quality improvement; Design measures; Pollution reduction; Reciprocal effects; Revealed preference datum; Socioeconomic characteristics; Transport demand; Travel behaviors; Nonmotorized transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019213283

The planning of the lateral runway is gradually being applied in the construction of large airports. First, the different utilization modes of the lateral runway and adjacent parallel runway were analyzed. After which four operational correlations and intervals were discussed, i.e.: independent operation, take-off & take-off dependent operation, take-off & landing dependent operation and fully dependent operation. Taking Chengdu new airport as an example, the airfield simulation models were established to evaluate the efficiency of the lateral runway. The simulation result suggests: A group of longitudinal and transverse runways can meet the hourly take-off and landing movements of about 75-77 in the case of independent operation. The take-off & landing dependent operation has relatively large impact on capacity. Under the conditions of fully dependent operation, the hourly movements are only 65, lower by about 16%, 10% and 6% compared with other three modes. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Emission control; Energy conservation; Sustainable development; Transportation; Chengdu; Energy saving and emission reductions; Parallel runway; Transportation infrastructures; Utilization modes; Airports",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019692189

Short-term and long-term exposure of PM2.5 in the micro environment would severely detriment the health of both humans and animals. The researches both at home and abroad dating from 2000 were analyzed and summarized mainly in the following 3 sections: source apportionment, health effects and control methods. Health effects were illustrated in both epidemiology and toxicology. The epidemiology was explicated in morbidity and mortality, the toxicology was illuminated in inflammatory reaction, oxidative stress, genotoxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. Control methods were showed in two aspects (sources and means of transmission), of which each was resolved by corresponding control strategy. Abundant investigations indicated that comprehensive control strategies were needed for sources decrement and health burden mitigation of indoor PM2.5. Based on the increasingly wide research of indoor PM2.5, the concept of indoors was essentially expanded, and on the basis of the summary of all the aspects mentioned above, both the scope and depth of indoor PM2.5 research were found insufficiently.

Hestia FFCO2 emissions are provided in the form of a group of sector-specific vector layers with point, line, and polygon sources to support carbon cycle science and climate policy. Application to carbon cycle science, in particular, requires regular gridded data in order to link surface carbon fluxes to atmospheric transport models. However, the heterogeneity and complexity of FFCO2 sources within regular grids is sensitive to spatial resolution. From the perspective of a data provider, we need to find a balance between resolution and data volume so that the gridded data product retains the maximum amount of information content while maintaining an efficient data volume. The Shannon entropy determines the minimum bits that are needed to encode an information source and can serve as a metric for the effective information content. In this paper, we present an analysis of the Shannon entropy of gridded FFCO2 emissions with varying resolutions in four Hestia study areas, and find: (1) the Shannon entropy increases with smaller grid resolution until it reaches a maximum value (the max-entropy resolution); (2) total emissions (the sum of several sector-specific emission fields) show a finer max-entropy resolution than each of the sector-specific fields; (3) the residential emissions show a finer max-entropy resolution than the commercial emissions; (4) the max-entropy resolution of the onroad emissions grid is closely correlated to the density of the road network. These findings suggest that the Shannon entropy can detect the information effectiveness of the spatial resolution of gridded FFCO2 emissions. Hence, the resolution-entropy relationship can be used to assist in determining an appropriate spatial resolution for urban CO2 flux studies. We conclude that the optimal spatial resolution for providing Hestia total FFCO2 emissions products is centered around 100 m, at which the FFCO2 emissions data can not only fully meet the requirement of urban flux integration, but also be effectively used in understanding the relationships between FFCO2 emissions and various social-economic variables at the U.S. census block group level. © 2017 by the authors.","FFCO2 emissions; Optimal grid resolution; Shannon entropy; Urban flux integration","Atmospheric movements; Fossil fuels; Image resolution; Amount of information; Atmospheric transport model; Grid resolution; Information contents; Information sources; Residential emissions; Shannon entropy; Spatial resolution; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon flux; fossil fuel; optimization; spatial resolution; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019906122

High-resolution urban models from LiDAR and oblique airborne photogrammetry can provide continuous SVF estimates over a large urban area, but such data are not always available and are difficult to acquire. Street view panoramas have become widely available in urban areas worldwide: Google Street View (GSV) maintains a global network of panoramas excluding China and several other countries; Baidu Street View (BSV) and Tencent Street View (TSV) focus their panorama acquisition efforts within China, and have covered hundreds of cities therein. In this paper, we approach this issue from a big data perspective by presenting and validating a method for automatic estimation of SVF from massive amounts of street view photographs. Comparisons were made with SVF estimates derived from two independent sources: a LiDAR-based Digital Surface Model (DSM) and an oblique airborne photogrammetry-based 3D city model (OAP3D), resulting in a correlation coefficient of 0.863 and 0.987, respectively. The comparisons demonstrated the capacity of the proposed method to provide reliable SVF estimates. Additionally, we present an application of the proposed method with about 12,000 GSV panoramas to characterize the spatial distribution of SVF over Manhattan Island in New York City. Although this is a proof-of-concept study, it has shown the potential of the proposed approach to assist urban climate and urban planning research. However, further development is needed before this approach can be finally delivered to the urban climate and urban planning communities for practical applications. © 2017 by the authors.","Automatic extraction; Google Street View; Panorama; Sky view factor; Urban climate; Urban planning","Optical radar; Photogrammetry; Photography; Urban planning; Automatic extraction; Google Street View; Panorama; Sky view factor; Urban climates; Big data",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019964303

After carbon coating, micrometer-sized FePO4·xH2O exhibits a reversible capacity that is higher than that of its counterpart without lattice water (130.0 vs 50.6 mAh g-1 at 0.15C rate) along with clearly enhanced rate capability and cyclability. The superior electrochemical performance of FePO4·xH2O is attributed to the lattice water that facilitates sodium-ion diffusion via enlarged channel dimensions and the screening of the electrostatic interactions between sodium ions and host anions. The amorphous phase is also advantageous in accommodating the stress created in the host framework during sodium-ion (de)intercalation. The presence of lattice water also protects the oxidation state of Fe from reductive surface carbon coating and slightly lowers the operation voltage via reduced inductive effect. The current study provides a useful insight into how to design SIB electrode materials particularly focusing on facile sodium-ion diffusion. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon; Cathodes; Coatings; Iron compounds; Metal ions; Channel dimension; Electrochemical performance; Electrode material; Inductive effects; Operation voltage; Oxidation state; Rate capabilities; Reversible capacity; Sodium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033672664

However, limited information is available regarding the response of methanogenic communities to elevated CO2 in freshwater marshes. Using high-throughput sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR, we compared the abundance and community structure of methanogens in different compartments (bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, and roots) of Calamagrostis angustifolia and Carex lasiocarpa growing marshes under ambient (380 ppm) and elevated CO2 (700 ppm) atmospheres. C. lasiocarpa rhizosphere was a hotspot for potential methane production, based on the 10-fold higher abundance of the mcrA genes per dry weight. The two marshes and their compartments were occupied by different methanogenic communities. In the C. lasiocarpa marsh, archaeal family Methanobacteriaceae, Rice Cluster II, and Methanosaetaceae co-dominated in the bulk soil, while Methanobacteriaceae was the exclusively dominant methanogen in the rhizosphere soil and roots. Families Methanosarcinaceae and Methanocellaceae dominated in the bulk soil of C. angustifolia marsh. Conversely, Methanosarcinaceae and Methanocellaceae together with Methanobacteriaceae dominated in the rhizosphere soil and roots, respectively, in the C. angustifolia marsh. Elevated atmospheric CO2 increased plant photosynthesis and belowground biomass of C. lasiocarpa and C. angustifolia marshes. However, it did not significantly change the abundance (based on mcrA qPCR), diversity, or community structure (based on high-throughput sequencing) of methanogens in any of the compartments, irrespective of plant type. Our findings suggest that the population and species of the dominant methanogens had weak responses to elevated atmospheric CO2. However, minor changes in specific methanogenic taxa occurred under elevated atmospheric CO2. Despite minor changes, methanogenic communities in different compartments of two contrasting freshwater marshes were rather stable under elevated atmospheric CO2. © 2017 Lin, Liu, Yuan, Ye and Ding.","Bulk soil; Elevated CO2; Freshwater marsh; Methanogen; Rhizosphere; Roots","carbon dioxide; dissolved organic carbon; organic carbon; unclassified drug; Article; Calamagrostis angustifolia; Carex lasiocarpa; DNA extraction; environmental exposure; gene; high throughput sequencing; marsh; mcrA gene; Methanobacteriaceae; methanogenic bacterium; Methanosarcinaceae; microbial community; nonhuman; photosynthetic rate; plant growth; real time polymerase chain reaction; seed plant; soil analysis; soil microflora; species diversity; species richness; taxonomy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019771014

TDR extends market concepts used primarily in emissions trading programs to the arena of land use. However, with the exception of a handful of success stories, TDR programs generate few transfers. Although researchers generally attribute the weak performance of TDR to program design flaws, this study demonstrates that the unique conditions presented by urban land markets explain, in part, why TDR programs often underperform. I present a case study of a TDR program in Sarasota, Florida, to address two questions. First, what attributes of urban land markets may impact TDR program design and outcomes? Second, is TDR a planning tool that can achieve desired planning goals, given the conditions of land markets? I find that the unique features of land markets—specifically (1) the sensitivity of development to timing; (2) imperfect information, uncertainty, and speculative activity; (3) unique features of land; (4) the limited number of buyers and sellers; and (5) the development orientation of urban political and planning institutions—distort the market for transferable development rights. The Sarasota case demonstrates how local land market characteristics contributed to a set of incremental program design and implementation decisions that, in sum, amounted to significant departures from fundamental program principles and mechanisms. These resulted in imperfect market conditions and rendered the TDR program ineffective. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","land market; market-based environmentalism; Transfer of development rights; urban political economy; zoning","environmentalism; implementation process; institutional framework; land market; land rights; land use planning; political economy; urban design; urban planning; zoning system; Florida [United States]; Sarasota County; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018947725

The SpeX spectrum is most consistent with the photospheric emission expected from an L∗ ∼ 20 L o, solar abundance A1.5V star with little to no extinction, and excess emission from circumstellar dust detectable beyond 4.5 μm. Non-detections of CO emission lines and accretion signatures point to the gas-poor circumstellar environment of a very old transition disk. Combining the SpeX + BASS spectra with archival WISE/AKARI/IRAS/Herschel photometry, we find an outer cold dust belt at ∼135 K and 20-40 au from the primary, likely coincident with the disk imaged by Subaru, and a new second inner belt with a temperature ∼570 K and an unusual, broad SED maximum in the 6-9 μm region, tracing dust at 1.1-2.2 au. An SED maximum at 6-9 μm has been reported in just two other A-star systems, HD 131488 and HD 121191, both of ∼10 Myr age. From Spitzer, we have also identified the ∼12 Myr old A7V HD 148657 system as having similar 5-35 μm excess spectral features. The Spitzer data allows us to rule out water emission and rule in carbonaceous materials - organics, carbonates, SiC - as the source of the 6-9 μm excess. Assuming a common origin for the four young A-star systems' disks, we suggest they are experiencing an early era of carbon-rich planetesimal processing. © 2017. The American Astronomical Society.

The interface contact in the fabricated nanocomposite greatly influences the charge transfer and separation so as to determine the final photocatalytic activities. However, the role of interface contact is often neglected, and is rarely reported to date. Hence, it is possible to further enhance the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4-based nanocomposite by improving the interfacial connection. Herein, phosphate-oxygen (P-O) bridged TiO2/g-C3N4 nanocomposites were successfully synthesized using a simple wet chemical method, and the effects of the P-O functional bridges on the photogenerated charge separation and photocatalytic activity for pollutant degradation and CO2 reduction were investigated. The photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 was greatly improved upon coupling with an appropriate amount of nanocrystalline TiO2, especially with P-O bridged TiO2. Atmosphere-controlled steady-state surface photovoltage spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy analyses revealed clearly the enhancement of photogenerated charge separation of g-C3N4 upon coupling with the P-O bridged TiO2, resulting from the built P-O bridges between TiO2 and g-C3N4 so as to promote effective transfer of excited electrons from g-C3N4 to TiO2. This enhancement was responsible for the improved photoactivity of the P-O bridged TiO2/g-C3N4 nanocomposite, which exhibited three-time photocatalytic activity enhancement for 2, 4-dichlorophenol degradation and CO2 reduction compared with bare g-C3N4. Furthermore, radica-trapping experiments revealed that the ·OH species formed as hole-modulated direct intermediates dominated the photocatalytic degradation of 2, 4-dichlorophenol. This work provides a feasible strategy for the design and synthesis of high-performance g-C3N4-based nanocomposite photocatalysts for pollutant degradation and CO2 reduction. © 2017, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

This process favors CO2 activation and also induces localized boron hydrolysis to in situ produce H2 as an active proton source and electron donor for CO2 reduction as well as boron oxides as promoters of CO2 adsorption. These synergistic effects, in combination with the unique catalytic properties of boron, are proposed to account for the efficiency of the CO2 reduction. This study highlights the promise of photothermocatalytic strategies for CO2 conversion and also opens new avenues towards the development of related solar-energy utilization schemes. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Societal developments have resulted in a greater use of many natural resources to the extent that the ecosystem can no longer self-regulate, thus severely damaging the balance of the ecosystem itself. This in turn has led to a deterioration in people's living environments. Our research is based on a combination of climate scenarios presented in the fifth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and policy scenarios, including the one-child policy and carbon tax policy. We adopted Land Change Modeler of IDRISI software to simulate and analyze land-use change under 16 future scenarios in 2050. Carbon sequestration, soil conservation and water yields were quantified, based on those land-use maps and different ecosystem models. We also analyzed trade-offs and synergy among each ecosystem service and discussed why those interactions happened. The results show that: (1) Global climate change has a strong influence on future changes in land-use. (2) Carbon sequestration, water yield and soil conservation have a mutual relationship in the Guanzhong-Tianshui economic region. (3) Climate change and implementation of policy have a conspicuous impact on the changes in ecosystem services in the Guanzhong-Tianshui economic region.

To achieve such multi-emission probe, the traditional methods have involved simple mixing of two emitters or tedious synthesis processes of hybrid material. However, these probes often have problems of inconstant emission strength ratio, low light-stability, and complicated synthetic process, which limit their applications in practical field. Herein, we report a single-structure Ce3+-doped LiYF4:Yb3+/Ho3+@LiYF4 upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), which features two emission peaks in the green (at 540 nm) and red (at 640 nm) region under the excitation of 980 nm near infrared laser. Importantly, the red/green intensity ratio can be regulated by changing the doping level of Ce3+ to modulate output colors. Furthermore, a Cr3+-responsive rhodamine derivative (CRD) was modified on the devised UCNPs surface to fabricate the colorimetric probe by luminescent resonance energy transfer (LRET) process. Upon addition of Cr3+ into the probe solution, the absorption peak of CRD at 560 nm is significantly enhanced, which greatly reduced the green emission, leading to an obvious color evolution from green to yellow to orange and to red with increasing the concentration of Cr3+. This method is successfully applied to practical detection of Cr3+ ion in industrial waste water.

To determine a beneficial approach in both economic and environmental aspects, carbon sequestration and emissions caused by forest-thinning activities can be traded. However, previous research on forest planning has not considered a detailed and sophisticated calculation for forest thinning and carbon sequestration. Hence, this study proposes a spatial forest-thinning planning problem involving carbon sequestration and emissions, which determine forest-thinning schedules over a planning period so that the total thinned timber volume over the period and the revenue from carbon sequestration and emissions can be maximized under certain spatial constraints. For this research, we first created a novel mathematical programming model, which can generally solve only small-scale problems. Therefore, this study also proposes an improved simulated annealing heuristic approach (ISA), which iteratively searches for a near optimal solution with two improved designs: a spatial local search operator and a neighborhood search scheme. The simulation results obtained using 300 forestland instances revealed that the proposed ISA can achieve better results through the proposed spatial local search operator, and run more efficiently through the proposed neighborhood search scheme. In addition, the decision regarding carbon sequestration and emissions was verified to be clearly advantageous for the cycling and sustainability of forest resources. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon sequestration; Carbon trading; Forest planning; Forest thinning; Simulated annealing; Spatial planning","Emission control; Heuristic methods; Iterative methods; Local search (optimization); Mathematical programming; Optimization; Simulated annealing; Sustainable development; Carbon sequestration; Carbon trading; Forest planning; Forest thinnings; Spatial planning; Forestry; Carbon Dioxide; Chelation; Emission; Forests; Thinning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009106926

In this study, observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) are performed to investigate the potential of high space- and time-resolution column measurements as constraints on urban NOx emissions. The regional chemistry-meteorology assimilation system where meteorology and chemical variables are simultaneously assimilated is comprised of a chemical transport model, WRF-Chem, the Data Assimilation Research Testbed, and a geostationary observation simulator. We design OSSEs to investigate the sensitivity of emission inversions to the accuracy and uncertainty of the wind analyses and the emission updating scheme. We describe the overall model framework and some initial experiments that point out the first steps toward an optimal configuration for improving our understanding of NOx emissions by combining space-based measurements and data assimilation. Among the findings we describe is the dependence of errors in the estimated NOx emissions on the wind forecast errors, showing that wind vectors with a RMSE below 1 m s-1 allow inference of NOx emissions with a RMSE of less than 30 mol/(km2 × h) at the 3 km scale of the model we use. We demonstrate that our inference of emissions is more accurate when we simultaneously update both NOx emissions and NOx concentrations instead of solely updating emissions. Furthermore, based on our analyses, we recommend carrying out meteorology assimilations to stabilize NO2 transport from the initial wind errors before starting the emission assimilation. We show that wind uncertainties (calculated as a spread around a mean wind) are not important for estimating NOx emissions when the wind uncertainties are reduced below 1.5 m s-1. Finally, we present results assessing the role of separate vs. simultaneous chemical and meteorological assimilation in a model framework without covariance between the meteorology and chemistry. © Author(s) 2017.",,"atmospheric chemistry; concentration (composition); emission; experimental study; meteorology; nitrogen dioxide; observational method; spatial resolution; trace gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020543989

Previous studies have evaluated the CLARREO measurement requirements for achieving climate change accuracy goals in orbit. The present study further quantifies the spectrally dependent IR instrument calibration requirement for detecting trends of atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles. The temperature, water vapor, and surface skin temperature variability and the associated correlation time are derived using the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis data. The results are further validated using climate model simulation results. With the derived natural variability as the reference, the calibration requirement is established by carrying out a simulation study for CLARREO observations of various atmospheric states under all-sky conditions. A 0.04-K (k = 2; 95% confidence) radiometric calibration requirement baseline is derived using a spectral fingerprinting method. It is also demonstrated that the requirement is spectrally dependent and that some spectral regions can be relaxed as a result of the hyperspectral nature of the CLARREO instrument. Relaxing the requirement to 0.06 K (k = 2) is discussed further based on the uncertainties associated with the temperature and water vapor natural variability and relatively small delay in the time to detect for trends relative to the baseline case. The methodology used in this study can be extended to other parameters (such as clouds and CO2) and other instrument configurations. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","Climate variability; Reanalysis data; Satellite observations; Statistical techniques; Temperature; Water vapor","Atmospheric temperature; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Calibration; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Moisture; Orbits; Temperature; Water vapor; Weather forecasting; Climate model simulations; Climate variability; European centre for medium-range weather forecasts; Reanalysis; Research and application; Satellite observations; Spectrometer calibrations; Statistical techniques; Climate change; calibration; climate change; detection method; infrared spectroscopy; satellite data; spectral analysis; temperature profile; uncertainty analysis; water vapor; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019083569

In particular, fine particulate matter (PM) has received increasing attention from scientists, governmental agencies, and the public due to its adverse impacts on human health. Monitoring the spatiotemporal patterns of air pollution is important for understanding its transport mechanisms and making effective environmental policies. The main goal of this study, therefore, was to quantify the spatial patterns and movement of air pollution in China at annual, daily, and hourly scales, so that the underlying drivers could be better understood. We used remote sensing data and landscape metrics together to capture spatiotemporal signatures of air pollution. Our results show that, at the annual scale, PM2.5 concentrations in China increased gradually from 1999 to 2011, with the highest concentrations occurring in the North China Plain as well as the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin. The total population affected by air pollution was about 975 million in 2010 (about 70% of China's population). Our more detailed analysis on daily and hourly scale further revealed that a heavy air pollution event occurred, expanded, aggregated, and finally dissipated over Northern China during Oct. 6–12, 2014, suggesting that the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region a center of severe pollution. Crop stalks burning in agricultural areas in this region seemed to be one of the leading drivers, along with coal burning and transportation emissions.

Multi-year inventories of vehicle emissions from 1994 to 2014 were estimated based on the emissions factors of different emissions standards and vehicle kilometers travelled for all types of vehicles. The trends and characteristics of the emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and course particulate matter (PM10) were then analyzed within and outside the PRD region. In the above two regions, the total amount of the five pollutant emissions varied greatly with gross domestic product (GDP) from 1994 to 2014, showing the overall performance of the first increasing up to 1.6–3.0 times before 2002, and then decreasing. However, the five pollutant emissions in the PRD region were 2.4–3.3 times more than in the non-PRD region. In both regions, light passenger cars and motorcycles were the main contributors to CO and VOC emissions (65%–80%), and heavy duty trucks and passenger cars were the main contributors to NOx, PM2.5 and PM10 emissions (around 42%–50%). Moreover, compared to CO and VOCs emissions, the changes in the contribution of every vehicles type to NOx, PM2.5 and PM10 emissions were more obvious, and coincided with the implementation time of emission and fuel standards in the non-PRD region. It was noted that CO and VOC emission variations was correlated closely with the population of yellow-label light passenger cars and motorcycles, whereas those of NOx and PM2.5 was coincided that of yellow-label heavy passenger cars and trucks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","GDP; Multi-year inventories trends; PRD and non-PRD region; Vehicle emissions","Automobiles; Carbon; Carbon monoxide; Motorcycles; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution; Transportation; Trucks; Volatile organic compounds; Fine particulate matter; Gross domestic products; Light passenger cars; Multi-year inventories trends; Particulate Matter; Pollutant emission; PRD and non-PRD region; Vehicle emission; Vehicles; carbon monoxide; nitrogen oxide; volatile organic compound; emission inventory; Gross Domestic Product; particulate matter; traffic emission; trend analysis; air pollutant; Article; car; China; controlled study; exhaust gas; gross national product; motorcycle; particulate matter; trend study; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011968699

In this study we assess the possibility to harmonize the inter-sectoral water allocation scheme within a highly altered human-hydrological system under reduction in water availability, triggered by projected climate change applying scenario-based approach. The Tagus River Basin headwaters, with significant disproportion in the water resources allocation between the environmental and socio-economic targets were taken as a perfect example of such system out of balance. We propose three different water allocation strategies for this region, including two conventional schemes and one imposing shift to sustainable water management and environmental restoration of the river. We combine in one integrated modelling framework the eco-hydrological process-based Soil and Water Integrated Model (SWIM), coupled with the conceptual reservoir and water allocation modules driven by the latest bias-corrected climate projections for the region and investigate possible water allocation scenarios in the region under constrained water availability in the future. Our results show that the socio-economic demands have to be re-considered and lowered under any water allocation strategy, as the climate impacts may significantly reduce water availability in the future. Further, we show that a shift to sustainable water management strategy and river restoration is possible even under reduced water availability. Finally, our results suggest that the adaptation of complex human-hydrological systems to climate change and a shift to a more sustainable water management are likely to be parts of one joint strategy to cope with climate change impacts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Human-hydrological systems; Hydrological modelling; Reservoir management; Tagus Segura Water Transfer; Water resources allocation","Climate models; Reservoir management; Reservoirs (water); Resource allocation; Restoration; Rivers; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water management; Water resources; Watersheds; Environmental restoration; Hydrological modelling; Hydrological system; Sustainable water management; Water allocation module; Water management strategies; Water resources allocations; Water transfers; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; ecohydrology; environmental restoration; error correction; headwater; hydrological modeling; integrated approach; reservoir; resource allocation; sustainability; water availability; water flow; water management; Tagus Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015609896

In many countries, health facility committees (HFCs) provide the accountability interface between health providers and citizens or users of health services. This article explores the social accountability practices facilitated by HFCs in Benin, Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Methods: The paper is based on a cross-case comparison of 11 HFCs across the three countries. The HFCs were purposefully selected based on the (past) presence of community participation support programs. The cases were derived from qualitative research involving document analysis as well as interviews and focus group discussions with health workers, citizens, committee members, and local authorities. Results: Most HFCs facilitate social accountability by engaging with health providers in person or through meetings to discuss service failures, leading to changes in the quality of services, such as improved health worker presence, the availability of night shifts, the display of drug prices and replacement of poorly functioning health workers. Social accountability practices are however often individualised and not systematic, and their success depends on HFC leadership and synergy with other community structures. The absence of remuneration for HFC members does not seem to affect HFC engagement in social accountability. Conclusions: Most HFCs in this study offer a social accountability forum, but the informal and non-systematic character and limited community consultation leave opportunities for the exclusion of voices of marginalised groups. More inclusive, coherent and authoritative social accountability practices can be developed by making explicit the mandate of HFC in the planning, monitoring, and supervision of health services; providing instruments for organising local accountability processes; strengthening opportunities for community input and feedback; and strengthening links to formal administrative accountability mechanisms in the health system. © 2017 The Author(s).","Accountability; Community participation; Health facility committee; Primary health care; Social accountability","Africa; Central Africa; community participation; ethics; health care personnel; health service; hospital management; human; information processing; organization and management; primary health care; qualitative research; social responsibility; Africa, Central; Africa, Western; Community Participation; Focus Groups; Health Facility Administration; Health Personnel; Health Services; Humans; Primary Health Care; Qualitative Research; Social Responsibility",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020750482

The response of communities, driven by the direct effects of ocean change on individual species as well the cascade of indirect effects, has received far less study. We used several rocky intertidal species including crabs, whelks, juvenile abalone, and mussels to determine how feeding, growth, and interactions between species could be shifted by changing ocean conditions. Our 10 wk experiment revealed many complex outcomes which highlight the unpredictability of community-level responses. Contrary to our predictions, the largest impact of elevated CO2 was reduced crab feeding and survival, with a pH drop of 0.3 units. Surprisingly, whelks showed no response to higher temperatures or CO2 levels, while abalone shells grew 40 % less under high CO2 conditions. Massive non-consumptive effects of crabs on whelks showed how important indirect effects can be in deter mining climate change responses. Predictions of species outcomes that account solely for physiological responses to climate change do not consider the potentially large role of indirect effects due to species interactions. For strongly linked species (e.g. predator-prey or competitor relationships), the indirect effects of climate change are much less known than direct effects, but may be far more powerful in reshaping future marine com munities. © The authors and Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute 2017.","Climate change; Global warming; Ocean acidification; Predation; Species interactions","bivalve; climate change; community response; environmental change; experimental study; global warming; high technology industry; interspecific interaction; intertidal community; juvenile; ocean acidification; physiological response; predation; survival; trophic cascade; Decapoda (Crustacea); Haliotidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020390720

Here, we use in situ high-pressure infrared (IR) spectroscopic titrations to quantify the solubility of H2O in six CO2-CH4 mixtures, ranging from pure CO2 to pure CH4, at shallow shale reservoir conditions of 323.2 K and 9.000 MPa. Measured concentrations of H2O at saturation increase with increasing mole percent CO2, and our results are in agreement with limited data available in the literature. We use these experimental results to benchmark three current thermodynamic multiphase routines: the mixed-solvent electrolyte (MSE), STOMP-COMP, and the Statistical Associating Fluid Theory for variable range Mie potentials (SAFT γ-Mie) equations of state. Of these models, MSE and STOMP-COMP accurately predict maximum H2O solubilities of the binary CO2-H2O and CH4-H2O systems, and they also reproduce the shape of the water solubility curve as a function of mole percent CO2.

Therefore, as carbon abatement is a public good, coping with climate change is also a public-good; however, it suffers from many free-rider incentives, leading to a tragedy of the commons. Overcoming this challenge from a systemic perspective, requires that all sectors such as industry, government, and citizens on global, national, and regional levels engage in low-carbon development and the implementation of fair and efficient climate policies. Through a theoretical exploration of carbon abatement and a systemic description of low-carbon systems, this paper developed a cybernetic framework for coping with climate change, which consists of a cloud platform for data analysis, meta-synthetic engineering for decision support, a polycentric approach to extensive consultation and various functional goal achievement modules. On this basis, by combining the “invisible hand” and “visible hand” and by integrating negotiation at the global level, cooperation at the national level and knowledge at the local level, a multilevel policymaking model is proposed to address complex climate change problems. This cybernetic paradigm based innovative approach could provide valuable illumination to stakeholders seeking to cope with climate change. © 2017, Systems Engineering Society of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","carbon abatement; climate change; Cybernetics; low-carbon development; public good","Climate models; Cybernetics; Decision support systems; Carbon abatement; Decision supports; Global climate changes; Human activities; Innovative approaches; Low-carbon development; Public goods; Tragedy of the commons; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019722608

The Midwest and Great Plains of the United States have been shown to be ""hot spots"" of coupling by many climate models and some observations. However, very few of the modeling studies have reported whether the climate models applied irrigation in the Midwest and Great Plains, where 24%-27% of farmland is irrigated, leaving open the question of whether irrigation affects current estimates of coupling strength. This study used a regional climate model that incorporated dynamic crop growth and precision irrigation (WRF3.3-CLM4crop) to investigate irrigation effects on land-atmosphere coupling strength. Coupling strength was quantified using multiple indices and the irrigated land-induced precipitation was tracked using a back trajectory method. The indices showed a consistent and significant decline in local coupling strength with irrigation in the Midwest and northern Great Plains. These reductions were due to increased soil moisture but decreased local precipitation and lower sensitivity of latent heat flux to soil moisture over irrigated regions. The back trajectories of water vapor transport confirmed that irrigation largely did not contribute to local precipitation. Water vapor from irrigated land was transported to the Midwest and U.S. Northeast where it fell as precipitation, suggesting that irrigation has a broader spatial impact on soil moisture-precipitation coupling than simply through local soil moisture-evapotranspiration coupling. The present study suggests that climate models without irrigation schemes may overestimate the land-atmosphere coupling strength over irrigated agricultural regions but underestimate coupling strength over neighboring nonirrigated regions. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","Climate models; Climate sensitivity; Coupled models; Hydrometeorology; North America; Soil moisture","Heat flux; Irrigation; Landforms; Moisture; Soil moisture; Soils; Water vapor; Climate sensitivity; Coupled models; Hydrometeorology; Land-atmosphere couplings; North America; Northern great plains; Regional climate modeling; Water vapor transport; Climate models; climate modeling; coupling; evapotranspiration; hydrometeorology; irrigation; land surface; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; soil moisture; Great Plains; Midwest; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018991189

The research combined a programme of research events with phased household-level monitoring of energy and carbon-reduction interventions. The carbon-reduction interventions were funded by the UK’s Department of Energy and Climate Change prior to the onset of the research. AR has recently been adopted within the context of environmental behaviour change programmes in the UK, with a number of methodological challenges. The EVALOC project’s challenges included developing a collaborative research design; building reciprocity between the researchers and research participants; dealing with biases and burdens in the research process; ensuring analytical rigour in the interpretation of the primarily qualitative evidence and dealing with the long-term and process-driven outcomes that arise from such interactions. This paper explores and discusses the challenges of AR in relation to selected research outcomes from EVALOC.

It allows one to directly record damage growth while changes remain invisible to those caring for the collection, as opposed to monitoring and inferring damage indirectly due to undesired interactions with local climates or waiting for visible damage to develop. As a consequence, AE can be used to record environmentally-induced physical changes directly in historic materials and, hence, can support the assessment of strategies for the indoor climate management of museums. However, applying AE to museum collections requires specific measures to deal with issues such as the uniqueness and fragility of the monitored objects, the diversity of construction materials and the measurement of signals in an often noisy environment. Systematic tests of the propagation and attenuation of AE signals in wood were performed to better understand the monitoring results in terms of damage location and to assess the ability of various high-pass filters to reduce the background noise.

We hypothesize that when soft regulations are surrounded by detailed conditions for getting state support, there will be higher degrees of local institutionalization of climate and energy strategies. The importance of economic support as part of national policy is confirmed by evidence from local energy and climate strategies and from interviews with local decision-makers. We also find that specific municipal features such as earlier municipal engagement in national support programs and relevant inter-municipal networks function as drivers for the institutionalization of local action. © 2016 Newcastle University.","degree of institutionalization; economic incentives; local climate strategies; shadow of hierarchy; soft regulation","decision making; energy policy; environmental economics; environmental policy; hierarchical system; incentive; institutional framework; regulatory framework; strategic approach; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988643253

The Greater Houston area is home to the largest petrochemical complexes in the United States, so the likelihood of emission events is higher in this area than in other areas in the nation. Notable emission events in the Greater Houston area have caused unexpected explosions, fires, and releases of toxic chemicals, which have killed workers and triggered various health issues among nearby communities. Understanding how to minimize these emission events can help protect the health of Houstonians. In this study, we analyzed emission event data for the Greater Houston area extracted from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) emission event database during 2003–2013 for criteria and other selected pollutants to identify annual and seasonal trends and industrial classification patterns. We evaluated 7273 emission events and found that total event incidents and releases from nitrogen oxides (NOX), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) have generally decreased from 2003 to 2013, whereas particulate matter (PM) event emissions have generally increased during this period. Our seasonal analyses demonstrated that emission events were more likely to occur during winter for several pollutants. We also found that emission events were mainly generated from the chemical manufacturing and petroleum and coal products manufacturing industries. In addition, we found strong interrelationships between different pairs of pollutants during these emission events. We compared these results against regulatory policy and found potential gaps within the state regulations and TCEQ emission event database explaining our findings, and we provided recommendations on closing these gaps. Our study could drive policy change to lower emission events in the Greater Houston area, potentially improving air quality and reducing the health impacts from these events. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Air pollution regulations; Emission events; Episodic releases; Particulate matter","air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; database; emission inventory; environmental quality; health impact; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; petrochemical industry; sulfur dioxide; United States; Houstonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020663602

Departing from a theoretical understanding of a circular economy provided by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the paper analyzes three areas: 1) biogas production, 2) nitrogen, phosphorous &amp; green house gas (GHG) emissions, and 3) re-cycle/cascade materials. It consequently elaborates on the environmental benefits obtained, in terms of CO2 emission from biogas production substituted for fossil fuels, improved water quality and hence reduced GHG emissions due to lower nitrogen effluents, and re-cycling of nutrients on farmland thereby recovering finite resources and improving crop yield. Economic spin-off effects are presented, including new jobs created in the local community. Learning from Solrød Biogas, this paper further proposes to include the following activities when planning for future biogas plants: waste-stream identification and coupling in the local community, measuring the value of digestate as a fertilizer, short distance to farmers delivering manure, and plant design adapted to the local energy market. Finally, the paper suggests how to qualify the circular economic concept based on the findings from the Solrød biogas plant. It is here concluded, that emphasis should be on cascading energy from biogas production by means of combined heat and power (CHP), district heating or process heat to industry. Besides this, cascades in the manufacturing chain must also be intensified, allowing a more efficient materials and energy utilization and re-cycling in this part of the production chain. This will consequently reduce the total quantity of waste being generated by manufacturing industries, and thus benefit re-cycling strategies that only capture and seek to re-use a limited fraction of the waste being generated from industry. © 2017, Paulus Editora.

This survey is different from previous efforts in that it is the first to target exoplanets orbiting Myr-old stars. Young exoplanet systems are expected to be the best candidates for radio detections given the higher magnetic field strengths predicted for young planets as well as the stronger and more dense stellar wind expected for the host stars. The radio emission from exoplanets is expected to be highly circularly polarized therefore we restricted our search to the circular polarization images rather than the total intensity images. We carried out two different search methods using this data. The first method was a targeted search for exoplanet emission using catalogues of known stars and Hot Jupiters within the Upper Scorpius field. The second search method was a blind search for highly circularly polarized sources in the field and for sources identified only in our polarization images. Both the blind and targeted search resulted in non-detections with typical 3σ flux density limits of 4-235 mJy over time-scales of 1.87-1000 min. In particular, we place the first limits on low-frequency emission from the Hot Jupiter systems WASP-17 b and K2-33 b.

With intensifying human demands for water and continued human alteration of rivers, there is a growing need for predicting responses of vegetation to flow alteration, including responses related to climate change and river flow management. We developed a coupled structured population model that combines stage-specific responses of plant guilds with specific attributes of river hydrologic regime. The model uses information on the vital rates of guilds as they relate to different hydrologic conditions (flood, drought, and baseflow), but deliberately omits biotic interactions from the structure (interaction neutral). Our intent was to (1) consolidate key vital rates concerning plant population dynamics and to incorporate these data into a quantitative framework, (2) determine whether complex plant stand dynamics, including biotic interactions, can be predicted from basic vital rates and river hydrology, and (3) project how altered flow regimes might affect riparian communities. We illustrated the approach using five flow-response guilds that encompass much of the river floodplain community: hydroriparian tree, xeroriparian shrub, hydroriparian shrub, mesoriparian meadow, and desert shrub. We also developed novel network-based tools for predicting community-wide effects of climate-driven shifts and deliberately altered flow regimes. The model recovered known patterns of hydroriparian tree vs. xeroriparian shrub dominance, including the relative proportion of these two guilds as a function of river flow modification. By simulating flow alteration scenarios ranging from increased drought to shifts in flood timing, the model predicted that mature hydroriparian forest should be most abundant near the observed natural flow regime. Multiguild sensitivity analysis identified substantial network connectivity (many connected nodes) and biotic linkage (strong pairwise connections between nodes) under natural flow regime conditions. Both connectivity and linkage were substantially reduced under drought and other flow-alteration scenarios, suggesting that community structure is destabilized under such conditions. This structured population modeling approach provides a useful tool for understanding the community-wide effects of altered flow regimes due to climate change and management actions that influence river flow regime. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America.","coupled matrix model; flow regime; flow response guild; interaction neutral; neutral theory; riparian community; stochastic population model","climate change; community structure; connectivity; dominance; floodplain; human activity; hydrological regime; plant community; riparian vegetation; river flow; sensitivity analysis; shrub; biological model; biota; climate change; Colorado; drought; hydrology; plant physiology; population dynamics; river; water flow; Biota; Climate Change; Colorado; Droughts; Hydrology; Models, Biological; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Population Dynamics; Rivers; Water Movements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020237036

Four scenarios were designed to assess the impacts of space heating and power mix, and sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the major factors that can reduce CO2 emissions. The operational stage consumed more energy than any other stage, and contributed the most to CO2 emissions. The influence of energy-efficient equipment and their lifespan on energy consumption and CO2 emissions varied greatly. Policies that encourage construction of buildings with longer lifespans and promote energy-saving measures can reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions in the buildings sector.

The intent is to upgrade and modernise the network to meet multidimensional requirements, including distributed energy resources, high levels of security, quality and efficiency of power supply, and requests of CO2 reduction. A systematic, effective reform action would best be based on the comprehensive evaluation of network performance. However, in literature, previous works evaluated intensively on partial network performances, i.e. reliability, operation efficiency etc. Different from these approaches, this study proposes a holistic performance evaluation framework based on health index (HI) methodology. To cope fully with industry needs, the proposed HI system measures performances of two-level objects from power equipment to network scales. For each level, the corresponding HI is derived successively by determining object's health metrics, establishing a core set of indicators, building physics-based model, using data-driven and multiple health information fusion techniques. As part of a 3-year major research programme initiated by State Grid of China, the above work has been implemented in a software architecture.

Crop intensification, diversification, reduced tillage, and variable N management are among strategies proposed to mitigate and adapt to climate shifts in the inland Pacific Northwest (iPNW). Our objectives were to assess these strategies across iPNW agroecological zones and time for their impacts on (1) winter wheat (WW) (Triticum aestivum L.) productivity, (2) crop sequence productivity, and (3) N fertilizer use efficiency. Region-wide analysis indicated that WW yields increased with increasing annual precipitation, prior to maximizing at 520 mm yr-1 and subsequently declining when annual precipitation was not adjusted for available soil water holding capacity. While fallow periods were effective at mitigating low nitrogen (N) fertilization efficiencies under low precipitation, efficiencies declined as annual precipitation exceeded 500 mm yr-1. Variability in the response of WW yields to annual precipitation and N fertilization among locations and within sites supports precision N management implementation across the region. In years receiving &lt; 350 mm precipitation yr-1, WW yields declined when preceded by crops rather than summer fallow. Nevertheless, WW yields were greater when preceded by pulses and oilseeds rather than wheat across a range of yield potentials, and when under conservation tillage practices at low yield potentials. Despite the yield penalty associated with eliminating fallow prior to WW, cropping system level productivity was not affected by intensification, diversification, or conservation tillage. However, increased fertilizer N inputs, lower fertilizer N use efficiencies, and more yield variance may offset and limit the economic feasibility of intensified and diversified cropping systems. © 2017 Maaz, Schillinger, Machado, Brooks, Johnson-Maynard, Young, Young, Leslie, Glover, Madsen, Esser, Collins and Pan.","Conservation tillage; Cropping systems; Diversification; Fallow; Intensification; IPNW USA; Precipitation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026801524

Treadmill exercise and long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish oil are able to stimulate hippocampal antioxidant defenses and improve memory. The aim was to test whether fish oil and exercise can improve rat's performance on memory tasks and optimize hippocampal antioxidant state in an age-dependent manner. Therefore, young and adult rats were exercised and received fish oil during 4 weeks. The exercise was performed for 30 min/day, with the speed gradually increasing from the first to the last week. Afterwards, episodic memory was measured by the recognition of object identity and spatial location. Hippocampal oxidative state was investigated with the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), carbonyls content, antioxidant enzymatic activity (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT)), and antioxidant nonenzymatic activity (reduced glutathione, sulfhydryl content). The adult rats treated with fish oil and exercise (FO&EX) were able to recognize object's shape and placement; however, FO&EX young rats had impaired spatial recognition (p < 0.05). The FO&EX young rats did not have reduced MDA or carbonyl content, though either fish oil or exercise reduced MDA (p < 0.05) and carbonyl levels (p < 0.01).

The frequency and severity of flooding events will dramatically increase in the future, as projected by climate change models. Therefore, understanding the response of different organisms to soil hypoxia, including crop plants, and their interaction with symbiotic and ubiquitous arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi is becoming increasingly important in order to enhance plant yield and to promote sustainable agriculture in the future. Plants and soil fungi are known to be obligate aerobes and are sensitive to O2 deficiency since they need a sufficient amount of this gas to support their aerobic metabolism. However, some specific morphological and metabolic adaptations also enable plants to survive in habitats where O2 availability is severely limited. Moreover, recent reports show that diverse plant root endophytic fungal communities exist in these ecosystems with some specific (new) taxa being reported to even thrive there. This includes obligate biotrophic AM fungi that fully depend on the plant-derived carbon source. A new aspect in the biology of these organisms originating from the research into hypoxic environments is that in addition to carbon, they can also use a plant-derived O2 source delivered into the submerged organs via plant's root aeration systems (e.g. aerenchyma). Moreover, in the field of community ecology, extreme hypoxic environments (e.g. Mofettes) have been shown to represent a powerful tool for the study of slower ecological and evolutionary processes in still largely unexplored soil microbial communities. They can be used to gain insight into the adaptation of native communities to a specific permanent stress (e.g. Soil hypoxia) as long-term natural experimental systems. In this chapter a review of the literature investigating AM fungi and their communities in hypoxic environments is presented. Considering this aspect will be essential for our capacity to adequately manage ecosystems and predict ecological and evolutionary responses to global change, with flooding and soil hypoxia being a consistent part of terrestrial ecosystems in the future. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells, when grown on limiting CO2, have a CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) that functions to concentrate CO2 at the site of Rubisco. Proteins thought to be involved in inorganic carbon uptake have been identified and localized to the plasma membrane or chloroplast envelope. However, current CCM models suggest that additional molecular components are involved in Ci uptake. In this study, the gene Cia8 was identified in an insertional mutagenesis screen and characterized. The protein encoded by Cia8 belongs to the sodium bile acid symporter subfamily. Transcript levels for this gene were significantly up-regulated when the cells were grown on low CO2. The cia8 mutant exhibited reduced growth and reduced affinity for Ci when grown in limiting CO2 conditions. Prediction programs localize this protein to the chloroplast. Ci uptake and the photosynthetic rate, particularly at high external pH, were reduced in the mutant. The results are consistent with the model that CIA8 is involved in Ci uptake in C. reinhardtii. © The Author 2017.

Rural communities which are highly dependent on natural resources are significantly affected by climate change. For the rural communities, difficulty in coping with climate change and preparing for climate change risks are further aggravated due to geographic and demographic obstacles; limited economic diversity; higher poverty rates etc. Small farmers based on their traditional knowledge and experiences are implementing various practices in agriculture, water, livestock etc. sectors to adapt the challenges of climate change. These activities are insignificant in combating climate change issues. However, if these small scale activities are integrated with existing sectoral development schemes/programmes, can create a greater impact. This paper presents strategies on how farmer's traditional knowledge and practices are integrated with sectoral development planning by showcasing case studies from various projects/activities in India.

However, the productivity response to these environmental factors is uncertain at the global scale and has largely been defined using limited observations from sparse monitoring sites, including carbon flux towers. Recent studies have shown that satellite observations of Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) are highly correlated with ecosystem Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). Here, we use a relatively long-term global SIF observational record fromthe Global OzoneMonitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) sensors to investigate the relationships between SIF, used as a proxy for GPP, and selected bio-climatic factors constraining plant growth at the global scale. We compared the satellite SIF retrievals with collocated GPP observations from a global network of tower carbon flux monitoring sites and surface meteorological data from model reanalysis, including soil moisture, Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD), and minimum daily air temperature (Tmin). We found strong correspondence (R2 &gt; 80%) between SIF and GPP monthly climatologies for tower sites characterized by mixed, deciduous broadleaf, evergreen needleleaf forests, and croplands. For other land cover types including savanna, shrubland, and evergreen broadleaf forest, SIF showed significant but higher variability in correlations between sites. In order to analyze temperature and moisture related effects on ecosystem productivity, we divided SIF by photosynthetically active radiation (SIFp) and examined partial correlations between SIFp and the climatic factors across a global range of flux tower sites, and over broader regional and global extents. We found that productivity in arid ecosystems is more strongly controlled by soil water content to an extent that soil moisture explains a higher proportion of the seasonal cycle in productivity than VPD. At the global scale, ecosystem productivity is affected by joint climatic constraint factors so that VPD, Tmin, and soil moisture were significant (p &lt; 0.05) controls over 60, 59, and 35 percent of the global domain, respectively. Our study identifies and confirms dominant climate control factors influencing productivity at the global scale indicated from satellite SIF observations. The results are generally consistent with climate response characteristics indicated from sparse global tower observations, while providing more extensive coverage for verifying and refining global carbon and climate model assumptions and predictions. © 2017 by the authors.","Ecosystem productivity; FLUXNET; GPP; MODIS-MOD17; Phenology; SIF; SMAP-L4C","Atmospheric temperature; Chlorophyll; Climate models; Ecology; Fluorescence; Forestry; Meteorology; Moisture; Plants (botany); Radiation effects; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Soils; Towers; Water content; Ecosystem productivity; FluxNet; MODIS-MOD17; Phenology; SMAP-L4C; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021052702

However, there is a scarcity of evidence on the effects of sustainable school buildings on health and performance indicators. We sought to create a framework for a multidisciplinary research agenda that links school facilities, health, and educational outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a nonsystematic review of peer review publications, government documents, organizational documents, and school climate measurement instruments. RESULTS: We found that studies on the impact of physical environmental factors (air, lighting, and thermal comfort) on health and occupant performance are largely independent of research on the social climate. The current literature precludes the formation of understanding the causal relation among school facilities, social climate, occupant health, and occupant performance. CONCLUSIONS: Given the average age of current school facilities in the United States, construction of new school facilities or retrofits of older facilities will be a major infrastructure investment for many municipalities over the next several decades. Multidisciplinary research that seeks to understand the impact of sustainable design on the health and performance of occupants will need to include both an environmental science and social science perspective to inform best practices and quantification of benefits that go beyond general measures of costs savings from energy efficiencies. © 2017, American School Health Association","indoor air quality; indoor environmental quality; occupant health; occupant performance; sustainable schools","air pollution; construction work and architectural phenomena; environmental exposure; environmental health; environmental protection; human; Occupational Diseases; organization and management; prevention and control; school; standards; Air Pollution; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Health; Facility Design and Construction; Humans; Occupational Diseases; Schools",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016930359

We propose a comparative, multiple-approach framework to assess the spatial variation of population vulnerability to climatic changes using several high-resolution variables related to climate, topography, and socioeconomic conditions with an objective to detect the spatial variability of climate vulnerability in Nepal. Nepal is one of the most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change due to frequent climatic hazards and poor socio-economic capacity. We used a climate vulnerability index (CVI) approach to derive climate vulnerability maps at the one-kilometer resolution and test an additive and a principal components-based composite method of data aggregation. In this work, we attempt to answer three questions. 1) How do different methods of assessment inform the spatial variation of the climate vulnerability in Nepal? 2) How do different variables interact to shape climate vulnerability in Nepal? 3) What proportions of the population in Nepal are vulnerable to climatic disasters and why? Our analysis uncovered significant spatial variations in population vulnerability to climate change across Nepal, with the highest vulnerability being experienced by the High Mountain region followed by the regions in the lower elevations. We find that although the lack of adaptive capacity is the biggest cause of population vulnerability to climate change in Nepal, a resilient community is shaped by both biophysical and socioeconomic characteristics. By performing an iterative sensitivity analysis of our thirteen variables both at the aggregate level (nationally) as well as at the more disaggregated (physiographic region) level, we contribute to identifying important, multi-scalar driving factors for vulnerability that can be employed as leverage points for lowering vulnerability at different scales. After performing analyses at multiple regions, we conclude that region-specific variable selection is needed for more detailed assessments and in order to prioritize adaptation strategies at scales that go beyond the hierarchy of administrative divisions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Biophysical; Himalayas; Principal components analysis; Socioeconomic","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; developing world; population dynamics; principal component analysis; socioeconomic conditions; spatial resolution; vulnerability; Himalayas; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016007485

Historically the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge was implemented in the wastewater treatment plants in order to stabilize this organic matter, but the reactors were often oversized that means large reactor volume are now day available. The co digestion of sludge with the organic wastes, such as the organic fraction of municipal solid waste, is a simple way to fully utilise these volumes and capital investment, to increase biogas production, to recover energy from waste, to balance the nutrient, to reduce greenhouse gas emission and, when applicable, to increase the performance of the wastewater treatment. In other words, a smart application of circular economy concepts focused on secondary carbon streams valorisation. A smart wastewater treatment plant must represent a service for the city and territory, where citizen and environment are the beneficiaries. With this vision, the WWTP treats both wastewater and the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) from separate collection. © 2017, ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

However, two critical aspects of the forest environment have been neglected in the description of the large-scale influence of forests on air pollution: the reduction of photolysis reaction rates and the modification of vertical transport due to the presence of foliage. Here we show that foliage shading and foliage-modified vertical diffusion have a profound influence on atmospheric chemistry, both at the Earth's surface and extending throughout the atmospheric boundary layer. The absence of these processes in three-dimensional models may account for 59-72% of the positive bias in North American surface ozone forecasts, and up to 97% of the bias in forested regions within the continent. These processes are shown to have similar or greater influence on surface ozone levels as climate change and current emissions policy scenario simulations. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"ozone; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric transport; boundary layer; climate change; emission control; foliage; forest canopy; ozone; photolysis; shading; three-dimensional modeling; turbulence; air pollution; air quality; Article; boundary layer; canopy; climate change; environmental change; foliage; grid cell; light intensity; photolysis; photosynthetic photon flux density; plant shading; surface property; vegetation; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019543310

Relative high global warming potential and biological energy loss from animal system makes methane (CH4) much more important than any other GHG. Researchers worldwide have attempted many approaches with variable success for enteric methane mitigation and the search for advanced sustainable approach is still on. However, attempting mitigation without knowing the precise emission from a country is not going to serve any purpose. Most of the countries, especially developing nations, are still lacking a valid database for enteric methane emission. In order to arrive at a national methane emission figure, a country should have proper methodologies for estimating the methane emission from different ruminant species fed on various dietary combinations as per local and seasonal availability. As sheep are being maintained by small and marginal farmers, therefore, the loss of biological energy in the form of CH4 under the resource- deficit scenario of farmers make this species as equally important as cattle and buffaloes. This chapter describes various methodologies which can be employed for the direct or indirect estimation of CH4 emission from sheep. Each methodology has been discussed in the chapter at length along with their advantages and limitations. Though the adoption of a methodology for the estimation of CH4 depends on many factors, in vivo techniques such as GreenFeed, sulfur hexafluoride tracer technique and respiration chambers are instrumental in order to estimate the precise emission and could be useful in determining the national CH4 emission when a large number of experiments are conducted involving large animals and locally available seasonal feedstuffs with repeated measurements. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Estimation methodologies; In vivo techniques; Indirect methods; Livestock; Methane; Sheep",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034056973

While energy consumption of macro base station (MBS) backhaul links has been estimated to be less than 5% of total network consumption, the value is expected to rise to 50% with the creation of UDN. As part of UDN, small cell networks (SCN) will require more backhaul links compared to MBS, leading to significant increase in backhaul energy requirements. In this paper we analyse the energy efficiency of point-to-point (PtP) and point-to-multi-point (PtMP) small cell backhaul architectures deployed to provide coverage in urban canyon environments. The results obtained show that the energy efficiency of both systems decreases with increase in SCB links. Furthermore, the PtMP system is shown to be more energy efficient than the PtP architecture. The development of energy management schemes is therefore required to optimize power consumption on the SCB segment. © 2017 IEEE.","5G; Energy efficiency; Massive-MIMO; Small cell backhaul","Carbon; Carbon footprint; Cells; Cytology; Energy utilization; Network architecture; Wireless telecommunication systems; Energy efficiency analysis; Energy efficient; Energy management schemes; Energy requirements; Point to multipoint; Point to points (PTP); Small cell Networks; Small cells; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019703231

South Africa in particular is susceptible to changes in climate due to its location at the southern-most point of Africa and the rich terrestrial and marine biodiversity that support many livelihoods in the country, make responding to climate change a priority for the government. Academia in South Africa has played a key role in climate change science developing down scaled climate projections used in planning and responding to climate change impacts. However, the interpretation, utilisation as well as the integration of climate science in planning at all levels of government has lagged behind, especially at local municipal level. This paper assesses the role that has been played by Risk and Vulnerability Science Centres in promoting resilience of local government and local communities to climate change. The Risk and Vulnerability Science Centres are one mechanism that has been developed to assist in bridging this gap, by providing a link between scientists and local governments and communities. Three Risk and Vulnerability Science Centres are hosted in three previously disadvantaged universities i.e., the University of Limpopo, University of Fort Hare and Walter Sisulu University. The centres present a great opportunity for the interpretation, packaging and dissemination of climate and other scientific data to local government and communities. They are also well placed to co-produce knowledge as they can conduct research to fill in the knowledge gaps identified by local government and local communities, however they have struggled to perform as expected especially addressing the knowledge gaps. The paper explores the challenges and the opportunities faced by Risk and Science Centres in understanding local level climate change risk and vulnerability and the complex systems in which local governments and community operate. An understanding of this would help design appropriate response options in order to build the resilience of local government and local communities to climate change. The centres have provided an opportunity for the capacity building of students and could play a key role in facilitating participatory platforms for social learning and co-production of knowledge at various levels of government that integrate both indigenous and experiential knowledge. Challenges experienced include lack of commitment by government officials to integrate the research recommendations into policy practice and lack of opportunities to present research in local government forums to inform development planning. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Climate change; Local government; Risk and vulnerability science centres; South Africa; Universities",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075662181

This study aims to improve understanding of water cycling in Los Angeles, including the impacts of imported water and water conservation policies. We evaluate the influence of local water restrictions on discharge records for 12 years in the Ballona Creek (urban) and Topanga Creek (natural) watersheds. Results show imported water has significantly altered the timing and volume of streamflow in the urban Ballona watershed, resulting in runoff ratios above one (more streamflow than precipitation). Further analysis comparing pre- vs. during-mandatory water conservation periods shows there is a significant decrease in dry season streamflow during-conservation in Ballona, indicating that prior to conservation efforts, heavy irrigation and other outdoor water use practices were contributing to streamflow. The difference between summer streamflow pre- vs. during-conservation is enough to serve 160,000 customers in Los Angeles. If Los Angeles returns to more watering days, educating the public on proper irrigation rates is critical for ensuring efficient irrigation and conserving water; however, if water restrictions remain in place, the City must take the new flow volumes into account for complying with water quality standards in the region. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","irrigation; Los Angeles; planning; streamflow; urbanization; water conservation; water policy; watersheds","Climate change; Drought; Irrigation; Planning; Stream flow; Water management; Water quality; Watersheds; Conservation policy; Environmental mitigation; Los angeles; Streamflow response; Urbanization; Water policies; Water quality standard; Water restrictions; Water conservation; discharge; dry season; environmental policy; hydrological response; irrigation; standard (regulation); streamflow; urban planning; urbanization; water management; water quality; water resource; water use; Ballona Creek; California; California; Los Angeles [California]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017419939

The criteria to which the development is assessed being sustainable or not are adopted from the practical definition for sustainability suggested in Dasgupta (2001) and Arrow et al. (2012) as 'non-declining inclusive wealth over time.' The benchmark of the inclusive wealth is defined as economy's productive base which can be classified as Natural Capital (Cn), Manufactured Capital (Cm), Human Capital (Ch), Social Capital (Cs), and Knowledge Capital (Ck). In this study we explore several policy options to solve the problem. The options are (i) Business as Usual, (ii) Stringent Regulation, (iii) Smallholder Empowerment. The evaluation is conducted by agent-based model simulation. Selected sustainability indicators, such as soil carbon stock, forest cover, plantation cover, biodiesel production, employment, customary land ownership, and adoption of best management practice, are employed to represent the five types of the productive based capital stocks change are evaluated over time. The result of the simulation indicates that Business as Usual scenario produces growing rate on Cm, Ch and Ck and declining rate on Cn and Cs over time. Applying the 'Stringent Regulation' scenario would shift the declining rates of Cn and Cs into a steady state and amplifying the rate of Ck with slightly reduce in Cm and Ch. Applying the 'Smallholders Empowerment' scenario would further improve this situation causing increase in Cm and Ch without sacrificing Cn, Cs and Ck. © 2017 IEEE.","agent-based model; biodiesel; palm oil; policy; sustainability","Autonomous agents; Biodiesel; Carbon; Cesium; Computational methods; Environmental protection; Oil shale; Public policy; Sustainable development; Agent-based model; Best management practices; Biodiesel production; Knowledge capitals; Palm oil biodiesels; Stringent regulations; Sustainability criteria; Sustainability indicators; Palm oil",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020304660

Coral cover in the Palk Bay reef at the northern Indian Ocean largely declined in the past decade due to frequent bleaching events, tsunami and increased fishing activities. In this study, we carried out a comparative assessment to assess the differences in the recovery and resilience of three spatially distant reefs viz. Vedhalai, Mandapam and Pamban along Palk Bay affected by moderate, severe and low fishing pressure respectively. The assessment was based on the juvenile coral recruitment pattern and its survivability combined with availability of hard substratum, live coral cover and herbivore reef fish stock. The Vedhalai reef has the highest coral cover (14.6 ± 6.3%), and ≥90% of the live corals in Vedhalai and Mandapam were affected by turf algal overgrowth. The density of herbivore reef fish was low in Vedhalai and Mandapam reefs compared to the Pamban reef with relatively few grazing species. The juvenile coral diversity and density were high in the Pamban reef and low in Vedhalai and Mandapam reefs despite high hard substratum cover. In total, 22 species of juvenile corals of 10 genera were recorded in Palk Bay. Comparison of the species diversity of juvenile corals with adult ones suggested that the Pamban reef is connected with other distant reefs whereas Vedhalai and Mandapam reefs were self-seeded. There was no statistically significant difference in the survivability of juvenile corals between the study sites, and in total, ≥90% of the juvenile corals survived the high sedimentation stress triggered by the northeast monsoon and bleaching stress that occurred recurrently. Our results indicated that the human activities indirectly affected the juvenile coral recruitment by degrading the live coral cover and contributed to the spatial variation in the recovery and resilience of the Palk Bay reef. Low species diversity of the juvenile corals will increase the vulnerability of the Palk Bay reef to species-specific endemic threats. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bleaching; Community structure; Coral; Palk Bay; Recruitment; Resilience","adult; community structure; coral; coral bleaching; coral reef; ecosystem resilience; environmental assessment; environmental degradation; environmental stress; fish; fishing; human activity; juvenile; macroalga; population density; recruitment (population dynamics); species diversity; survival; vulnerability; India; Indian Ocean; Mandapam; Northern Province [Sri Lanka]; Palk Bay; Rameswaram Island; Sri Lanka; Tamil Nadu; algae; Anthozoa; animal; Anthozoa; coral reef; fish; herbivory; Indian Ocean; population dynamics; Animals; Anthozoa; Coral Reefs; Fishes; Herbivory; Indian Ocean; Population Dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017149587

Organic aerosol (OA) instead of sulfate is now the dominant component of total PM2.5. Long-term surface observations (1991-2013) in the Southeast US in summer show parallel decreases in sulfate (2.8%-4.0% a-1) and OA (1.6%-1.9% a-1). Decline of anthropogenic OA emissions is uncertain but is unlikely to fully explain this trend because most OA in the Southeast US in summer is biogenic. We conducted a 1991-2013 simulation with the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model including inventory decreases in anthropogenic SO2, NOx, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions, constant anthropogenic primary OA emissions, and a new mechanism of aqueous-phase SOA formation from isoprene. This simulation reproduces the observed long-term decreases of sulfate and OA, and attributes the OA decrease to decline in the OA yield from biogenic isoprene as sulfate decreases (driving lower aqueous aerosol volume and acidity). Interannual OA variability in the model (mainly driven by isoprene) is also well correlated with observations. This result provides support for a large air quality co-benefit of SO2 emission controls in decreasing biogenic OA as well as sulfate. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","air quality; GEOS-Chem; isoprene; SOA; Southeast US; sulfate","Aerosols; Air quality; Chemical compounds; Isoprene; Sulfur compounds; Sulfur dioxide; Volatile organic compounds; Air quality policy; Chemical transport models; Fine particulate matter; GEOS-Chem; Mass concentration; Secondary organic aerosols; sulfate; Surface observation; Quality control; aerosol; air quality; annual variation; anthropogenic effect; emission control; environmental policy; EOS; isoprene; particulate matter; spatiotemporal analysis; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018527490

However, the already available methods and tools do not offer an integrated framework for the SEAPs’ development and especially the selection of sustainable Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and Rational Use of Energy (RUE) technologies. In this context, the aim of this paper is to present a participatory supportive framework for the implementation of local energy planning. At the first level, the proposed approach incorporates the development of alternative Scenarios of Actions (using knowledge-based process, participatory approach and aspiration level). At the second level, a direct and transparent multicriteria decision support is introduced, in order to evaluate the feasible Scenarios. It includes the application of a multicriteria ordinal regression approach and an extreme ranking analysis method for the estimation of the best and worst possible ranking position of each Scenario. The results from the pilot appraisal of the methodological approach to a “real” problem are presented and discussed. The adopted approach contributes to the selection of the most appropriate combination of RES/RUE actions, supporting in this way the local authorities to the development of their SEAP. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Multiple criteria analysis; OR in energy; Robustness analysis; Scenarios","aspiration; decision support system; renewable energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994177018

While climate may disrupt process feedbacks that would otherwise steer landscapes toward steady erosion, sediment transport processes tend to erase past climate landforms and thus bias landscape evolution interpretations. Here, we couple a 50 k.y. Paleoenvironmental record with 24 10Be-derived paleo-erosion rates from a 63-m-thick sediment archive in the unglaciated soil-mantled Oregon Coast Range. Our results span the forested marine oxygen isotope stage (MIS) 3 (50-29 ka), the subalpine MIS 2 (29-14 ka), and the forested MIS 1 (14 ka to present). From 46 ka through 28.5 ka, erosion rates increased from 0.06 mm yr-1 to 0.23 mm yr-1, coincident with declining temperatures. Mean MIS 2 erosion rates remained at 0.21 mm yr-1 and declined with increasing MIS 1 temperatures to the modern mean rate of 0.08 mm yr-1. Paleoclimate reconstructions and a frost-weathering model suggest periglacial processes were vigorous between 35 and 17 ka. While steady erosion is often assumed, our results suggest that climate strongly modulates soil production and transport on glacialinterglacial time scales. By applying a cosmogenic paleo-erosion model to evaluate 10Be concentrations in our sedimentary archive, we demonstrate that the depth of soil mixing (which is climate-dependent) controls the lag time required for cosmogenic erosion rates to track actual values. Our results challenge the widely held assumption that climate has minimal impact on erosion rates in unglaciated midlatitude terrain, which invites reconsideration of the extent to which past climate regimes manifest in modern landscapes. © 2016 Geological Society of America.",,"Erosion; Forestry; Sediment transport; Soils; Climatic controls; Geomorphic process; Landscape evolutions; Marine oxygen isotopes; Oregon coast ranges; Paleoclimate reconstruction; Periglacial process; Sediment transport process; Climate models; climate effect; erosion rate; geomorphological response; landscape evolution; marine isotope stage; paleoclimate; paleotemperature; periglacial process; sediment transport; Coast Ranges; Oregon; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018428129

These include production of bulk materials (e.g. steel and cement), energy supply (e.g. fossil fuels) and animal source foods (particularly ruminants and their products). Effective strategies to meet these targets require transformative changes in supply as well as demand, involving changes in economic, political and legal systems at local, national and international levels, building on evidence from many disciplines. This paper outlines contributions from behavioural science in reducing demand. Grounded in dualprocess models of human behaviour (involving non-conscious and conscious processes) this paper considers first why interventions aimed at changing population values towards the environment are usually insufficient or unnecessary for reducing demand although they may be important in increasing public acceptability of policies that could reduce demand. It then outlines two sets of evidence from behavioural science towards effective systems-based strategies, to identify interventions likely to be effective at: (i) reducing demand for products that contribute most to GHG emissions, mainly targeting non-conscious processes and (ii) increasing public acceptability for policy changes to enable these interventions, targeting conscious processes.

This variability in infection outcomes is recapitulated at the granuloma level within each host, such that some sites of infection can be fully cleared while others progress. Understanding the spectrum of TB outcomes requires new tools to deconstruct the mechanisms underlying differences in granuloma fate. Here, we use novel genome-encoded barcodes to uniquely tag individual M. tuberculosis bacilli, enabling us to quantitatively track the trajectory of each infecting bacterium in a macaque model of TB. We also introduce a robust bioinformatics pipeline capable of identifying and counting barcode sequences within complex mixtures and at various read depths. By coupling this tagging strategy with serial positron emission tomography coregistered with computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging of lung pathology in macaques, we define a lesional map of M. tuberculosis infection dynamics. We find that there is no significant infection bottleneck, but there are significant constraints on productive bacterial trafficking out of primary granulomas. Our findings validate our barcoding approach and demonstrate its utility in probing lesion-specific biology and dissemination. This novel technology has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of local dynamics in tuberculosis. IMPORTANCE Classically, M. tuberculosis infection was thought to result in either latent infection or active disease. More recently, the field has recognized that there is a spectrum of M. tuberculosis infection clinical outcomes. Within a single host, this spectrum is recapitulated at the granuloma level, where there can simultaneously be lesional sterilization and poorly contained disease. To better understand the lesional biology of TB infection, we digitally barcoded M. tuberculosis to quantitatively track the fate of each infecting bacterium. By combining this technology with serial PET-CT imaging, we can dynamically track both bacterial populations and granuloma trajectories. We demonstrate that there is little constraint on the bacterial population at the time of infection. However, the granuloma imposes a strong bottleneck on dissemination, and the subset of granulomas at risk of dissemination can be distinguished by physical features. © 2017 Martin et al.","Bacterial barcode; Granuloma; Infection mapping; Lung infection; Macaque; Mycobacterium tuberculosis","adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bioinformatics; computer assisted tomography; DNA barcoding; genetic code; granuloma; in vivo study; lung; Macaca; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; positron emission tomography; priority journal; tuberculosis; animal; biology; genetics; human; latent tuberculosis; Macaca fascicularis; microbiology; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; physiology; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; tuberculosis; Animals; Computational Biology; Granuloma; Humans; Latent Tuberculosis; Lung; Macaca fascicularis; Models, Animal; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Tuberculosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022333849

The emissions of unregulated compounds (such as total particle number (PN) (over 5.6 nm); black carbon (BC); NO2; benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX); carbonyl compounds; and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)) were measured with several online devices, and different samples were collected using cartridges and quartz filters. Furthermore, a preliminary statistical analysis was performed on eight Euro 4-6 diesel and gasoline vehicles to study the impacts of driving conditions and after-treatment and engine technologies on emissions of regulated and unregulated pollutants. The results indicate that urban conditions with cold starts induce high emissions of BTEX and carbonyl compounds.

In the past decade, dose escalation has guaranteed a better local control of disease with a great tolerance in terms of side effects. Our results constitute a benchmarking exercise for a prospective trial that involves the use of heavy particles as integration of conventional treatment with photons. Background The prognosis for patients with high-risk prostate cancer is poor. No consensus exists on the most effective treatment. The aim of this retrospective study was to identify the biochemical progression-free survival and the toxicity profile of patients with localized high-risk prostate cancer treated with external beam radiation therapy. These results will constitute a benchmark for a prospective &#x201C;mixed beam&#x201D; trial: a boost with carbon ions followed by a pelvic photon intensity-modulated radiotherapy (NCT02672449 [clinicaltrials.gov]). Patients and Methods We retrospectively reviewed the data of 76 patients treated in our institution with photon radiation therapy according to the inclusion criteria of the future &#x201C;mixed beam&#x201D; trial: cT3a and/or serum prostate-specific antigen &#x003E; 20 ng/mL and/or Gleason score of 8 to 10, cN0 cM0. Toxicity, and biochemical and clinical progression-free survival were assessed. Results Seventy-six patients fulfilled our criteria. The median follow-up was 30.2 months (range, 7.2-61.1). Biochemical progression was observed in 22 patients (28.9%) after a median time of 20.2 months (range, 5-58.1) from the end of radiotherapy. Sixteen patients had clinical progression, in all the cases preceded by biochemical progression. Fifty-seven patients (75%) are alive with no evidence of disease, 13 (17.1%) are alive with clinically evident disease, 6 died (3 of prostate disease 3.9%). Conclusion Our results suggest that a more aggressive treatment is necessary. Local treatment intensification based on the &#x201C;mixed beam&#x201D; approach combining carbon ions (with its known radiobiological advantages) and photons might represent a promising strategy in high-risk prostate cancer and it will be investigated with our prospective clinical trial. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon ions; Mix beam approach; Photons; Prostate cancer","prostate specific antigen; prostate specific antigen; adult; aged; Article; cancer growth; cancer mortality; cancer prognosis; cancer radiotherapy; cancer risk; cancer staging; cancer survival; cone beam computed tomography; controlled study; external beam radiotherapy; follow up; gastrointestinal disease; Gleason score; high risk patient; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; major clinical study; male; overall survival; photon therapy; progression free survival; prostate cancer; retrospective study; urogenital tract disease; benchmarking; blood; clinical trial; disease free survival; middle aged; procedures; prognosis; prospective study; prostate tumor; proton therapy; treatment outcome; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Benchmarking; Disease-Free Survival; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic Neoplasms; Proton Therapy; Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012932687

A combination of photon intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) on pelvis with a carbon ion boost might be the optimal treatment scheme to escalate the dose on prostate and deliver curative dose with respect to normal tissue and quality of dose distributions. In fact, carbon ion beams offer the advantage to deliver hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) using a significantly smaller number of fractions compared to conventional RT without increasing risks of late effects. Methods: This study is a prospective phase II clinical trial exploring safety and feasibility of a mixed beam scheme of carbon ion prostate boost followed by photon IMRT on pelvis. The study is designed to enroll 65 patients with localized high-risk prostate cancer at 3 different oncologic hospitals: Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, and Centro Nazionale di Adroterapia Oncologica. The primary endpoint is the evaluation of safety and feasibility with acute toxicity scored up to 1 month after the end of RT. Secondary endpoints are treatment early (3 months after the end of RT) and long-term tolerability, quality of life, and efficacy. Results: The study is not yet recruiting; in silico studies are ongoing and we expect to start recruitment by 2017. Conclusions: The present clinical trial aims at improving the current treatment for high-risk prostate cancer, evaluating safety and feasibility of a new RT mixed-beam scheme including photons and carbon ions. Encouraging results are coming from carbon ion facilities worldwide on the treatment of different tumors including prostate cancers. Carbon ions combine physical properties allowing for high dose conformity and advantageous radiobiological characteristics. The proposed mixed beam treatment has the advantage to combine a photon high conformity standard of care IMRT phase with a hypofractionated carbon ion RT boost delivered in a short overall treatment time. © 2017 Wichtig Publishing.","Clinical trial; High-risk prostate cancer; Hypofractionated radiotherapy; Photon intensity-modulated radiotherapy","Article; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; feasibility study; high risk patient; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; ion therapy; long term care; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; multihospital system; open study; pelvis radiography; phase 2 clinical trial; prospective study; prostate cancer; quality of life; radiation hazard; radiation safety; toxicity testing; adult; adverse effects; aged; clinical trial; intensity modulated radiation therapy; ion therapy; middle aged; pathology; pelvis; photon; procedures; Prostatic Neoplasms; radiation dose; radiation dose fractionation; radiation response; therapeutic use; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Dose Fractionation; Heavy Ion Radiotherapy; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pelvis; Photons; Prostatic Neoplasms; Quality of Life; Radiation Dosage; Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019767279

In developing countries the use of low cost fuels including coal, wood, pellets, charcoal and cow dung remains an obstacle in ensuring the right to clean air. In this study, several stove to fuel combustion technologies researches, were reviewed for similarities/ commonalities and differences. The review highlights on critical health and environmental effects associated with burning of solid fuels using inefficient cookstoves. The review deepens the understanding on various clean energy interventions and policy formulation in several countries within the Southern Africa Development Communities (SADC) region. Studies indicated the development of stove alone will not be enough in enhancing or reducing air pollution, but emphasis shall be put on stove to fuel combination. Findings also suggest a lack of clear or practical policy intervention to restore household indoor air quality, while single policy intervention proven inadequate in many studies. In sub-Saharan region, policy intervention focuses on energy switch thus from traditional solid fuels to modern energy resources namely electricity and liquid petroleum gas (LPG). This approach is not feasible given the difficulties in electricity generation and supply system, housing infrastructure and cost implication.

With the recent years, inflation in the fuel prices & the demand to have reduced greenhouse emissions has played a significant role in redefining the car aerodynamics. The shape of the vehicle uses about 3% of fuel to overcome the resistance in urban driving, while it takes 11% of fuel for the highway driving. This considerable high value of fuel usage in highway driving attracts several design engineers to enhance the aerodynamics of the vehicle using minimal design changes. Besides, automotive vehicles have become so much faster experiencing uplift force which creates unexpected accidents. This brings the idea of using external devices, which could be attached to the present vehicle without changing the body. This paper is based on the design, developments and numeral calculation of the effects of external device, which will be spoiler that mounted at the rear side of the sedan car to make the present vehicles more aerodynamically attractive.

It has up to three generations per year and has no natural enemies in Europe which helps it to spread rapidly and to become highly invasive in its new range. The aim of this paper is to show i) spatial distribution, ii) number of generations; iii) food choice, and iv) genetic distribution of box tree moth in Croatia. Materials and Methods: Occurrence data of box tree moth were obtained by field observation and data obtained from the general public. The number of generations of box tree moth was studied by direct observation of life stages on plants. Food choice test was conducted on Buxus sempervirens, Ilex aquifolium, Euonymus japonicus and Ligustrum vulgare used as food plants. Haplotype diversity and distribution of box tree moth was done for 5 localities in Croatia and their comparison to the haplotypes from China, Korea and 10 European countries. Results: Box tree moth has rapidly spread over the whole territory of Croatia in 4 years and it has three generations per year. The larvae showed a clear preference for B. sempervirens leaves and the total consumption was 0.5 g/dry weight of box leaves/larva. Three haplotypes were observed and haplotype HT4 was found in 4 out of 5 sampling sites in Croatia. The haplotypes observed in Croatia were present in China, which indicates Chinese origin of Croatian populations. Conclusions: Suitable European climate, widely available host plants and lack of natural enemies have enabled box tree moth to become highly invasive, to quickly disperse in its new environment and to make devastating damages to ornamental European box plants and hedges. © 2017 by the Croatian Forest Research Institute.","Buxus sempervirens; Haplotypes; Invasive species; Total consumption",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045312282

We adopt the perspective that CC-AP drivers and physiological impacts are universal, resulting in consistent stress responses of forest ecosystems across zonobiomes. Evidence supporting this viewpoint is presented from the literature on ecosystem gross/net primary productivity and water cycling. Responses to CC-AP are compared across evergreen/deciduous foliage types, discussing implications of nutrition and resource turnover at tree and ecosystem scales. The availability of data is extremely uneven across zonobiomes, yet unifying patterns of ecosystem response are discernable. Ecosystem warming results in trade-offs between respiration and biomass production, affecting high elevation forests more than in the lowland tropics and low-elevation temperate zone. Resilience to drought is modulated by tree size and species richness. Elevated O 3 tends to counteract stimulation by elevated carbon dioxide (CO 2). Biotic stress and genomic structure ultimately determine ecosystem responsiveness. Aggrading early- rather than mature late-successional communities respond to CO 2 enhancement, whereas O 3 affects North American and Eurasian tree species consistently under free-air fumigation. Insect herbivory is exacerbated by CC-AP in biome-specific ways. Rhizosphere responses reflect similar stand-level nutritional dynamics across zonobiomes, but are modulated by differences in tree-soil nutrient cycling between deciduous and evergreen systems, and natural versus anthropogenic nitrogen (N) oversupply. The hypothesis of consistency of forest responses to interacting CC-AP is supported by currently available data, establishing the precedent for a global network of long-term coordinated research sites across zonobiomes to simultaneously advance both bottom-up (e.g., mechanistic) and top-down (systems-level) understanding. This global, synthetic approach is needed because high biological plasticity and physiographic variation across individual ecosystems currently limit development of predictive models of forest responses to CC-AP. Integrated research on C and nutrient cycling, O 3 -vegetation interactions and water relations must target mechanisms' ecosystem responsiveness. Worldwide case studies must be subject to biostatistical exploration to elucidate overarching response patterns and synthesize the resulting empirical data through advanced modelling, in order to provide regionally coherent, yet globally integrated information in support of internationally coordinated decision-making and policy development. © The Author 2017.

Leveraging recently collected national emissions and activity data sets, we developed a new process-based emissions model implemented in a Monte Carlo simulation framework to estimate emissions for each component and facility in the system. We find that approximately 83% of emissions, given the existing suite of technologies, have the potential to be abated, with only a few emission categories comprising a majority of emissions. We then formulate optimization models to determine optimal abatement strategies. Most emissions across the system (approximately 80%) are efficient to abate, resulting in net benefits ranging from $160M to $1.2B annually across the system. The private cost burden is minimal under standard and tax instruments, and if firms market the abated natural gas, private net benefits may be generated. Superemitter policies, namely, those that target the highest emitting facilities, may reduce the private cost burden and achieve high emission reductions, especially if emissions across facilities are highly skewed. However, detection across all facilities is necessary regardless of the policy option and there are nontrivial net benefits resulting from abatement of relatively low-emitting sources.

The paper discusses selected contextual determinants of bullying, using data collected in Poland in 2015 and aggregated to school level (4085 students; 70 junior high schools). The main hypothesis is related to the neighborhood social capital as protective factor and the type of community as a modifier. The main dependent variable was the combined index of bullying which included three perspectives (victim, perpetrator, bystander). Student delinquent behavior was taken into account as potential determinant, along with selected characteristics of the school and neighborhood. The analyses were adjusted for the percentage of the surveyed boys. The overall bullying index ranged, depending on the school, from 0.88 to 4.07 points (out of 12 possible); intraclass coefficient ICC = 2.8%. In the entire sample, the main predictors of bullying were student delinquent behaviors as a risk factor and the school social climate as a protective factor (R2 = 56.3%). The stratification of schools due to their location influences the inference regarding those main determinants. The dominating influence of delinquent behavior is visible only in big cities where bullying index showed the highest dispersion. In smaller towns and rural areas, the neighborhood social capital becomes an important protective factor; highly correlated with the school climate. We can conclude that strong social bonds in the community are supportive for school climate and can reduce the level of bullying at schools. © 2017, The Author(s).","Bullying; Delinquent behavior; Ecological analysis; School climate; Urbanization level","bullying; child; city; delinquency; dependent variable; high school; human; major clinical study; male; neighborhood; offender; Poland; risk factor; rural area; social bonding; social capital; social environment; stratification; student; urbanization; victim",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009289860

The presence of a PCM layer in the external building wall, due to the effect of storage and release of latent energy phenomena, modifies the energy behavior, both during the summer and winter periods. This paper addresses the problem of the definition of the energetic behavior of a layer subject to phase change with periodic non-sinusoidal boundary conditions, characterizing the external walls of air-conditioned buildings. In such conditions, the layer is the site of the formation of one or more bi-phase interfaces, which originate on the boundary surfaces, or are always present and fluctuate within the layer. It is also possible that the layer does not undergo any phase change. The study has been developed by a finite difference numeric calculation model which explicitly determines the number and the position of the bi-phase interfaces that originate in the layer and the temperature and the heat flux fields. The surface heat fluxes are used to evaluate the PCM layer energetic behavior in terms of energy transferred through the boundary surfaces and of stored energy in sensible and latent form. The proposed method employs the characteristic day that it is periodically repeated for all the days of the considered month. The use of the characteristic days drastically reduces the computational burden of the numerical calculation and it allows to obtain guidance on the behaviour of the PCM throughout the year, in accordance with the variability of external climatic conditions, in order to select the PCM with the most suitable thermophysical properties. The methodology developed is applied to PCM layers with different melting temperatures and subject to climatic conditions of two locations, one with a continental climate and the second one with a Mediterranean climate. The results obtained allowed us to identify which PCM is more suitable in improving the energetic performances of building walls in the heating or cooling period during the year. In particular, the energy analysis highlighted that, in both localities, during the winter period: the lowest energy exiting from the indoor environment is ensured by a PCM with a melting temperature of 15 °C; the highest contribution of energy entering the indoor environment, mainly due to solar radiation, is recorded for a PCM with a melting temperature of 26 °C. During the summer period: the lowest value of energy entering the indoor environment is obtained by a PCM with melting temperature of 26 °C; the highest value of energy exiting from the indoor environment is ensured by a melting temperature equal to 20 °C. In both locations, a PCM with a melting temperature intermediate between those of the winter and summer set points of the indoor environment is the best compromise between winter and summer energy needs for an air-conditioned environment, as it allows obtainment of the highest values of the yearly total stored energy. © 2017 by the authors.

For all the attention accorded the issue, climate changeglobal warming has spawned surprisingly little grassroots activism in the contemporary United States. Drawing on social movement theory, the author seeks to explain this puzzle. The prevailing consensus among movement scholars is that the prospect for movement emergence is facilitated by the confluence of three factors: the expansion of political opportunities, the availability of mobilizing structures, and cognitive and affective mobilization through framing processes. The author then applies each of these factors to the case of climate change, arguing that (a) awareness of the issue developed during an especially inopportune period in American politics, (b) the organizations that arose to address the issue were ill suited to the kind of grassroots mobilization characteristic of successful movements, and (c) the amorphous nature of the issue played havoc with efforts at strategic framing. © 2017 by Annual Reviews.

We explored monthly dissolved inorganic N (DIN) export to the GOM for a historical year (2002) and two future scenarios (year 2022) by linking macroeonomic energy, agriculture market, air quality, and agriculture land management models to a DIN export model. Future scenarios considered policies aimed at encouraging bioenergy crop production and reducing atmospheric N-emissions, as well as the effect of population growth and the states’ infrastructure plans on sewage fluxes. Model-derived DIN export decreased by about 9% (from 279 to 254 kg N km−2 year−1) between 2002 and 2022 due to a 28% increase in area planted with corn, 24% improvement in crop N-recovery efficiency (NRE, to 0.52), 22% reduction in atmospheric N deposition, and 23% increase in sewage inputs. Changes in atmospheric and sewage inputs had a relatively small effect on DIN export and the effect of bioenergy crop production depended on nutrient management practices. Without improved NRE, increased production of corn would have increased DIN export by about 14% (to 289 kg N km−2 year−1) between 2002 and 2022. Model results suggest that meeting future crop demand while reducing the areal extent of hypoxia could require aggressive actions, such improving basin-level crop NRE to 0.62 or upgrading N-removal capabilities in waste water treatment plants beyond current plans. Tile-drained cropland could contribute up to half of DIN export; thus, practices that reduce N losses from tile drains could also have substantial benefit. © 2017, The Author(s).","Dissolved inorganic nitrogen; Gulf of Mexico; Mississippi River Basin; Nitrogen export model; Tile drainage","agricultural land; agricultural management; atmospheric deposition; bioenergy; crop production; dissolved inorganic nitrogen; hypoxia; maize; nitrogen; numerical model; nutrient enrichment; population growth; river basin; tile drain; wastewater treatment plant; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico; Mississippi River; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017252761

A roster of adaptation strategies has emerged in the climate change literature, especially with regard to timing: anticipatory, concurrent, or reactive. Significant progress has been made in studying climate change adaptation decision making that incorporates uncertainty, but less work has examined how strategies interact with existing infrastructure characteristics to influence adaptability. We use a virtual testbed of highway drainage crossings configured with a selection of actual culvert emplacements in Colorado, USA, to examine the effect of adaptation strategy and culvert characteristics on cost efficiency and service level under varying rates of climate change. A meta-model approach with multinomial regression is used to compare the value of better climate change predictions with better knowledge of existing crossing characteristics. We find that, for a distributed system of infrastructural units like culverts, knowing more about existing characteristics can improve the efficacy of adaptation strategies more than better projections of climate change. Transportation departments choosing climate adaptation strategies often lack detailed data on culverts, and gathering that data could improve the efficiency of adaptation despite climate uncertainty. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Climate change; Infrastructure adaptation; Scenario simulation; Stormwater management","adaptation; adaptive management; climate change; culvert; decision making; infrastructure planning; prediction; scenario analysis; strategic approach; water management; Colorado; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012271901

Stimulated by the shift towards energy efficient design and rising fuel costs, the concept is perceived as a potential means of meeting energy and carbon targets through an established, reliable methodology. However the performance of the Standard in terms of adequate indoor air quality and thermal comfort in a UK climate remains under-researched. This paper describes the use of the Passivhaus Standard in a UK context, and its potential implications on indoor environmental quality. A case study is presented, which included indoor air quality measurements, occupant diary, building survey and occupant interviews in a Passivhaus social housing project in Northern Ireland. The study found issues with indoor air quality, the use and maintenance of Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery (MVHR) systems, lack of occupant knowledge and the perception of overheating in the case study dwellings. The findings provide a much needed insight into the indoor environmental quality in homes designed to the Passivhaus standard; which can be disseminated to aid the development of an effective sustainable building design that is both appropriate to localised climatic conditions and also sensitive to the health of building occupants. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Energy efficiency; Indoor air quality; Overheating; Passivhaus","Air quality; Architectural design; Buildings; Carbon; Energy efficiency; Housing; Indoor air pollution; Intelligent buildings; Sustainable development; Ventilation; Waste heat; Energy-efficient design; Indoor air quality; Indoor air quality measurements; Indoor environmental quality; Mechanical ventilation; Overheating; Passivhaus; Sustainable building design; Air quality standards",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019664921

This increase in temperature is labeled as global warming, which is due to different greenhouse gases that pollute the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is the largest contributor, its main source being from the electricity production sector. There has been discussion by experts and organizations as to whether zero carbon dioxide emissions in this sector is possible by 2050. This paper studies and analyzes wind, nuclear, and hydroelectric power production to accomplish this goal. It also examines and selects the ideal turbine (onshore and offshore) for each year from 2018 to 2050 using estimated research and development. The scope focuses on night time base load to exclude solar energy from this study. The strategy represents the entire United States by focusing on 20 metropolitan areas (Case Shiller Metropolitan Areas). Due to time constraints, only a select 5 of the 20 Case Shiller metropolitan areas will be modeled. Using Mathematical Programming Language for linear programming, we optimized the number of each alternative in each region modeled. An economic model was used from National Renewable Energy Laboratory to estimate the job growth for the system in the areas. The analysis provides the cost and economic impact that the system will have on the regions. It is recommended that a method to levitate the price of the system is needed which can be in the form of carbon tax or governmental subsidies. © 2017 IEEE.","Department of Energy; Energy Information Agency; Jobs and Economic Development; Mathematical Programming Language; National Renewable Energy Laboratory","Carbon dioxide; Computer programming languages; Cost estimating; Costs; Economic and social effects; Economics; Electric power generation; Emission control; Estimation; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydroelectric power; Linear programming; Mathematical programming; Research laboratories; Solar energy; Department of Energy; Economic development; Electricity production; Energy information agencies; Hydroelectric power production; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Production strategy; Research and development; Cost benefit analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025634086

These include efforts to reverse current policy initiatives to combat climate change and protect the integrity of the national air and watersheds. The purported rationale, in sum, is that current policy initiatives to protect the environment are over burdensome and retard economic growth. This age-old argument is wholly focused on one side of the equation, the costs of regulation. However, in reality, these regulations also provide substantial benefits that, by all legitimate estimates, far outweigh the purported costs. At the heart of this cost-benefit analysis that underpins environmental regulations is the fundamental reason government becomes involved in environmental regulation in the first place: Externalities. And when viewed objectively, we see that externalities disproportionately impact communities that are already marginalized. In fact, the marginalization of these communities is often directly associated with externalities. The purpose of this article is to discuss the current posture of the Trump administration toward environmental deregulation within the context of externalities. The goal is to remind us that most environmental problems emanate from externalities; that externalities do not cease simply by removing regulatory obstacles to their existence; and that externalities disproportionately impact marginalized communities. © 2017 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","environmental justice; environmental policy; externalities; public policy","climate change; cost-benefit analysis; economic growth; environmental impact; environmental justice; environmental management; environmental policy; environmental protection; marginalization; policy approach; social policy",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020546001

Groundwater reliance has created new challenges for sustainable management. This article examines how regional groundwater users coordinate and collaborate to manage shared groundwater resources, including attention to what drives collaboration. To identify and illustrate these facets, this article examines three geographically diverse cases of groundwater governance and management from the United States Sun Belt: Orange County Water District in southern California; Prescott Active Management Area in north-central Arizona; and the Central Florida Water Initiative in central Florida. These regions have different surface water laws, groundwater allocation and management laws and regulations, demographics, economics, topographies, and climate. These cases were selected because the Sun Belt faces similar pressures on groundwater due to historical and projected population growth and limited availability of usable surface water supplies. Collectively, they demonstrate groundwater governance trends in the United States, and illustrate distinctive features of regional groundwater management strategies. Our research shows how geophysical realities and state-level legislation have enabled and/or stimulated regions to develop groundwater management plans and strategies to address the specific issues associated with their groundwater resources. We find that litigation involvement and avoidance, along with the need to finance projects, are additional drivers of regional collaboration to manage groundwater. This case study underscores the importance of regionally coordinated and sustained efforts to address serious groundwater utilization challenges faced by the regions studied and around the world. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Case studies; Collaboration; Groundwater governance; Innovation; Regional groundwater management","Climate change; Groundwater; Laws and legislation; Population statistics; Regional planning; Surface water resources; Surface waters; Water management; Water supply; Case-studies; Collaboration; Groundwater allocation; Groundwater governances; Groundwater management plan; Groundwater utilization; Orange county water districts; Regional groundwater; Groundwater resources; ground water; surface water; governance approach; groundwater resource; innovation; legislation; population growth; surface water; sustainability; water management; water use; Article; climate; economics; irrigation (agriculture); participatory management; population growth estimation; United States; waste water management; water supply; Arizona; California; climate change; environmental protection; Florida; government regulation; legislation and jurisprudence; water supply; Arizona; California; Florida [United States]; Orange County [Florida]; Prescott; Sun Belt; United States; Arizona; California; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Florida; Government Regulation; Groundwater; Water Resources; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011914855

Results indicate that cofiring wood pellets with coal is generally not a commercially viable option. However, lower-level (with wood pellets < 15%) cofiring could have been feasible during the infancy period (2009–2011) when wood pellet price was declining. Sensitivity analysis shows that our conclusions are robust and the most important factors are relative prices of coal and mixed fuel. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis that cofiring is economically feasible and suggest using policy vehicles to stimulate the bioenergy market and meet the greenhouse gas emission reduction target. In particular, a subsidy of $1.40/mmbtu to the 10% mixed fuel or a tax of $1.50/mmbtu on coal would prompt the conversions of coal-only power plants to cofiring ones, and a subsidy of $0.45/mmbtu to the 10% mixed fuel or a tax of $0.50/mmbtu on coal would maintain existing cofiring power plants in the status quo. © 2017","Bioenergy; Decision-making; Forestry; Greenhouse gas emission; Real options","Alternative fuels; Coal; Decision making; Emission control; Forestry; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Pelletizing; Sensitivity analysis; Wood; Wood fuels; Bio-energy; Co-firing power plants; Electricity generation; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Real Options; Regime switching; Regime switching model; Relative prices; Fossil fuel power plants; bioenergy; carbon emission; decision making; electricity generation; forestry; greenhouse gas; wood; Georgia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033387138

The electricity generation units that respond to this demand are major contributors to sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), both of which have direct impacts on public health, and contribute to the formation of secondary pollutants including ozone and fine particulate matter. This study quantifies temperature-driven changes in power plant emissions due to increased use of building air conditioning. We compare an ambient temperature baseline for the Eastern US to a model-calculated mid-century scenario with summer-average temperature increases ranging from 1 C to 5 C across the domain. We find a 7% increase in summer electricity demand and a 32% increase in non-coincident peak demand. Power sector modeling, assuming only limited changes to current generation resources, calculated a 16% increase in emissions of NOx and an 18% increase in emissions of SO2. There is a high level of regional variance in the response of building energy use to climate, and the response of emissions to associated demand. The East North Central census region exhibited the greatest sensitivity of energy demand and associated emissions to climate. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Air quality; buildings; climate impacts; electricity; modeling","Air quality; Electricity; Energy utilization; Models; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Building energy use; Climate impacts; Electricity demands; Electricity generation; Fine particulate matter; Power-plant emissions; Temperature increase; US energy consumption; Buildings; air conditioning; air quality; ambient air; building; census; climate effect; electricity generation; electricity industry; energy use; power plant; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021305193

The present study examines why managers often do not engage their firms in adaptations to climate change. Thereby the study focuses, in particular, on the lack of strategic adaptation, which we define as anticipatory and target-oriented action with the purpose of increasing resilience to climate change. In order to investigate causes of lacking strategic adaptation in firms, the study employs a behavioral perspective based on the reasoned action approach. Thus, the study examines how barriers and motivational factors jointly shape the non-adaptive behavior of firm managers. Such causes of non-adaptive behavior are examined by comparing different classes of non-adaptors based on a case study in the manufacturing industry of the Austrian state of Tyrol. The obtained results underline recent criticism on barrier-centered analyses of non-adaptation by demonstrating the importance of motivational factors. Moreover, results point to the changeable nature of the identified causes of non-adaptive behavior by clarifying interactions between them and by suggesting influences from background factors. © 2017 by the authors.","Actor-centered approach; Barriers; Behavioral perspective; Climate change adaptation; Manufacturing industry; Motivational factors","adaptive management; alpine environment; behavioral response; climate change; industrial practice; manufacturing; strategic approach; supply chain management; Austria; Tyrol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021656800

Those elevated GHG concentrations warm the planet and - partially offset by net cooling effects by aerosols - are largely responsible for the observed warming over the past 150 years. An accurate representation of GHG concentrations is hence important to understand and model recent climate change. So far, community efforts to create composite datasets of GHG concentrations with seasonal and latitudinal information have focused on marine boundary layer conditions and recent trends since the 1980s. Here, we provide consolidated datasets of historical atmospheric concentrations (mole fractions) of 43 GHGs to be used in the Climate Model Intercomparison Project - Phase 6 (CMIP6) experiments. The presented datasets are based on AGAGE and NOAA networks, firn and ice core data, and archived air data, and a large set of published studies. In contrast to previous intercomparisons, the new datasets are latitudinally resolved and include seasonality. We focus on the period 1850-2014 for historical CMIP6 runs, but data are also provided for the last 2000 years. We provide consolidated datasets in various spatiotemporal resolutions for carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as 40 other GHGs, namely 17 ozone-depleting substances, 11 hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), 9 perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) and sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2). In addition, we provide three equivalence species that aggregate concentrations of GHGs other than CO2, CH4 and N2O, weighted by their radiative forcing efficiencies. For the year 1850, which is used for pre-industrial control runs, we estimate annual global-mean surface concentrations of CO2 at 284.3 ppm, CH4 at 808.2 ppb and N2O at 273.0 ppb. The data are available at https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/input4mips/ and www.climatecollege.unimelb.edu.au/cmip6. While the minimum CMIP6 recommendation is to use the global- and annual-mean time series, modelling groups can also choose our monthly and latitudinally resolved concentrations, which imply a stronger radiative forcing in the Northern Hemisphere winter (due to the latitudinal gradient and seasonality).. © Author(s) 2017.",,"accuracy assessment; aerosol; boundary layer; carbon dioxide; climate effect; climate modeling; climate variation; CMIP; concentration (composition); experimental study; greenhouse gas; ice core; latitudinal gradient; methane; nitrous oxide; Northern Hemisphere; radiative forcing; spatiotemporal analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020214855

One increasingly popular measure is the use of cargo bikes in city logistics due to their improved energy efficiency, lower emissions and lower traffic disturbance. The paper assess the impacts of electric cargo bikes, from a public policy perspective and, simultaneously, taking into account variables that cover the urban logistics operators’ interests. Under a public policy perspective, the considered variables evaluate mobility, environmental impacts and indirectly, the quality of life. In terms of private interests, the studied variables cover costs levels (operation and driving) and efficiency. This evaluation aims at clarifying if electric cargo bikes can indeed represent a sustainable mobility policy under specific boundaries, by leading to better environmental and social impacts and not hindering the operational efficiency of urban logistics activities. Methods: For that purpose, the measurement of the traffic key performance indicators, as well as of Well-to-Wheel energy and CO2 emission savings is performed allowing to quantify mobility, reliability and operational efficiency indicators. Several scenarios related with the introduction of electric cargo bikes replacing conventional vans were assessed and evaluated in order to compare the effects of different market shares in the mobility of the studied area located in Porto (Portugal). Acknowledging the short distance range of cargo bikes, the simulation is carried out and an estimation of the total transportation cost is performed, which includes transport and emission cost when the vehicle is driving, emission cost while idling and labor cost. Results: The main conclusion is that cargo bikes can replace up to 10% of the conventional vans in areas with maximum linear distances of about 2 km, without changing the overall network efficiency. Additionally, urban logistics WTW CO2 emission impacts can be reduced by up to 73%, which represents 746 kg of CO2 avoided emissions. Furthermore, the introduction of electric cargo bikes in urban logistics activities has positive effects for all the vehicle categories and all the scenarios, reaching up to 25% of reductions in external costs. Conclusions: As a result, cargo bikes implemented at the appropriate spatial scale within the city can be a sustainable solution for urban logistics, depending on a prior delimitation of the conditions and adequate implementation strategy, to guarantee that it actually leads to improvements in terms of mobility, environment, energy, running costs and externalities. © 2017, The Author(s).","City logistics; Cycle logistics; Electric cargo bikes; Sustainable mobility","Benchmarking; Bicycles; Carbon dioxide; Compensation (personnel); Competition; Costs; Crashworthiness; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Public policy; Quality control; Sustainable development; Trucks; Wages; City logistics; Electric cargo bikes; European Commission; Implementation strategies; Key performance indicators; Operational efficiencies; Sustainable mobility; Sustainable solution; Freight transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020040321

Therefore, it is crucial to estimate the amounts of fine particulate matter concentrations through the urban atmosphere. In this research, an artificial neural network technique was utilized to model the PM2.5 dispersion in Tehran City. Factors which are influencing the predicted value consist of weather-related and air pollutionrelated data, i.e. wind speed, humidity, temperature, SO2, CO, NO2, and PM2.5 as target values. These factors have been considered in 19 measuring stations (zones) over urban area across Tehran City during four years, from March 2011 to March 2015. The results indicate that the network with hidden layer including six neurons at training epoch 113, has the best performance with the lowest error value (MSE=0.049438) on considering PM2.5 concentrations across metropolitan areas in Tehran. Furthermore, the ""R"" value for regression analysis of training, validation, test, and all data are 0.65898, 0.6419, 0.54027, and 0.62331, respectively.

Small islands are not exempt from this target, so this study's emphasis is placed on a 50-50 target: to reduce the fossil fuel consumption through electricity generation from Renewable Energy Sources (RES) to cover 50% of all electric demand by 2050 on small islands. Using Cozumel Island,Mexico, as a case study, this analysis will be based on three factors: economical, technical, and land-use possibilities of integrating Renewable Energy Technologies (RETs) into the existing electrical grid. This analysis is made through long-termstatisticalmodels. Adeterministicmethodology is used to performtime-series simulations. The selection of the best system was made on the basis of a Dimensional Statistical Variable (DSV) through primary and secondary category rankings. The presented methodology determines the best systems for capturing the initial capital cost and competitiveness of this new proposal compared with the current system of electricity generation on the Island, and can be applied to small islands as well. According to the results, all systems proposed are able to completely satisfy the renewable electricity needed by 2050 in all scenarios. From the 12 system proposals that were compared, two systems, System 2 and System 7, were chosen as eligible systems to be installed. The Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) result for System 2 was 0.2518 US$/kWh and for System 7 was 0.2265 US$/kWh by 2018 in the Base Scenario. Meanwhile, the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) value fluctuated from 17.2% for System 2 to 31% for System 7.","Greenhouse gas reduction; Hybrid system; Island electricity supply; Renewable energy; Renewable energy target; Renewable energy technology","competitiveness; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy resource; fossil fuel; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; land use change; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; small island state; smart grid; storage; wind power; Cozumel; Mexico [North America]; Quintana Roo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020056578

Understanding structural architecture and its effects on the flux of fluids, specifically CO2 and CH4, in the shallow subsurface and atmosphere is helping with designing and implementing next-generation monitoring technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). An important aspect of this research is using subsurface fracture data to inform the design of flight pathways for UAVs in the Farnsworth oil unit of the Anadarko Basin. The target zone for CO2 storage and enhanced oil recovery in the Farnsworth oil unit is in the upper Morrow sandstone at subsurface depths greater than 2000m (6562 ft). Field study reveals that sandstone and chert in the High PlainsAquifer containnumerous joints thatprovide crucial insight into aquifer architecture and subsurface flow pathways. Properties of more than 1700 joints were measured in the field and in high-resolution satellite images. Two distinctive joint systems interpreted as a conjugate pair were identified in the study area. Joint spacing follows a lognormal statistical scaling rule. These fractures appear to be the product of an east-northeast regional compressive stress and may have a significant effect on flow in the High Plains Aquifer system. Based on the results of this research, design of UAV flight paths should be oblique to fractures in a way thatmaximizes the likelihood of CO2 and CH4 flux of systematic joints and cross joints.

Therefore, the presented paper analysed the carbon stock in the living merchantable trees (with diameter at breast height above 7 cm) of the Czech forests with regard to groups of tree species and tree compartments (wood under bark with diameter above 7 cm, wood under bark with diameter below 7 cm, bark, green twigs, foliage, stump and roots). We examined its regional distribution and relationship to the number of inhabitants and the gross domestic product. The data used for the analysis originated from 13,929 forest plots of the first Czech National Forest Inventory performed between 2001 and 2004. The total tree carbon stock was obtained as a sum of the carbon stock in the individual tree compartments estimated from the biomass amount in the compartments multiplied by the relative carbon content. Wood biomass amount was calculated by multiplying a particular part of tree volume with species-specific green wood density. The total amount of carbon stored in forest trees in the Czech Republic was over 327 mill. t, which is about 113 t of carbon per ha of forests. The highest carbon amount (160 mill. t, i.e. 49.0% of the total amount) was fixed in spruce. The minimum carbon amount fixed in the forest cover (14.35 mill. t) was calculated for Ústecký kraj (region), while the maximum carbon amount (51.51 mill. t) was found in Jihoceský kraj.","Allometric equation; Carbon; Forest biomass; Tree compartments; Tree species composition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038350871

Generalized linear models however, overlook the spatial component of land-use data, and its effects on statistical inference. Spatial autocorrelation may artificially reduce variance in observations, and inflate the effect size of covariates. To uncover the consequences of overlooking this spatial component, we tested both spatially explicit and non-spatial models of deforestation for Colombia. Parameter estimates, analyses of residual spatial autocorrelation, and Bayesian posterior predictive checks were used to compare model performance. Significant residual correlation showed that non-spatial models failed to adequately explain the spatial structure of the data. Posterior predictive checks revealed that spatially explicit models had strong predictive power for the entire range of the response variable and only failed to predict outliers, in contrast with non-spatial models, which lacked predictive power for all response values. The predictive power of non-spatial models was especially low in regions away from Colombia's center, where about half the observations were clustered. While all analyses consistently identified a core of important covariates of deforestation rates, predictive modeling requires parameter estimates informed by the spatial structure of the data. To inform increasingly important forest and carbon sequestration policy, land-use models must account for spatial autocorrelation. © 2017 Mets et al.","Amazon; Andes; Colombia; Land protection; Posterior predictive check",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020010424

After defining key terms, it reviews the history of environmental determinism's rise and fall within geography in the early twentieth century. It discusses the key reasons for the doctrine's rejection and presents alternative, non-deterministic frameworks developed within geography for analyzing the roles played by the environment in human affairs. The authors examine the rise in recent decades of neo-deterministic approaches to such issues as the demarcation of regions, the causes of civilizational collapse in prehistory, today's globally uneven patterns of human well-being, and the consequences of human-induced climate change. In each case, the authors draw on the insights and approaches of geography, the academic discipline most conversant with the interactions of society and environment, to challenge the widespread acceptance that such approaches have won.

The research was performed through a field study investigation during the hot summer period. The investigation included different ventilation strategies, i.e. daytime, full-day and night-time ventilation. Furthermore, in the case of night ventilation, different window opening patterns, i.e. single sided and cross ventilation, were examined. The results show that night ventilation is the most effective strategy for passive cooling in vernacular dwellings during the hot summer period, compared to the two other ventilation strategies. This strategy reduces peak indoor air temperatures and also improves indoor thermal conditions during the following day. Furthermore, cross ventilation, during night-time takes full advantage of the relatively low outdoor air temperatures and cools down the building envelope in the best possible way. The findings are presented in a comparative manner and evaluated in a quantitative way, offering valuable information in the relevant field.

Although release of this CH4 to the ocean and atmosphere has become a topic of discussion, the region remains sparingly explored. Here we present pore water chemistry results from 32 sediment cores taken during Leg 2 of the 2014 joint Swedish-Russian-US Arctic Ocean Investigation of Climate-Cryosphere-Carbon Interactions (SWERUS-C3) expedition. The cores come from depth transects across the slope and rise extending between the Mendeleev and the Lomonosov ridges, north of Wrangel Island and the New Siberian Islands, respectively. Upward CH4 flux towards the seafloor, as inferred from profiles of dissolved sulfate (SO42g), alkalinity, and the 13C of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), is negligible at all stations east of 143°gE longitude. In the upper 8gm of these cores, downward SO42g flux never exceeds 6.2gmolgmg2gkyrg1, the upward alkalinity flux never exceeds 6.8gmolgmg2gkyrg1, and 13C composition of DIC (13C-DIC) only moderately decreases with depth (g3.6g‰gmg1 on average). Moreover, upon addition of Zn acetate to pore water samples, ZnS did not precipitate, indicating a lack of dissolved H2S. Phosphate, ammonium, and metal profiles reveal that metal oxide reduction by organic carbon dominates the geochemical environment and supports very low organic carbon turnover rates. A single core on the Lomonosov Ridge differs, as diffusive fluxes for SO42g and alkalinity were 13.9 and 11.3gmolgmg2gkyrg1, respectively, the 13C-DIC gradient was 5.6g‰gmg1, and Mn2+ reduction terminated within 1.3gm of the seafloor. These are among the first pore water results generated from this vast climatically sensitive region, and they imply that abundant CH4, including gas hydrates, do not characterize the East Siberian Sea slope or rise along the investigated depth transects.

Given the pore-scale nature of chemical reactions, we took a digital rock physics approach. Tight carbonate mudstone was imaged using X-ray microcomputed tomography. We simulated calcite dissolution using a phenomenological numerical model that stands from experimental and microstructural observations under transport-limited reaction conditions. Fluid flow was simulated using the lattice-Boltzmann method, and the pore wall was adaptively eroded at a rate determined by the local surface area and velocity magnitude, which we use in place of solvent flux. We identified preexisting, high-conductivity fluid pathways imprinted in the initial microstructure. Though these pathways comprise a subset of the total connected porosity, they accommodated 80 to 99% of the volumetric flux through the digital sample and localized dissolution. Porosity-permeability evolution exhibited two stages: selective widening of narrow pore throats that comprised preferential pathways and development and widening of channels. We quantitatively monitored attributes of the pore geometry, namely, porosity, specific surface area, tortuosity, and average hydraulic diameter, which we qualitatively linked to permeability. This study gives a pore-scale perspective on the microstructural origins of laboratory permeability-porosity trends of tight carbonates undergoing transport-limited reaction with CO2-rich fluid. ©2017.

Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain this shift: (1) massive evaporite deposition associated with rifting during opening of the South Atlantic and (2) increased inputs of volcanically derived sulfur due to eruption of large igneous provinces. Each process produces a very different impact on marine sulfate concentrations, which in turn affects several biogeochemical phenomena that regulate the global carbon cycle and climate. Here we present sulfur isotope data from Resolution Guyot, Mid-Pacific Mountains (North Pacific Ocean), that track sympathetically with strontium isotope records through the ~5‰ negative sulfur isotope shift. We employ a linked sulfur-strontium isotope mass-balance model to identify the mechanisms driving the sulfur isotope evolution of the Cretaceous ocean. The model only reproduces the coupled negative sulfur and strontium isotope shifts when both hydrothermal and weathering fluxes increase. Our results indicate that marine sulfate concentrations increased significantly during the negative sulfur isotope shift and that enhanced hydrothermal and weathering input fluxes to the ocean played a dominant role in regulating the marine sulfur cycle and CO2 exchange in the atmosphere-ocean system during this interval of rapid biogeochemical change. © 2017 Geological Society of America.",,"Biogeochemistry; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Deposition; Igneous rocks; Isotopes; Oceanography; Strontium; Sulfur compounds; Weathering; Atmosphere-ocean system; Chemical evolution; Early Cretaceous; Global carbon cycle; Large igneous provinces; North Pacific Ocean; Strontium isotopes; Sulfate concentrations; Sulfur; biogeochemistry; concentration (composition); Cretaceous; evaporite; isotopic composition; paleoceanography; sulfate; sulfur isotope; volcanism; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (South); Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017564119

Reducing these impacts is crucial, but production-based frameworks of carbon measurement and mitigation—which encompass only a limited part of cities’ carbon footprints—are much more developed and widely applied than consumption-based approaches that consider the embedded carbon effectively imported into a city. Frequently, therefore, cities are left blind to the importance of their wider consumption-related climate impacts, while at the same time left lacking effective tools to reduce them. To explore the relevance of these issues, we implement methodologies for assessing production- and consumption-based emissions at the city-level and estimate the associated emissions trajectories for Bristol, a major UK city, from 2000 to 2035. We develop mitigation scenarios targeted at reducing the former, considering potential energy, carbon and financial savings in each case. We then compare these mitigation potentials with local government ambitions and Bristol’s consumption-based emissions trajectory. Our results suggest that the city’s consumption-based emissions are three times the production-based emissions, largely due to the impacts of imported food and drink. We find that low-carbon investments of circa £3 billion could reduce production-based emissions by 25% in 2035. However, we also find that this represents <10% of Bristol’s forecast consumption-based emissions for 2035 and is approximately equal to the mitigation achievable by eliminating the city’s current levels of food waste. Such observations suggest that incorporating consumption-based emission statistics into cities’ accounting and decision-making processes could uncover largely unrecognised opportunities for mitigation that are likely to be essential for achieving deep decarbonisation. © 2017, The Author(s).","Carbon footprint; Cities; Climate policy; Consumption-based emissions; Mitigation; Sustainable consumption",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011604860

In this study we use magnetostratigraphy and astrochronology to establish a chronostratigraphic framework for the excursion. Paleomagnetic and isotopic results from the Flinders Ranges, South Australia, and from Death Valley, California (USA), demonstrate that the nadir of the excursion is coincident with a correlative polarity transition at each locality, suggesting global synchroneity. Rock magnetic cyclostratigraphy yields an astrochronologic estimate of ~8 m.y. for the excursion's duration at both locations.

Therefore when UBC is present, AEAs tend to adsorb into these carbon surfaces instead of generating air voids that result in premature concrete failures. For this reason, fly ash sources with high amounts of residual carbon are rendered unusable in concrete. Technologies to remove residual carbon or neutralize its effects have been developed and deployed for nearly two decades in order to provide fly ash that does not interfere with air entrainment in concrete.Recent changes in environmental regulations have increased the need to either remove or neutralize the effects of carbon in ash. The US Environmental Protection Agency's Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) final rule was enacted in Dec. 2011 and required coal-fueled power plants to control mercury emissions by Apr. 2015. States were allowed to grant 1-year extensions, and certain critical units are allowed to delay compliance until 2017 by an EPA administrative order.Power plant owners have undertaken a variety of strategies for MATS compliance, including switching fuel, sorbent injections, and changing operations of existing emissions control equipment such as flue-gas desulphurization scrubbers. A major compliance strategy involves the injection of powdered activated carbon (PAC) into flue-gas streams. PAC acts as a sorbent to capture mercury; however, this type of carbon is highly reactive and more adsorptive than residual unburned or ""native"" carbon. Thus amounts as small as 1% of fly ash can have a significant impact on its adsorption potential, which can create a barrier for fly ash use in concrete.Chemical passivation is an effective way to neutralize the effects of residual unburned and activated carbon in ash. The concept involves adding a sacrificial agent to the ash to mitigate carbon adsorption properties. In addition to the sacrificial agent, the technology also requires accurate reagent dosing equipment, testing, and diagnostic methods for determining appropriate reagent dosage and quality control (QC). Passivation reagents are selected for their great affinity to adsorb on activated carbon and to minimize their impact on ash use in concrete. When applied to fly ash, the reagent saturates the activated carbon surfaces with a sacrificial agent to prevent the carbon from attracting AEAs used in concrete. The treatment process, typically installed at the power plant, provides an accurate and uniform distribution of reagent to assure consistent treatment of fly ash. Automation of the treatment system can reduce the potential for operator error. Robust testing methods to measure the adsorption potential of ash containing PAC are needed to determine the reagent dosage, QC, and quality assurance (QA) of treated ash. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Using findings from a qualitative study, it demonstrates how smallholders in Bangladesh currently experience climate change through their everyday agricultural practices, and how climate change along with the ecosystem destruction from modern farming technologies adversely affects their livelihoods. Drawing on the recent literature on sustainable adaptation, this paper argues that any agricultural adaptation strategy in Bangladesh must analyse the vulnerabilities of farming communities at the intersection of their geographically specific exposure to climatic threats, the extent of their market participation and the socioecological implications of their technology adoption. It concludes that an eventual departure from the current rice monoculture pivoted on chemical dependence and an excessive use of natural resources is the prerequisite for a sustainable agricultural adaptation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bangladesh; climate resilient cultivars; smallholder agriculture; sustainable adaptation; technological optimism","adaptive management; agricultural management; agricultural practice; climate change; environmental policy; monoculture; optimization; participatory approach; smallholder; sustainability; technological change; vulnerability; Bangladesh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961207895

In the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Rubisco preferentially relocalises to the pyrenoid during CCM induction and pyrenoid-less mutants lack a functioning CCM and grow very poorly at low CO2. The aim of this study was to investigate the CO2 response of pyrenoid-positive (pyr+) and pyrenoid-negative (pyr-) mutant strains to determine the effect of pyrenoid absence on CCM induction and gene expression. Shotgun proteomic analysis of low-CO2-Adapted strains showed reduced accumulation of some CCM-related proteins, suggesting that pyr- has limited capacity to respond to low-CO2 conditions. Comparisons between gene transcription and protein expression revealed potential regulatory interactions, since Rubisco protein linker (EPYC1) protein did not accumulate in pyr- despite increased transcription, while elements of the LCIB/LCIC complex were also differentially expressed. Furthermore, pyr-showed altered abundance of a number of proteins involved in primary metabolism, perhaps due to the failure to adapt to low CO2.

Guava has well established markets in more than 60 countries. The top ten guava producers in the world are India, China, Thailand, Pakistan, Mexico, Indonesia, Brazil, Bangladesh, Philippines and Nigeria. Guava bear fruits at different times of the year. However, harvesting all the crops in small amount is not profitable, In India, maximum fruiting is found in the rainy season which are poor in quality due to high water content and severely attacked by fruit fly while the winter harvested fruits are superior in quality having good market demand. Cycling of crop to avoid rainy season crop and increasing winter crop is possible. Cycling of crop by using different methods of flower regulation, it is possible to harvest guava round-the-year. The method(s) to be followed for crop regulation depend on climatic factors, cropping pattern, market and industry demand, cultivar, etc. The different methods used for crop cycling are a) water management to induce stress, b) pruning of shoots at different levels and at different times, c) training (bending) of shoots, and d) manual or chemical thinning of flowers. Spraying of different bioregulators (naphthaleneacetic acid, naphthalene acetamide, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, etc.), chemicals (4,6-dintro-o-cresol, potassium iodide, urea, etc.) at different concentrations were found effective in deblossoming and regulation of cropping. Crop cycling for round-the-year harvest is possible by pruning of shoots at different times of the year.

The carbonation rate was more strongly correlated with Ca/(Si + Al) of calcium silicate hydrates (CSH) than with Ca/Si, with the rate being higher with a decrease in Ca/(Si + Al). Carbonation reduced the porosity but increased large-diameter pores, and a mixture with a higher carbonation rate showed more significant coarsening of pores. It was also found that different reactions occurred in different region of the paste. A mechanism was suggested whereby CSH in the inner products is strongly affected by carbonation to decompose to an amorphous silica gel, with the released Ca transferring out of the grains to form CaCO3. In the outer products, the Ca/Si of CSH was reduced by carbonation similarly to the inner products, but the decomposition did not proceed to a silica gel as long as Ca(OH)2 remained to be present. © 2017 The Ceramic Society of Japan.

This survey investigates alternative fuel blends used in a state-of-the-art EURO 6 diesel engine with different shares of biomass to liquid, hydrotreated vegetable oils and fatty acid methyl ester, which present a possibility to meet these requirements. In particular, the reduction of particulate matter and, as a result, the possibility to reduce nitrogen oxides emissions holds remarkable potential for the application of synthetic fuels in diesel engines. The investigated fuel blends generally demonstrate good applicability when used in the test engine with standard settings. Adaptions to engine parameters (e.g., injection timing or exhaust gas recirculation) hold further potential. With respect to the EU’s targeted 10% bio-quota by 2020 two ternary fuel blends containing conventional diesel fuel, fatty acid methyl ester and biomass to liquid or hydrotreated vegetable oils were also tested and featured excellent performance in terms of emissions and efficiency. © 2017 SAE International.",,"Automobile drivers; Biomass; Diesel engines; Esters; Exhaust gas recirculation; Fuel economy; Liquids; Nitrogen oxides; Synthetic fuels; Vegetable oils; Biomass To Liquid; Driving performance; Emission legislation; Fatty acid methyl ester; Injection timing; Nitrogen oxides emission; Particulate Matter; Reducing emissions; Fatty acids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018242249

Three types of local Australian biodiesel namely macadamia biodiesel (MB) were used for this study, and the data was compared with conventional diesel fuel (B0). Performance results showed that the addition of butanol with diesel-biodiesel blends slightly lowers the brake power (BP), increases brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and brake specific energy consumption (BSEC). The emission study revealed that the addition of butanol additive with diesel-biodiesel blends reduces carbon monoxides (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM) emission than macadamia-diesel blends and diesel (B0) fuel. Finally, 5% butanol can be added to local Australian biodiesel-diesel blends to lower the NOx and PM emission. © 2017 IEEE.","alternative fuel; biodiesel; butanol; diesel engine; transportation sector","Alternative fuels; Biodiesel; Brakes; Butenes; Carbon; Carbon monoxide; Diesel fuels; Energy utilization; Engine cylinders; Engines; Fuel consumption; Fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Bio-diesel blends; Bio-diesel fuel; Brake specific fuel consumption; Naturally aspirated; Particulate matter emissions; Performance and emissions; Specific energy consumption; Transportation sector; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025117005

High-precision maps of auroral H3 + densities, temperatures, and radiances reveal significant variabilities in those parameters, with regions of enhanced density and emission accompanied by reduced temperature. Juno magnetometer data, combined with solar wind propagation models, suggest that a shock may have impacted Jupiter in the days preceding the observation interval but that the solar wind was quiescent thereafter. Auroral H3 + temperatures reveal a downward temporal trend, consistent with a slowly cooling upper atmosphere, such as might follow a period of shock recovery. The brightest H3 + emissions are from the end of the period, 23 April. A lack of definitive signatures in the upstream interplanetary magnetic field lends supporting evidence to the possibility that this brightening event may have been driven by internal magnetospheric processes. ©2017.

While small mammalian herbivores, such as rodents, are typically inconspicuous, their impacts on plant community structure and chemistry can be large. We used a small mammal exclosure experiment to explore whether rodents in a southeastern old field directly altered the aboveground plant species composition and chemistry, and indirectly altered the belowground soil community composition and activity. In general, when rodents were excluded, C3 graminoids increased in cover and biomass, contributing toward a shift in plant species composition relative to plots where rodents were present. The plant community chemistry also shifted; plant fiber concentration and carbon : nitrogen were higher, whereas plant nitrogen concentration was lower in exclosure plots relative to access plots. While microbial community enzyme activity increased when rodents were excluded, no significant changes in the fungal : bacterial or potential nitrogen mineralization occurred between treatments. Our results show that rodents can rapidly influence aboveground plant community composition and chemistry, but their influence on belowground processes may require plant inputs to the soil to accumulate over longer periods of time. © 2017 Moorhead et al.","Aboveground; Belowground; Communities; Ecosystem function; Foliar chemistry; Nitrogen mineralization; Plant chemistry; Plant-animal interactions; Rodent herbivory; Soil microbes; Species composition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019932187

Although numerous studies report increased mortality associated with extreme heat events, quantifying the global risk of heat-related mortality remains challenging due to a lack of comparable data on heat-related deaths. Here we conducted a global analysis of documented lethal heat events to identify the climatic conditions associated with human death and then quantified the current and projected occurrence of such deadly climatic conditions worldwide. We reviewed papers published between 1980 and 2014, and found 783 cases of excess human mortality associated with heat from 164 cities in 36 countries. Based on the climatic conditions of those lethal heat events, we identified a global threshold beyond which daily mean surface air temperature and relative humidity become deadly. Around 30% of the world's population is currently exposed to climatic conditions exceeding this deadly threshold for at least 20 days a year. By 2100, this percentage is projected to increase to -1/448% under a scenario with drastic reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and -1/474% under a scenario of growing emissions. An increasing threat to human life from excess heat now seems almost inevitable, but will be greatly aggravated if greenhouse gases are not considerably reduced. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Results reveal an outdoor nighttime warming effect of not more than 0.2 °C which is most obvious with the semi-extensive while the outdoor and indoor cooling effect ranges between 0.05–0.6 °C and 0.4–1.4 °C, respectively depending on the green-roof type, urban density and time of the day. These daytime temperature reductions also vary per prevailing climates and follow this order: hot-dry, hot (or warm)-humid, and temperate which can be explained by the interplay between solar intensity/air temperature and relative humidity between the regions. In a hot-humid region, the evaporative cooling potential of greenery is dampened when compared to hot-dry region. This is also true for region with low solar intensity and humidity like the temperate region. In terms of cooling demand reduction, 5.2% was observed in hot-dry climate on the hottest day of the year with full-intensive green-roof while the least saving of 0.1% was found with semi-extensive green-roof in temperate climate.

However, consumers employ these distributed energy systems based on individual decisions rather than top-down installation planning, so even if the expansion of PV and other renewable energy sources is a national energy policy, it remains uncertain how and when PV installation targets will be realized. Furthermore, when consumers extensively deploy distributed energy systems, the power-expansion planning of utilities will be affected by changes in daily load patterns. In this paper, the authors develop a two-stage model focusing on interactions between the energy system adoption behavior of customers and power-expansion planning of a utility. In the first stage, the authors disaggregate Japan's Kanto region into 38 areas and then develop an optimum energy system model including PV and CGS for consumers. In the second stage, the demand for electric power from the utility is transferred to the power-expansion planning model of the Tokyo Electric Power Company. The authors observe how well the results for PV penetration agree with the cost and the market projection scenarios given by governmental plans. The effects of subsidy scenarios for PV are also evaluated. The authors find that PV penetration will not meet installation targets unless additional PV promotion policies are implemented. The power-expansion model in Stage 2 shows how consumer behavior affects long-term expansion. These findings suggest the need for an integrated energy policy promoting a low-carbon society. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Carbon; Consumer behavior; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Expansion; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Cogeneration systems; Distributed energy systems; Expansion planning; Low-carbon societies; National energy policy; Renewable energy source; Tokyo electric power companies; Two stage approach; Electric power system planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010514165

While many European coal-fired power plants have been transitioning to wood pellets to abate carbon dioxide emissions, such a changeover has not occurred in the United States electricity sector. This analysis examines the environmental implications of co-firing coal and wood pellets in the Southeastern United States, where the vast majority of wood pellet exports to Europe originate. Utilizing primary data from existing wood pellet manufacturers, a life cycle inventory is presented that characterizes the full cradle-to-grave environmental performance of co-firing coal and wood pellets for electricity generation. Furthermore, the avoided life cycle emissions related to shipping wood pellets to Europe are calculated. Life cycle assessment modeling scenarios for co-firing wood pellets in existing coal-fired power plants within the Southeastern United States result in reductions in eight of nine impact categories. The results presented here indicate that co-firing with wood pellets could be a viable interim solution for the aging fleet of coal-fired power plants within the Southeastern United States, particularly if stricter emission regulations and renewable portfolio standards are implemented. © 2017","Bioenergy; Industrial ecology; Life cycle assessment; Sustainable systems; Thermoelectric power generation","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Electric industry; Environmental management; Global warming; Life cycle; Mining; Pelletizing; Thermoelectric power; Wood; Bio-energy; Environmental implications; Environmental performance; Industrial ecology; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle assessment model; Renewable portfolio standard; Sustainable systems; Fossil fuel power plants; Coal; Life Cycle Assessment; Pellets; Power Generation; Power Plants; Southeastern USA; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015985164

Shifts in phenology and range affect not only individual plant and pollinator species but also interactions among them, with possible negative consequences for both parties due to unfavorable abiotic conditions or mismatches caused by differences in shift magnitude or direction. Ultimately, population extinctions and reductions in pollination services could occur as a result of these climate change-induced shifts, or plants and pollinators could be buffered by plastic or genetic responses or novel interactions. Either scenario will likely involve altered selection pressures, making an understanding of plasticity and local adaptation in space and time especially important. In this review, we discuss two methods for studying plant-pollinator interactions under climate change: spatial and temporal transplants, both of which offer insight into whether plants and pollinators will be able to adapt to novel conditions. We discuss the advantages and limitations of each method and the future possibilities for this area of study. We advocate for consideration of how joint shifts in both dimensions might affect plant-pollinator interactions and point to key insights that can be gained with experimental transplants. © 2017 Morton and Rafferty.

The proper methods of its cultivation are yet to be fully explored, although it has numerous economic benefits, can be easily propagated and is adaptive to a wide range of climatic and soil conditions in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. About 45% of the agricultural land in Saudi Arabia is arid. The soils are calcareous, sandy, with a low fertility level and a very low organic matter content. They have a low water holding capacity and high infiltration and evaporation rates and thus the productivity on these soils is limited. Because of insufficient growth of moringa in Saudi Arabia, the methods of green cultivation with microbial inoculants (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, P-solubilizing microorganisms, Trichoderma, Azotobacter, Azospirillum, etc.), organic fertilizers, and mycotrophic green manure plants should be explored for successful plantation to enhance product quality and yield of moringa grown on arid agricultural land in Saudi Arabia. Organic matter will improve the physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil, while mycotrophic green manure plants and beneficial soil microorganisms can help increase plant growth by improving uptake of nutrients, and alleviating stresses like drought, salinity, heavy metal contamination, high temperatures for seedling establishment, disease control, soil aggregate structure, and reducing soil erosion. In Saudi Arabia and other Middle East countries, Moringa peregrina is a native species adapted to harsh climatic conditions. The plantation of this species may be extended to other parts of the Kingdom. Another widely cultivated species (M. oleifera Lam.) may be introduced by following green cultivation methods to minimize desertification under changing climatic conditions and to improve environmental conditions of the country.","Green cultivation; Moringa; Saudi Arabia",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019859013

For truck applications, which are currently responsible for nearly three-quarters of the total U.S. freight energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, platooning has been identified as an early feature for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) that could provide significant fuel savings and improved traffic safety and efficiency without radical design or technology changes compared to existing vehicles. A statistical analysis was performed based on a large collection of real-world U.S. truck usage data to estimate the fraction of total miles that are technically suitable for platooning. In particular, our analysis focuses on estimating “platoonable” mileage based on overall highway vehicle use and prolonged high-velocity traveling, and established that about 65% of the total miles driven by combination trucks from this data sample could be driven in platoon formation, leading to a 4% reduction in total truck fuel consumption. This technical potential for “platoonable” miles in the United States provides an upper bound for scenario analysis considering fleet willingness and convenience to platoon as an estimate of overall benefits of early adoption of connected and automated vehicle technologies. A benefit analysis is proposed to assess the overall potential for energy savings and emissions mitigation by widespread implementation of highway platooning for trucks. © 2017 SAE International.",,"Accident prevention; Automation; Automobiles; Energy conservation; Fleet operations; Fuel economy; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Highway accidents; Highway engineering; Safety engineering; Traffic control; Transportation; Trucks; Vehicles; Freight transportation; Automated vehicles; Emissions mitigation; Road transportation; Scenario analysis; Smart technology; Technical potential; Technology change; Vehicle automations; Benefit analysis; Freight transportation; Vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039073767

The two constructs, modernism and climate responsive design, became conflated in the haste to isolate a distinctive architectural identity for Queensland. A suppression of complexities has seen climate zone boundaries collapse into state boundaries and the architecture of tropical and subtropical zones illustrated with work predominantly located in the populous southeast corner. Climate, whilst defined very loosely, is usually addressed empirically in explanations about design processes and outcomes with little consideration given to the variety of ways that climate might inform a culture of architecture. Together with the frequency and range of situations labelled “sub-tropical,” these issues challenge the usefulness of climate as a critical tool for assessing the development of Queensland architecture. This paper evaluates the significance of climate to the consolidation of modern architecture in Queensland and tests the veracity of claims for a subtropical modernism there. It uses the writing and built work of renowned Brisbane architect, artist, essayist, correspondent, John Dalton (1927–2007), as a reference point for revealing tensions in local approaches to climate responsiveness and regional design. Dalton was conscious of the possibilities for a distinctively Queensland culture of modern architecture and his built work demonstrates the development of a set of private theories and practices that defy the reduction favoured by discourse, between modernist and regionalist thinking. © 2017 The Society of Architectural Historians, Australia and New Zealand.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020012100

Although a number of studies have been conducted on gender and CC, information on gender inequality and CC adaptation strategies, particularly in Tanzania, is still limited. This chapter aims to first, identify CC adaptation strategies in the study area; second, examine gender inequality in terms of division of labor, resource ownership, and decision-making; and third, determine how gender inequality affects CC adaptation strategies. The chapter is based on a study conducted in Kilosa District in Tanzania, which adopted a cross-sectional research design. Primary data were collected from 50 respondents using a structured questionnaire and a checklist of questions for focus group discussions. Desk review of various documents was employed in collecting secondary data. It was found that various adaptation strategies were used by the pastoralists to adapt to CC impacts. It was also found that gender inequality in the study area made it difficult to implement various CC adaptation measures. It is recommended that gender-sensitive policies and strategies on household division of labor, resource ownership, and decision-making are required to enhance women's CC adaptive capacity. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, there is need to determine the implication of the transforming urban landscapes on urban micro-climate to optimise urban land uses and to effectively mitigate adverse impacts. In this study, we aimed at assessing micro-climate forcing of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes in the heterogeneous Harare Metropolitan City, Zimbabwe, between 1984 and 2015. To achieve this objective, the transformation of major LULCs within the city was determined and relative brightness temperature used to assess long-term thermal changes in the city. Results show that coverage of high density residential areas increased by 92% between 1984 and 2016 at the expense of cooler green-spaces, which decreased by 75.5%. This translated to a 0.98 °C and 1.98 °C temperature increase, attributed to LULC changes alone and to all factors that include greenhouse effect and ozone depletion respectively. Results also show that converting bare areas to water bodies reduced surface temperatures by 4.5 °C, while the construction of low-to-medium density residential areas reduced bare surface temperatures by 3.78 °C. Conversion of green-spaces to low-medium residential areas increased temperatures by 0.16 °C. Overall, conversion of LULC types contributed more than 0.5 °C thermal elevation within the city, largely attributed to increases in built-up areas and reduction in heat mitigating green-spaces. These findings offer insight into landscape surface energy balance changes arising from urbanization, critical for urban planning, environmental governance as well and climate change management in cities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Green-spaces; Land-use-land-cover; Remote sensing; Temperature increases; Urban heat island; Urbanization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017430696

By analyzing long-term data from 110 mountainous streams draining into German drinking water reservoirs, nitrate concentrations indeed declined in the majority of catchments. Furthermore, our meta-analysis indicates that the declining nitrate levels are linked to the release of dissolved iron to streams likely due to a reductive dissolution of iron(III) minerals in riparian wetland soils. This dissolution process mobilized adsorbed compounds, such as phosphate, dissolved organic carbon and arsenic, resulting in concentration increases in the streams and higher inputs to receiving drinking water reservoirs. Reductive mobilization was most significant in catchments with stream nitrate concentrations &lt;6 mg L−1. Here, nitrate, as a competing electron acceptor, was too low in concentration to inhibit microbial iron(III) reduction. Consequently, observed trends were strongest in forested catchments, where nitrate concentrations were unaffected by agricultural and urban sources and which were therefore sensitive to reductions of atmospheric nitrogen depositions. We conclude that there is strong evidence that the decline in nitrogen deposition toward pre-industrial conditions lowers the redox buffer in riparian soils, destabilizing formerly fixed problematic compounds, and results in serious implications for water quality. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","atmospheric deposition; carbon cycle; nitrogen biogeochemistry; organic matter; riparian zone; streamwater chemistry","atmospheric deposition; carbon cycle; concentration (composition); mountain stream; nitrogen; organic carbon; organic matter; phosphate; riparian zone; streamwater; water chemistry; Germany; carbon; ferric ion; nitrogen; phosphate; environmental monitoring; Germany; industry; meta analysis; river; water supply; Carbon; Environmental Monitoring; Ferric Compounds; Germany; Industry; Nitrogen; Phosphates; Rivers; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990066683

They play an important role in Arctic wetland ecosystems by regulating carbon, water, and energy fluxes and providing freshwater habitats. However, ponds, i.e., waterbodies with surface areas smaller than 1. 0 × 104ĝ€m2, have not been inventoried on global and regional scales. The Permafrost Region Pond and Lake (PeRL) database presents the results of a circum-Arctic effort to map ponds and lakes from modern (2002-2013) high-resolution aerial and satellite imagery with a resolution of 5ĝ€m or better. The database also includes historical imagery from 1948 to 1965 with a resolution of 6ĝ€m or better. PeRL includes 69 maps covering a wide range of environmental conditions from tundra to boreal regions and from continuous to discontinuous permafrost zones. Waterbody maps are linked to regional permafrost landscape maps which provide information on permafrost extent, ground ice volume, geology, and lithology. This paper describes waterbody classification and accuracy, and presents statistics of waterbody distribution for each site. Maps of permafrost landscapes in Alaska, Canada, and Russia are used to extrapolate waterbody statistics from the site level to regional landscape units. PeRL presents pond and lake estimates for a total area of 1. 4 × 106ĝ€km2 across the Arctic, about 17ĝ€% of the Arctic lowland ( &lt; ĝ€300ĝ€mĝ€a.s.l.) land surface area. PeRL waterbodies with sizes of 1. 0 × 106ĝ€m2 down to 1. 0 × 102ĝ€m2 contributed up to 21ĝ€% to the total water fraction. Waterbody density ranged from 1. 0 × 10 to 9. 4 × 101ĝ€kmĝ'2. Ponds are the dominant waterbody type by number in all landscapes representing 45-99ĝ€% of the total waterbody number. The implementation of PeRL size distributions in land surface models will greatly improve the investigation and projection of surface inundation and carbon fluxes in permafrost lowlands.

However, there is a lack of on-the-ground forest adaptation research to indicate what adaptation measures or tactics might be effective in preparing forest ecosystems to deal with climate change. Natural resource managers in many areas are also challenged by scant locally or regionally relevant information on climate projections and potential impacts. The Adaptive Silviculture for Climate Change (ASCC) project was designed to respond to these barriers to operationalizing climate adaptation strategies by providing a multiregion network of replicated operational-scale research sites testing ecosystem-specific climate change adaptation treatments across a gradient of adaptive approaches, and introducing conceptual tools and processes to integrate climate change considerations into management and silvicultural decisionmaking. Here we present the framework of the ASCC project, highlight the implementation process at two of the study sites, and discuss the contributions of this collaborative science-management partnership. © 2017, Society of American Foresters.

Here, we demonstrate an approach to concurrently survey the archaea alongside the bacteria with high-resolution 16S rRNA gene sequencing, linking these community data to geochemical parameters. We applied this integrated analysis to hydric soils sampled across a model methane-emitting freshwater wetland. Geochemical profiles, archaeal communities, and bacterial communities were independently correlated with soil depth and water cover. Centimeters of soil depth and corresponding geochemical shifts consistently affected microbial community structure more than hundreds of meters of lateral distance. Methanogens with diverse metabolisms were detected across the wetland, but displayed surprising OTU-level partitioning by depth. Candidatus Methanoperedens spp. archaea thought to perform anaerobic oxidation of methane linked to iron reduction were abundant. Domain-specific sequencing also revealed unexpectedly diverse non-methane-cycling archaeal members. OTUs within the underexplored Woesearchaeota and Bathyarchaeota were prevalent across the wetland, with subgroups and individual OTUs exhibiting distinct occupancy and abundance distributions aligned with environmental gradients. This study adds to our understanding of ecological range for key archaeal taxa in a model freshwater wetland, and links these taxa and individual OTUs to hypotheses about processes governing biogeochemical cycling. © 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"archaeal DNA; bacterial DNA; fresh water; iron; methane; RNA 16S; soil; archaeon; bacterium; biodiversity; classification; genetics; high throughput sequencing; metabolism; microbial consortium; microbiology; oxidation reduction reaction; soil; wetland; Archaea; Bacteria; Biodiversity; DNA, Archaeal; DNA, Bacterial; Fresh Water; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Iron; Methane; Microbial Consortia; Oxidation-Reduction; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016440492

Well-constrained sea level projections are needed to estimate future losses from SLR and benefits of climate protection and adaptation. Process-based models that are designed to resolve the underlying physics of individual sea level drivers form the basis for state-of-The-Art sea level projections. However, associated computational costs allow for only a small number of simulations based on selected scenarios that often vary for different sea level components. This approach does not sufficiently support sea level impact science and climate policy analysis, which require a sea level projection methodology that is flexible with regard to the climate scenario yet comprehensive and bound by the physical constraints provided by process-based models. To fill this gap, we present a sea level model that emulates global-mean long-Term process-based model projections for all major sea level components. Thermal expansion estimates are calculated with the hemispheric upwelling-diffusion ocean component of the simple carbon-cycle climate model MAGICC, which has been updated and calibrated against CMIP5 ocean temperature profiles and thermal expansion data. Global glacier contributions are estimated based on a parameterization constrained by transient and equilibrium process-based projections. Sea level contribution estimates for Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are derived from surface mass balance and solid ice discharge parameterizations reproducing current output from ice-sheet models. The land water storage component replicates recent hydrological modeling results. For 2100, we project 0.35 to 0.56ĝ€-m (66ĝ€-% range) total SLR based on the RCP2.6 scenario, 0.45 to 0.67ĝ€-m for RCP4.5, 0.46 to 0.71ĝ€-m for RCP6.0, and 0.65 to 0.97ĝ€-m for RCP8.5. These projections lie within the range of the latest IPCC SLR estimates. SLR projections for 2300 yield median responses of 1.02ĝ€-m for RCP2.6, 1.76ĝ€-m for RCP4.5, 2.38ĝ€-m for RCP6.0, and 4.73ĝ€-m for RCP8.5. The MAGICC sea level model provides a flexible and efficient platform for the analysis of major scenario, model, and climate uncertainties underlying long-Term SLR projections. It can be used as a tool to directly investigate the SLR implications of different mitigation pathways and may also serve as input for regional SLR assessments via component-wise sea level pattern scaling. © Author(s) 2017.

Understanding the growth habit of trees under hostile environmental conditions and their capacity to sequester CO2 is of great interest for forestry scientists. The main objectives of the study were to analyze the growth habit of Eucalyptus camaldulensis on sandy marginal lands, assess the tree carbon stocks on sandy soils and to examine the potential of study area to play a role in environmental improvement while reducing the atmospheric CO2. The study was carried out in Noorpur Thal region of Punjab. A survey of the study area was carried out through a pre-tested questionnaire and measurements of trees were taken in situ to calculate the biomass and carbon stocks. It was found that 19.47% of the Noorpur Thal region was covered by Eucalyptus plantations while this area can be potentially covered up to 55%. The growth habit and biomass production of Eucalyptus camaldulensis trees was excellent when grown on marginal sandy soils with proper irrigation. The total carbon stocks present were about 1.80 Mega ton and the CO2 sequestration rate was observed about 6.58 Mega ton year-1. However, at 55% potential, this area can sequester the 18.59 Mega ton of C worth about US$ 1459.315 million. This study might be extended to quantify the CO2 sequestration potential if further 6.5 million hectares saline and waterlogged marginal lands are afforested in Pakistan with Eucalyptus camaldulensis plantations. © 2017, University of Agriculture.

Temporally, adaptation strategies and policies have to address potential impacts in both the short- and long term, whereas spatially, place-based and context-specific adaptations are essential. To help inform decision-making on climate change adaptation, this study adopted a bottom-up approach to assess local climate vulnerability and winegrowers’ adaptive processes in two regulated wine-producing areas in the Anjou-Saumur wine growing sub-region, France. The data used for this study were collected through individual semi-structured interviews with 30 winegrowers. With a focus on wine quality, climate-related exposure, and sensitivity were dependent on many contextual factors (e.g., northern geographical position, wine regulatory frameworks, local environmental features) interacting with the regional oceanic climate. Climate and other non-climate-related variables brought about important changes in winegrowers’ management practices, varying in time and space. This ongoing process in decision-making enhanced winegrowers’ adaptive responses, which were primarily reactive (e.g., harvesting, winemaking) or anticipatory (e.g., canopy and soil management) to short-term climate conditions. Winegrowers described changing trends in climate- and grapevine (Vitis) -related variables, with the latter attributed to regional climate changes and evolving management practices. Regarding future climate trends, winegrowers’ displayed great uncertainty, placing the most urgent adaptation priority on short-term strategies, while changing grapevine varieties and using irrigation were identified as last resort strategies. The study concluded by discussing the implications of these findings in the context of climate change adaptation in viticulture. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Adaptation; Climate change; Contextual; Loire valley; Perceptions; Viticulture; Vulnerability","adaptive management; assessment method; climate change; decision making; environmental conditions; management practice; perception; vine; viticulture; vulnerability; France; Loire Valley; Vitis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957601846

Accordingly, this article seeks to highlight the importance of a resource-efficient built environment, which enables required functions to be delivered with less assets, and to put forward an approach toward this objective. In this regard, the circular economy (CE) concept seeks to extract more value from resources by using them for as long as possible, thereby increasing economic prosperity and employment while reducing waste, greenhouse emissions, and pollution. Thus far, application of CE principles has largely concentrated on the industrial sector, such as through industrial symbiosis and its extension to urban symbiosis/metabolism. Their application to cities and, in particular, the built environment has been limited and the body of literature is relatively undeveloped. Insight is offered into how this field of research might be developed and applied to enable a more resource-efficient, low-carbon built environment with socioeconomic benefits. It reviews literature on the CE and industrial ecology, their application to industrial and urban contexts, and the gaps pertaining to the building sector. A proposition for extending research and its application to the built environment is then put forward, encapsulated in a conceptual model. This is seen as an important first step in influencing policy makers and repositioning resource efficiency firmly on the sustainable and carbon neutral building agenda. © 2017 by Yale University","asset management; carbon neutrality; circular economy; industrial ecology; sustainable development; urban development","Asset management; Ecology; Economics; Efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial economics; Intelligent buildings; Urban growth; Carbon neutralities; Circular economy; Industrial ecology; Low carbon built environments; Resource efficiencies; Socio-economic benefits; Sustainable building; Urban development; Sustainable development; conceptual framework; emission control; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; industrial ecology; policy making; socioeconomic impact; sustainable development; urban development; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018639642

Two specific shortcomings are identified: (1) incoherence between existing forestry policy instruments with regard to community forest concept and REDD+ rules and (2) locally over-constraining approaches used in forest management which would provide guidelines and caution about the REDD+ implementation. These shortcomings, if not considered, may lead to ineffectiveness of emission reduction programs as well as to social disconnection at the local level. This means that effective implementation of REDD+ will require further policy actions mainly dealing with actors' consents within developed equitable instruments while setting up efficient conflict management systems.","community rights; consents; effectiveness; institutions; stakeholders","community forestry; conflict management; conservation management; environmental degradation; environmental protection; forestry policy; institutional framework; learning; legal rights; policy implementation; reforestation; stakeholder; Cameroon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021435801

Viet Nam has a rich biodiversity and is also one of the most vulnerable countries impacted by climate change. Climate change policies have been adopted at national and local levels as well as by sector, making Viet Nam one of the nations to most systematically fulfill their obligation under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Consequently, we have used Viet Nam as a case study, to assess the integration of ecosystem-based approach to adaptation to climate change. We found that ecosystem-based adaptation is being implemented in some projects but, overall, is inadequately considered by Viet Nam’s climate change policies. Instead, policies predominantly rename infrastructure projects as climate change adaptation and focus on hard solutions for disaster reduction, rather than responding to long-term climate change through ecosystem-based adaptation. Moreover, ecosystem-based adaptation projects have focused on only a few relevant types of ecosystems. Viet Nam should revise its existing climate change policies and sectoral strategies to integrate ecosystem-based adaptation across different scales of governance. As other nations develop adaptation policies at different scales, the lesson from Viet Nam is that engineering measures need to be balanced with ecosystem-based adaptation for more affordable and effective responses to climate change. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,"Biodiversity; Cost effectiveness; Cost engineering; Ecology; Ecosystems; Environmental regulations; Global warming; Adaptation policies; Adaptation to climate changes; Climate change adaptation; Climate change policies; Cost-effective measures; Engineering measures; Infrastructure project; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Climate change; biodiversity; climate change; disaster management; environmental policy; governance approach; integrated approach; long-term change; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014892287

Dual-blend ethanol mandates, in which multiple ethanol blends are simultaneously available, are one way policy markers can move forward with more aggressive mandates more quickly. The recent ethanol mandate in the state of New South Wales, Australia offers a unique natural experiment to quantify the potential environmental benefits and costs of a dual blend ethanol policy. This paper estimates the impact on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from road-activity that are attributable to the implementation of the New South Wales ethanol requirements.

Data for use in the model was gathered from three wastewater treatment plants in Sweden. The evaluation showed that the introduction of microalgae could reduce electricity and heat consumption as well as CO2 emissions but would require large land areas. The study concludes that a 12-fold increase in the basin surface area would result in reductions of 26–35% in electricity consumption, 7–32% in heat consumption and 22–54% in carbon dioxide emissions. This process may be suitable for wastewater treatment plants in Nordic countries, where there is a higher organic load in summer than at other times of the year.

The paper describes a range of similarities between these two technologies in terms of scale, maturity, and costs, and in the way they represent possible solutions to the problem of climate change. However, the paper also describes enormous differences in government support towards full-scale demonstration. These differences are then explained in the analysis, which shows how different network structures facilitate different levels of access to the policy making process.

On the other hand, biomass combustion can contribute to inhalable particulate matter smaller than 10 micrometres (PM10) in the ambient air. Since PM10 can cause adverse health effects, a trade-off between CO2 mitigation and air pollution control can arise. To avoid this target conflict, measures ensuring low PM emissions from biomass combustion need to be identified and enforced. The present survey summarises the know-how on the health relevance of combustion generated PM, describes the mechanisms which can cause PM in biomass combustion, denotes the different particles types, and derives measures to reduce PM from biomass combustion. For this purpose, carbonaceous and inorganic pollutants as well as primary and secondary aerosols are distinguished. The overview shows, that a near-complete combustion is crucial to avoid organic pollutants, which is the main target for residential biomass combustion. Inorganic PM resulting from ash constituents and also formed in near-complete combustion is mainly relevant for automated biomass boilers and can be effectively reduced by particle precipitation from the flue gas. Hence biomass can play an important role to the future energy supply in an environmentally friendly way, if state-of-the art combustion devices are applied and appropriately operated. © 2017, ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

However, current understanding of institutions in adaptation situations is fragmented across the scientific community, evidence diverges, and cumulative learning beyond single studies is limited. This study adopts a diagnostic approach to elaborate a nuanced understanding of institutional barriers and opportunities in climate adaptation by means of a model-centred meta-analysis of 52 case studies of public climate adaptation in Europe. The first result is a novel taxonomy of institutional attributes in adaptation situations. It conceptually organises and decomposes the many details of institutions that empirical research has shown to shape climate adaptation. In the second step, the paper identifies archetypical patterns of institutional traps and trade-offs which hamper adaptation. Thirdly, corresponding opportunities are identified that enable actors to alleviate, prevent or overcome specific institutional traps or trade-offs. These results cast doubt on the validity of general institutional design principles for successful adaptation. In contrast to generic principles, the identified opportunities provide leverage to match institutions to specific governance problems that are encountered in specific contexts. Taken together, the results may contribute to more coherence and integration of adaptation research that we need if we are to foster learning about the role of institutions in adaptation situations in a cumulative fashion. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Archetypes; Climate change adaptation; Europe; Institutional diagnostics; Institutions; Meta-analysis; Model-centred","adaptive management; climate change; conceptual framework; empirical analysis; environmental planning; extreme event; institutional framework; interdisciplinary approach; learning; meta-analysis; trade-off; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958746031

The present study investigates how the ongoing forestation activities in West Africa may influence the characteristics of heatwaves over the region in the future. The study characterised heatwave using two metrics (excess heat factor (EHF), and a percentile based index (TXI)). A regional climate model (RegCM) is used to simulate characteristics of heatwave for the past (1970–2000) and future (2030–2060; IPCC RCP4.5) climates in West Africa with and without forestation of the Savannah zone (area between 8°N and 12°N). While RegCM gives a realistic simulation of extreme temperature thresholds (i.e. 95th percentile of daily mean temperature and 90th percentile of daily maximum temperature) and seasonal distribution of heatwave days, it fails to reproduce the spatial distribution of heatwave number, days and duration as in observation. Both heatwave indices (TXI and EHF) generally show similar patterns of heatwave characteristics over West Africa, except that heatwave number and days are substantially greater with TXI than with EHF. The results show that the RCP 4.5 emission scenario would induce longer and more frequent heatwave events and days over the whole region and that the increase of heatwave days is likely to occur in all months of the year.

Based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change methodology, VESTAP can be used to evaluate Korea's vulnerability to major climate impacts (including 32 conditions in 8 categories). VESTAP is based on RCP 4.5/8.5 scenarios and can provide evaluation results in 10-year intervals from the 2010s to 2040s. In addition, this paper presents the results of a case study using VESTAP for targeted assessment of health vulnerability to heat waves under the RCP 8.5 scenario for the 2040s. Through vulnerability assessment at the province level in South Korea, Daegu Metropolitan City was identified as the most vulnerable region. The municipality and submunicipality levels of Daegu were also assessed in separate stages. The results indicated that Pyeongni 3-Dong in Seo-Gu was most vulnerable. Through comprehensive analysis of the results, the climate exposure index was identified as the greatest contributor to health vulnerability in Korea. Regional differences in climate exposure can be moderated by social investment in improving sensitivity and adaptive capacity. This study is significant in presenting a quantitative assessment of vulnerability to climate change by the administrative unit in South Korea. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the efficient development and implementation of climate change adaptation policies in South Korea. © 2017 by the authors.","Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Health vulnerability; Heat wave; IPCC AR4; Vulnerability assessment","adaptive management; assessment method; climate change; climate effect; heat wave; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; metropolitan area; qualitative analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; vulnerability; South Korea; Taegu [South Korea]; Taegu [Taegu (ADS)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021651376

This study addresses the use of such a regional atmospheric model to estimate physical maximum precipitation rates for the next generation of flood management strategies under evolving climate conditions. First, 48 significant historical storm events were selected based on the continuous reconstructed precipitation conditions on the Feather, Yuba, and American River watersheds in California. Then, the boundary conditions of the numerical atmospheric model were modified with the fully saturated atmospheric layers (100% relative humidity) to generate the atmospheric conditions that maximize the precipitation over the three watersheds. Surprisingly, maximizing the atmospheric moisture supply at the model boundary does not always increase the precipitation in the watersheds of interest. A rain-shadow effect of the topography seemed to be intensified by the abundance of the atmospheric moisture in some cases. Consequently, although the linkage between the precipitable water in the atmosphere and the ground precipitation is generally proportional, the alignment of the topography and the wind field can modulate their relationship. Finally, a methodology to maximize the steady-state precipitation rate was discussed to characterize the conceptual continuous heavy storm event in the Feather, Yuba, and American River basins. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","Complex terrain; Extreme events; Flood events; Mesoscale models; Orographic effects; Risk assessment","complex terrain; extreme event; flood; mesoscale meteorology; numerical model; orographic effect; precipitation (climatology); risk assessment; storm; American River; California; Feather River; United States; Yuba River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019045038

However, not all the projects that use air quality mobile sensors consider the potential effects of their use on the attitudes and behaviors of non-expert individuals. This study explores the experiences, perceptions, attitudes, and behavioral intentions of 12 participants who used a real-time NO2 sensor over a period of 7 days in the metropolitan area of Barcelona and compares them with 16 participants who did not have access to the device but rather to documentary information. The study design is based on recombined focus groups who met at the beginning and end of a 7-day activity. The results suggest that the experience with the sensors, in comparison with the traditional information, generates greater motivation among participants. Also, that the use of the sensor seems to support a more specific awareness of the problem of air pollution. In relation to risk perception, the textual and visual information seems to generate stronger beliefs of severity among participants. In both groups, beliefs of low controllability and self-efficacy are observed. Neither using the sensor nor reading the documentary information seems to contribute positively in this sense.

We experimentally found that CNDs with an average diameter of 4.4 nm were uniformly distributed on the surface of pCN using electron microscopy analysis. The CND/pCN-3 sample with a CND content of 3 wt.% showed the highest catalytic activity in the CO2 photoreduction process under visible and simulated solar light. This process results in the evolution of CH4 and CO. The total amounts of CH4 and CO generated by the CND/pCN-3 photocatalyst after 10 h of visible-light activity were found to be 29.23 and 58.82 μmol·gcatalyst −1, respectively. These values were 3.6 and 2.28 times higher, respectively, than the amounts generated when using pCN alone. The corresponding apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was calculated to be 0.076%. Furthermore, the CND/pCN-3 sample demonstrated high stability and durability after four consecutive photoreaction cycles, with no significant decrease in the catalytic activity. The significant improvement in the photoactivity using CND/pCN-3 was attributed to the synergistic interaction between pCN and CNDs. This synergy allows the effective migration of photoexcited electrons from pCN to CNDs via well-contacted heterojunction interfaces, which retards the charge recombination. This was confirmed by photoelectrochemical measurements, and steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence analyses. The first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were consistent with our experimental results, and showed that the work function of CNDs (5.56 eV) was larger than that of pCN (4.66 eV). This suggests that the efficient shuttling of electrons from the conduction band of pCN to CNDs hampers the recombination of electron–hole pairs. This significantly increased the probability of free charge carriers reducing CO2 to CH4 and CO. Overall, this study underlines the importance of understanding the charge carrier dynamics of the CND/pCN hybrid nanocomposites, in order to enhance solar energy conversion.

Research was undertaken to answer the following question: what strategy could the Government of Bangladesh consider in order to enhance the security of inhabitants of the Bangladesh “Sundarbans Impact Zone (SIZ)” and conserve the biodiversity of the Sundarbans mangrove forest? The proposed strategy, which was based on data and analyses from a team of social and natural scientists and engineers, includes two central elements: incentives to encourage migration out of the SIZ successfully and measures to reduce dangers from natural hazards for inhabitants who choose to remain.

On the onehand, it allows us to investigate fundamental processes of the nonlinear response of electrons driven by astrong laser pulse in a periodic crystal lattice. On the other hand, it opens new paths toward efficientattosecond pulse generation, novel imaging of electronic wave functions, and enhancement of high-orderharmonic-generation (HHG) intensity. A key feature of HHG in a solid (as compared to the wellunderstoodphenomenon of HHG in an atomic gas) is the delocalization of the process, whereby an electronionized from one site in the periodic lattice may recombine in any other. Here, we develop an analyticmodel, based on the localizedWannier wave functions in the valence band and delocalized Bloch functionsin the conduction band. This Wannier-Bloch approach assesses the contributions of individual latticesites to the HHG process and hence precisely addresses the question of localization of harmonic emissionin solids. We apply this model to investigate HHG in a ZnO crystal for two different orientations,corresponding to wider and narrower valence and conduction bands, respectively. Interestingly, fornarrower bands, the HHG process shows significant localization, similar to harmonic generation in atoms.For all cases, the delocalized contributions to HHG emission are highest near the band-gap energy.Our results pave the way to controlling localized contributions to HHG in a solid crystal.","Condensed matter physics; Optics; Quantum physics","Condensed matter physics; Conduction bands; Crystal orientation; Optics; Wave functions; Attosecond science; Electronic wave functions; High harmonics generations; High order harmonics; Non-linear response; Periodic lattices; Pulse generation; Quantum physics; Harmonic analysis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021364308

Production of fresh export fruit and vegetables in Kenya has increasingly been done under the Global-GAP standard scheme by smallholder farmers to improve both environmental conservation and market access. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of Global-GAP policy on climate change perceptions of smallholder French beans farmers. The analysis was based on data collected from a random sample of 616 households interviewed in the Central and Eastern regions of Kenya. The study used principal component analysis (PCA) to extract farmers' key prevailing climate change perceptions and logit regression model to examine the effect of Global-GAP policy on climate change perceptions among other socio-economic factors. The PCA analysis extracted three components proxying for 'droughts', 'delay in rainy seasons', 'diseases and pests' and three proxying for 'hot days', 'floods', and 'diseases and pests' as summarizing maximum variance in the perceptions in the Central and Eastern region respectively. The common, study area-wide climate change perception was identified as incidence of diseases and pest. Logit regression analysis found that Global-GAP policy significantly influenced and improved farmers' probability of perceiving climate change. Other factors found to influence farmers' probability of having the identified climate change perceptions included regional specificity, access to agricultural extension service, access to credit, plot size, and soil fertility. The policy implication of this study is that the government and service providers should mainstream factors like Global-GAP compliance and regional considerations found to improve probability of perceiving climate change in awareness creation extension strategies, towards enhancing adoption of adaptation measures in the smallholder fruits and vegetables farming sector. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate change perception; French beans farming; Global-GAP certification; Kenya; Logit regression model; Principal component analysis; Smallholder",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027310133

Previously, we studied purified pectate lyases (Pel) produced by Bacillus strains from fermenting cocoa and characterized the cloned pel genes. This study aims to search for biological signals that modulates Pel production and regulators that influence pel gene expression. Strains were grown to the end of exponential phase in media containing various carbon sources. Pel enzymes production in Bacillus was unaffected by simple sugar content variation up to 2%. Additionally, it appeared that pel gene is not under the control of the most common carbon and pectin catabolism regulators ccpA and kdgR, which could explain the insensitivity of Pel production to carbon source variation. However, a 6-fold decrease in Pel production was observed when bacteria were grown in LB rich medium as opposed to basal mineral medium. Subsequently, bioinformatics analysis of cloned pel gene promoter region revealed the presence of DegU binding site. Furthermore, the deletion of degU gene dramatically reduces the pel gene expression, as revealed by real time quantitative PCR, showing an activation effect of DegU on Pel synthesis in Bacillus strains studied. We assumed that, during the latter stage of cocoa fermentation when simple sugars are depleted, production of Pel in Bacillus is stimulated by DegU to supply microbial cells with carbon source from polymeric pectic compounds. © Elsevier Ltd","Bacillus; Cocoa fermentation; DegU regulator; Pectate lyase; pel gene regulation","bacterial protein; carbon; DegU protein, Bacteria; pectate lyase; pectin; polysaccharide lyase; Bacillus; bacterial gene; biosynthesis; cacao; DNA sequence; enzymology; fermentation; gene expression regulation; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; molecular cloning; Bacillus; Bacterial Proteins; Cacao; Carbon; Cloning, Molecular; Fermentation; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Genes, Bacterial; Pectins; Polysaccharide-Lyases; Sequence Analysis, DNA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006304193

The only viable source for the continuous monitoring of sea ice cover, its variability and characterization in the vast and remote polr region is the utilization of data acquired by orbiting satellites supported by Ship based observations. India has been contributing significantly in the development of techniques for extraction of sea ice from state-of-Art Indian sensors and other international missions. Significant progress has been made towards understanding sea ice variability in the Antarctic region. Based on various studies in polar regions, it has been observed that during last few decades, Arctic is showing the consistent decline of summer sea ice cover, in contrast to Antarctica which is showing regional anomalies with positive and negative trends. Role of sea ice concentration in Indian monsoon has also been examined. Relation of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and sea ice extents have been studied. A climatic dataset of Sea Ice Occurrence Probability (SIOP) generated for the Antarctic region was used to compare the climatic sea ice growth and melt patterns in the eastern and the western regions of the Antarctic.This paper reviews the recent contributions mainly by Indian scientists in the studies of sea ice with inclusion of a few international scientific contributions.","Antarctic; Microwave radiometer; Remote sensing; SAR; Scatterometer; Sea ice","Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climatology; Earth (planet); Meteorological instruments; Microwave devices; Orbits; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Antarctic; El Nino southern oscillation; International missions; Microwave radiometers; Occurrence probability; Scatterometers; Scientific contributions; Sea ice concentration; Ice",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021137365

The data set consists of measurements obtained from 164 felled brutian pine trees included in 35 research plots. The potential applicability and accuracy of the Levenberg-Marquardt artificial neural network (LMANN) models for brutian pine biomass prediction was investigated by testing their performance against the predictions derived by the nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression-nonlinear regression (NLR) models. The results reported in this research suggest that LMANN models achieved higher accuracy than that derived from the NLR models, showing that the use of this type of neural network architecture is worth consideration in both dry biomass tree component prediction and total dry biomass prediction. © 2017 Society of American Foresters","Allometry; Biomass additivity; Brutian pine; Levenberg-Marquardt artificial neural network models; Nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression","Biology; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon capture; Digital storage; Forecasting; Network architecture; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Additivity; Allometry; Brutian pine; Levenberg-Marquardt Artificial Neural Networks; Seemingly unrelated regression; Forestry; Biomass; Chelation; Neural Networks; Pinus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019422920

The results were examined for the influence of different factors (i.e., type of wood, appliance and combustion cycle). Differently from the standard emission testing methods, user habits were simulated in a schematic way in the laboratory employing different combustion cycles that represent a realistic user behavior. Five locally available firewood typeswere used for the feeding of manual appliances. Two types of pellets (i.e., lowquality higher ash, S-, and Cl-content pellets and high-quality pellets with DIN-PLUS certification) were selected for the experiments in the automatic stove and boiler. Methane emissions for the manually fed appliances ranged approx. between 1 g/kg to 10 g/kg. Depending on the appliance type the highest instantaneous emission factors coincided with different situations causing incomplete combustion and favoring the methane formation (e.g., starved air combustion at high temperatures characterizing the advanced stove or low temperature high excess air combustion in the closed fire place. A more complete combustion in the automatic pellet appliances brought to much lower emissions factors. © 2017, ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

Earth’s climate is the result of resonances and beats between various quasi-cyclic processes of varying wavelengths. It is not possible to forecast the future, unless we have a good understanding of where the earth is in time in relation to the current phases of those different interacting natural quasi periodicities. Evidence is presented specifying the timing and amplitude of the natural 60 ± year and, more importantly, 1000 year periodicities (observed emergent behaviors) that are so obvious in the temperature record. Data related to the solar climate driver are discussed and the solar cycle 22 low in the neutron count (high solar activity) in 1991 is identified as a solar activity millennial peak and correlated with the millennial peak – inversion point – in the RSS temperature trend in about 2004. The cyclic trends are projected forward and predict a probable general temperature decline in the coming decades and centuries. Estimates of the timing and amplitude of the coming cooling are made. If the real climate outcomes follow a trend which approaches the near term forecasts of this working hypothesis, the divergence between the IPCC forecasts and those projected by this paper will be so large by 2021 as to make the current, supposedly actionable, level of confidence in the IPCC forecasts untenable. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","climate forecasting; Global cooling; natural climate cycles; solar activity","Forecasting; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Climate cycle; Climate forecasting; Emergent behaviors; Fit for purpose; Global cooling; Quasi-periodicities; Solar activity; Temperature trends; Earth (planet); air temperature; climate cycle; climate prediction; cooling; policy making; solar activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019071285

It can address climate change issues by reducing urban greenhouse gas emission and oil consumption while at the same time improving mobility. However, many public transport networks are not effective and instead create high operating costs with low frequencies and occupancy. Melbourne is one example of a metropolitan area that faces this problem. Even though the city has well-integrated train and tram networks, Melbourne's bus network still needs to be improved. This study used network planning approach to redesign the bus network in the City of Glen Eira, a Local Government Area (LGA) in the southeastern part of Metropolitan Melbourne. The study area is the area between Gardenvale North and Oakleigh Station, as well as between Caulfield and Patterson Stations. This area needs network improvement mainly because of the meandering bus routes that run within it. This study aims to provide recommendations for improving the performance of bus services by reducing meandering routes, improving transfer point design and implementing coordinated timetables. The recommendations were formulated based on a 'ready-made' concept to increase bus occupancy. This approach can be implemented in other cities with similar problems and characteristics including those in Indonesia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Bus transportation; Buses; Greenhouse gases; Operating costs; Transportation routes; Trolley cars; Local government areas; Melbourne , Australia; Metropolitan area; Mode of transport; Network improvement; Network planning; Public transport; Public transport networks; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023185785

Similar to its effect across various sectors and areas, climate change has potential to affect surface water quality directly and indirectly. On the one hand, the rise in temperature enhances the microbial activity and decomposition of organic matter in the river system and changes in rainfall alter discharge and water flow in the river ultimately affecting pollution dilution level. On the other hand, the disposal of organic waste and channelizing municipal sewage into the rivers seriously worsen water quality. This study attempts to relate hydro-climatology, water quality, and impact of climatic and non-climatic stresses in affecting river water quality in the upper Bagmati basin in Central Nepal. The results showed that the key water quality indicators such as dissolved oxygen and chemical oxygen demand are getting worse in recent years. No significant relationships were found between the key water quality indicators and changes in key climatic variables. However, the water quality indicators correlated with the increase in urban population and per capita waste production in the city. The findings of this study indicate that dealing with non-climatic stressors such as reducing direct disposal of sewerage and other wastes in the river rather than emphasizing on working with the effects from climate change would largely help to improve water quality in the river flowing from highly populated urban areas. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Bagmati; Climate; Monitoring; Non-climatic factors; Water quality","Biochemical oxygen demand; Climate change; Dissolved oxygen; Flow of water; Indicators (chemical); Monitoring; Rivers; Sewage; Waste disposal; Water quality; Bagmati; Climate; Climatic factors; Climatic variables; Hydro climatologies; Microbial activities; River water quality; Water quality indicators; River pollution; dissolved oxygen; organic matter; rain; surface water; fresh water; sewage; water; water pollutant; climate change; climate effect; organic matter; rainfall; river system; surface water; water quality; Article; climate change; controlled study; environmental impact; environmental temperature; geographic distribution; litter decomposition; Nepal; organic waste; oxygen consumption; river; sewage; urban area; waste disposal; water analysis; water flow; water quality; analysis; chemistry; city; environmental monitoring; procedures; river; standards; statistics and numerical data; water pollutant; water pollution; water quality; Bagmati River; Nepal; Cities; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Fresh Water; Nepal; Rivers; Sewage; Water; Water Pollutants; Water Pollution; Water Quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019982159

However, there are two established hypotheses that relate herbivore damage and environmental stress mostly tested at the within-population level: the Plant Stress Hypothesis (PSH) and the Plant Vigor Hypothesis (PVH). To examine if support for the PSH holds true at broader scales, we tested it at the micro- (among individuals), meso- (between habitats) and macroscale (between geographical regions, Iberia and Macaronesia). We measured plant stress and leaf damage by different natural enemies (chewers, miners and pathogens) in 12 populations across the range of the relict tree Prunus lusitanica. Results regarding the proportion of leaves attacked by any enemy showed no support for the PSH at either micro or mesoscale, observing instead higher damage in less stressed individuals within populations and in high-quality habitats. However, the latter was true exclusively within the Macaronesian region, highlighting the important effect of the type of abiotic stress on plant susceptibility to herbivory. At the macroscale, alternatively, results showed support for the PSH: we observed a higher proportion of leaves attacked in Macaronesia than in Iberia, where plants unexpectedly exhibited greater stress symptoms. Among-scale inconsistencies may respond to the effect of distinct climatic factors governing both plant and herbivore dynamics at large scales, particularly in species with distributional ranges across contrasting climatic regions such as P. lusitanica. Finally, different plant enemies showed different patterns of damage, corroborating the need to study them separately to achieve consistent generalizations of these hypotheses. © 2017 Gesellschaft für Ökologie","Herbivory; Multiple scales; Plant Stress Hypothesis; Plant Vigor Hypothesis; Relict flora",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023616035

However, it is not easy for small ride-sharing startups, which typically has limited budget and manpower, to boost the service in the early stages. In this paper, we present our on-demand service whose main operation is based on a mobile application for taxi-sharing which utilizes the users' trust network. We also explain in detail the three phased approaches we have applied in an attempt to increase the matching rate among the users. A high matching rate is crucial for survival of a ride-sharing service, because once a service fails to match customers in real-time, the retention rate falls sharply. Next, we analyze and interpret the implication of committing to each approach.

For scientists, L&D raises questions around the extent that such impacts can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change, which may generate complex results and be controversial in the policy arena. This is particularly true in the case of probabilistic event attribution (PEA) science, a new and rapidly evolving field that assesses whether changes in the probabilities of extreme events are attributable to GHG emissions. If the potential applications of PEA are to be considered responsibly, dialogue between scientists and policy makers is fundamental. Two key questions are considered here through a literature review and key stakeholder interviews with representatives from the science and policy sectors underpinning L&D. These provided the opportunity for in-depth insights into stakeholders’ views on firstly, how much is known and understood about PEA by those associated with the L&D debate? Secondly, how might PEA inform L&D and wider climate policy? Results show debate within the climate science community, and limited understanding among other stakeholders, around the sense in which extreme events can be attributed to climate change. However, stakeholders do identify and discuss potential uses for PEA in the WIM and wider policy, but it remains difficult to explore precise applications given the ambiguity surrounding L&D. This implies a need for stakeholders to develop greater understandings of alternative conceptions of L&D and the role of science, and also identify how PEA can best be used to support policy, and address associated challenges. Policy relevance The WIM was established to address the negative impacts of climate change, but whether attribution evidence will be required to link impacts to climate change is yet to be determined, and also controversial. Stakeholders show little awareness of PEA and agreement on its role, which raises important questions for policy. Dialogue between policymakers, practitioners and scientists could help to build a broader understanding of PEA, to determine whether it is relevant, and facilitate both its development and WIM high level decision-making processes. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptation; climate policy; event attribution; loss and damage; probabilities; UNFCCC","adaptive management; carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; decision making; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; perception; probability; stakeholder; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940938843

We compared two Indian cattle breeds (Gir and Kankrej) and two exotic cattle (Holstein and Jersey) breeds. Using a defined dietary plan for selected Indian varieties, the diet dependent shifts in microbial community and abundance of the enzymes associated with methanogenesis were studied. This data has been compared with the available rumen metagenome data from Holstein and Jersey dairy cattle. The abundance of genes for methanogenesis in Holstein and Jersey cattle came from Methanobacteriales order whereas, majority of the enzymes for methanogenesis in Gir and Kankrej cattle came from Methanomicrobiales order. The study suggested that by using slow/less digestible feed, the propionate levels could be controlled in rumen; and in turn, this would also help in further reducing the hydrogenotrophic production of methane. The study proposes that with the designed diet plan the overall methanogenic microbial pool or the individual methanogens could be targeted for development of methane mitigation strategies. © 2017, Association of Microbiologists of India.","Acetate; Formate; Methanogen; Roughage; Volatile fatty acids",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009446496

These relationships are known as the transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE) and the regional TCRE (RTCRE), and have been shown to remain approximately constant over a wide range of cumulative emissions. Here, we assessed how well this relationship holds for seasonal patterns of temperature change, as well as for annual-mean and seasonal precipitation patterns. We analyzed an idealized scenario with CO2 concentration growing at an annual rate of 1% using data from 12 Earth system models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Seasonal RTCRE values for temperature varied considerably, with the highest seasonal variation evident in the Arctic, where RTCRE was about 5.5 C per Tt C for boreal winter and about 2.0 C per Tt C for boreal summer. Also the precipitation response in the Arctic during boreal winter was stronger than during other seasons. We found that emission-normalized seasonal patterns of temperature change were relatively robust with respect to time, though they were sub-linear with respect to emissions particularly near the Arctic. Moreover, RTCRE patterns for precipitation could not be quantified robustly due to the large internal variability of precipitation. Our results suggest that cumulative CO2 emissions are a useful metric to predict regional and seasonal changes in precipitation and temperature. This extension of the TCRE framework to seasonal and regional climate change is helpful for communicating the link between emissions and climate change to policy-makers and the general public, and is well-suited for impact studies that could make use of estimated regional-scale climate changes that are consistent with the carbon budgets associated with global temperature targets. © 2017 The Author(s).

For a target pollutant to be eliminated from an air stream, the proposed methodology is initiated with a mechanistic derived reaction rate. The determination of intrinsic kinetic parameters is associated with the use of a simple geometry laboratory scale reactor, operation under kinetic control and a uniform incident radiation flux, which allows computing the local superficial rate of photon absorption. Thus, a simple model can describe the mass balance and a solution may be obtained. The kinetic parameters may be estimated by the combination of the mathematical model and the experimental results. The validated intrinsic kinetics obtained may be directly used in the scaling-up of any reactor configuration and size. The bench scale reactor may require the use of complex computational software to obtain the fields of velocity, radiation absorption and species concentration. The complete methodology was successfully applied to the elimination of airborne formaldehyde. The kinetic parameters were determined in a flat plate reactor, whilst a bench scale corrugated wall reactor was used to illustrate the scaling-up methodology. In addition, an optimal folding angle of the corrugated reactor was found using computational fluid dynamics tools. © 2017 by the authors.","Air pollution; Photocatalytic reactors; Radiation modeling; Reactor optimization","air pollution; algorithm; catalysis; ecosystem restoration; human; photochemistry; procedures; theoretical model; Air Pollution; Algorithms; Catalysis; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Photochemistry",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020745823

MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson, is a timely moment to review and identify key research foci that could advance island biology. Here, we take a collaborative horizon-scanning approach to identify 50 fundamental questions for the continued development of the field. Location: Worldwide. Methods: We adapted a well-established methodology of horizon scanning to identify priority research questions in island biology, and initiated it during the Island Biology 2016 conference held in the Azores. A multidisciplinary working group prepared an initial pool of 187 questions. A series of online surveys was then used to refine a list of the 50 top priority questions. The final shortlist was restricted to questions with a broad conceptual scope, and which should be answerable through achievable research approaches. Results: Questions were structured around four broad and partially overlapping island topics, including: (Macro)Ecology and Biogeography, (Macro)Evolution, Community Ecology, and Conservation and Management. These topics were then subdivided according to the following subject areas: global diversity patterns (five questions in total); island ontogeny and past climate change (4); island rules and syndromes (3); island biogeography theory (4); immigration–speciation–extinction dynamics (5); speciation and diversification (4); dispersal and colonization (3); community assembly (6); biotic interactions (2); global change (5); conservation and management policies (5); and invasive alien species (4). Main conclusions: Collectively, this cross-disciplinary set of topics covering the 50 fundamental questions has the potential to stimulate and guide future research in island biology. By covering fields ranging from biogeography, community ecology and evolution to global change, this horizon scan may help to foster the formation of interdisciplinary research networks, enhancing joint efforts to better understand the past, present and future of island biotas. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","biodiversity conservation; community ecology; extinction; global change; island biogeography theory; island biology; island evolution; island macroecology; research priorities","biodiversity; climate change; colonization; community ecology; evolutionary biology; extinction; global change; Internet; introduced species; island biogeography; macroecology; research work; Azores; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017403570

Like many Australian cities, Wollongong is surrounded by dense eucalyptus forest, so the urban airshed is heavily influenced by biogenic emissions. Instruments were deployed during MUMBA to measure the gaseous and aerosol composition of the atmosphere with the aim of providing a detailed characterisation of the complex environment of the ocean-forest-urban interface that could be used to test the skill of atmospheric models. The gases measured included ozone, oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane and many of the most abundant volatile organic compounds. The aerosol characterisation included total particle counts above 3ĝ€nm, total cloud condensation nuclei counts, mass concentration, number concentration size distribution, aerosol chemical analyses and elemental analysis.<br><br>The campaign captured varied meteorological conditions, including two extreme heat events, providing a potentially valuable test for models of future air quality in a warmer climate. There was also an episode when the site sampled clean marine air for many hours, providing a useful additional measure of the background concentrations of these trace gases within this poorly sampled region of the globe. In this paper we describe the campaign, the meteorology and the resulting observations of atmospheric composition in general terms in order to equip the reader with a sufficient understanding of the Wollongong regional influences to use the MUMBA datasets as a case study for testing a chemical transport model.

Understanding the nature and causes of their variability is of paramount importance for society. However, historical records of TCs are too short to fully characterize such changes and paleosediment archives of Holocene TC activity are temporally and geographically sparse. Thus, it is of interest to apply physical modeling to understanding TC variability under different climate conditions. Here we investigate global TC activity during a warm climate state (mid-Holocene, 6,000 yBP) characterized by increased boreal summer insolation, a vegetated Sahara, and reduced dust emissions. We analyze a set of sensitivity experiments in which not only solar insolation changes are varied but also vegetation and dust concentrations. Our results show that the greening of the Sahara and reduced dust loadings lead to more favorable conditions for tropical cyclone development compared with the orbital forcing alone. In particular, the strengthening of theWest African Monsoon induced by the Sahara greening triggers a change in atmospheric circulation that affects the entire tropics. Furthermore, whereas previous studies suggest lower TC activity despite stronger summer insolation and warmer sea surface temperature in the Northern Hemisphere, accounting for the Sahara greening and reduced dust concentrations leads instead to an increase of TC activity in both hemispheres, particularly over the Caribbean basin and East Coast of North America. Our study highlights the importance of regional changes in land cover and dust concentrations in affecting the potential intensity and genesis of past TCs and suggests that both factors may have appreciable influence on TC activity in a future warmer climate.","Dust emissions; Hurricanes; Land cover changes; Mid-holocene; Vegetation changes","Africa south of the Sahara; Article; Caribbean; climate change; dust; humidity; hurricane; land use; North America; priority journal; sea surface temperature; solar energy; summer; sunlight; vegetation; Africa; climate; computer simulation; ecosystem; history; humidity; plant; Africa, Northern; Climate; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Cyclonic Storms; Dust; Ecosystem; History, Ancient; Humidity; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020723054

Development of strategies to mitigate the impact of these projected changes on agricultural production and environmental quality is important for ensuring agricultural resiliency to future climate. This study used the DRAINMOD hydrologic model to simulate subsurface drainage discharge at a field site in the headwaters of the Western Lake Erie Basin using future climate patterns projected by 20 general circulation models. Despite projected increases in rainfall, by the late twenty-first century, subsurface discharge was projected to decrease 7% and 11% under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. Reductions in subsurface discharge were attributed to increased temperature and evapotranspiration. The performance of controlled drainage was not projected to change on an annual basis throughout the next century. The benefits of controlled drainage systems as an agricultural best management practice were still evident under the projected climate change of the next century. The role of controlled drainage as a means to potentially retain more crop available water in the soil profile could become critically important under future climate conditions.","Climate modeling; Drainage water management; DRAINMOD; Ohio","agricultural production; best management practice; climate change; climate modeling; drainage; drought; environmental quality; evapotranspiration; general circulation model; headwater; hydrological modeling; rainfall; soil profile; twenty first century; water management; Great Lakes [North America]; Lake Erie; Midwest; Ohio; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019854509

Not only is there currently a debate over the best policy instrument, it is also discussed whether the renewable energy production should be expanded centralized at locations with the highest production potential or decentralized close to load. It is yet not fully understood what influences the spatial distribution of renewable energy installation. I assess the effect of subsidy scheme and market design on the spatial distribution of wind energy installations by comparing (a) feed-in tariffs versus market premiums and (b) uniform versus nodal pricing. The analysis is based on theoretical considerations and using a six-node test model that reflects the consumption and renewable resource distribution in several countries and regions. The institutional setting has great influence on the spatial distribution and resulting system costs. With uniform pricing, a market premium only leads to a more decentralized expansion of renewable energy production than a tariff when sites share similar wind conditions. Spatially more distributed expansion of wind power performs better in terms of total costs and share of wind power in final demand when networks are restricted. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Market design; Support scheme; Wind energy","Climate change; Commerce; Costs; Machinery; Renewable energy resources; Wind power; Institutional setting; Market design; Policy instruments; Renewable energies; Renewable energy installations; Renewable energy source; Renewable resource; Wind conditions; Spatial distribution; alternative energy; centralization; climate change; demand analysis; energy market; energy policy; institutional framework; spatial distribution; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018915218

It is well known that processes related to virus transmission by mosquitoes are highly influenced by weather. Temperature has been described as one of the climatic variables that largely governs the development and survival of mosquito eggs as well as the survival of all insect stages. Previously, we noted that high temperatures in the Colombian city of Riohacha negatively affect the establishment of dengue virus (DENV) infection in mosquitoes; in Bello and Villavicencio cities, which have lower average temperatures, DENV infection rates in mosquitoes are positively associated with a gradual increase in temperature. Here, we test the hypothesis that a similar effect of temperature can be detected in the incidence in the human population inhabiting dengue-endemic cities in Colombia. Objective Our objective was to evaluate the effect of climate variables related to temperature on DENV incidence in human populations living in DENV-endemic cities in Colombia. Methods Epidemiologic data from the Instituto Nacional de Salud from 2012-2015 and 7 variables related to temperature were used to perform Spearman rank sum test analyses on 20 Colombian cities. Additionally, locally estimated scatterplot smoothing analyses were performed to describe the relationship among temperatures and incidence. Findings Results indicated that Colombian cities with average and maximum temperatures greater than 28°C and 32°C, respectively, had an inversely related relationship to DENV incidence, which is in accordance with areas where higher temperatures are recorded in Colombia. Conclusion Climatic variables related to temperature affect dengue epidemiology in different way. According to the temperature of each city, transmission might be positively or negatively affected. © 2017 Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai","climatic variables; correlation analysis; correlation coefficient; dengue; incidence; temperature","Article; climate; Colombian; dengue; disease surveillance; endemic disease; human; incidence; risk assessment; temperature; virus transmission; city; Colombia; dengue; mosquito vector; transmission; weather; Cities; Colombia; Dengue; Humans; Incidence; Mosquito Vectors; Temperature; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034590044

It has recently made commitments to improve air quality and to peak its CO2 emissions by 2030. We examine one strategy that can potentially address both issues-utilizing long-distance electricity transmission to bring renewable power to the polluted eastern provinces. Based on an integrated assessment using state-of-the-science atmospheric modeling and recent epidemiological evidence, we find that transmitting a hybrid of renewable (60%) and coal power (40%) (Hybrid-by-wire) reduces 16% more national air-pollution-associated deaths and decreases three times more carbon emissions than transmitting only coal-based electricity. Moreover, although we find that transmitting coal power (Coal-by-Wire, CbW) is slightly more effective at reducing air pollution impacts than replacing old coal power plants with newer cleaner ones in the east (Coal-by-Rail, CbR) (CbW achieves a 6% greater reduction in national total air-pollution-related mortalities than CbR), both coal scenarios have approximately the same carbon emissions. We thus demonstrate that coordinating transmission planning with renewable energy deployment is critical to maximize both local air quality benefits and global climate benefits. © 2017 The Author(s).

People and places vulnerable to climate change have been the focus of many discussions. However, in the forestry sector, limited studies have been conducted that link human vulnerability to recent initiatives, such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation or REDD+, especially in highly vulnerable countries. Using case studies from the Philippines, this paper focuses on the vulnerability of two community-based forest management (CBFM) organizations, with and without REDD+ readiness intervention, to show the impacts of climate variability and extremes. Two balance-weighted approaches, the livelihood vulnerability index and the IPCC-framework, were used in the vulnerability assessments. Results revealed high vulnerability of both CBFM organizations, although Malitbog Upland Developers for Sustainable Association (MUDSA) livelihood vulnerability is largely aggravated by its exposure to disaster, climate variability and extremes, accessibility to health facilities and water supply. The long history of CBFM implementation in both organizations have minimal contribution in enhancing the adaptive capacity of members to cope with and adapt to climate change impacts. REDD+ (readiness), does not insure reduced vulnerability to climate change, unless sustainable livelihood is achieved. As the State controls forest resources, the rights of CBFM-organizations to commercially benefit from these resources are limited, a disincentive to the development of new and viable development programs in CBFM areas, such as REDD+. This also constrains the achievement of climate resiliency. © 2016, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.","Climate variability and extremes; Community-based forest management; Livelihood vulnerability index; REDD+; Southern Leyte; Sustainable livelihoods",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027987623

NOx emissions are evaluated, taking into account not only the exhaust emissions produced by transport activity, but also the amount of the population exposed to these air pollutants. Results show up to 10.4% CO2 and 13.8% NOx reductions in congested traffic conditions for a 90% penetration of green drivers; however, the population's exposure to NOx increases up to 20.2%. Moreover, while traffic volumes decrease by 13.5% for the entire region, they increase by up to 16.4% downtown. Travel times also increase by 28.7%. Since green drivers tend to choose shorter routes through downtown areas, eco-routing systems are an effective tool for fighting climate change, but are ineffective to reduce air pollution in dense urban areas. © 2017 by the authors.

Several recent studies have foregone climate model forecasts during assimilation due to the computational expense of running coupled global climate models (CGCMs) and the relatively low skill of these forecasts on longer timescales. Here we greatly diminish the computational cost by employing an empirical forecast model (linear inverse model, LIM), which has been shown to have skill comparable to CGCMs for forecasting annual-to-decadal surface temperature anomalies. We reconstruct annual-average 2 m air temperature over the instrumental period (1850-2000) using proxy records from the PAGES 2k Consortium Phase 1 database; proxy models for estimating proxy observations are calibrated on GISTEMP surface temperature analyses. We compare results for LIMs calibrated using observational (Berkeley Earth), reanalysis (20th Century Reanalysis), and CMIP5 climate model (CCSM4 and MPI) data relative to a control offline reconstruction method. Generally, we find that the usage of LIM forecasts for online PDA increases reconstruction agreement with the instrumental record for both spatial fields and global mean temperature (GMT). Specifically, the coefficient of efficiency (CE) skill metric for detrended GMT increases by an average of 57 % over the offline benchmark. LIM experiments display a common pattern of skill improvement in the spatial fields over Northern Hemisphere land areas and in the high-latitude North Atlantic-Barents Sea corridor. Experiments for non-CGCM-calibrated LIMs reveal region-specific reductions in spatial skill compared to the offline control, likely due to aspects of the LIM calibration process.

Therefore, a method to rank brake pairs (pads and rotors) with respect to their particle emission factors in a reliable way is needed to develop a low-emission disc brake. A novel inertial disc brake dynamometer designed for brake particle emission studies, a modified SAE J 2707 cycle, an electrical low-pressure cascade impactor and a filter are used to test five different pad materials against cast-iron rotors. By changing only the pad materials, it is shown that the differences between the mass emission factor and the number emission factor of the the worst brake pair and those of the best brake pair decreases by more than four times and 19 times respectively. Furthermore, the results show that the material combination ranked the best in terms of the mass emission factor is ranked the worst in terms of the number emission factor. The results reveal that this combination of a test stand, a test cycle and particle instruments can discriminate between different brake pair materials in a reliable way in the case of the mass emission factors while more research has to be carried out in the case of the number emission factors. © IMechE 2016.","airborne fraction; Automotive brake; gravimetric method; mass emission factor; non-exhaust emissions; number emission factor","Air brakes; Air quality; Automobile parts and equipment; Cast iron; Dynamometers; Meteorological instruments; airborne fraction; Automotive brake; Emission factors; Exhaust emission; Gravimetric methods; Mass emissions; Brakes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019043416

By the 1980s, however, most optimal sites were developed or protected through conservation policies. Today, climate change and growing water demands pose new challenges for water management. Consequently, policy-makers are once again advocating for water storage. In the U.S. and other developed countries, this return to supply-side solutions is manifesting in auxiliary infrastructural projects such as dam augmentation and aquifer storage and recovery (ASR). We argue that the return to a high-modernist reliance on big infrastructure is not limited to developing countries and illustrate the rise of auxiliary infrastructure using two case studies in California and Oregon. Our analysis suggests these auxiliary infrastructural projects are appealing to water managers because they purport to accommodate the demand for new water-governance strategies while working within the limitations imposed by past infrastructural development and environmental policy. Nevertheless, increasing storage capacity alone is insufficient for water management in the context of climate change, for demand-side strategies must also be pursued.","Adaptation; Climate change; Conservation policy; Infrastructure; Political ecology; Water governance","adaptive management; aquifer; climate change; developing world; environmental policy; governance approach; groundwater; infrastructural development; policy making; twentieth century; water demand; water management; water storage; California; Oregon; United States; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020307045

The problem of the optimal filling of plaster compositions, labor intensity and low profitability of natural filler production was raised A solution was suggested: expand the nomenclature of fillers for plaster compositions of the new generation, apply nanotechnological raw materials, in particular, carbonate sludge - the product of reactant treatment of waste water from thermal power plants and carbonate siliceous product - flue dust from asphalt concrete plants.

This change in surface energy budget may exacerbate or counteract biogeochemical greenhouse gas effects of LCC, with a large body of emerging assessments being produced, sometimes apparently contradictory. We reviewed the existing scientific literature with the objective to provide an overview of the state-of-the-knowledge of the biophysical LCC climate effects, in support of the assessment of mitigation/adaptation land policies. Out of the published studies that were analyzed, 28 papers fulfilled the eligibility criteria, providing surface air temperature and/or precipitation change with respect to LCC regionally and/or globally. We provide a synthesis of the signal, magnitude and uncertainty of temperature and precipitation changes in response to LCC biophysical effects by climate region (boreal/temperate/tropical) and by key land cover transitions. Model results indicate that a modification of biophysical processes at the land surface has a strong regional climate effect, and non-negligible global impact on temperature. Simulations experiments of large-scale (i.e. complete) regional deforestation lead to a mean reduction in precipitation in all regions, while air surface temperature increases in the tropics and decreases in boreal regions. The net global climate effects of regional deforestation are less certain. There is an overall consensus in the model experiments that the average global biophysical climate response to complete global deforestation is atmospheric cooling and drying. Observed estimates of temperature change following deforestation indicate a smaller effect than model-based regional estimates in boreal regions, comparable results in the tropics, and contrasting results in temperate regions. Regional/local biophysical effects following LCC are important for local climate, water cycle, ecosystems, their productivity and biodiversity, and thus important to consider in the formulation of adaptation policy. However before considering the inclusion of biophysical climate effects of LCC under the UNFCCC, science has to provide robust tools and methods for estimation of both country and global level effects. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","biophysical impacts; climate change; climate policies; deforestation; land cover change","Atmospheric temperature; Biodiversity; Biophysics; Budget control; Climate models; Deforestation; Greenhouse gases; Interfacial energy; Tropics; biophysical impacts; Climate policy; Eligibility criterion; Land-cover change; Regional climate effects; Scientific literature; Surface air temperatures; Surface energy budget; Climate change; adaptive management; air temperature; anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; biophysics; climate change; cooling; deforestation; energy budget; environmental policy; evapotranspiration; global climate; greenhouse gas; hydrological cycle; land cover; land surface; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; surface energy; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019885102

Behavioral economics has characterized the relationship between concurrently available commodities but has not been applied to marijuana and tobacco couse. U.S. adults ≥ 18 years who coused marijuana and tobacco cigarettes were recruited via Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing service by Amazon. Participants (N = 82) completed online purchasing tasks assessing hypothetical marijuana or tobacco cigarette puff consumption across a range of per-puff prices; 2 single-commodity tasks assessed these when only 1 commodity was available, and 2 cross-commodity tasks assessed these in the presence of a concurrently available fixed-price commodity. Purchasing tasks generated measures of demand elasticity, that is, sensitivity of consumption to prices. In single-commodity tasks, consumption of tobacco cigarette puffs (elasticity of demand: α = 0.0075; 95% confidence interval [0.0066, 0.0085], R2 = 0.72) and of marijuana puffs (α = .0044; 95% confidence interval [0.0038, 0.0049], R2 = 0.71) declined significantly with increases in price per puff. In cross-commodity tasks when both tobacco cigarette puffs and marijuana puffs were available, demand for 1 commodity was independent of price increases in the other commodity (ps &gt; .05). Results revealed that, in this small sample, marijuana and tobacco cigarettes did not substitute for each other and did not complement each other; instead, they were independent of each other.

Mapping and quantifying mangrove biomass is useful for the effective management of these forests and maximizing their ecosystem service performance. The objectives of this research were to model, map, and analyse the biomass change between 2000 and 2011 of mangrove forests in the Cangio region in Vietnam. SPOT 4 and 5 images were used in conjunction with object-based image analysis and machine learning algorithms. The study area included natural and planted mangroves of diverse species. After image preparation, three different mangrove associations were identified using two levels of image segmentation followed by a Support Vector Machine classifier and a range of spectral, texture and GIS information for classification. The overall classification accuracy for the 2000 and 2011 images were 77.1% and 82.9%, respectively. Random Forest regression algorithms were then used for modelling and mapping biomass. The model that integrated spectral, vegetation association type, texture, and vegetation indices obtained the highest accuracy (R2adj = 0.73). Among the different variables, vegetation association type was the most important variable identified by the Random Forest model. Based on the biomass maps generated from the Random Forest, total biomass in the Cangio mangrove forest increased by 820,136 tons over this period, although this change varied between the three different mangrove associations. © 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

It is not surprising that many cities have adopted long-term emission reduction goals. However, a detailed analysis of energy use and the resulting carbon emissions are rare in developing countries. This paper presents historical trends of energy demand and energy-related CO2 emissions for Bangkok, Thailand. The CO2 emissions account for the use of fossil fuels only. It also presents the projections of energy use and CO2 emissions from 2010 to 2050. Using a bottom-up energy model and scenario analysis, the paper employs a Long-range Energy Alternative Planning (LEAP) system to simulate four sectors in Bangkok. The results identified by the BAU (business-asusual) scenario indicate that total energy is expected to reach 54,560 kilotonne of oil equivalent (ktoe) with 191 million tonne CO2 (Mt-CO2) by 2050. Under the alternative scenario, if all policy interventions are implemented simultaneously, the potential for energy-savings and reduced CO2 emissions in 2050 are estimated to be 32,120 ktoe and 106.19 Mt- CO2.

Over the past decades, corn contract farming has increased, and the chief method for eliminating waste from these farms has chiefly been open burning on the fields, which produces enormous amounts of greenhouse gases (GHG) and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). To find a way to reduce GHG emissions in the corn production system, this work focuses on finding clusters with minimum transportation time from waste disposal centers. To solve the clustering problems, four models are created and solved on AIMMS and MATLAB. Simulation results indicate that the number of clients essentially affects the performance of the procedure. The case studies are on corn production management in Chiang Mai, the region’s economic capital, as well as in 9 provinces in Northern Thailand, including Chiang Mai, whose combined corn production comprises 32.73 percent of the national production. With roughly 15% of the corn cobs and husks involved in the study, we found that by changing the waste elimination process, the total CO2 emissions can be reduced by up to 12,008.40 tons per year in Chiang Mai and up to 180,198.14 tons per year in the 9 provinces of Northern Thailand. © 2017 by the authors.

In this study, we suggest a new strategy to synthesize CNPs with tunable size, while avoiding the use of harsh conditions and allowing easy surface functionalization. The metastable state of polyyne-containing materials appoints them as ideal precursors for low-temperature preparation of carbon-rich structures. Our approach is to synthesize octatetrayne-containing particles prompt to spontaneous reaction, including topochemical polymerization, followed by aromatization, to avoid harsh carbonization steps. For the particle synthesis, the well-known dispersion polymerization process has been adapted for homocoupling of terminal butadiynes, generating the octatetrayne-containing particles. The method was proven reproducible, scalable, and versatile, as the particles' size can be modulated between 50 and 170 nm. Surface functionalization via thiol-yne click chemistry was completed with a pyrene-modified thiol ligand to provide the CNPs with photoactive properties in the visible range. The functionalized particles exhibit fluorescence at 470 nm arising from excimer formation. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Biocompatibility; Carbonization; Dispersions; Low temperature effects; Medical applications; Nanoparticles; Optical properties; Polymerization; Semiconductor quantum dots; Temperature; Biomedical applications; Dispersion polymerization; Functionalized particles; Low temperature preparation; Low temperature synthesis; Photoactive properties; Surface Functionalization; Topochemical polymerization; Synthesis (chemical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020313767

These goals seem to be difficult to achieve, nevertheless the development and implementation of innovative concepts is always a step forward. Nowadays the renewable energy sources seem to be the panacea for the problems of pollutions and energy saving. Many inventors and scientists work on concept of smart grid technology. The basic concept of this technology is producing energy directly in the cities. It seems to be a good idea but often in urban areas there is no place for new installations or cost of land is the barrier. Therefore to produce and manage energy directly in the cities, we have to take into account many aspects such as cost of land, location, available renewable energy sources, number of inhabitants, electrical network, terrain obstacles, and local plans. Here is the good place to use geographic information system technology which can help us to analyze all these issues and combine spatial, satellite, and statistical data to create one coherent concept of managing various sources of energy in the cities. The aim of this study is to consider opportunities of using geographic information systems in supporting process of energy management in the cities. It was taken into account many important elements: solar conditions, impact of cloudiness on value of solar radiation, spatial data, buildings and electrical network, obstacles, and number of inhabitants. It is all for identify the advantages and disadvantages of geographic information system in the analysis of solar energy potential in the city. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Energy; environment management; geographic information system; Smart City; urban areas","Electric network parameters; Energy conservation; Energy management; Geographic information systems; Information management; Information systems; International law; Natural resources; Pollution; Renewable energy resources; Smart city; Solar energy; Atmospheric pollution; Electrical networks; Energy; Environment management; International obligations; Renewable energy source; Smart Grid technologies; Urban areas; Energy management systems; alternative energy; emission control; energy planning; environmental management; European Commission; European Union; GIS; smart city; solar power; Poland [Central Europe]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019610379

Different slurry application techniques can influence the emission of GHG. In the years 2014 and 2015, two parallel trials (sites: Lückstedt and Kossebau) and one lysimeter trial (site: Falkenberg) were set up in Central Germany (federal state: Saxony-Anhalt) in order to investigate the influence of the slurry strip-till method on ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions when compared to surface slurry incorporation. The effect of the nitrification inhibitor (NI) (PIADIN®) on GHG emissions was also examined. NH3 was measured using a combination of passive samplers and the Dräger Tube method (DTM). N2O was measured using the closed chamber method (CCM) both in the maize row and in the interrow space. In the two years of the experiment, NH3volatilization fluctuated between 0.6 and 3.5 kg NH3-N ha−1. In 2014, the slurry strip-till treatments in Lückstedt emitted significantly less NH3 than surface slurry incorporation. In 2015, at the Kossebau site NH3 volatilization was significantly lower in the treatments with NI than those with no NI. In both years, N2O emissions were between 0.5 kg and 2 kg N2O-N ha−1. In the lysimeter trial, in 2014 significantly higher N2O emissions were detected in the unfertilized control than in the fertilized treatments. In the plot trial in Kossebau, in 2015 significantly lower N2O emissions were recorded in the row than interrow. These differences are probably due to the uptake of mineral nitrogen by the plants in the row as a starting material for nitrification and denitrification. In Kossebau there were significant correlations between N2O emissions and soil temperature. As regards the slurry strip-till method, no significant reduction in N2O emissions was observed in comparison to surface slurry incorporation. The influence of the slurry strip-till method on NH3 and N2O emissions depends on annual weather conditions and it cannot generally be regarded as preferable to conventional, surface slurry incorporation. © 2017","Ammonia; Greenhouse gases; Lysimeter; Nitrification inhibitor; Nitrous oxide; Slurry-strip-till","Ammonia; Lysimeters; Nitrification; Nitrogen oxides; Soil pollution; Soil surveys; Closed-chamber method; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Mineral nitrogen; Nitrification and denitrification; Nitrification inhibitor; Nitrous oxide; Soil temperature; Strip tills; Greenhouse gases; ammonia; biosphere; denitrification; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; inhibitor; lysimeter; nitric oxide; nitrogen; slurry; soil chemistry; soil temperature; Brandenburg [Germany]; Falkenberg; Germany; Saxony-Anhalt; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011625108

Ozone uptake triggers oxidative stress that may promote adverse changes in various plant physiological processes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between meteorological conditions and O3 exposure in foliar injuries, gas exchanges and antioxidant enzyme activity in Psidium guajava Paluma. Saplings of Paluma were exposed in a site contaminated by O3. Foliar injuries, gas exchanges, and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) were evaluated weekly. Results were analyzed by multivariate analysis. The O3 exposure reduced carbon assimilation and induced the onset of foliar injuries. The enzymatic activities were more related to meteorological conditions than to O3 exposure, indicating that these enzymes are not this species’ first line of defense. However, our finding indicates that Paluma may be considered a response indicator, given its presentation of foliar injuries even at low O3 concentrations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Antioxidants; Foliar injuries; Gas exchanges; Ozone; Psidium guajava","Antioxidants; Carbon; Enzymes; Forestry; Multivariant analysis; Oxygen; Ozone; Antioxidant enzyme activity; Environmental conditions; Foliar injuries; Gas exchange; Meteorological condition; Multi variate analysis; Psidium guajava; Tropospheric ozone concentration; Enzyme activity; antioxidant; concentration (composition); ecological impact; environmental conditions; enzyme activity; evergreen tree; forest ecosystem; gas exchange; injury; oxidative stress; ozone; physiological response; pollution exposure; urban area; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Sao Paulo [Sao Paulo (STT)]; Psidium guajava",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012096175

This situation is problematic for inhabitants of temporary waters whose reproductive success depends on rainfall and evaporation that determine the length of the aquatic phase. For organisms with long-lived dormant life stages, bet hedging models suggest that a fraction of these should stay dormant during each growing season to buffer against the probability of total reproductive failure in variable environments. Thus far, however, little empirical evidence supports this prediction in aquatic organisms. We study geographic variation in delayed hatching of dormant eggs in natural populations of two crustaceans, Branchinella longirostris and Paralimnadia badia, that occur in temporary rock pools along a 725 km latitudinal aridity gradient in Western Australia. Consistent with bet hedging theory, populations of both species were characterised by delayed hatching under common garden conditions and hatching fractions decreased towards the drier end of the gradient where the probability of reproductive success was shown to be lower. This decrease was most pronounced in the species with the longer maturation time, presumably because it is more sensitive to the higher prevalence of short inundations. Overall, these findings illustrate that regional variation in climate can be reflected in differential investment in bet hedging and hints at a higher importance of delayed hatching to persist when the climate becomes harsher. Such strategies could become exceedingly relevant as determinants of vulnerability under climate change. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Australia; Climate change; Diapause; Life history; Risk spreading","aquatic organism; bet-hedging; climate change; crustacean; diapause; egg; growing season; hatching date; latitudinal gradient; life history; pond; reproductive success; risk factor; Australia; Western Australia; Branchinella longirostris; Crustacea; animal; climate; climate change; Crustacea; pond; reproduction; Animals; Climate; Climate Change; Crustacea; Ponds; Reproduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016010915

In the first part of this paper, projections of low and high flows in the rivers of the Vistula and the Odra basins (VOB region), for two future time horizons, are presented. Projections are based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model simulations driven by results of the EURO-CORDEX experiment under Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5. The VOB region covers most of Poland and parts of five neighboring countries, giving this study an international relevance. In the second part of the paper, a review of projections of low and high flows in rivers in Central and Eastern Europe is presented. Despite a substantial spread of flow projections, the main message of the modelling part is that increases of both low and high flows are dominating. The magnitude of increase of low flow is considerably higher than that of high flow. In other words, future streamflow droughts are projected to be less severe, whereas, in contrast, river floods are projected to increase, which is a challenge for flood risk reduction, water management, and climate change adaptation. There is an overall agreement of our findings for the VOB region with projections of hydrological extremes from large-scale models forced by EURO-CORDEX results in the European-scale studies.

Currently there is no detailed housing data base for Local Authority housing in Ireland that catalogues the housing stock according to geometric configuration and thermal characteristics for each typology. The aim of this chapter is to present a methodology to catalogue LAH stock and build a detailed housing stock data base. The GIS web based mapping application Google Street View is used to identify 18 house typologies across 36 LAH developments for Cork City in the South of Ireland, used as a dataset for demonstration of the methodology; a total of 10,318 housing units are counted and information subdivided into end of terrace, mid terrace, semi-detached, terrace lengths, orientation and elevation. This database then provides the base line assessment for building a stock aggregation model; the stock aggregation approach is used as a method to evaluate the energy performance of the building stock, beginning with analysis of individual house types; referred to as a ‘bottom up approach’. Four representative archetypes are produced from the study and subsequently modelled using DEAP simulation software. 10,318 homes were identified, catalogued and statistically analysed within a number of weeks for the city council. This can be extended nationally very effectively with data bases now being constructed remotely rather than the challenges of physical mapping and surveying. Using a matrix based linear system for weighting parameters allows a large number of computationally efficient transformations of house types and parameters into archetypes. There is also flexibility in determining the grouping algorithm depending on the nature of the LAH studied. Investment in retrofit is highly justified in this area with large potential for reducing CO2 emissions, the number of fuel poverty sufferers and victims of seasonal mortality due to thermally inefficient homes. The study suggests the method applied has scalable potential and is modular in structure facilitating wider adaptation. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Archetype; Fuel poverty; Local authority housing; Retro fit; Stock aggregation","Buildings; Carbon dioxide; Computer software; Houses; Investments; Linear systems; Linear transformations; Mapping; Mathematical transformations; Surveys; Archetype; Computationally efficient; Fuel poverty; Geometric configurations; Local authorities; Mapping applications; Retro fit; Thermal characteristics; Housing",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019662116

It hosts a deep water (>1000 m) gas hydrate and associated seafloor seepage system. Near-seafloor headspace gas compositions and its methane carbon isotopic signature along the ridge indicate a predominance of thermogenic gas sources feeding the system. Prediction of the base of the gas hydrate stability zone for theoretical pressure and temperature conditions and measured gas compositions results in an unusual underestimation of the observed bottom-simulating reflector (BSR) depth. The BSR is up to 60 m deeper than predicted for pure methane and measured gas compositions with >99% methane. Models for measured gas compositions with >4% higher-order hydrocarbons result in a better BSR approximation. However, the BSR remains >20 m deeper than predicted in a region without active seepage. A BSR deeper than predicted is primarily explained by unaccounted spatial variations in the geothermal gradient and by larger amounts of thermogenic gas at the base of the gas hydrate stability zone. Hydrates containing higher-order hydrocarbons form at greater depths and higher temperatures and contribute with larger amounts of carbons than pure methane hydrates. In thermogenic provinces, this may imply a significant upward revision (up to 50% in the case of Vestnesa Ridge) of the amount of carbon in gas hydrates. ©2017. American Geophysical Union.

Characterizing these attributes has been approached by 1) building reference models for specific Phanerozoic intervals, 2) recognizing the climatic impact in modulating carbonate production, and 3) analyzing the influence of changing bio-geochemical conditions. The reference-model approach is mostly based on biological evolution, the climatic-impact approach emphasizes temperature, and the bio-geochemical approach considers the changes in Mg/Ca ratios and Ca++ concentrations in the oceans. To date, however, an analysis integrating all of these factors is still missing. The analysis presented here includes all these factors but also CO2, which is fundamental for both photosynthesis and CaCO3 precipitation. Here we analyze the waxing and waning of Cenozoic reef limestones from the central Tethys region through several steps: 1) on the basis of rock volume, rock textures, associated sediments and light-dependent skeletal components, as records of light penetration and wave energy (depth); 2) on global environmental conditions (δ13C, δ18O, pCO2, temperature); and 3) on the basis of functionality, nutritional requirements and available resources. Through the Cenozoic, water motion, whether induced by surface or internal waves or by currents, increased as the thermal gradients strengthened, both with depth and with latitude. Active water motion is essential for plankton catchers such as corals, but less so for many larger benthic foraminifers (LBF). Pycnoclines in the meso-oligophotic zone would then favor the benthic plankton catchers such as corals, but would be detrimental for many LBF. Warm temperatures favored LBF. The Eocene LBF families predominated during lowering of atmospheric pCO2 by using respiratory CO2 to enhance the symbiont production of photosynthates under oligotrophic conditions and limited turbulence, whereas the Miocene families had to adapt to a progressive increase in turbulence. The eurythermal coralline red algae, however, became preponderant producers in the mesophotic zone during times when the δ13C was relatively high. This explains two apparent paradoxes: 1) corals thrive best when the Earth's high latitudes cool, and 2) the dominance of corals and LBF is inversely correlated, despite they both require tropical conditions and have similar trophic strategies (mixotrophy). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbonate production; Cenozoic; Coral buildups; LBF; Red algae; Seagrass","Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Factor analysis; Geochemistry; Lime; Plankton; Reefs; Rocks; Textures; Turbulence; Wave energy conversion; Cenozoic; Coral buildups; Environmental conditions; Geochemical approaches; Geochemical conditions; Oligotrophic conditions; Red algae; Seagrasses; Algae; carbonate rock; Cenozoic; coral reef; limestone; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; red alga; seagrass; Tethys; Anthozoa; Foraminifera; Rhodophyta",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016158980

Measurements of stable carbon isotope of soil organic carbon (SOC) also investigate the incorporation of carbon derived from C4 plants (maize) or C3 plants (rice) into SOC. The amounts of biomass incorporation were significantly affected to SOC. Changing from maize to continue upland rice resulted in SOC loss of about 5% after the three crop cycles. In this study, after the second crops and when the cultivation system was changed from maize to lowland rice, the δ13C value of soil carbon was shifted from -18.77 ‰ to -20.73‰. This represented the rapid incorporation of rice-derived carbon into SOC. Conversion of continuous maize to continuous upland and lowland rice resulted in a decrease in C concentrations in light fractions, especially in lowland rice rotation with maize. Since majority of SOC was in the heavy fraction (&gt;80%), it might play the important role in storing carbon. Consequently, this study demonstrated that crop rotation could significantly affect soil carbon sequestration potential and such effects could be detected as early as when the first land conversion occurred. © 2017, International Congress of Chemistry and Environment.

Landslides and floods are related, as the former cause the lakes that burst, and floods can undercut slopes and cause landslides. During the past 200 years, landslides and floods caused by LLOFs in the Garhwal Himalaya have occurred in 1894, 1970, and 1978; but the most disastrous event, in terms of loss of life and economic impact, occurred in June 2013, which was a result of extreme rainfall in the Higher Himalaya and breaching of a moraine-dammed lake, very short-lived LLOFs, and rainfall-induced runoff and landslides. Outmigration from the area as a result of the 2013 event has caused anxiety about the future of the economy and also concerns about security of a state that has an international border. As a contribution to planning and reconstruction to secure the livelihoods of the local people and to entice migrants to return, this paper identifies zones in the Mandakini valley susceptible to landslides using a ‘Weights of Evidence’ approach.

Although that energy harvested is small and in the order of milliwatt, it can provide enough power for wireless sensors and other low-power applications. In the environment there is a lot of wasted energy that can be converted into electricity to power the various circuits and represents a potentially cheap source of power. Energy harvesting is important because it offers an alternative power supply for electronic devices where is does not exist conventional energy sources. This technology applied in a wireless sensor network (WSN) and devices on the IoT, will eliminate the need for network-based energy and conventional batteries, will minimize maintenance costs, eliminate cables and batteries and is ecological. It has the same advantage in applications from remote locations, underwater, and other hard to reach places where conventional batteries and energy are not suitable. Energy harvesting will promote environmentally friendly technologies that will save energy, will reduce CO2 emissions, which makes this technology indispensable for achieving next-generation smart cities and sustainable society.

Ongoing changes in mountain agriculture have affected the balance between the two elements of the mosaic. In order to understand the consequences of these changes for ecosystem functioning, we studied patterns in vegetation, root structure and soil properties along transects of varying grassland-to-shrub proportions. Our hypothesis was that differences in the vegetation aboveground are accompanied by differences belowground, related to soil properties and depth. The research was conducted at a subalpine site in the Trentino region (South-eastern Alps), consisting of Nardus stricta grasslands alternating with shrub patches of Rhododendron ferrugineum. Our investigation showed that the composition of vegetation was mainly governed by R. ferrugineum cover and less by soil properties. Plant species richness peaked at low to intermediate degrees of shrub cover and composition between transects became more similar with increasing shrub cover. Where R. ferrugineum cover was higher, Hemicryptophytes caespitosae were replaced by Nano-phanerophytes with consequences for belowground structures. At increasing shrub cover, root length density decreased, especially in the top soil, while root weight density remained stable and C content increased insignificantly. We discuss that theses structural changes along the gradient of R. ferrugineum cover affect a number of ecosystem services. The presented evidence suggests that maintaining grasslands with a low cover of R. ferrugineum balances a number of services, namely plant species diversity, carbon stabilization in soil and the prevention of soil erosion. © 2016 The Author(s).

Two skeletal mechanism versions were obtained for methane/dimethyl ether combustion system by varying the tolerance used to identify important reactions in the characteristic timescale analysis of the system.

Shell dispersion within habitat was greater for surfclams than for ocean quahogs either due to spatial time averaging, animals not living in all habitable areas all of the time, or parautochthonous redistribution of shell. The regional distribution of dead shell differed from the distribution of live animals, for both species, in a systematic way indicative of range shifts due to climate change. In each case the differential distribution was consistent with warming of the northwest Atlantic. Present-day overlap of live surfclams with live ocean quahogs was consistent with the expectation that the surfclam's range is shifting into deeper water in response to the recent warming trend. The presence of locations devoid of dead shells where live surfclams nevertheless were collected measures the recentness of this event. The presence of dead ocean quahog shells at shallower depths than live ocean quahogs offers good evidence that a range shift has occurred in the past, but prior to the initiation of routine surveys in 1980. Possibly, this range shift tracks initial colonization at the end of the Little Ice Age. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Arctica; Climate change; Continental shelf; Death assemblage; Georges Bank; Habitat; Ocean quahog; Spisula; Surfclam","autochthon; biomass; bivalve; climate change; continental shelf; data set; dispersion; fossil assemblage; habitat; niche overlap; shell; spatial distribution; warming; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northwest); Georges Bank; Animalia; Arctica islandica; Bivalvia; Spisula; Spisula solidissima",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019986236

Enabling carbon credits to be derived from these activities is important for reforestation, particularly since reforestation does not come cheaply. Australia's Carbon Farming Initiative is a world-leading policy that allows carbon credits to be obtained by using published methods-based approaches. Here we apply two different approaches to a young mixed species reforestation project in the wet tropics of Queensland, Australia. One approach assesses carbon sequestration from published allometric equations requiring direct field measurements, and the other applies a national carbon accounting model, FullCAM. Using allometric equations, we found above-ground biomass was influenced significantly by family, species, size class, and the interaction of family and size class. Species in the family Proteaceae out-performed species in other families. Selection of species according to soil nutrient status could enhance growth rates, but if soil nutrients and species responses are not known, then a bet-hedging strategy using mixed species from a variety of families is probably the best option. For three year old forest plots, FullCAM modelled significantly more carbon mass of trees than published allometric models for mixed tropical forests, suggesting that FullCAM needs adjustment to more accurately reflect species, families, local conditions and small-scale sites. Current policy settings are at odds with the needs of carbon farmers, considering the importance of forests and landscape restoration in fighting climate change and biodiversity decline. Legislated national methods allowing the development of species-specific allometrics for small mixed plantations do not account for the costs of developing these allometrics, especially in markets that are marginal. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Allometrics; Carbon models; Functional traits; Proteaceae; Restoration","Biodiversity; Climate change; Conservation; Image reconstruction; Investments; Land reclamation; Nutrients; Reforestation; Restoration; Tropics; Allometric equations; Allometrics; Carbon accounting model; Carbon models; Functional traits; Landscape restoration; Proteaceae; Site characteristics; Forestry; allometry; bet-hedging; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; climate change; dicotyledon; ecosystem modeling; environmental policy; environmental restoration; functional role; methodology; project assessment; reforestation; restoration ecology; soil nutrient; tropical forest; Biodiversity; Carbon; Reforestation; Restoration; Australia; Queensland; Proteaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014764114

To this end, many European countries announced EV stock targets, e.g., Germany aims to have one million EVs on the roads by 2020. To achieve these goals and to handle the range limitation of EVs, a widespread publicly accessible charging infrastructure is needed. This paper provides a dynamic spatial and temporal simulation model for the building of charging infrastructure on a municipality scale. We evaluate empirical data about the timely utilization of different charging stations in the German federal state of Bavaria. This data is used to derive empirical models for the start time and duration of charging events as well as the popularity of charging stations. We develop a lightweight discrete event simulation model which can be used to investigate different expansion strategies, e.g., based on the load of charging stations or the number of successful and failed charging attempts. We show the applicability of our model using the German federal state of Bavaria as a use case. © 2017 ACM.","Charging infrastructure planning; Charging stations; Discrete event simulation; Electric vehicles; Electromobility","Charging (batteries); Electric switches; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Vehicles; Charging infrastructures; Charging station; Discrete-event simulation model; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electromobility; Expansion strategies; Publicly accessible; Temporal simulation; Discrete event simulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020730711

Molecular simulations were carried out for binary mixtures of CO2 and H2O over four N-functionalized surfaces and three variations of the quaternary group with increasing wt % N. The quaternary group was found to be most stable with a 13% loss in CO2 capacity observed, followed by the pyrrolic and pyridonic groups, which lost 25 and 28% CO2 loading capacity, respectively. The oxidized pyridinic group demonstrated a dramatic loss in capacity, i.e., 58% when compared to ideal loading. The quaternary group was the only functionality to display loading in excess of 2.0 mmol CO2 g-1 sorbent under ambient temperature and 1% humidity (2.40 mmol CO2 g-1 sorbent). Further, the two functional groups without oxygen were shown to be more resistant to competitive H2O adsorption at low humidity. In general, increasing nitrogen content appears to buffer the CO2 capacity loss under low humidity, yet such systems appear to be incompatible with CO2 separation at ambient temperature and 10% humidity.

To date, the major determinant climatic factors of the disease in the region have remained largely unknown, making it difficult to effectively target countermeasures for avian cholera surveillance and control. This study aimed to quantify the relationship between climatic variables and cases of avian cholera in subtropical areas of China. Data relating to local meteorological variables and notified cases of avian cholera were supplied by the relevant authorities between January 2006 and December 2015. Spearman correlation, co-linearity statistics and cross-correlation analysis were applied to the data, controlling for co-linearity and lag effects. A time-series Poisson regression analysis was conducted to examine the degree of correlation between the climate variables and avian cholera transmission. The results indicated that monthly mean temperature, relative humidity, rainfall and the multivariate El Niño Southern Oscillation Index, with 2-3 months lag, were correlated with avian cholera incidence. The final model had good predictive ability for the occurrence of avian cholera. Overall, the findings indicate that climate variability plays an important role in avian cholera transmission in Guangxi province. Adoption of the model presented in this study could usefully inform avian cholera surveillance strategies, making them significantly simpler and more effective. The model could also serve as a decision support tool for veterinary professionals and health authorities. © 2017, Fundacao APINCO de Ciencia e Tecnologia Avicolas.

In order to find a favourable method to obtain exact data of coal permeability, two different methods are operated to investigate coal permeability evolution. Steady state method is applied with constant upstream gas pressure and downstream pressure to keep constant pressure difference. Permeability is measured when velocity of gas flow is constant. Pulse transient method is applied with a pulse upstream pressure increment to discharge gas through coal sample to downstream gas reservoir. Permeability is calculated when the upstream reservoir and downstream reservoir reach a new equilibrium pressure. Experiments by different methods are both conducted on 2.5 cm diameter, 2.5-5 cm long cylindrical samples at same constant confining pressure and axial pressure, using both non-adsorbing (helium (He)) and strongly adsorbing (carbon dioxide (CO2)) gases. Every single coal sample is measured by both methods, while all samples are collected from Southeast Ordos Basin in China. The results are compared to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods. Permeability measured by steady state method is slightly larger than that measured by pulse transient method, which indicates that pulse transient method is preferable for measuring low permeability measurement. Factors that may influence the results of measurement are analyzed. Steady state method may destroy the structure of coal and slightly enlarge the pore fracture, with constant pore pressure, which results in higher permeability. On the contrary, pulse transient method keeps samples close to in situ condition, which obtains more exact data. However, several improvements are needed to minimize the error of the pulse transient methods. Temperature has important influence on permeability measurement. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal deposits; Environmental engineering; Flow of gases; Gas permeability; Gases; Methane; Natural resources exploration; Coal permeabilities; Confining pressures; Constant pressure difference; Downstream pressure; Equilibrium pressure; Permeability measurements; Pulse transient method; Reservoir characteristic; Petroleum reservoir engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019662886

Since then, eight cities and five provinces have been selected as pilot areas to develop a low-carbon economy. Under such a circumstance, this study aimed to construct a indicator system and evaluating model so that the low-carbon development levels of the pilot cities can be quantified. Therefore, this study, based the on Driving Force–Pressure–State–Impact–Response model, established a regional low-carbon development indicator system. Second, the weight of each indicator was calculated by taking the entropy method. Third, the low-carbon development levels were measured and evaluated by taking the comprehensive approach of Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution. Then, taking 10 cities from those 13 pilot areas as case studies, this study measured and compared the low-carbon development levels of those 10 cities before and after being pilot areas. The research findings showed that though the low-carbon development levels changed greatly, only five pilot cities’ growth rate is positive. The reasons for changes in the low-carbon development levels were analyzed. The urbanization level and energy consumption elasticity coefficient were the main factors affecting the low-carbon development levels. Additionally, the study traced the effective policies hidden behind the indicators, which provided policy insights to help decision makers prepare their low-carbon development strategies, including legislation efforts, economic instrument, renewable energy and energy-saving technology improvement and low-carbon transportation. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Entropy methods; Indicator; Low-carbon development (LCD); Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)","carbon emission; decision making; development indicator; economic instrument; energy planning; entropy; growth rate; renewable resource; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961575583

In the logic circuitry, through the study of the defect-induced hot carrier emissions from the combinational logic gates, distinctive differences in emission characteristic between open and short defects are identified. Using this defect induced emission characterization approach, together with layout trace and analysis, the type of defect can be predicted. The defect physical location, which yielded no detectable hotspot signal, can also be narrowed down along the long failure net. This allows for the selection of the most appropriate physical failure analysis approach for defect viewing and thus achieving significant reduction in failure analysis cycle time. In the memory array, the weak emission from partially turned-on pass gate transistor is leveraged to localize marginal opens and shorts on the wordline node of the pass-gate transistor. These approaches are applied with great success in the foundry environment to localize yield limiting defects that resulted in SCAN and memory build-in self-test failure, without memory bitmap, diagnostic support or measurable IDD leakage, on advanced technology nodes devices.

Two literature searches were conducted on: (1) active transport health co-benefits, and (2) dietary health co-benefits. Articles needed to quantify both greenhouse gas emissions and health or nutrition outcomes resulting from active transport or diet changes. A data extraction tool (PRISMA) was created for article selection and evaluation. A rubric was devised to assess the biases, limitations and uncertainties of included articles. For active transport 790 articles were retrieved, nine meeting the inclusion criteria. For diet 2524 articles were retrieved, 23 meeting the inclusion criteria. A total of 31 articles were reviewed and assessed using the rubric, as one article met the inclusion criteria for both active transport and diet co-benefits. Methods used to estimate the effect of diet or active transport modification vary greatly precluding meta-analysis. The scale of impact on health and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) outcomes depends predominately on the aggressiveness of the diet or active transport scenario modelled, versus the modelling technique. Effective mitigation policies, infrastructure that supports active transport and low GHGE food delivery, plus community engagement are integral in achieving optimal health and GHGE outcomes. Variation in culture, nutritional and health status, plus geographic density will determine which mitigation scenario(s) best suit individual communities. © 2017 by the authors.

Lakadandh Swamp occurs in the core monsoon zone of India. The study revealed that between &sim;12,785 and &sim;9035 cal. yrs BP, tree savannah vegetation, &mdash; composed of Poaceae, Amaranthaceae, Tubuliflorae along with the tree taxa Holoptelea sp. and Sapotaceae; sparsely distributed Acacia sp., Emblica officinalis, Lagerstroemia sp., Madhuca indica and Syzygium sp., thickets of Ricinus and Zizyphus sp. &mdash; occurred in the region under a cool and dry climate probably indicative of reduced monsoon precipitation.

Between &sim;9035 and &sim;4535 cal. yrs BP, the expansion of existing taxa Holoptelea sp., Sapotaceae, Madhuca indica, Ailanthus excelsa and Lagerstroemia sp. as well as the appearance of Acacia, and Shorea robusta, Acanthaceae, Rungia sp., and Ricinus sp., shows the tree savannah vegetation was replaced by open mixed tropical deciduous forest under a regime of warm and moderately humid climate with increased monsoon precipitation. Since &sim;4535 cal. yrs BP to Present, owing to the improvement of most of the forest constituents, particularly Madhuca indica, Holoptelea sp., Sapotaceae and Lannea coromandelica, and also with immigration of Terminalia sp., Diospyros sp., Butea sp. and Maytenus sp., mixed tropical deciduous forest has taken over the space covered by open mixed tropical deciduous forest under a warm and relatively more humid climate, with further increase in monsoon precipitation. The existing cereal-based agricultural practice increased during the latter two phases, which could be attributed to increased monsoon precipitation. © 2015, © 2015 AASP — The Palynological Society.","climate; India; pollen; tropical vegetation; Younger Dryas","climate variation; deciduous forest; dicotyledon; grass; herb; palynology; pollen; precipitation (climatology); savanna; swamp forest; tropical region; vegetation dynamics; Younger Dryas; Chhattisgarh; India; Koriya; Acacia; Acanthaceae; Ailanthus; Amaranthaceae; Butea; Diospyros; Holoptelea; Lagerstroemia; Madhuca indica; Maytenus; Phyllanthus emblica; Poaceae; Rungia; Sapotaceae; Shorea robusta; Syzygium; Terminalia; Ziziphus sp.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020102107

The stationary sources explain the highest concentrations for all air pollutants evaluated, except for CO, for which the mobile sources are predominant. The anthropogenic sources considered resulted an increasing in the spatial peak-temporal average concentrations of pollutants in 3 to 2780 times in relation to those with only biogenic sources. The future scenario showed an increase in the range of 3 to 62% in average concentrations and 45 to 109% in peak concentrations depending on the pollutant.

These shifts have been documented across the globe for diverse communities. Although many species are flowering earlier, others have exhibited no shifts or delays in flowering. How species respond phenologically will shape interactions both with other community members and with the abiotic environment, altering fitness, abundance and ultimately persistence. To understand if variability in phenological response is influenced by evolutionary history, we tested for phylogenetic signal in shifts in flowering onset for 13 communities representing 116 families across the Northern Hemisphere. We compared the fit of models of neutral evolution (Brownian Motion) with models that incorporate selection (Ornstein–Uhlenbeck). We found significant signal in whether species had shifted and the magnitude of response, with both traits conforming to an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck model of trait evolution. Synthesis. These results show there is global phylogenetic signal in the direction and magnitude of shifts in flowering onset and indicate selection has shaped flowering time responses of related species under climate change; thus, environmentally determined optima may constrain whether and to what degree species respond phenologically to climate change. Our findings further demonstrate the value of testing for phylogenetic signal across multiple communities and comparing multiple models of trait evolution. © 2016 The Authors.

The study analyses the key aspects of forest governance, focusing on drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, governance deficit, institutions and social networks, co-benefits, and opportunities and challenges of REDD+ in RKWS. Focus group discussions and key informant interviews were used for primary data collection from different forest stakeholders, including forest-dependent communities, Forest Department (FD) and co-management project staffs. The survey revealed that REDD+ not only on technical issues but even more on how the evolving mechanism is governed on various levels, ranging from local to international. Although a majority (69.5%) of the respondents were motivated to engage in REDD+, indigenous communities were less interested in fear of loss of access to and use of land and forest resources, ownership and rights, and traditional customs and knowledge. There remained a degree of ambiguity of FD, community and co-management projects in field operations, which conflicted with the notions of cooperation, transparency, and accountability of the overall initiatives. Moreover, there is a strong local power structure that has major control over the community, locality and even over a local administration that is a crucial issue to the RKWS authority. However, REDD+ will open up the opportunity to manage the RKWS’s forest resources in a sustainable way, increase the level of protection, and expand the area protected, hence REDD+ must align with the interests of all stakeholders to fulfil its goal. Further research is necessary to inform the governance of REDD+ in Bangladesh to better understand the interplay, interactions and linkages between existing institutions, actors and policy processes. © 2017 by the authors.

Predicting their welfare impacts before their establishment could help with the design of compensation schemes. Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are increasingly used for ex ante evaluations but their validity is largely untested in low-income settings. Using a case study of a new REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) project in eastern Madagascar, we explore the validity of DCEs in two ways: (i) whether the estimates of welfare costs derived from DCE are affected by respondents’ prior experience of conservation (ii) whether DCE results have high theoretical and content validity. We surveyed households who have varying degrees of experience of restrictions to swidden agriculture. We also qualitatively debriefed a sub-sample of respondents to better understand their thought processes. Latent class analysis shows that DCE outcomes vary with conservation experience. Households more experienced with forest protection are less willing to trade-off rights to clear forest for swidden agriculture with any compensatory interventions whereas less experienced households highly favor support for alternative agricultural techniques and a secure right to clear one hectare of forest. Although the results show apparent non-attendance to some attributes (e.g., cash payments), qualitative debriefings suggest that respondents infact do expect relatively low or no utility from the given attributes and hence have theoretically valid preferences. Similarly, the DCE has generally high content validity. Although DCE can elicit current preferences in this context, using ex ante DCE to estimate the welfare costs of such a long-term intervention requires caution. We conclude that it is difficult to robustly estimate compensation in advance of an intervention, there is therefore a need to rethink conservation approaches, and the feasibility of achieving fair compensations for conservation-imposed restrictions. © 2017 The Author(s)","choice experiment; compensations; Madagascar; REDD+; validity; welfare impacts","compensation system; deforestation; discrete choice analysis; emission control; nature conservation; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; welfare impact; Madagascar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014740375

We use long-term records of ground-based measurements from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System and Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments to assess the patterns in anthropogenic combustion ratios (ΔECa/ΔCO and ΔECa/ΔNOx) across the U.S. Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts (PADD) regions for the years 2000-2015. We investigate the change in these ratios between the periods 2000-2007 and 2008-2015. Overall, ΔECa/ΔCO ratios increase by 0.7-82% and ΔECa/ΔNOx by 6.8-104% across the East and West PADD regions. The urban West showed the largest increase relative to other regions. This is mainly attributed to a 13-23% increase in ΔECa during the winter and fall seasons and significant reductions in urban ΔNOx (except in winter).

Given the increased thermal stress on these systems by growing cooling demands of riparian/coastal infrastructures in combination with climate warming, the question arises on how to best monitor and manage these systems. In this study, we investigate local and system-wide physical effects on the medium-sized perialpine Lake Biel (Switzerland), influenced by point-source cooling water emission from an upstream nuclear power plant (heat emission ∼700 MW, ∼18 W m−2 lake wide). We use one-dimensional (SIMSTRAT) and three-dimensional (Delft3D-Flow) hydrodynamic numerical simulations and provide model resolution guidelines for future studies of thermal pollution. The effects on Lake Biel by the emitted excess heat are summarized as: (i) clear seasonal trend in temperature increase, locally up to 3.4°C and system-wide volume mean ∼0.3°C, which corresponds to one decade of regional surface water climate warming; (ii) the majority of supplied thermal pollution (∼60%) leaves this short residence time (∼58 days) system via the main outlet, whereas the remaining heat exits to the atmosphere; (iii) increased length of stratified period due to the stabilizing effects of additional heat; (iv) system-wide effects such as warmer temperature, prolonged stratified period, and river-caused epilimnion flushing are resolved by both models whereas local raised temperature and river short circuiting was only identifiable with the three-dimensional model approach. This model-based method provides an ideal tool to assess man-made impacts on lakes and their downstream outflows. © 2017. American Geophysical Union.

In sessile organisms like plants, adaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity of key functional traits are the main mechanisms through which species can respond to environmental heterogeneity and climate change. While extended research has been carried out in temperate species in this regard, there is still limited knowledge as to how species from seasonally-dry tropical climates respond to spatial and temporal variation in environmental conditions. In fact, studies of intraspecific genetically-based differences in functional traits are still largely unknown and studies in these ecosystems have largely focused on in situ comparisons where environmental and genetic effects cannot be differentiated. In this study, we tested for ecotypic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity in leaf economics spectrum (LES) traits, water use efficiency and growth rates under natural and manipulated precipitation regimes in a common garden experiment where seedlings of eight populations of the neotropical live oak Quercus oleoides were established. We also examined the extent to which intraspecific trait variation was associated with plant performance under different water availability. Similar to interspecific patterns among seasonally-dry tropical tree species, live oak populations with long and severe dry seasons had higher leaf nitrogen content and growth rates than mesic populations, which is consistent with a “fast” resource-acquisition strategy aimed to maximize carbon uptake during the wet season. Specific leaf area (SLA) was the best predictor of plant performance, but contrary to expectations, it was negatively associated with relative and absolute growth rates. This observation was partially explained by the negative association between SLA and area-based photosynthetic rates, which is contrary to LES expectations but similar to other recent intraspecific studies on evergreen oaks. Overall, our study shows strong intraspecific differences in functional traits in a tropical oak, Quercus oleoides, and suggests that precipitation regime has played an important role in driving adaptive divergence in this widespread species. © 2017 Ramírez-Valiente, Center, Sparks, Sparks, Etterson, Longwell, Pilz and Cavender-Bares.","Ecotypes; Leaf economics spectrum; Local adaptation; Neotropics; Phenotypic plasticity; Quercus oleoides; Specific leaf area; Water stress",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019266269

However, estimates of global riverine CO2 emissions remain greatly uncertain owing to the absence of a comprehensive and spatially resolved CO2 emission measurement. Based on intensive field measurements using floating chambers, riverine CO2 evasion in the Wuding River catchment on the Loess Plateau was investigated. Lateral carbon derived from soil respiration and chemical weathering played a central role in controlling the variability of riverine CO2 partial pressure (pCO2). In addition, in-stream processing of allochthonous organic carbon was an also important source of CO2 excess, modulating the influence of lateral carbon inputs. All the surveyed streams were net CO2 sources, exhibiting pronounced spatial and seasonal variabilities. The mean CO2 efflux was 172, 116, and 218 mmol m−2 d−1 in spring, summer, and autumn, respectively. Unlike the commonly observed strongest CO2 emissions in headwater streams, the increasing CO2 efflux with stream order in the Wuding River catchment reflects its unique geomorphologic landscape in controlling CO2 emissions. While in reservoirs, the pCO2 was more controlled by primary production with aquatic photosynthetic assimilation constraining it to a lower level. Both the magnitude and direction of CO2 evasion from reservoirs have been greatly altered. Contrast to streams with large CO2 effluxes, reservoirs were small carbon sources and even carbon sinks, due primarily to greatly reduced turbulence and enhanced photosynthesis. In view of the large number of reservoirs on the Loess Plateau, assessing the resulting changes to CO2 emissions and their implications for regional carbon budgets warrants further research. ©2017.

Fortunately, value-added biochars can be produced from mixed solid waste, thereby addressing solid waste management issues, and enabling long-term carbon sequestration. We hypothesize that soil deficiencies can be remedied by the application of municipal waste-based biochars. Select municipal organic wastes (newspaper, cardboard, woodchips and landscaping residues) individually or in a 25% blend of all four waste streams were used as feedstocks of biochars. Three sets of pyrolysis temperatures (350, 500, and 750 °C) and 3 sets of pyrolysis residence time (2, 4 and 6 h) were used for biochar preparation. The biochar yield was in the range of 21–62% across all feedstocks and pyrolysis conditions. We observed variations in key biochar properties such as pH, electrical conductivity, bulk density and surface area depending on the feedstocks and production conditions. Biochar increased soil pH and improved its electrical conductivity, aggregate stability, water retention and micronutrient contents. Similarly, leachate from the soil amended with biochar showed increased pH and electrical conductivity. Some elements such as Ca and Mg decreased while NO3-N increased in the leachates of soils incubated with biochars. Overall, solid waste-based biochar produced significant improvements to soil fertility parameters indicating that solid municipal wastes hold promising potential as feedstocks for manufacturing value-added biochars with varied physicochemical characteristics, allowing them to not only serve the needs for solid waste management and greenhouse gas mitigation, but also as a resource for improving the quality of depleted soils. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biochar; Carbon sequestration; Environment; Soil amendment; Sustainability","calcium; carbon; nitrate; nitrogen; sulfur; trace element; charcoal; soil; solid waste; carbon sequestration; environmental management; leachate; municipal solid waste; organic matter; physicochemical property; pyrolysis; residence time; soil amendment; soil fertility; soil quality; soil remediation; sustainability; waste management; Article; biochar; bulk density; carbon storage; controlled study; electric conductivity; environmental sustainability; leaching; municipal solid waste; organic waste; physical chemistry; pyrolysis; soil acidity; soil aggregation; soil amendment; soil analysis; soil fertility; soil quality; soil treatment; solid waste management; surface area; temperature; waste; water retention; carbon sequestration; chemistry; soil; solid waste; waste management; Carbon Sequestration; Charcoal; Soil; Solid Waste; Temperature; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011660582

The anaerobic character of pit toilet sewage causes nitrogen (N) to prevail as ammonium rather than as nitrate ions. Anaerobic decomposition of organic carbon is initially resorted to reduce competition for ammonium oxidation during subsequent aerobic treatment of sewage. A mixture of air-dried cattle manure, sand and gravel is used as a biobarrier medium for nitrate reduction. Cattle manure serves as an affordable organic carbon source; sand particles act as a medium for attached bacterial growth, while gravel improves the permeability of the barrier. Batch tests showed that anaerobic reactions reduce chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration in pit toilet sewage by 85%. Comparatively, aerobic reactions reduce ammonium concentration in sewage by 77% through assimilation, nitrification and adsorption; 6-10 h of contact between the biobarrier mix and nitrate leads to acceptable levels of denitrification (residual nitrate concentration < 45 mg/l). A modified twin-pit toilet that facilitates anaerobic decomposition of sewage in the first pit and aerobic treatment and denitrification of sewage in the second pit is constructed at Mulbagal town, Karnataka, India.","Environment; Pollution; Sewage treatment & disposal","Bioremediation; Denitrification; Fertilizers; Gravel; Manures; Mining laws and regulations; Nitrates; Organic carbon; Pollution; Sewage treatment; Aerobic treatment; Ammonium concentrations; Ammonium oxidation; Anaerobic decomposition; Anaerobic reactions; Environment; Nitrate concentration; Nitrate reduction; Chemical oxygen demand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021678178

The optimization yields a set of monetary shadow values for land and biomass carbon fluxes. These values can be interpreted as the fluxes’ socially optimal prices and can thus be used to outline a comprehensive land use sector carbon tax policy. The taxation can be organized in various ways. We present a solution that is easy to implement and monitor in practice.

PBDEs are ubiquitous in the environment and their occurrence in polar regions highlights the importance of atmospheric transport. As yet, most researches emphasized evaporative and fugitive releases of PBDEs during production, use and waste management phases. However, the recent studies have uncovered the importance of the combustion source when considering the release of PBDEs into the atmosphere. Nevertheless, complete PBDE emission inventories are lacking, and no global PBDE emissions from combustion sources have been estimated. Therefore, this study estimated the global PBDE emissions from combustion sources and illegal open burning of WEEE and e-waste, as well as evaporative and fugitive releases from commercial PBDE mixtures. We found that combustion sources and illegal open burning of e-waste globally emit PBDEs at 0.255–5.56 and 6.75 tonnes year–1, and are important PBDE emitters. The effectiveness of reducing human exposure to PBDEs will be minimized and delayed if mitigation of PBDE emissions from combustion sources is ignored. Control of PBDE emissions from combustion sources should be taken along with the ban of commercial PBDE mixtures. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Dioxin; E-waste; Inventory; Open burning; PBDEs; Review","Atmospheric movements; Combustion; Crime; Electronic Waste; Ethers; Flame retardants; Health risks; Mixtures; Reviews; Waste incineration; Waste management; Wastes; Atmospheric transport; Dioxin; Emission inventories; Inventory; Open burning; PBDEs; Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs); Potential health risks; Organic pollutants; atmospheric transport; burning; combustion; dioxin; electronic waste; emission inventory; health risk; literature review; PBDE; polar region; pollutant source; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018383388

NPV does not account for key uncertainties likely to influence relevant landholder decision making. While real options analysis (ROA) is an alternative method that accounts for the uncertainty over future conditions and the large upfront irreversible investment involved in establishing perennials, there have been limited applications of ROA to evaluating land use change decision economics and even fewer applications considering climate change risks. Further, while the influence of spatially varying climate risk on biomass conversion economic has been widely evaluated using NPV methods, effects of spatial variability and climate on land use change have been scarcely assessed with ROA. In this study we applied a simulation-based ROA model to evaluate a landholder's decision to convert land from agriculture to biomass. This spatially explicit model considers price and yield risks under baseline climate and two climate change scenarios over a geographically diverse farming region. We found that underlying variability in primary productivity across the study area had a substantial effect on conversion thresholds required to trigger land use change when compared to results from NPV analysis. Areas traditionally thought of as being quite similar in average productive capacity can display large differences in response to the inclusion of production and price risks. The effects of climate change, broadly reduced returns required for land use change to biomass in low and medium rainfall zones and increased them in higher rainfall areas. Additionally, the risks posed by climate change can further exacerbate the tendency for NPV methods to underestimate true conversion thresholds. Our results show that even under severe drying and warming where crop yield variability is more affected than perennial biomass plantings, comparatively little of the study area is economically viable for conversion to biomass under $200/DM t, and it is not until prices exceed $200/DM t that significant areas become profitable for biomass plantings. We conclude that for biomass to become a valuable diversification option the synchronisation of products and services derived from biomass and the development of markets is vital. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Australia; Biomass; Climate change; Economic; Real options analysis; Spatial","rain; agricultural land; biomass power; climate change; contingent valuation; decision making; energy market; environmental economics; investment; land use change; landholding; risk assessment; semiarid region; spatial analysis; agricultural land; Article; Australia; biomass conversion; biomass energy; biomass production; climate change; environmental economics; harvest; investment; land use; landscape; nonhuman; profit; renewable energy; risk assessment; simulation; warming; wheat; agriculture; biomass; climate; spatial analysis; Australia; Nucleopolyhedrovirus; Agriculture; Biomass; Climate; Climate Change; Spatial Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012293098

However, the storage, transport and combustion of methane within these gas-producing plants cannot be considered as an emission-free process. The emission monitoring of biogas plants is a complex challenge due to several possible single sources, which either are locally unknown and/or have a time-variant emission characteristic. In general, there are two measurement approaches. The on-site approach investigates the single emission sources and sums them up. The remote sensing approach determines the overall emission from the whole biogas plant by analyzing atmospheric methane concentrations upwind and downwind of the source area. However, the comparison of literature values remains difficult due to different measurement approaches applied on different plant configurations. Though first intercomparison measurements based on both approaches were carried out recently, the resulting emission factors still showed high deviations so that the harmonization of the measurement approaches have to be continued. However, both approaches have their benefits depending on the purpose of the emission monitoring and the chased emission mitigation strategies. In Germany, the new insight about methane emissions from biogas plants started an intensive discussion about the state of the art of emission monitoring, new limits and further regulation of plants. © 2017, ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

Observational datasets can be a useful tool in addressing this issue. During a cruise in June-July 2011, measurements of upperocean biogeochemical variables, climatically active gases and plankton community composition were collected from northwestern European seas. We used various multivariate statistical techniques to assess the relative influences of carbonate chemistry and other environmental factors on these response variables. We found that the spatial patterns in plankton communities were driven more by nutrient availability and physical variables than by carbonate chemistry. The best subset of variables able to account for phytoplankton community structure was the euphotic zone depth, silicic acid availability, mixed layer average irradiance, and nitrate concentration (59% of variance explained). The spatial variations in phytoplankton and coccolithophores species composition were both found to be more strongly associated with nutrients and physical variables than carbonate chemistry, with the latter only explaining 14 and 9% of the variance, respectively. The plankton community composition and contribution of calcifying organisms was not observed to change under lower calcite saturation state (Ω) conditions, although no regions of undersaturation (Ω<1) were encountered during the cruise. Carbonate chemistry played a more prominent, but still secondary, role in determining dinoflagellate and diatom assemblage composition (20 and 13% of total variance explained, respectively). Nutrient and physical variables also explained more of the spatial variations of most climatically active gases and selected biogeochemical response variables, although some also appeared to be influenced by carbonate chemistry. This observational study has demonstrated that ocean acidification research needs to be set in context with other environmental forcing variables to fully appreciate the primary, or indeed secondary, role that increasing fugacity of carbon dioxide has on biological communities and associated biogeochemical rates. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2017.

In fact, according to the conclusions of the 5th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), the continuous warming of the global climate since 1950 is unequivocal and is clearly attributable to the influence of human activities. This warming has caused and shall continue to cause increases in the temperatures of continental and sub-continental zones of the planet, in addition to an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme hot weather events. The future scenarios of regionalised climate change for Spain give credence to this and it is highly likely that there will be a continuous rise in temperatures and in the frequency of extreme weather events in our area.

Here, we present the sulfur geochemistry of siliciclastic sediments from two sites along the Argentine continental slope—a system characterized by dynamic deposition and reworking, which result in non-steady state conditions. The two investigated sites have different depositional histories but have in common that reactive iron phases are abundant and that organic matter is refractory—conditions that result in low organoclastic sulfate reduction rates (SRR). Deposition of reworked, isotopically light pyrite and sulfurized organic matter appear to be important contributors to the sulfur inventory, with only minor addition of pyrite from organoclastic sulfate reduction above the sulfate-methane transition (SMT). Pore-water sulfide is limited to a narrow zone at the SMT. The core of that zone is dominated by pyrite accumulation. Iron monosulfide and elemental sulfur accumulate above and below this zone. Iron monosulfide precipitation is driven by the reaction of low amounts of hydrogen sulfide with ferrous iron and is in competition with the oxidation of sulfide by iron (oxyhydr)oxides to form elemental sulfur. The intervals marked by precipitation of intermediate sulfur phases at the margin of the zone with free sulfide are bordered by two distinct peaks in total organic sulfur (TOS). Organic matter sulfurization appears to precede pyrite formation in the iron-dominated margins of the sulfide zone, potentially linked to the presence of polysulfides formed by reaction between dissolved sulfide and elemental sulfur. Thus, SMTs can be hotspots for organic matter sulfurization in sulfide-limited, reactive iron-rich marine sedimentary systems. Furthermore, existence of elemental sulfur and iron monosulfide phases meters below the SMT demonstrates that in sulfide-limited systems metastable sulfur constituents are not readily converted to pyrite but can be buried to deeper sediment depths. Our data show that in non-steady state systems, redox zones do not occur in sequence but can reappear or proceed in inverse sequence throughout the sediment column, causing similar mineral alteration processes to occur at the same time at different sediment depths. © 2017 Riedinger, Brunner, Krastel, Arnold, Wehrmann, Formolo, Beck, Bates, Henkel, Kasten and Lyons.","Biogeochemistry; Non-steady state; Subsurface sulfur cycle; Sulfate-methane transition; Sulfur isotopes","Biogeochemistry; Deposition; Hydrogen sulfide; Isotopes; Metastable phases; Methane; Pyrites; Sediments; Submarine geology; Sulfur compounds; Water; Non steady-state; Non-steady state systems; Non-steady-state conditions; Oxidation of sulfides; Siliciclastic sediments; Sulfate-methane transitions; Sulfur cycles; Sulfur isotope; Iron oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021067182

Headspace exposure of Arabidopsis thaliana to a mixture of the bicyclic monoterpenes α-pinene and β-pinene induced defense, accumulation of reactive oxygen species, and expression of SA- and SAR-related genes, including the SAR regulatory AZELAIC ACID INDUCED1 (AZI1) gene and three of its paralogs.

Arabidopsis geranylgeranyl reductase1 mutants with reduced monoterpene biosynthesis were SAR-defective but mounted normal local resistance and methyl salicylate-induced defense responses, suggesting that monoterpenes act in parallel with SA. The volatile emissions from SAR signal-emitting plants induced defense in neighboring plants, and this was associated with the presence of α-pinene, β-pinene, and camphene in the emissions of the “sender” plants.

When oxygen (O2) is reduced along with CO2 at the cathode of an anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrochemical cell, carbonate and bicarbonate are formed which are transported through electrolyte by migration from the cathode to the anode where they are oxidized back to CO2 and O2. This behavior makes AEM-based devices scientifically interesting CO2 separation devices or ""electrochemical CO2 pumps."" Electrochemical CO2 separation is a promising alternative to the state-of-the-art solvent-based methods because the cells operate at low temperatures and scale with surface area, not volume, suggesting that the industrial electrochemical systems could be more compact than amine sorption technologies. In this work, we investigate the impact of the CO2 separator cell potential on the CO2 flux, carbonate transport mechanism, and process costs. The applied electrical current and CO2 flux showed a strong correlation that was both stable and reversible. The dominant anion transport pathway, carbonate versus bicarbonate, undergoes a shift from carbonate to mixed carbonate/bicarbonate with increased potential.

It has enacted numerous policy measures at federal, federal state and local level which combined should deliver the aspired energy savings. Our contribution reviews the German governance system (multi-level policy coordination and policy feedback through monitoring and verification of energy savings), including the full set of German Sustainable Energy Action Plans (SEAPs). We find that many of the SEAPs put emphasis on CO2 reduction but neglect a systematic monitoring and verification (M&amp;V) of energy efficiency. A harmonised M&amp;V scheme covering the relevant energy aggregates and energy savings can facilitate policy feedback. Designing the M&amp;V system to the principle of cost-effectiveness can help to save costs and keep information provision and administrative burden in balance. Regarding policy coordination, the German case shows that strong formal coordination structures are a necessary condition for effective policy design, but not a sufficient one. They need to be backed up by informal coordination such as feedback loops or sharing of best practices to add a dynamic dimension. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Energy efficiency governance; Informal coordination; Monitoring and verification; Multi-level government; Policy coordination; SEAPs","Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Energy conservation; Public policy; Administrative burdens; Coordination structures; Energy efficiency policies; Informal coordination; Information provision; Multilevels; SEAPs; Sustainable energy; Energy efficiency; action plan; administrative framework; carbon dioxide; energy efficiency; energy policy; governance approach; policy analysis; sustainability; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991109202

Studies of energy futures depicted the full geologic extent of coal as a virtually unlimited backstop energy supply, drawing justification from legacy ratios of reserves-to-production (R-P) on the order of several centuries. Annual consumption and market prices for hard coal have doubled since 1990, providing an opportunity to recalibrate the next century's reference case with an empirically constrained outlook for this important industrial fuel source. Over the last two decades, improving knowledge of world coal deposits refined estimates of their recoverable portion, reducing assessed reserves by two-thirds. Coal supply costs during this period increased much faster than anticipated by models which mapped total geologic occurrences with long and flat supply curves. Consequently, underlying assumptions no longer hold for many multi-decade global energy reference cases depicting a rapid expansion of coal production – the conceptual framework for these scenarios needs revision. Energy system outlooks underlying pathways of future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions provide a case study, since the climate change research community commonly uses business-as-usual scenarios with a strong carbon signal from coal combustion many times higher than current reserve estimates. In this paper, we explain why vast expansion in 21st-century coal consumption should not be used to describe any plausible reference case of the global energy future. Illustrating coal as a practically unlimited backstop supply is inconsistent with the current state of coal markets, technology, and reserve estimates. Future coal production faces many uncertainties, but the key uncertainty for long-term scenarios is the recoverable portion of reserves, not how many total geologic resources will eventually become reserves. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Coal backstop; Coal resources; Energy economics; Greenhouse gas scenarios","Carbon; Climate change; Coal; Coal deposits; Commerce; Economics; Gas emissions; Geologic models; Greenhouse gases; Proven reserves; Annual consumption; Business-as-usual; Coal resources; Conceptual frameworks; Energy economics; Future coal productions; Research communities; Reserve estimates; Coal combustion; climate change; coal combustion; coal production; coal supply; energy resource; energy use; greenhouse gas; price dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019067889

This study summarizes results and conclusions from 20 municipalities in Sweden that have implemented the so called CERO analysis in order to adapt to future emission targets for travel. The overall aim of the study is to identify factors explaining why some municipalities are more successful than others in a benchmarking comparison. The results indicate that commuting by car is by far the most dominant source of emissions, constituting on average 76% of total annual travel emissions (including both commuting and business travel). In order to reduce these emissions, travel planning programs within organizations must address both commuting conditions and business travel conditions to reduce car dependence for work travel, e.g., employees using private cars for business trips most likely also use their own cars for commuting. To identify potential success factors as regards emissions-efficient travel, three comparative statistical analyses were conducted: grouping municipalities with low emissions in relation to the total average; analysis of car commuters' willingness to change travel mode; and before-and-after analyses of municipalities implementing specific action plans. The results revealed that municipalities conducting follow-up studies 2 years after implementing travel planning programs all lowered their total CO2 emissions, by on average 10% during a 2-year period. Overall, these municipalities achieved redistribution to alternative travel modes but also reduced total travel mileage. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Analysis; backcasting; benchmarking; CERO; climate; efficiency; modelling; planning; sustainable; systems; transport; travel","Benchmarking; Carbon dioxide; Computer systems; Efficiency; Models; Planning; Analysis; Backcasting; CERO; climate; sustainable; transport; travel; Transportation; action plan; benchmarking; commuting; comparative study; emission control; future prospect; modeling; strategic approach; sustainability; transportation planning; transportation system; travel behavior; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011411542

For these measurements, Multi-Gas sensors provide low-cost in situ monitoring of gas composition but to date have lacked the ability to detect halogens. Here, two Multi-Gas instruments characterized passive outgassing emissions from Mt. Etna’s (Italy) three summit craters, Voragine (VOR), North-east Crater (NEC) and Bocca Nuova (BN) on 2 October 2013. Signal processing (Sensor Response Model, SRM) approaches are used to analyse H2S/SO2 and HCl/SO2 ratios. A new ability to monitor volcanic HCl using miniature electrochemical sensors is here demonstrated. A “direct-exposure” Multi-Gas instrument contained SO2, H2S and HCl sensors, whose sensitivities, cross-sensitivities and response times were characterized by laboratory calibration. SRM analysis of the field data yields H2S/SO2 and HCl/SO2 molar ratios, finding H2S/SO2 = 0.02 (0.01–0.03), with distinct HCl/SO2 for the VOR, NEC and BN crater emissions of 0.41 (0.38–0.43), 0.58 (0.54–0.60) and 0.20 (0.17–0.33). A second Multi-Gas instrument provided CO2/SO2 and H2O/SO2 and enabled cross-comparison of SO2. The Multi-Gas-measured SO2-HCl-H2S-CO2-H2O compositions provide insights into volcanic outgassing. H2S/SO2 ratios indicate gas equilibration at slightly below magmatic temperatures, assuming that the magmatic redox state is preserved. Low SO2/HCl alongside low CO2/SO2 indicates a partially outgassed magma source. We highlight the potential for low-cost HCl sensing of H2S-poor HCl-rich volcanic emissions elsewhere. Further tests are needed for H2S-rich plumes and for long-term monitoring. Our study brings two new advances to volcano hazard monitoring: real-time in situ measurement of HCl and improved Multi-Gas SRM measurements of gas ratios. © 2017, The Author(s).","Chlorine; E-nose; Electronic nose; Halogen; Multi-Gas instrument; Open-system volcanic degassing; Volcanic outgassing","atmospheric chemistry; chemical composition; chlorine; crater; degassing; electrochemical method; halogen; hydrogen sulfide; in situ measurement; phase equilibrium; sensor; sulfur compound; volcanic gas; Catania [Sicily]; Etna; Italy; Sicily",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017553230

In 2010, the TMG introduced a mandatory CO2 emission reduction and a cap-and-trade scheme; the world's first such scheme that sets binding targets for buildings. The research was carried out through reviews of the published and unpublished literature, surveys and face-to-face interviews with various stakeholders involved in the policy process. The essential components that enabled successful policy-making and implementation of the scheme in Tokyo are revealed, such as the administrative leadership and the capacity of the TMG administration, the availability of historical data supporting the policy discussions and the gradual and flexible implementation mechanisms. The article concludes with recommendations for future improvements in the TMG and beyond. Policy relevance This article presents the lessons from the recent advancements in climate policy in Tokyo, particularly the world's first mandatory city-scale emission reduction and cap-and-trade scheme that includes buildings. The scheme was relatively effective as the total GHG emissions were reduced by 23% on average from the base years and 10% below the average of other parts of the country before the end of the first compliance period of five years (2010–2014). The policy innovations from the world's largest city and the capital of Japan can inform sub-national governments about the potential barriers and opportunities for introducing mandatory GHG emissions reductions. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","city; emission trading scheme; governance; Japan; sub-national; Tokyo","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; emissions trading; environmental policy; governance approach; innovation; policy implementation; policy making; stakeholder; Honshu; Japan; Kanto; Tokyo [Kanto]; Tokyo [Tokyo (PRF)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961218707

The reduced size of spring habitats makes them prone to drying events, which are more frequent in dryer climates. Frequent disturbances may lead to local extinctions followed by colonisations from nearby sites, in a source–sink dynamics. Early recolonisation leads to random assemblages and reduces the match between organisms and environmental conditions. As a consequence, a low amount of community variation can be explained by environmental variables. Conversely, the settled communities from wetter climates best fit the ecological characteristics of sites, and deterministic processes, such as species sorting, dominate the assemblages. In conclusion, in the studied regions, ostracod communities from small water bodies of dryer climates seem to be mainly driven by stochastic dynamics when compared to more continental areas. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Assembly rules; Climate; Metacommunity analysis; Ostracod; Spring","arid region; assembly rule; community ecology; environmental conditions; environmental factor; ostracod; source-sink dynamics; spring (hydrology); stochasticity; Europe; Ostracoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982290294

SCCs are used to estimate the benefits of CO2 reductions from policies. However, little is known about the modeling underlying the values or the implied societal risks, making SCC estimates difficult to interpret and assess. This study performs the first in-depth examination of SCC modeling using controlled diagnostic experiments that yield detailed intermediate results, allow for direct comparison of individual components of the models, and facilitate evaluation of the individual model SCCs. Specifically, we analyze DICE, FUND, and PAGE and the multimodel approach used by the US Government. Through our component assessments, we trace SCC differences back to intermediate variables and specific features. We find significant variation in component-level behavior between models driven by model-specific structural and implementation elements, some resulting in artificial differences in results. These elements combine to produce model-specific tendencies in climate and damage responses that contribute to differences observed in SCC outcomes - producing PAGE SCC distributions with longer and fatter right tails and higher averages, followed by DICE with more compact distributions and lower averages, and FUND with distributions that include net benefits and the lowest averages. Overall, our analyses reveal fundamental model behavior relevant to many disciplines of climate research, and identify issues with the models, as well as the overall multimodel approach, that need further consideration. With the growing prominence of SCCs in decision-making, ranging from the local-level to international, improved transparency and technical understanding is essential for informed decisions. © 2017 The Author(s).","carbon cycle; climate change; damages; impacts; Social cost of carbon; social cost of greenhouse gases",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021813385

We show that effective control of the wide resistive region between dissipation-free and completely ohmic transport regime can be achieved by evaporating a half-metallic strip, made from a Co2CrAl compound in our case, directly onto a type-II superconducting film, a Mo56Re44 alloy in our case, and tuning the spin-polarized injection current. We have revealed steps-like features in current-voltage characteristics of the Mo-Re films, even without any injection, and explained it within a 'self-injection' scenario in contacts formed by ferromagnetic (F) and superconducting (S) layers. At certain injection levels, a set of resistive metastable states following the main criteria for the phase-slip events was observed. We have found that low magnetic fields, even less than the lower critical field of the Mo-Re alloy, have a significant impact on the resistive transition region of the S film probably due to their effect on the magnetic ordering in the F strip, thus producing a strong coupling between transport characteristics of proximized S and F layers. © 2016 IEEE.","current-voltage characteristics; half-metallic layers; Phase-slip lines; Proximity effect; resistive transport regime; superconducting films","Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Current voltage characteristics; F region; Molybdenum alloys; Rhenium alloys; Ternary alloys; Thin films; Half-metallic; Phase slip lines; Proximity effects; Resistive transition; resistive transport regime; Spin-polarized injection; Superconducting coherence length; Transport characteristics; Superconducting films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012927223

The nitrogen cycle, in particular, is driven by microorganisms responsible for the fixation and loss of nitrogen, and the reduction-oxidation transformations of bio-available nitrogen. Within marine systems, nitrogen availability is often the limiting factor in the growth of autotrophic organisms, intrinsically linking the nitrogen and carbon cycles. In order to elucidate the state of these cycles in the past, and help envisage present and future variability, it is essential to understand the specific microbial processes responsible for transforming bio-available nitrogen species. As most microorganisms are soft-bodied and seldom leave behind physical fossils in the sedimentary record, recalcitrant lipid biomarkers are used to unravel microbial processes in the geological past. This review emphasises the recent advances in marine nitrogen cycle lipid biomarkers, underlines the missing links still needed to fully elucidate past shifts in this biogeochemically-important cycle, and provides examples of biomarker applications in the geological past. © 2017 The Authors.

The overall climate targets adopted for Oslo 2030–2050 were to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% (2030) and to zero in 2050. To achieve these goals, several measures for the various municipal sectors have to be implemented. For the transport sector, the most important measure is to ensure transition from individual car transport to public transport, cycling and walking, green goods transportation. Having a fossil free society in 2050, then it is crucial to reverse trends to changing people’s behaviour. If car traffic inside the city centre will be banned, then the consequences need to be evaluated. The concern for the disabled, goods transportation, public transit and residents must be safeguarded. Through comparison with other cities that are partially car-free, we have described some consequences that must be taken into account when implementing the green policy. Several methods are used, a literature review and face-to-face interviews. A study-tour to Germany and France included city-walks, and interviews with urban and transport planners and politicians from the cities of Nuremberg, Freiburg, and Strasbourg. These cities were chosen because of their log experience with implementation of pedestrianized city centres. The provision of pedestrianized city centre in Oslo may at first glance seem like a political stunt from an inexperienced visionary political party. Drastic measures must be implemented, that requires thoughtful planning and participation. A car-free city centre cannot be completed at the expense of the population, and to have a good planning phase will be more important than the goal of implementing the measures within a certain time limit. Achieving good accessibility for all affected may potentially lead to a vibrant cityscape, suitable for many. © 2017 WIT Press.","Car-free; Oslo city centre; Sustainable transport; Urban development",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047955350

Engineered biocovers (i.e., a mixture of soil and organic matter) can be used for gas emission control in landfills. One of the key factors affecting methane oxidation and methane removal by engineered biocovers in general is the temperature in the biocover material, which is in turn influenced by the ambient temperature. This study compares the efficacy of methane removal in a biocover consisting of a mature compost and soil mixture at different temperatures using three column tests. Methane removal efficiencies and temporal variation of methane mass flux were determined based on measured methane content at different locations within the biocover material profiles. In all cases, methane content at the top was considerably lower than that of the inflow. However, the efficiency of the column at 22°C was significantly higher than that of the one placed at 11°C. Based on scanning electron microscopy images taken from the upper section of the columns, evident formation of stacks of materials and reduction of pore spaces in all cases were observed and were interpreted qualitatively as a consequence of biological activity leading to formation of bacterial colonies, biofilm, or carbonate precipitate over biocover material particles. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Biocover; Methane oxidation; Municipal solid waste landfill","Bioactivity; Biological materials; Composting; Efficiency; Emission control; Exhaust systems (engine); Land fill; Methanation; Methane; Mixtures; Oxidation; Scanning electron microscopy; Solid wastes; Biocover; Carbonate precipitates; Efficiency of the columns; Material particles; Methane oxidation; Municipal solid waste landfills; Removal efficiencies; Scanning electron microscopy image; Municipal solid waste; bacterium; bicarbonate; biofilm; compost; emission control; landfill; methane; municipal solid waste; oxidation; performance assessment; temporal variation; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019947656

These changes and the statistical significances of individual and combined effects of treatment and cultivar or rootstocks showed great differences among the cultivars and rootstocks. So B/C rates helped us to evaluate the tolerance to lime induced chlorosis of the cultivars and rootstocks. B/C referring Fe efficiency ratio calculated as the value for the bicarbonate treatment divided by that for the control for each parameter studied used for tolerance state of cultivars and rootstocks. According to B/C ratios calculated for active and total Fe, FCR, the MG and RG grafted on both rootstocks regarded as tolerant cultivars. In addition to this, the MM106 rootstock was more tolerant than the M9 rootstock under bicarbonate applied condition giving higher B/C ratio for active and total Fe, total chlorophyll, FCR and APX but lower MDA concentrations. It can be concluded that suitable cultivar-rootstock combinations is a good strategy to overcome Fe chlorosis in apple plants grown in calcareous soils. © 2017","Apple cultivars; Lime-induced chlorosis; M9; MM106; Oxidative stress; Rootstocks","bicarbonate; bioaccumulation; calcareous soil; chelate; clay loam; cultivar; disease incidence; fruit; oxidative stress; rootstock; tolerance; Malus x domestica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014951780

Modelers use emissions inventories to represent the temporal and spatial distribution of these emissions needed to estimate their impacts on regional and global air quality. However, large uncertainties exist in emissions estimates. Thus, assessing differences in these inventories is essential for the better understanding of air pollution over China. We compare five different emissions inventories estimating emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 μm or less (PM10) from China. The emissions inventories analyzed in this paper include the Regional Emission inventory in ASia v2.1 (REAS), the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC), the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research v4.2 (EDGAR), the inventory by Yu Zhao (ZHAO), and the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS). We focus on the period between 2000 and 2008, during which Chinese economic activities more than doubled. In addition to national totals, we also analyzed emissions from four source sectors (industry, transport, power, and residential) and within seven regions in China (East, North, Northeast, Central, Southwest, Northwest, and South) and found that large disagreements exist among the five inventories at disaggregated levels. These disagreements lead to differences of 67 μgm-3, 15 ppbv, and 470 ppbv for monthly mean PM10O3 and CO, respectively, in modeled regional concentrations in China. We also find that all the inventory emissions estimates create a volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited environment and MEIC emissions lead to much lower O3 mixing ratio in East and Central China compared to the simulations using REAS and EDGAR estimates, due to their low VOC emissions. Our results illustrate that a better understanding of Chinese emissions at more disaggregated levels is essential for finding effective mitigation measures for reducing national and regional air pollution in China. © Author(s) 2017.",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; comparative study; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; human activity; spatiotemporal analysis; volatile organic compound; China; Citrus maxima",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020033329

Changes in engine technologies can alter emissions. To quantify these effects, we measured gas- and particle-phase emissions from 82 light-duty gasoline vehicles recruited from the California in-use fleet tested on a chassis dynamometer using the cold-start unified cycle. The fleet included 15 GDI vehicles, including 8 GDIs certified to the most-stringent emissions standard, superultra-low-emission vehicles (SULEV). We quantified the effects of engine technology, emission certification standards, and cold-start on emissions. For vehicles certified to the same emissions standard, there is no statistical difference of regulated gas-phase pollutant emissions between PFIs and GDIs. However, GDIs had, on average, a factor of 2 higher particulate matter (PM) mass emissions than PFIs due to higher elemental carbon (EC) emissions. SULEV certified GDIs have a factor of 2 lower PM mass emissions than GDIs certified as ultralow-emission vehicles (3.0 ± 1.1 versus 6.3 ± 1.1 mg/mi), suggesting improvements in engine design and calibration. Comprehensive organic speciation revealed no statistically significant differences in the composition of the volatile organic compounds emissions between PFI and GDIs, including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX). Therefore, the secondary organic aerosol and ozone formation potential of the exhaust does not depend on engine technology. Cold-start contributes a larger fraction of the total unified cycle emissions for vehicles meeting more-stringent emission standards. Organic gas emissions were the most sensitive to cold-start compared to the other pollutants tested here. There were no statistically significant differences in the effects of cold-start on GDIs and PFIs. For our test fleet, the measured 14.5% decrease in CO2 emissions from GDIs was much greater than the potential climate forcing associated with higher black carbon emissions. Thus, switching from PFI to GDI vehicles will likely lead to a reduction in net global warming.

Here, the role of the Antarctic surface height for meridional heat transport and local radiative feedbacks, including the surface albedo feedback, was investigated based on CO2-doubling experiments in a low-resolution coupled climate model. When Antarctica was assumed to be flat, the north-south asymmetry of the zonal mean top of the atmosphere radiation budget was notably reduced. Doubling CO2 in a flat Antarctica (flat AA) model setup led to a stronger increase in southern hemispheric poleward atmospheric and oceanic heat transport compared to the base model setup. Based on partial radiative perturbation (PRP) computations, it was shown that local radiative feedbacks and an increase in the CO2 forcing in the deeper atmospheric column also contributed to stronger Antarctic warming in the flat AA model setup, and the roles of the individual radiative feedbacks are discussed in some detail. A considerable fraction (between 24 and 80% for three consecutive 25-year time slices starting in year 51 and ending in year 126 after CO2 doubling) of the polar amplification asymmetry was explained by the difference in surface height, but the fraction was subject to transient changes and might to some extent also depend on model uncertainties. In order to arrive at a more reliable estimate of the role of land height for the observed polar amplification asymmetry, additional studies based on ensemble runs from higher-resolution models and an improved model setup with a more realistic gradual increase in the CO2 concentration are required. © Author(s) 2017.",,"Atmospheric movements; Budget control; Climate models; Heat transfer; Ozone layer; Solar radiation; Uncertainty analysis; Antarctic ozone depletion; Coupled climate model; Meridional heat transports; Model uncertainties; North-south asymmetry; Polar amplifications; Radiative perturbation; Top of the atmospheres; Carbon dioxide; albedo; amplification; carbon dioxide; climate modeling; concentration (composition); height; ozone depletion; polar motion; radiative transfer; Southern Hemisphere; Antarctica; Arctic; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019617062

An important factor is related to the presence of significant water losses, which result in an increase in the supply volume and therefore a higher energy consumption for treatment and pumping, without effectively supplying users. The current European environmental strategy is committed to sustainable development by generating action plans to improve the environmental performance of products and services. The analysis of carbon footprints is considered one such improvement, allowing for the evaluation of the environmental impact of single production phases. Using this framework, the aim of the study is to apply a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology to quantify the carbon footprint of an overall integrated urban water system referring to ISO/TS 14067 (2013). This methodology uses an approach known as ""cradle to grave"" and presumes to conduct an objective assessment of product units, balancing energy, and matter flows along the production process. The methodology was applied to a real case study, i.e., the integrated urban water system of the Palermo metropolitan area in Sicily (Italy). Each process in the system was characterized and globally evaluated from the point of view of water loss, energy consumption, and CO2 production, and some mitigation strategies are proposed and evaluated to reduce the energy consumption and, consequently, the environmental impact of the system. © 2017 by the authors.","Carbon footprint; LCA methodology; Urban water system; Water losses","Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Life cycle; Planning; Reservoirs (water); Sustainable development; Water quality; Waterworks; Environmental performance; Environmental strategy; Integrated urban water systems; LCA methodology; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Products and services; Urban water systems; Water loss; Produced Water; action plan; carbon dioxide; carbon footprint; energy use; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; performance assessment; quantitative analysis; sustainable development; urban area; water quality; Italy; Palermo [Sicily]; Sicily",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020620655

The negative effects of AC+clay were observed on a wide range of species with different feeding strategies, although the suspension feeding brittle star Amphiura filiformis was particularly affected. Even though activated carbon is effective in reducing sediment-to-water fluxes of dioxins and other organic pollutants, this study shows that capping with powdered AC can lead to substantial disturbances to the benthic community. © 2017, The Author(s).","Benthic community; Benthic ecology; Contaminated sediment; Feeding guilds; Macrofauna; Remediation","abundance; activated carbon; benthic fauna; benthos; biomass; community composition; contaminated land; dioxin; disturbance; experimental study; field method; fjord; guild; mercury (element); remediation; sediment pollution; Grenland; Norway; Telemark; Amphiura filiformis; Ophiuroidea; aluminum silicate; charcoal; clay; animal; aquatic species; biomass; ecosystem restoration; estuary; food chain; Norway; population dynamics; sediment; Aluminum Silicates; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Biomass; Charcoal; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Estuaries; Food Chain; Geologic Sediments; Norway; Population Dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017576796

This study aims to estimate and compare direct and indirect emissions and environmental impacts at foundation and structure construction stages of a building using a case study. The case study is multi-storey commercial building construction with concrete framing. A process based methodology is developed to estimate emissions from seven sources that contribute to both greenhouse gas (GHG) and non-GHG emissions. An impact assessment is also carried out to compare the environmental impacts for different stages of construction from global, regional and local perspectives. The results highlight an overpowering indirect GHG contribution of 89% from material embodied emissions at the structure construction stage. Direct GHG emissions at the foundation construction are prominent with a contribution of 12.7% and 13.4% for emissions from equipment usage and transportation respectively. Nitrous Oxides (NOx) and Carbon Monoxides (CO) are recorded as the most prominent non-GHG emissions. The results were further analysed based on four scenarios corresponding to direct and indirect emissions. The results signified a GHG emission reduction of 12% can be achieved by adopting sustainable materials such as fly ash and blast furnace concrete. The impact assessment results illustrate a large contribution to global warming potential (GWP) with a value of over 98% for the construction stage from the global perspective. This large contribution from GWP is reduced to 60% and 57% with relative high contributions from Photochemical Oxidation Potential (POFP) with 26% and 34% at regional and local levels. The scenario analyses on direct emissions highlight the importance of resource utilisation in reducing impacts at local level. The results indicate that identification of the significant emission sources and impact categories at different construction stages, prior to implementing emission reduction opportunities such as usage of sustainable materials and operational optimisation of construction equipment and transportation vehicles is key to minimising impacts at building construction. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Buildings; Construction; Emissions; Environmental impacts; Foundation; Structure","Blast furnaces; Buildings; Carbon; Carbon monoxide; Concretes; Construction; Construction equipment; Crashworthiness; Emission control; Environmental impact; Fly ash; Foundations; Gas emissions; Global warming; Materials handling; Nitrogen oxides; Office buildings; Particulate emissions; Structure (composition); Sustainable development; Building construction; Environmental emissions; Foundation construction; Global warming potential; Photochemical oxidation; Structure constructions; Sustainable materials; Transportation vehicles; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016480946

For being effective and not leading to production relocation in the long-run, unilateral climate policy should be moderate, implemented by a sufficiently larger area and complemented by mechanisms promoting the international transfer of clean technologies. The model indicates that the smaller area cannot take the lead in global climate mitigation for a protracted time period.

This approach has proved inefficient because of low adoption of the so-called improved technologies. This paper describes the strategic approaches to the development of a climate-smart village (CSV) model in the groundnut basin of Senegal. A CSV model is a participatory integrated approach using climate information, improved context-based technologies/practices aiming at reachingimproved productivity (food and nutrition security), climate resilient people and ecosystem and climate mitigation. In this study, participatory vulnerability analysis, planning adaptation capacity and participatory communication for development were implemented, putting people affected by the impacts of climate change (CC) at the center of the approach. Four interdependent groups of activities/domains, namely-local and institutional knowledge, use of climate information services, development of climate-smart technology and local development plans, were covered. It was emphasized, how all this taken together could create improved livelihoods for women, men and vulnerable groups. Results: The approach made it possible to involve local people in the decision-making process for the development of their adaptation capacity to CC. It also helped to set up an overall land management process by identifying and addressing environmental (sustainable resource management, ecosystem resilience) and socioeconomic (institutional organization, empowerment, poverty alleviation and food security) challenges. A monitoring survey revealed that farmers appreciate well this participatory approach compared to previous top-down approach in that the former allow them to own the process. Also determinant drivers of adoption of the technologies were identified. Conclusion: Scaling this community development model in sites with similar climatic and socioeconomic conditions could help in contributing toward achieving food security in rural areas at wider scale because of better enthusiasm and engagement from rural farmers to pursue solution to their constraints taking into consideration constraints posed by climate and more need based and tailored advisory services. © 2017 The Author(s).","Adaptation; Climate-smart technologies; Resilience; Sustainable development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019145728

Where vehicles are the largest contributor to air pollution up to 70%-80%, while 20%-30% caused by industrial activities. The increasing number of vehicles which perform movements will result in more emissions of vehicles in the free air of the city. Traffic is also influenced by the presence of land use. One of the types of land use that have considerable influence against the movement of traffic is trade. Along with the development of transport activities in the area of Pasar Besar Malang city (the Biggest Traditional Market in Malang), it will cause problems such as traffic jam and air pollution. Therefore, the need for proper handling of the problem of traffic jam and air pollution in the area of Pasar Besar that is to identify the performance of road traffic around area of Pasar Besar and calculate the quantity of CO2 emissions based on the footprint of transport on the area of Pasar Besar.

Studies involving the effect of adopting integrated systems on greenhouse gas mitigation are essential for choosing sustainable agricultural systems. In this study, the emissions of nitrous oxide in a crop-livestock system (4-year crop/pasture rotation) compared with two continuous crop (CC) areas under conventional and no-tillage management were investigated. The treatments consisted of continuous cropping under no-tillage (CC-NT), continuous cropping with annual heavy disc harrow (CC-CT), an integrated crop-livestock system under no-tillage (CLS-NT) and native Cerrado as a reference. Considering the cumulative N2O emissions in a year, the CC-CT emitted 2.55 kg N-N2O ha−1, higher than the Cerrado, which emitted 0.55 kg N-N2O ha−1. All the agricultural systems emitted more N2O than the Cerrado, however, the two conservation systems CC-NT and CLS-NT had lower emissions than the CC-CT, and were responsible for 1.90 and 1.52 kg N-N2O ha−1, respectively. In the agroecosystems, the highest N2O fluxes were observed after fertilization and rainfall events. In the CC systems, N2O emissions were greater than in the integrated system during the sorghum/off-season period, but in the CC-CT emissions were greater than in CC-NT. During the soybean cycle no differences in emissions were observed between both CC systems, which surpassed that in CLS-NT that was occupied by Brachiaria pasture. The annual cumulative N2O emissions in CLS-NT were close to that observed in the Cerrado indicating this system to be an agricultural practice with potential to mitigate N2O emissions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Brachiaria brizantha; Greenhouse gas emissions; Integrated systems; Intercropping; No till","agricultural ecosystem; agricultural emission; agricultural management; alternative agriculture; cerrado; clay soil; cropping practice; flux measurement; grass; greenhouse gas; intercropping; mixed farming; nitrous oxide; Oxisol; pasture; sorghum; soybean; zero tillage; Brazil; Brachiaria; Glycine max; Urochloa brizantha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009454836

This research encompasses the environments of stars of different spectral types and evolutionary status. In this article, we focus on the possibility of habitable moons in selected F-star systems. Materials and Methods: We explore the astrobiological significance of F-type stars of spectral type between F5 V and F9.5 V, which possess Jupiter-type planets within or close to their climatological habitable zones. These planets, or at least a subset of those, may also possess rocky exomoons, which potentially offer habitable environments. Our work considers eight selected systems. The Jupiter-type planets in these systems are in notably differing orbits with eccentricities between 0.08 (about Mars) and 0.72. We consider the stellar UV environments provided by the photospheric stellar radiation, which allows us to compute the UV habitable zones for the systems. Following previous studies, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is taken as a proxy for carbon-based macromolecules following the paradigm that extraterrestrial biology might be based on hydrocarbons. Results: We found that the damage inflicted on DNA is notably different for the range of systems studied, and also varies according to the orbit of the Jupiter-type planet, especially for systems of high ellipticity, as expected. Furthermore, the UV levels in the CLI-HZs of the F-type stars are generally more severe than for the solar environment, except for regions beyond the outer limits of the general habitable zones. Particular emphasis was placed on locations akin to Earth-equivalent (i.e., homeothermic) positions in the Solar System. The general conditions of habitability in F-star systems are also affected by the rapidness of stellar evolution; nonetheless, based on previous research on the origin of life on Earth, a generally favorable assessment about the overall possibility of life around F-type stars can be conveyed. For some systems studied here, excessive values of damage are attained if compared to today's Earth or during the Archean eon. Conclusion: Considering that the detection of exomoons around different types of stars will remain challenging in the foreseeable future, we view our work also as an example and template for investigating the combined requirements of climatological and UV-based habitability for exosolar objects. Further studies for systems of stars with other spectral types and/or other evolutionary status will be considered as part of our future research. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Being directly involved in air pollution and indirectly in climate change, understanding what factors drive BVOC emissions is a prerequisite for modeling their emissions and predict air pollution. The main algorithms currently used to model BVOC emissions are mainly light and/or temperature dependent. Additional factors such as seasonality and drought also influence isoprene emissions, especially in the Mediterranean region, which is characterized by a rather long drought period in summer. These factors are increasingly included in models but only for the principal studied BVOC, namely isoprene, but there are still some discrepancies in estimations of emissions. In this study, the main BVOCs emitted by Quercus pubescens-isoprene, methanol, acetone, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, MACR, MVK and ISOPOOH (these three last compounds detected under the same m/z)-were monitored with a PTR-ToF-MS over an entire seasonal cycle during both in situ natural and amplified drought, which is expected with climate change. Amplified drought impacted all studied BVOCs by reducing emissions in spring and summer while increasing emissions in autumn. All six BVOCs monitored showed daytime light and temperature dependencies while three BVOCs (methanol, acetone and formaldehyde) also showed emissions during the night despite the absence of light under constant temperature. Moreover, methanol and acetaldehyde burst in the early morning and formaldehyde deposition and uptake were also punctually observed, which were not assessed by the classical temperature and light models. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"biogenic emission; climate change; deciduous tree; drought; isoprene; seasonality; volatile organic compound; Mediterranean Region; Quercus pubescens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021144171

However, there is a general need to increase grain legume protein production in Europe so as to meet the increasing demand while reducing resource utilization, thereby contributing to mitigation of global climate change. Taking this need into consideration, a field-based experiment with pea (Pisum sativum L.) was carried out in a field certified for organic agriculture from November 2014 to June 2015. The experiment was laid out in a split-plot design with two main treatments (conventional and organic farming system) and four subplots per main plot corresponding to four different pea genotypes, particularly one commercial cultivar ('Onward'), and three local landraces ('Amorgos', 'Andros' and 'Schinousa'). Standard inorganic fertilizer (11-15-15, N:P2O5:K2O) and sheep manure were used as base dressings in the conventional and the organically-treated plots, respectively. The aim of the experiment was to test the performance of each pea genotype in organic farming crops as compared to conventional cropping, in terms of: green seed yield, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The results of this study indicate that 'Andros' increased significantly the above-ground biomass and the fresh green seed production on the harvesting date when compared with all the other genotypes. In addition, there were significant differences in cumulative N2O fluxes between the pea cultivars with 'Schinousa' producing the highest N2O amounts and 'Andros' the lowest. In conclusion, the pea genotype seems to have a strong influence on both GHG emissions and production and therefore, appropriate selection of cultivars is imperative for efficient use of this legume in organic cropping systems.","Conventional; Genotype; Legume; Organic agriculture; Pisum sativum",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028811845

However, majority of the trees, Emblica officinalis, Terminalia, Acacia nilotica, Holoptelea integrifolia, etc. are under-represented, despite their frequent occurrence. Their irregular record in the pollen rain could be attributed to low pollen-productivity since they are entomophillous as well as partial pollen preservation.

The aim of this study was to determine the nutritional status, soil and plant analysis of strawberry plants organically grown under climatic conditions of Yumurtalik town of Adana, Turkey. The study was conducted between 2010 and 2012. In the trial; (1) cowpea (Vigna sinensis L.), and (2) bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) were used as green manuring crops; and one plot (3) was used as the control (plot where green fertilizer was not used and kept as fallow). Additionally, the effects of organic commercial compost material Ekoflora (N:P:K 1.5:2:2) and compost tea that was obtained from Ekoflora were also investigated on the split plots throughout the growing season. Green manure was used in the trial conducted as four replications as treatments (control, cowpea and bean) being the main plots and farm manure used as sub plots. Fresh strawberry seedlings of 'Sweet Charlie' cultivar were used in the trial. It was found that green manure + compost tea application increased organic matter, total nitrogen and available phosphorus and potassium contents of the soil and decreased available calcium and magnesium values. The organic matter (OM) content averaged to 2.32% in green manure applications, and organic matter average value of green manure + organic manure application was 2.38% revealing that average organic matter level was increased by 0.06%.

Using the discrete choice experiment, the authors elicit the preferences of approximately 4098 respondents from the Czech Republic, Poland, and UK for the GHG emission reduction policies that differ in four attributes: emission reduction target, burden sharing across the EU Member States, the distribution of costs within each country, and cost. The three specific reduction targets analysed correspond to the EU 2050 Roadmap and deep decarbonization policy (80% target), the climate-energy 2014 targets (40% target), and the status quo policy (20% target); each will result in a specific emission trajectory by 2050. The results reveal stark differences between the three countries. Czechs would be on average willing to pay around EUR 13 per household per month for the 40% GHG emission reductions by 2030 or EUR 17 for 80% reductions by 2050, and the citizens of the UK are willing to pay about EUR 45. Conversely, the mean willingness to pay (WTP) of Polish households for achieving more stringent targets is not statistically different from zero. The WTP for adopting policies to reach the 40% and 80% targets are not statistically different in any of the examined countries. However, it was found that the preferences in all three countries are highly heterogeneous. In addition, an insight is provided into the preferred characteristics of the future GHG emission reduction policies. Policy relevance A detailed understanding of the acceptability of climate mitigation policies among the general public is crucial for identifying the potential for improvements in their design. This study examines the public acceptability of the EU’s future mitigation policies. The authors elicit preferences of respondents from three EU countries for three different emission trajectories and reduction targets through policy packages that include several options to share the burden among the EU Member States and to distribute the costs among citizens of each country. Preferences are analysed for each attribute and the willingness-to-pay values for several alternative policy packages are derived. The authors believe that understanding public acceptability can help support the successful implementation of climate mitigation policies. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Burden sharing; climate change mitigation policy; consumer preferences; cost distribution; discrete choice experiments; GHG emission targets","climate change; discrete choice analysis; emission control; environmental policy; European Union; greenhouse gas; mitigation; policy analysis; policy implementation; public attitude; willingness to pay; Czech Republic; Poland [Central Europe]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002376232

As an example case study, the December 2014 flood in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, was investigated. Atmospheric conditions at the onset of the flood event are described and evaluated with respect to the general weather circulation, initial wetness, and event precipitation. Persistent, predominantly westerly general weather circulations (GWCs) directed several low-pressure systems over the North Sea to Schleswig-Holstein during December 2014, accompanied by prolonged rainfall and finally a strong precipitation event in southern Schleswig-Holstein, causing several inland gauges to exceed their, by then maximum, water levels. Results show that the antecedent precipitation index (API) is able to reflect the soil moisture conditions and, in combination with the maximum 3-day precipitation sum (R3d), to capture the two main drivers finally leading to the flood: (1) the initial wetness of north-western Schleswig-Holstein and (2) strong event precipitation in southern and eastern Schleswig-Holstein from 21 to 23 December; at the same time, both indices exceeded their respective 5-year return periods. Further, trend analyses show that both API and R3d have been increasing during recent years, while regional patterns match the north-eastward shift of cyclone pathways, leading to a higher risk of flooding in Schleswig-Holstein. Within the network of experts, investigations of these and further indices/drivers for earth system changes (e.g. wind surge and sea level rise) derived from observations, reanalyses, and regional climate model data are planned for all German coastal areas. Results can be expected to lead to improved adaptation measures to floods under climate change conditions wherever catchments have to be drained and infrastructures and ecosystems may be harmed. © Author(s) 2017.",,"Atmospheric movements; Catchments; Climate change; Climate models; Earth (planet); Precipitation (meteorology); Regional planning; Sea level; Soil moisture; Storms; Water levels; Atmospheric conditions; Digital infrastructures; Low pressure systems; Precipitation events; Precipitation indices; Regional climate modeling; Schleswig holsteins; Transport infrastructure; Floods; climate change; flood; low pressure system; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; regional climate; soil moisture; transportation infrastructure; trend analysis; weather; Germany; Schleswig-Holstein",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020533010

The size and composition of these dusts, however, have not been well described. We evaluated the full size distribution (from 0 to 100 μm in aerodynamic diameter) and chemical/biological composition of inhalable dusts inside several Colorado dairy parlors. Four aerodynamic size fractions (<3, 3-10, 10-30, and >30 μm) were collected and analyzed using a combination of physiochemical techniques to understand the structure of bacterial communities and chemical constituents. Airborne particulate mass followed a bimodal size distribution (one mode at 3 μm and a second above 30 μm), which also correlated with the relative concentrations of the following microbiological markers: bacterial endotoxin, 3-hydroxy fatty acids, and muramic acid. Sequencing of the 16S-rRNA components of this aerosol revealed a microbiome derived predominantly from animal sources. Bacterial genera included Staphlyococcus, Pseudomonas, and Streptococcus, all of which have proinflammatory and pathogenic capacity. Our results suggest that the size distribution of bioaerosols emitted by dairy operations extends well above 10 μm in diameter and contains a diverse mixture of potentially hazardous constituents and opportunistic pathogens. These findings should inform the development of more effective emissions control strategies. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Aerodynamics; Aerosols; Agriculture; Biohazards; Chemical analysis; Chemical hazards; Chemical operations; Dust; Fatty acids; Hazards; Health hazards; RNA; Size distribution; 3-Hydroxy fatty acids; Aerodynamic diameters; Bimodal size distribution; Chemical and biologicals; Chemical constituents; Particulate matter emissions; Physiochemical techniques; Relative concentration; Bacteria; endotoxin; hydroxy fatty acid; muramic acid; RNA 16S; endotoxin; aerodynamics; aerosol composition; air mass; diameter; livestock farming; pathogen; public health; size distribution; source apportionment; Article; bioaerosol; bioinformatics; chemical composition; Colorado; correlation analysis; dairy industry; DNA sequence; dust; genus; microbial community; microbiome; nonhuman; particle size; particulate matter; physical chemistry; Pseudomonas; RNA sequence; scanning electron microscopy; Staphylococcus; statistical analysis; Streptococcus; aerosol; air pollutant; animal; bacterium; Colorado; dairying; dust; environmental monitoring; human; particle size; Colorado; United States; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Pseudomonas; Streptococcus; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Animals; Bacteria; Colorado; Dairying; Dust; Endotoxins; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particle Size; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022004317

We find that competitive agricultural contracts in the seed-corn industry impose significant structural barriers to adopting climate change mitigation behaviors. Seed-corn contracts constrain adoption of those behaviors through competitive rankings based solely on net commodity production and by limiting farmers’ access to information to make judicious management decisions. At the micro level, our findings suggest that informational influence—that is, where farmers turn for trusted information—also affects climate change mitigation behaviors, and that these informational networks are embedded within structural constraints. Our findings suggest that agricultural contracts serve as a significant structural constraint on the adoption of mitigation practices and that climate scholarship and policy must address both macro and micro dimensions simultaneously to encourage adoption of climate change mitigation. © 2016, by the Rural Sociological Society",,"agricultural production; climate change; contract farming; maize; seed; social impact; Michigan; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992458091

A better understanding of genetic pathways regulating chilling tolerance will enable breeders to develop varieties with improved tolerance during germination and young seedling stages. To dissect chilling tolerance, five assays were developed; one assay for the germination stage, one assay for the germination and seedling stage, and three for the seedling stage. Based on these assays, five chilling tolerance indices were calculated and assessed using 202 O. sativa accessions from the Rice Mini-Core (RMC) collection. Significant differences between RMC accessions made the five indices suitable for genome-wide association study (GWAS) based quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. For young seedling stage indices, japonica and indica subspecies clustered into chilling tolerant and chilling sensitive accessions, respectively, while both subspecies had similar low temperature germinability distributions. Indica subspecies were shown to have chilling acclimation potential. GWAS mapping uncovered 48 QTL at 39 chromosome regions distributed across all 12 rice chromosomes. Interestingly, there was no overlap between the germination and seedling stage QTL. Also, 18 QTL and 32 QTL were in regions discovered in previously reported bi-parental and GWAS based QTL mapping studies, respectively. Two novel low temperature seedling survivability (LTSS)–QTL, qLTSS3-4 and qLTSS4-1, were not in a previously reported QTL region. QTL with strong effect alleles identified in this study will be useful for marker assisted breeding efforts to improve chilling tolerance in rice cultivars and enhance gene discovery for chilling tolerance. © 2017 Schläppi, Jackson, Eizenga, Wang, Chu, Shi, Shimoyama and Boykin.","Abiotic stress; Chilling acclimation; GWAS based QTL mapping; Indica rice; Japonica rice; Rice chilling tolerance; Rice mini-core",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021115494

In alpine regions the temperature rise has been especially pronounced and together with decreasing winter precipitation has led to earlier snowmelt. The close association between time of snowmelt and plant growth at high elevations makes climate change for alpine plants particularly threatening. Here we transplanted eleven congeneric pairs of high- and low-elevation herbaceous species to common gardens differing c. 800 m in elevation, and c. 4 °C in mean growing season temperature to test whether reproductive phenologies of high- and low-elevation plants differ in their respective responses to temperature. Results indicate that high-elevation plants were less plastic in response to transplantation than their low-elevation congeners as the onsets of phenophases on average shifted 7 days less than in low-elevation plants. Plasticity of phenophase durations was overall weaker than that of phenophase onsets, and slightly stronger in high-elevation species compared to low-elevation congeners. We suggest that weaker plasticity in the onsets of early stages of reproductive phenology of high-elevation plants is related to spring frost, which constitutes a strong selective agent against early loss of winter hardiness. Some of the plastic responses of both low- and high-elevation species might potentially be adaptive under predicted climate change. However, the observed plasticity can be largely explained as a passive response to temperature and not as the result of natural selection in heterogeneous environments. The strong temperature-sensitivity of low-elevation species might promote their upward range expansion, but only to a certain threshold after which it becomes limited by the short growing season. © 2017 Gesellschaft für Ökologie","Alpine plants; Canalization; Flowering; Phenology; Warming",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020873790

We tested remote-sensing modeling to map root zone soil salinity for farmland in the WSJV.

Among the various environmental factors, heat stress is well known for its harmful effects on livestock and related production losses. Sheep exposed to heat stress show lower body growth and hide quality and compromised reproductive functions in both males and females. Adapting to the changing climate requires appropriate manipulations in the production system by taking into account the positive effects and attempting to diminish the negative effects of climate change. The highly adapted indigenous breeds identified by marker-assisted selection can be used as an efficient tool for developing thermotolerant breeds through improved breeding programmes. Promotion of such breeds can improve production efficiency and may lead to fewer greenhouse gas emissions. Further, the local people, especially women, are good managers of natural resources and possess excellent skills to utilize the natural resources efficiently. Hence, occasional training and a participatory research approach into the roles of women assist the tackling of climate change in the rural areas. In addition, well-organized early warning systems avoid severe damage due to unexpected disasters by providing sufficient time to prepare effective responses. Development of skilled disease surveillance supported with effective health services may effectively control the spread of climate change-related diseases in sheep. Furthermore, the production system requires improved water resource management to provide sufficient water for sheep production in the arid and semi-arid regions. Cultivation of drought-tolerant fodder varieties in extremely hot areas is an efficient adaptive strategy to ensure sufficient supply of feed during scarcity periods. Finally, strengthening extension services and building awareness through capacitybuilding programmes helps the livestock keepers to improve their adaptive capacities against climate change. Adaptation strategies related to cold stress include advanced cold-tolerant breeding programmes, migration in extreme winter and adoption of proper cold management practices. According to the predictions by various international bodies, the consequences of climate change will be on the rise in the future. Hence, adequate cost-effective management strategies appear to be the immediate need of the hour for adapting sheep production systems to the changing climate. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Adaptation; Climate change; Cold stress; Drought; Early warning system; Heat stress; Sheep",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034084889

To ascertain the species, ten tree species were selected on the basis of some previous study from the campus of the University of Burdwan and were studied in the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. The study has been designed to investigate biochemical and physiological activities of selected tree species as the campus is presently exposed to primary air pollutants and their impacts on plant community were observed through the changes in several physical and biochemical constituents of plant leaves. As the plant species continuously exchange different gaseous pollutants in and out of the foliar system and are very sensitive to gaseous pollutants, they serve as bioindicators. Due to air pollution, foliar surface undergoes different structural and functional changes. In the selected plant species, it was observed that the concentration of primary air pollutants, proline content, pH, relative water holding capacity, photosynthetic rate, and respiration rate were higher in the pre-monsoon than the post-monsoon season, whereas the total chlorophyll, ascorbic acid, sugar, and conductivity were higher in the post-monsoon season. From the entire study, it was observed that the concentration of sulfur oxide (SOx), nitrogen oxide (NOx), and suspended particulate matter (SPM) all are reduced in the post-monsoon season than the pre-monsoon season. In the pre-monsoon season, SOx, NOx, and SPM do not have any significant correlation with biochemical as well as physiological parameters. SPM shows a negative relationship with chlorophyll ‘a’ (r = −0.288), chlorophyll ‘b’ (r = −0.267), and total chlorophyll (r = −0.238). Similarly, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and the total chlorophyll show negative relations with SOx and NOx (p &lt; 0.005) during the post-monsoon season. Proline shows a positive relationship with SOx in the pre-monsoon season whereas in the post-monsoon season proline content shows a positive relationship with both SOx and NOx.

Interestingly, Er3+ peak intensity decreases and that of Eu3+ increases with increase of temperature as is the case of individual doped cases and dual emission is also achieved via phyical mixing of the individual doped ZnO. The opposite trend is due to the electron transfer from the defect levels of host ZnO to Eu3+ and not to Er3+.

Satellite observations from coarse resolution sensors (i.e., MODIS and AVHRR) have been widely used to study impacts of climate anomalies on vegetation phenology. The advantage of coarse resolution sensors are daily observations across the entire globe, but the coarse spatial resolution, as well as the relatively short time span covered by MODIS, are significant drawbacks in analyzing landscape-scale trends in phenology. Time series data from the medium resolution sensor Landsat may overcome these issues. However, because of Landsat's lower observation frequency, phenological methods developed with coarse resolution data are not directly transferable. Here, we demonstrate a new Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework for estimating inter-annual variation in vegetation phenology from Landsat time series while controlling for spatial variation. The method pools all available observations to estimate the spatial variation in phenological parameters, while specifically modeling inter-annual variation as random effect terms. The advantage of a Bayesian approach is the ability to incorporate prior knowledge from other phenology and climate observations to reduce variability in the estimates, as well as a more robust estimation of uncertainty. We demonstrate and evaluate the modeling framework with a case study of changing spring phenology in broad-leaved trees in the Bavarian Forest National Park in southern Germany. Results show that the model estimated the spatial and temporal variation in phenological parameters precisely. Temporal variation in start of season showed overall strong agreement with ground-based measures of bud-break variability (r = 0.82 [0.80–0.84]). Our proposed modeling framework will help to better monitor and understand changes in vegetation phenology at scales yet unexplored by the phenological community. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Bavarian Forest; Climate change; Hierarchical model; Vegetation phenology","Bayesian networks; Biology; Climate change; Climate models; Forestry; Hierarchical systems; Radiometers; Random processes; Satellite imagery; Time series; Vegetation; Bavarian Forest National Park; Bavarians; Bayesian hierarchical model; Hierarchical model; Observation frequencies; Satellite observations; Spatial and temporal variation; Vegetation phenology; Uncertainty analysis; annual variation; climate change; forest ecosystem; global change; ground-based measurement; Landsat; MODIS; numerical method; numerical model; phenology; satellite sensor; spatial resolution; spatial variation; temporal variation; time series; vegetation cover; Bavaria; Bavarian Forest National Park; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016397067

In terms of trade, gross domestic product, and the overall Index of Industrial Production, the garment industry grows 5.4% every year, according to the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council. Hot and humid weather, locally available labour, raw cotton, the generation of hydropower, entrepreneurial skills and port facilities and transport systems are favourable to the textile industry and create a great demand for the production of yarn. Meanwhile, problems exist in the textile industry owing to disorganized systems and infrastructure, the global recession, strong competition in the world market, a lack of energy and electricity and diminishing export orders. A rise in the price of raw materials resulted in lower productivity, advanced machinery and modernization, bringing down the value of textile products. The textile industry is also responsible for a major part of the total industrial pollution that affects farmland and rivers. To overcome these demands and environmental impacts, organic farming helps in the cultivation of highly drought-tolerant crops. They are grown to be eco-friendly, for waste-to-wear technology. The processing and supply chain is also concerned about the long-term health of the planet, by reducing the release of CO2 into the environment.

Like most ecosystem services, climate regulation is the product of various ecological phenomena with unique spatial features. Elucidating which abiotic and biotic factors relate to spatial patterns of climate regulation services advances our understanding of what underlies climate-mitigation potential and its variation within and across ecosystems. Here we quantify and contrast the statistical relations between climate regulation services (albedo and evapotranspiration, primary productivity, and soil carbon) and abiotic and biotic factors. We focus on 16,955 forest plots in a regional extent across the eastern United States. We find the statistical effects of forest litter and understory carbon on climate regulation services to be as strong as those of temperature-precipitation interactions. These biotic factors likely influence climate regulation through changes in vegetation and canopy density, radiance scattering, and decomposition rates. We also find a moderate relation between leaf nitrogen traits and primary productivity at this regional scale. The statistical relation between climate regulation and temperature-precipitation ranges, seasonality, and climatic thresholds highlights a strong feedback with global climate change. Our assessment suggests the expression of strong biotic influences on climate regulation services at a regional, temperate extent. Biotic homogenization and management practices manipulating forest structure and succession will likely strongly impact climate-mitigation potential. The identity, strength, and direction of primary influences differed for each process involved in climate regulation. Hence, different abiotic and biotic factors are needed to monitor and quantify the full climate-mitigation potential of temperate forest ecosystems. ©2017. American Geophysical Union.

Cities contribute significantly to global warming, and as the world further takes a rural-urban population tilt, the next few decades pose a great challenge in addressing global disparities in the access and allocation of carbon. This book explores the ways in which cities, through their spatial development, contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and looks at the ways in which rapidly urbanizing cities in low- and middle-income countries can be planned to reduce overall GHG emissions. The book considers key questions such a: What should be the appropriate economies of scale for cities in a country? What is the most favourable rate of urbanization? What should be the most suitable spatial pattern for a city? And what are appropriate regulatory, economic or governance mechanisms to achieve a low-carbon society? These issues are explored through data analysis of over 156 developing countries and through a specific case study of India. India acts as an interesting example of how societies undergoing rural-to-urban transformations could become green within the planetary boundaries while systematically addressing national and local urban governance. The research concludes with a future pathway that is committed to low-carbon and high-equity spatial development, and will find pertinence to researchers and practitioners alike. This book provides a new tool for policymakers, planners and scholars to rationally and equitably account for global carbon space, prioritize low-carbon strategies for national urbanization and planning individual cities, in addition to recommending an urban governance framework inclusive of green agenda. © 2017 Mahendra Sethi.

By conducting a qualitative evaluation of a pilot program in Nepal that made carbon payments to forest user groups, we examine if community forestry institutions can be effective, efficient, and equitable in implementing Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD)+. Our evaluation relies on focus group discussions, meetings, and community and program documents of forestry user groups that participated in the REDD+ pilot and matched groups that did not. Compared to control groups, REDD+ user groups appear to be more effective in carbon sequestration, perhaps because of increased prevention of forest fires and grazing, nursery establishment, and other forest management. REDD+ user groups report a larger number of forest conservation, forest utilization, and community development activities relative to control groups. Participating communities bear transaction costs of US$4.5/hectare and implementation costs of US$2.5/hectare on average (or NPR 50,000 (US$600) per year). The mean REDD+ rent per ton of additional carbon sequestered was US$1.3. Targeting of benefits improves partly because some marginalized groups, particularly women, participate more in the planning and management. In terms of equity, microcredit and capacity development activities were skewed to the poorest households, whereas alternate fuel and carbon monitoring were more advantageous to middle or high income households. Overall, our analyses suggest that REDD+ activities can be successfully executed, if communities receive technical and capacity building support for institutional strengthening, in addition to carbon payments. © 2017 by the author(s).","Cobenefit; Effectiveness; Efficiency; Equity; REDD+","carbon emission; carbon sequestration; community forestry; cost analysis; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; equity; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021846205

To date, most education research on climate change examines middle and high school students' knowledge without considering the link between understanding and interest to address such issues in their career. In research on students' attitudes about sustainability, we found that half of first-year college engineering students, in our nationally representative sample of all college students at 4-year institutions (n = 937), do not believe climate change is caused by humans. This lack of belief in human-caused climate change is a significant problem in engineering education because our results also indicate engineering students who do not believe in human caused climate change are less likely to want to address climate change in their careers. This dismal finding highlights a need for improving student understanding and attitudes toward climate change in order to produce engineers prepared and interested in solving complex global problems in sustainability. To advance understanding about students' understanding of climate change and their agency to address the issue, we developed the CLIMATE survey to measure senior undergraduate engineering students' Climate change literacy, engineering identity, career motivations, and agency through engineering. The survey was designed for students in their final senior design, or capstone course, just prior to entering the workforce. We developed the survey using prior national surveys and newly written questions categorized into six sections: (1) career goals and motivation, (2) college experiences, (3) agency, (4) climate literacy, (5) people and the planet, and (6) demographic information. We conducted focus groups with students to establish face and content validity of the survey. We collected pilot data with 200 engineering students in upper-level engineering courses to provide validity evidence for the use of these survey items to measure students and track changes across the undergraduate curriculum for our future work. In this paper, we narrate the development of the survey supported by literature and outline the next step for further validation and distribution on a national scale. Our intent is to receive feedback and input about the questions being asked and the CLIMATE instrument. Our objective is to share the nationally representative non-identifiable responses (the estimated goal is 4,000 responses) openly with education researchers interested in students understanding about climate change, their engineering identity, career motivations, and agency through engineering. Ultimately, we want this research to become a catalyst for teaching about topics related to climate change in engineering and its implications for sustainability. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",,"Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Engineering research; Motivation; Professional aspects; Students; Surveys; Sustainable development; Teaching; Demographic information; Education research; Engineering course; High school students; Representative sample; Survey development; Undergraduate curricula; Undergraduate engineering students; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030550224

Here we show that Sahel rainfall is skilfully predicted on inter-annual and multi-year (that is, >5 years) timescales and use these predictions to better understand the driving mechanisms. Moisture budget analysis indicates that on multi-year timescales, a warmer north Atlantic and Mediterranean enhance Sahel rainfall through increased meridional convergence of low-level, externally sourced moisture. In contrast, year-to-year rainfall levels are largely determined by the recycling rate of local moisture, regulated by planetary circulation patterns associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.

However, little is known about its impacts on rumen microbes. This study evaluated the effects of nisin (1 and 5 μM) on in vitro rumen fermentation characteristics, microbiota, and select groups of rumen microbes in comparison with monensin (5 μM), one of the most commonly used ionophores in ruminants. Nisin had greater effects than monensin in inhibiting methane production and decreasing acetate/propionate ratio. Unlike monensin, nisin had no adverse effect on dry matter digestibility. Real-time PCR analysis showed that both monensin and nisin reduced the populations of total bacteria, fungi, and methanogens, while the population of protozoa was reduced only by monensin. Principal component analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons showed a clear separation between the microbiota shaped by monensin and by nisin. Comparative analysis also revealed a significant difference in relative abundance of some bacteria in different taxa between monensin and nisin. The different effects of monensin and nisin on microbial populations and bacterial communities are probably responsible for the discrepancy in their effects on rumen fermentation. Nisin may have advantages over monensin in modulating ruminal microbial ecology and reducing ruminant methane production without adversely affecting feed digestion, and thus it may be used as a potential alternative to monensin fed to ruminants. © 2017 Shen, Liu, Yu and Zhu.","Bacterial community; Feed digestion; Methane; Microbial population; Microbiota; Monensin; Nisin; Rumen fermentation","methane; monensin; nisin; RNA 16S; amplicon; Article; bacterial gene; batch fermentation; comparative study; controlled study; DNA extraction; fermentation; gas chromatography; Holstein cattle; metagenomics; microbial community; nonhuman; population abundance; principal component analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA gene; rumen microorganism; ruminant; ruminant stomach; species composition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020503684

The proposed model explicitly incorporates the effects of competition between regional ports and between shipping companies, and captures operational considerations such as the inventory costs of in-transit cargo, and the tradeoff between enlarged fleet size and slow steaming. The behaviors of shipping companies and ports are modeled in a two-stage game so that market equilibria under alternative regulations can be solved and compared. The findings suggest that a unilateral regulation may actually lead to an increase in total emissions, whereas a uniform regulation always reduces total emissions. Under either type of regulation, there can be asymmetric effects on shipping companies and ports. Therefore, regulators and the maritime industry need to strike a balance between emission reduction and fair competition.

We evaluated reclaimed land in Hachirogata, located in Japan's Akita Prefecture. Non-puddling cultivation is a technique of planting rice without the puddling. A rotary plow is used to plant the rice in finely crushed soil. Non-puddling allows a delay in irrigation. Thus, the soil is less likely to become deoxidized and a smaller amount of methane gas is released from the disturbed soil. Sparse planting is a technique whereby the planting stalk density is reduced by 30% (21 stalks/m2 to 15 stalks/m2), thereby reducing the material costs of producing seedlings. We found that use of the non-puddling technique reduced overall GHG emissions to 69% of those produced by rice cultivation using puddling. With sparse planting, GHG emissions were only reduced by a small amount to 93% of that of full planting. The current work shows that the appropriate mixture of sparse planting and non-puddling cultivation is necessary to obtain the greatest reduction in GHG emissions.","Life Cycle Assessment; Rice production",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019137495

A similar survey was conducted in 2002 before initiation of the ProAire2002-2010 program aimed at reducing air pollution. Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m/p-xylene, and o-xylene were sampled while traveling during the morning rush hour in May 2011. Compared with the 2002 survey, in-vehicle concentrations were substantially lower in 2011, except for formaldehyde in microbuses (35% higher than in 2002). The reductions were 17-42% (except microbuses), 25-44%, 41-61%, 43-61%, 71-79%, 80-91%, and 79-93% for formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m/p-xylene, and o-xylene, respectively. These reductions are considered to be the outcome of some of the actions in the ProAire2002-2010 program. In some microbuses, use of liquid petroleum gas may have increased in-vehicle formaldehyde concentrations. The reduction in predicted excess cancer incidence of commuters because of ProAire2002-2010 was estimated to be 1.4 cases/yr. In addition, if every microbus commuter changed their transport mode to bus, metro, or metrobus in the future, the estimated excess cancer incidence of commuters could be further decreased from 6.4 to 0.88-2.2 cases/year. © 2017 Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.

High organic carbon content in soil is vital as it leads to improved soil quality, increased productivity, and stable soil aggregates. In addition, with the signing of the climate agreement, there is growing interest in carbon sequestration in landscapes. This paper looks at how soil organic carbon (SOC) can be increased so that it contributes not only to the reduction of atmospheric CO2, but also translates to the increased food production, thereby enhancing food security. This synergy between climate change mitigation and enhancing food security is even more relevant for mountain landscapes of the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region where there remains huge potential to increase CO2 sequestration and simultaneously address food security in the chronic food deficit villages. Soil samples were collected from seven transects each in Bajhang and Mustang and from four land use types in each transect. Samples of soils were taken from two depths in each plot: 0–15 cm and 15–30 cm below the soil surface to compare the top soil and subsoil dynamics of the soil nutrients. The lab analysis was performed to assess the soil texture, soil acidity in “power of hydrogen” (pH), and macro-nutrients reflecting soil fertility. Secondary data was used to analyze the level of food deficit in the villages. The pH value of soil from Bajhang ranged from 5.3 to 9.1. The pH value of soil ranged from 5.7 to 8.8 in Mustang. SOC contents of sampled soils from Bajhang ranged from 0.20% to 7.69% with a mean amount of 2.47% ± 0.17%. SOC contents of sampled soils from Mustang ranged from 0.51% to 8.56% with a mean amount of 2.60% ± 0.25%. By land use type, forest land had the highest carbon (C) content of 53.61 t·ha−1 in Bajhang, whereas in Mustang, agricultural land had the highest C content of 52.02 tons·ha−1. Based on these data, we can say that there is potential for increasing SOC through improved soil health and crop production holistic soil management should be practiced for higher productivity, and incorporating livestock for farmyard manure would fertilize cultivated soils, which increases soil productivity. Increasing productivity would aid in enhancing the access and availability of food in these mountain villages. © 2017 by the authors.

The SDA remained a consistent sink of nitrogen (N). Source function was a combined effect of dilution of incoming drainage from a tropical storm and legacy-based soil P saturation. Denitrification was the main biochemical process contributing to N retention (Y1 = 23%, Y2 = 56%). Volume reduction was the main reason for nutrient retention, especially for P because of limited to no remaining soil P sorption capacity. Although a net sink of P for Y2, an event-wise analysis showed the source function for 40% of the outflow events indicating intermittent P release from soil. Because surface P treatment efficiency during both years was either less than or close to the water retention efficiency, volume reduction and not sorption or biological assimilation controlled P treatment. Almost a third of the incoming P was lost through subsurface pathways, highlighting the significance of groundwater P losses from SDAs. Harvesting and removal of biomass can mine P and restore SDA's sink function. For an example sub-basin of Florida Everglades, potentially harvestable P from SDAs was more than the basin P loads. A payment for environmental services project to treat additional P through biomass harvesting is a sustainable approach, especially under future climate projections of more frequent high-intensity storms for the Everglades and beyond. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Best management practices; Desorption; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Reservoir","Desorption; Efficiency; Groundwater; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Reservoir management; Reservoirs (water); Soils; Surface treatment; Best management practices; Biochemical process; Future climate projections; Payment for environmental services; Retention efficiencies; Sorption capacities; Storm water detention; Treatment efficiency; Storms; best management practice; biogeochemistry; denitrification; desorption; flux measurement; nitrogen; nutrient dynamics; phosphorus; reservoir; runoff; soil nutrient; sorption; source-sink dynamics; subtropical region; Everglades; Florida [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013820865

Availability of water defines distribution of the country's forests and decreases their productivity towards the south. Climate change generates a particular threat for Ukrainian forests and stability of agroforestry landscapes. This paper considers the impacts of expected climate change on vulnerability of Ukrainian forests using ensembles of global and regional climatic models (RCM) based on Scenarios B1, A2, A1B of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change, and a ""dry and warm"" scenario A1B+T-P (increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation). The spatially explicit assessment was provided by RCM for the WMO standard period (1961-1990), ""recent"" (1991-2010) and three future periods: 2011-2030, 2031-2050 and 2081-2100. Forest-climate model by Vorobjov and model of amplitude of flora's tolerance to climate change by Didukh, as well as a number of specialized climatic indicators, were used in the assessment. Different approaches lead to rather consistent conclusions. Water stress is the major limitation factor of distribution and resilience of flatland Ukrainian forests. Within Scenario A1B, the area with unsuitable growth conditions for major forest forming species will substantially increase by end of the century occupying major part of Ukraine. Scenario A1B+T-P projects even a more dramatic decline of the country's forests. It is expected that the boundary of conditions that are favorable for forests will shift to north and northwest, and forests of the xeric belt will be the most vulnerable. Consistent policies of adaptation and mitigation might reduce climate-induced risks for Ukrainian forests. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate change; Mid-Latitude ecotone; Predictions of state and distribution of forests over 21st century; Ukrainian forests; Xeric belt","agroforestry; climate change; climate modeling; ecotone; ensemble forecasting; future prospect; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; latitude; limiting factor; prediction; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; twenty first century; vulnerability; water stress; Ukraine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021685263

Aside from the United States, China and India are the two major producers ofcarbon dioxide emissions in the world. At the same time China and India are two of the leading developing countries in promoting green energy and international climate change objectives. The local wind energy industry, as an alternative to replace fuel, witnessed a politically-sponsored take-off in both countries in terms of global market share as well as domestically-installed wind energy capacity in the late 2000s. In particular, the current governments have taken the issue seriously on both the local and international levels. China and India ratified the Paris Agreement in 2015 and their national climate objectives. The puzzle of rapidly growing and politically supported wind energy sectors in these two countries in which environmental protection is strategically ignored in favour for economic growth has to be understood in the terms of the bigger picture of Beijing and New Delhi fostering external and internal legitimation by transforming norms and values to measureable outcomes. To do so, the paper illuminates the development of renewed legislative commitments for wind energy, the increasing external pressure for emission reductions, institutional changes, and demands for legitimation in India and China. © 2017 Institute of China and Asia-Pacific Studies - National Sun Yat-sen University.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of farming practices on SOC stocks at the farm type level. We designed a framework which encompasses a farm typology describing the diversity of farm practices applied to vegetable crops and a model of SOC dynamics to estimate the impact of these practices on SOC stocks. The study was carried out in the Guadeloupe archipelago, which offers a good representation of the variability of Caribbean agriculture, in a context of transition from traditional sugarcane and banana monocultures for export to a more diversified agriculture including vegetable crops. A farm typology was developed from a survey of 71 farmers concerning their socio-economic characteristics and farming practices. The MorGwanik model of SOC dynamics was then used to assess the impact of farming practices on SOC at the farm type level, and to interpret the observed SOC changes. Five farm types were identified varying from traditional export agriculture with low diversification to monoculture of vegetable crops based on compost application and reduced soil tillage. The observed and simulated results indicated that systems with a fallow/vegetables cycle ratio &gt; 2 and the monoculture of vegetables including compost applications at ≥ 10 Mg ha− 1 yr− 1 presented C sequestration corresponding to SOC increases of 10% and 3% of the initial stock, respectively. The monoculture of vegetables with a compost rate &lt; 10 Mg ha− 1 yr− 1 and systems including vegetables in rotation with export crops and a short fallow cycle presented a reduction in SOC that ranged from 10% to 18%. Pedoclimatic conditions had a lower impact on SOC changes. Similar socio-economic profiles of farmers were observed for farm types including very different cropping systems. The model well described SOC changes for each farm type and offered valuable insights about the factors affecting SOC losses and C sequestration. The framework proposed in this study was helpful to identify improved managements that can maintain or increase SOC stocks under tropical conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cropping system; Diversified agriculture; Farming practice; Rotation; SOC dynamics; Tropics","agricultural diversification; agricultural practice; biophysics; carbon sequestration; conceptual framework; crop plant; crop rotation; farming system; monocotyledon; paleoclimate; socioeconomic status; soil carbon; sugar cane; tropical region; typology; vegetable; Guadeloupe; Leeward Islands [Lesser Antilles]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013025417

To disentangle the effect of rapid adjustment to a given forcing on the overall change in extreme precipitation, we use a linear regression method that has been previously applied to mean precipitation. Equilibrium experiments with preindustrial CO2 concentrations and reduced solar constant were compared with a four times CO2 concentration experiment for 10 state-of-the-art climate models. We find that the two forcing mechanisms, greenhouse gases and solar, impose clearly different rapid adjustment signals in the mean precipitation, while such difference is difficult to discern for extreme precipitation due to large internal variability. In contrast to mean precipitation, changes in extreme precipitation scale with surface temperature trends and do not seem to depend on the forcing mechanism. ©2017. American Geophysical Union.

We monitored a population of the tree species Cordia oncocalyx (Boraginaceae) for 24 months in the dry thorny woodland of semi-arid northeastern Brazil, to investigate which life-history traits allow this tree to be locally dominant. We used horizontal life tables and a Lefkovitch matrix and tested for relationships among demographic parameters of seedling, infant, juvenile, immature, virginile and reproductive ontogenetic stages with rainfall and canopy openness. Germination and recruitment occurred in the rainy months, and dry-season mortality occurred only in seedlings (76% and 100%, first and second years, respectively) and infants (3% and 6%). Juveniles showed greater height growth under more open canopies (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.24), suggesting that light availability influences growth. The population growth rate was λ = 1.0336, and the highest sensitivity occurred in the infant-juvenile transition. Our results show light as a restrictive growth factor for plants in the juvenile stage and confirm the strong influence of rainfall on the dynamics of trees in a seasonally dry environment. The formation of a persistent seed bank with germination concentrated at the rainfall onset but spreading over the rainy season are strategies that hedge bets before establishment. The formation of a bank of infants, which can resume growth as soon as there is water, hedges bets after establishment.

Trees on roadside exhibited reduced carbon assimilation (36.7 ± 2.4%) and transpiration rate (42.14 ± 2.9%), decreased stomatal conductance (66.85 ± 3.87%), increased stomatal resistance (212.2 ± 11.25%), more leaf thickness (40.54 ± 3.25) and water use efficiency (9.4 ± 0.87%), and changes in lead (179.31 ± 10.24%) and proline (15.61 ± 1.92%) concentration in leaf tissues when compared to less traffic area (FRI campus).

We evaluated the hypothesis that CUEa and CUEh counterbalance at a large scale, stabilizing microbial growth (μ) as a fraction of gross primary production (GPP). Collating data from published studies, we correlated annual CUEa, estimated from satellite imagery, with locally determined soil CUEh for 100 globally distributed sites. Ecosystem CUEe, the ratio of net ecosystem production (NEP) to GPP, was estimated for each site using published models. At the ecosystem scale, CUEa and CUEh were inversely related. At the global scale, the apparent temperature sensitivity of CUEh with respect to mean annual temperature (MAT) was similar for organic and mineral soils (0.029°C−1). CUEa and CUEe were inversely related to MAT, with apparent sensitivities of −0.009 and −0.032°C−1, respectively. These trends constrain the ratio μ : GPP (= (CUEa × CUEh)/(1 − CUEe)) with respect to MAT by counterbalancing the apparent temperature sensitivities of the component processes.

This coupled behaviour causes various land-Atmosphere feedbacks, and an insufficient understanding of these feedbacks contributes to uncertain global climate model projections. For example, a crucial role of the land surface in exacerbating summer heat waves in midlatitude regions has been identified empirically for high-impact heat waves, but individual climate models differ widely in their respective representation of land-Atmosphere coupling. Here, we compile an ensemble of 54 combinations of observations-based temperature (<i>T</i>) and evapotranspiration (ET) benchmarking datasets and investigate coincidences of <i>T</i> anomalies with ET anomalies as a proxy for land-Atmosphere interactions during periods of anomalously warm temperatures. First, we demonstrate that a large fraction of state-of-The-Art climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) archive produces systematically too frequent coincidences of high <i>T</i> anomalies with negative ET anomalies in midlatitude regions during the warm season and in several tropical regions year-round. These coincidences (high <i>T</i>, low ET) are closely related to the representation of temperature variability and extremes across the multi-model ensemble. Second, we derive a land-coupling constraint based on the spread of the <i>T</i>-ET datasets and consequently retain only a subset of CMIP5 models that produce a land-coupling behaviour that is compatible with these benchmark estimates. The constrained multi-model simulations exhibit more realistic temperature extremes of reduced magnitude in present climate in regions where models show substantial spread in <i>T</i>-ET coupling, i.e. biases in the model ensemble are consistently reduced. Also the multi-model simulations for the coming decades display decreased absolute temperature extremes in the constrained ensemble. On the other hand, the differences between projected and present-day climate extremes are affected to a lesser extent by the applied constraint, i.e. projected changes are reduced locally by around 0.5 to 1ĝ€°C-but this remains a local effect in regions that are highly sensitive to land-Atmosphere coupling. In summary, our approach offers a physically consistent, diagnostic-based avenue to evaluate multi-model ensembles and subsequently reduce model biases in simulated and projected extreme temperatures. © Author(s) 2017.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Climatology; Surface measurement; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Extreme temperatures; Global Climate Model projections; Land atmosphere interaction; Land-atmosphere couplings; Multi-model ensemble; Multi-Model Simulations; Temperature variability; Climate models; air temperature; air-soil interaction; benchmarking; climate prediction; CMIP; coupling; data set; ensemble forecasting; evapotranspiration; high temperature; land surface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019974403

This diversity of living creatures forms a support system, which has been used by each civilization for its growth and development. The rich bio- diversity has been instrumental in providing humanity with food security, health care, and industrial goods that has led to high standard of living in the modern world. The diversity of life on earth is very rich that if we use it sustainably and judiciously, we can go on developing new products for generations. For this rea- son, we must realize the importance of biodiversity as a major resource. Many traditional societies have played significant roles in conserving biodiversity. They value biodiversity as a part of their livelihood through cultural and even sometimes religious sentiments. Assessing the status and trends of biodiversity is essential for sustainable development strategies at all levels, from village to nation to region. Ecological communities maintain the ecological and evolution- ary processes that sustain life. These are necessary to help maintain the planet's chemical balance, moderate climate, renew soil, and conserve species diversity. They are also the source of all biological wealth-supplying food, raw materials, medicines, recreational resources, and a store of other goods and services worth many billions of dollars per year. The genetic stocks within crop varieties, live- stock breeds, and their wild relatives provide essential traits for increasing and improving agricultural production and the development of biotechnologies. Biodiversity assessment is the first step in protecting the complete range of morphological and genetic diversity of species on Earth and in reaching the goals of conservation biology. Assessment begins with identifying organisms that make up biological communities and understanding evolutionary histories.

The approach has gradually shifted from leadership toward more strategic behavior that reflects the preferences of the member states. Reduced uncertainty concerning member-state preferences and solutions accounts for much of the change in leadership. Uncertainty has decreased as climate policies have become more mature and member states have gained experience from implementing them. Asymmetries in member-state preferences, decision-making procedures, and impatience caused by the international context are all important conditions for the European Commission’s leadership. These observations lend support to apparently contradictory theories that have seen EU climate policy as propelled either by autonomous supranational institutions or by increasingly ambitious member states. © 2017 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"decision making; environmental policy; European Commission; European Union; implementation process; leadership; strategic approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018439704

Hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction as well as CO2 and N2 electrochemical reduction to form methane and ammonia are taken as examples. Calculations of reaction rates based on the estimation of the activation energy of elementary steps from minimum energy paths and transition state theory have been shown to provide accurate estimates of rates even for complex reactions and competing reaction mechanisms.

It was found that the various negative impacts that characterize the global development of the oil industry, such as the development of alternative energy source, the increase of unconventional hydrocarbon production, the reduction of US imports of oil, the suspension of economic sanctions against Iran, the resumption of oil deliveries from Libya, the growth impairment in global oil consumption, reduce the effectiveness of innovative activities of oil companies and inhibit the development of innovative processes in the complex. It determines the need to enforce the state innovation policy and to develop recommendations to facilitate the introduction of innovative technologies. The special attention is given to studying of environmental aspects of oil companies' activities. Recommendations for stimulating oil companies to introduce environmental innovations are developed. The analysis shows that Russian companies activity in the field of environmental innovation in contrast to the world's leading corporations is low.

Stratospheric sulfate injection (SSI) is a geoengineering method proposed to reduce planetary warming by reflecting a proportion of solar radiation back into space that would otherwise warm the surface and lower atmosphere. The authors analyze results from the Met Office Hadley Centre Global Environment Model, version 2, Carbon Cycle Stratosphere (HadGEM2-CCS) climate model with stratospheric emissions of 10 Tg yr-1 of SO2, designed to offset global temperature rise by around 1°C. A reduction in concentrating solar power output of 5.9% on average over land is shown under SSI relative to a baseline future climate change scenario (RCP4.5) caused by a decrease in direct radiation. Solar photovoltaic energy is generally less affected as it can use diffuse radiation, which increases under SSI, at the expense of direct radiation. The results from HadGEM2-CCS are compared with the Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry-Climate Model (GEOSCCM) from the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP), with 5 Tg yr-1 emission of SO2. In many regions, the differences predicted in solar energy output between the SSI and RCP4.5 simulations are robust, as the sign of the changes for both HadGEM2-CCS and GEOSCCM agree. Furthermore, the sign of the total and direct annual mean radiation changes evaluated by HadGEM2-CCS agrees with the sign of the multimodel mean changes of an ensemble of GeoMIP models over the majority of the world. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","Climate change; Climate models; General circulation models; Radiative fluxes; Renewable energy; Shortwave radiation","Carbon; Climate models; Earth (planet); Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Radiation; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sulfur dioxide; Chemistry-climate models; Concentrating solar power; General circulation model; Goddard earth observing systems; Radiative fluxes; Renewable energies; Short-wave radiation; Solar photovoltaic energies; Climate change; climate change; climate modeling; ensemble forecasting; general circulation model; photovoltaic system; radiative transfer; renewable resource; shortwave radiation; solar power; stratosphere; sulfate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019470704

There is currently a wide selection of possible feedstocks, a variety of conversion routes, and a number of different end products that can be produced at a range of scales. However, economic slowdown, low oil prices, lack of global political will, and lingering questions regarding land use change and the sustainability of bioenergy production systems provide a challenging global context to speed the pace of investment. The opinions expressed in this paper are derived from our collaboration within IEA Bioenergy to determine opportunities as well as barriers that need to be overcome to realize opportunities on a wider scale. This comprehensive and novel collaborative effort confirmed that feedstocks produced using logistically efficient production systems can be mobilized to make significant contributions to achieving global targets for bioenergy. At the same time, significant barriers to large-scale implementation exist in many regions. The mobilization potential identified in the study will depend on both increases in supply chain efficiencies and profits and strong policy support to increase stakeholder and investor confidence.

We examined forest owners’ willingness to enroll in payments for carbon sequestration policies under different levels of financial incentives (annual revenue), different contract lengths, and different program administrators (e.g., private companies versus a state or federal agency). We also examined the influence forest owners’ sense of place had on their willingness to enroll in hypothetical programs. Our results showed a high level of ambivalence toward participating in payments for carbon sequestration programs. However, both financial incentives and contract lengths significantly influenced forest owners’ intent to enroll. Neither program administration nor forest owners’ sense of place influenced intent to enroll. Although our analyses indicated that payments from carbon sequestration programs are not currently competitive with the monetary returns expected from timber harvest or property sales, certain forest owners might see payments for carbon sequestration programs as a viable option for offsetting increasing tax costs as development encroaches and property values rise. © 2017 Society of American Foresters.","Payments for ecosystem services; Stated choice methods; Urbanization","Economics; Ecosystems; Carbon sequestration; Charlotte , North Carolina; Discrete choice experiments; Financial incentives; Payments for ecosystem services; Program administration; Stated choice methods; Urbanization; Forestry; Carbon; Chelation; Ecosystems; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020439143

We hypothesized that urban infrastructure significantly alters downstream water quality and contributes to variability in GHG saturation and emissions. We measured gas saturation and estimated emission rates in headwaters of two urban stream networks (Red Run and Dead Run) of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study Long-Term Ecological Research project. We identified four combinations of stormwater and sanitary infrastructure present in these watersheds, including: (1) stream burial, (2) inline stormwater wetlands, (3) riparian/floodplain preservation, and (4) septic systems. We selected two first-order catchments in each of these categories and measured GHG concentrations, emissions, and dissolved inorganic and organic carbon (DIC and DOC) and nutrient concentrations biweekly for 1 year. From a water quality perspective, the DOC:NO3- ratio of streamwater was significantly different across infrastructure categories. Multiple linear regressions including DOC:NO3- and other variables (dissolved oxygen, DO; total dissolved nitrogen, TDN; and temperature) explained much of the statistical variation in nitrous oxide (N2O, r2 = 0.78), carbon dioxide (CO2, r2 = 0.78), and methane (CH4, r2 = 0.50) saturation in stream water. We measured N2O saturation ratios, which were among the highest reported in the literature for streams, ranging from 1.1 to 47 across all sites and dates. N2O saturation ratios were highest in streams draining watersheds with septic systems and strongly correlated with TDN. The CO2 saturation ratio was highly correlated with the N2O saturation ratio across all sites and dates, and the CO2 saturation ratio ranged from 1.1 to 73. CH4 was always supersaturated, with saturation ratios ranging from 3.0 to 2157. Longitudinal surveys extending form headwaters to third-order outlets of Red Run and Dead Run took place in spring and fall. Linear regressions of these data yielded significant negative relationships between each gas with increasing watershed size as well as consistent relationships between solutes (TDN or DOC, and DOC:TDN ratio) and gas saturation. Despite a decline in gas saturation between the headwaters and stream outlet, streams remained saturated with GHGs throughout the drainage network, suggesting that urban streams are continuous sources of CO2, CH4, and N2O. Our results suggest that infrastructure decisions can have significant effects on downstream water quality and greenhouse gases, and watershed management strategies may need to consider coupled impacts on urban water and air quality. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"carbon dioxide; catchment; concentration (composition); dissolved inorganic carbon; dissolved organic carbon; drainage network; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; headwater; infrastructure; nitrous oxide; nutrient budget; regression analysis; salinity; saturation; stormwater; supersaturation; urban area; water quality; watershed; Baltimore; Maryland; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020749655

Mitigation benefits through the use of forest products are affected by product life cycles, which determine the duration of carbon storage in wood products and substitution benefits where emissions are avoided using wood products instead of other emissions-intensive building products and energy fuels. Here we determined displacement factors for wood substitution in the built environment and bioenergy at the national level in Canada. For solid wood products, we compiled a basket of end-use products and determined the reduction in emissions for two functionally equivalent products: a more wood-intensive product vs. a less wood-intensive one. Avoided emissions for end-use products basket were weighted by Canadian consumption statistics to reflect national wood uses, and avoided emissions were further partitioned into displacement factors for sawnwood and panels. We also examined two bioenergy feedstock scenarios (constant supply and constrained supply) to estimate displacement factors for bioenergy using an optimized selection of bioenergy facilities which maximized avoided emissions from fossil fuels. Results demonstrated that the average displacement factors were found to be similar: product displacement factors were 0.54 tC displaced per tC of used for sawnwood and 0.45 tC tC−1 for panels; energy displacement factors for the two feedstock scenarios were 0.47 tC tC−1 for the constant supply and 0.89 tC tC−1 for the constrained supply. However, there was a wide range of substitution impacts. The greatest avoided emissions occurred when wood was substituted for steel and concrete in buildings, and when bioenergy from heat facilities and/or combined heat and power facilities was substituted for energy from high-emissions fossil fuels. We conclude that (1) national-level substitution benefits need to be considered within a systems perspective on climate change mitigation to avoid the development of policies that deliver no net benefits to the atmosphere, (2) the use of long-lived wood products in buildings to displace steel and concrete reduces GHG emissions, (3) the greatest bioenergy substitution benefits are achieved using a mix of facility types and capacities to displace emissions-intensive fossil fuels. © 2016 The Authors.

The Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP) is a coordinated international effort to assess the climate impacts of solar geoengineering, a proposal to counteract global warming with a reduction in incoming solar radiation. We assess the mechanisms underlying the rainfall response to a simplified simulation of such solar dimming (G1) in the suite of GeoMIP models and identify robust features. While solar geoengineering nearly restores preindustrial temperatures, the global hydrology is altered. Tropical precipitation changes dominate the response across the model suite, and these are driven primarily by shifts of the Hadley circulation cells. We report a damping of the seasonal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in G1, associated with preferential cooling of the summer hemisphere, and annual mean ITCZ shifts in some models that are correlated with the warming of one hemisphere relative to the other. Dynamical changes better explain the varying tropical rainfall anomalies between models than changes in relative humidity or the Clausius-Clapeyron scaling of precipitation minus evaporation (P -E), given that the relative humidity and temperature responses are robust across the suite. Strong reductions in relative humidity over vegetated land regions are likely related to the CO2 physiological response in plants. The uncertainty in the spatial distribution of tropical P -E changes highlights the need for cautious consideration and continued study before any implementation of solar geoengineering. © Author(s) 2017.",,"climate effect; cooling; hydrological cycle; intertropical convergence zone; rainfall; relative humidity; solar radiation; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020043291

Santo-André, SP, 09.210-170, Brazil","While Brazilian municipal solid waste (MSW) is most often collected and disposed of at ""controlled"" dumps and landfills, a large amount of refuse still ends up at irregular dumping sites. Unfortunately, there are few cases where waste is processed in a manner that provides additional benefits to local communities, for example, recovering energy from waste. The most common form of energy recovery practiced worldwide is converting it to electricity. In order to meet current energy needs and reduce fossil fuel emissions, this approach is a crucial component of any regional energy strategy and therefore should be considered wherever applicable. The present study quantified the feasibility of implementing alternative and complementary technologies for treatment and final disposal of the MSW of São Paulo to generate electricity with consideration of potential environmental impacts using life cycle assessment (LCA). The technologies considered were (i) disposal at landfill with biogas recovery, (ii) mechanical and biological treatment and (iii) incineration. The program SimaPro 7.3.3 was used to analyse the life cycle impact (LCI) and life cycle impact assessment (LCIA). The scope of the study, including the border and the detailing, was defined based on the technological treatment and disposal routes for MSW.. Results showed that, among the alternatives considered in this study, the electricity generated from the combined processes of a mechanical and biological treatment system and incineration is the most attractive option in terms of minimizing the environmental impacts. Electricity generation from incineration process proved to be attractive not only in terms of environmental impacts, but also in terms of energy efficiency, yielding more energy than simply collecting biogas from landfill. Results were classified in terms of potential long-term impacts, i.e., considering the potential environmental impacts over a period of 100 years. When considering long-term impacts, the greatest areas of concern were regarding carcinogenic substances, non-carcinogenic substances, ecotoxicity, and eutrophication. As a general conclusion, this study identifies current options and opportunities for Brazil, for the implementation of projects related to energy conversion from MSW, with a focus on the incineration process, with the caveat that there are still socio-political-economic barriers to the latter process, despite its environmental benefits and energy efficiency.","Biogas; Energy; Incineration; Life cycle assessment; Municipal solid waste","Biochemical engineering; Biogas; Collector efficiency; Electric power generation; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Eutrophication; Fossil fuels; Incineration; Land fill; Life cycle; Recovery; Solid wastes; Waste incineration; Biological treatment systems; Electricity generation; Energy; Environmental benefits; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle impact assessment; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Technological treatment; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019402767

For an Improved understanding of the link between Southern Ocean processes, biogeochemical cycles and the global climate, scientific research was commenced. Some remarkable research work has been accomplished by Indian Scientific community in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean (ISSO). A total of six successful multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional expeditions were carried out from the year 2009 to 2015 in the ISSO, with the pilot expedition launched in the year 2004. During the last decade, an understanding of different aspects of the ocean processes has been achieved using chemical studies and proxies. Studies in the ISSO focused on shifts in the oceanic fronts, the carbon and nutrient dynamics, as well as the food web dynamics across the different fronts. The spatial-Temporal variation of nutrients, dissolved oxygen, dissolved inorganic carbon and the factors regulating their distribution in the ISSO has also been addressed. Attempts were made to understand the atmosphereocean interaction of CO2 and biogeochemical processes. Some experimental work have been undertaken to assess the nitrogen uptake and influence of micronutrients on phytoplankton. Similarly, stable isotope of oxygen has been used as a proxy in some early studies in the ISSO. Isotopic and molecular investigations have been commenced to understand the biogeochemical processes within the water column, as the biological pump and particulate organic matter (POM) have a major role to play in carbon sequestration and further influencing the global climate variability. Detailed studies on dissolved and particulate organic matter are being carried out to gain knowledge of the biological pump and the factors responsible for climate variability and ocean acidification.","Carbon; Indian sector of southern ocean; Oxygen isotope; Stable isotopes","Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Carbon; Climatology; Dissolution; Ecology; Isotopes; Nutrients; Oceanography; Organic compounds; Oxygen; Atmosphere-ocean interactions; Biogeochemical process; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Global climatic changes; Oxygen isotopes; Particulate organic matters; Southern ocean; Stable isotopes; Dissolved oxygen",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021159334

The research framework is built around a set of assumptions regarding the process of transition between risk management regimes. The framework includes five basic conceptual elements: (1) risk management regimes, (2) development pathways, (3) activity spheres, (4) activity spaces, and (5) root, contextual, and proximate drivers. The interaction among these elements and the potential for transition between four different possible regime states including resistance, resilience, transformation, and collapse are presented. The framework facilitates and guides analysis on whether and how transition is emergent, constrained, or accelerated in specific contexts.

Nonetheless, there are few facilities available in those regions of the world for in vivo measurement of methane production in cattle. The aim of the present work was to describe the design, construction and operation of respiration chambers for in vivo measurement of methane production in cattle in Mexico. Locally available materials were used in the construction. Walls, roof and doors were constructed of thermic panels with two windows of acrylic at the front so the animal can be observed at all times. Chambers have an air volume of 9.97 m3. Air is drawn from the chamber at a rate of 500 L/min by the effect of mass action flow generators. Methane was measured in air samples with an infrared analyzer. Chambers operate under a slight negative pressure of around-500 Pa. Air temperature inside the chambers is kept at 23 °C with an air conditioner, while relative humidity is maintained at 55 % with a dehumidifier. Functioning of the chambers was evaluated in Bos indicus, Nelore cattle fed Taiwan grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and a concentrate (18 % crude protein), and measurements were made during runs of 23 h duration. Methane production was on average 173.2 L per day, while the emission factor was 17.48 L methane per kilogram o dry matter consumed. It concludes that this respiration facility is capable of measuring methane production accurately in cattle fed tropical rations.","Greenhouse gases; Methane; Respiration chambers.; Ruminants; Tropics","biogas; methane; poly(methyl methacrylate); protein; urethan; air conditioning; air sampling; air temperature; Article; biomass production; breathing; cage; electric potential; flow rate; gas analysis equipment; greenhouse; humidity; mass action; Nellore cattle; nonhuman; Pennisetum; respiration chamber; rumen; ruminant; tropics; zebu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018376951

Hence, nonprecious metal catalysts which are expected to replace platinum-based catalysts have become popular green sustainable development topics. We chose a facile pyrolysis method for the synthesis of this material, making the resulting coating material present a state of effectively encapsulating all cobalt nanoparticles into slim nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes after process optimization, and the cobalt content even reached 20.9 wt %. In the catalytic aspect, the optimized Co@NSCNTs show a half wave potential equivalent to Pt/C in alkaline medium. Then, better durability (after 60,000 s chronoamperometry, the current retention still remains 95%) and commendable resistance to methanol crossover performed than the literature confirmed. All these characteristics superior to Pt/C should be ascribed to large amounts of entire encapsulated structures and synergism between encapsulated Co nanocrystal and graphitic N-doped carbon nanotubes.

Animal manure added to soil can elevate the soil CO2 and release organic acid due to microbial decomposition of the high organic matter content of animal manure. Additionally, the elevated CO2 can accelerate carbonate weathering in alkaline soil, such as lime soil. However, in acidic soil, it is unclear whether the chemical weathering of additive aglime can be quickened by the elevated CO2 due to animal manure addition. Thus, to ascertain the impact of animal manure addition on aglime weathering in acidic soil and to understand the weathering agent of aglime or underlying carbonate in the acidic soil profile, we established two contrasting profiles (control profile and manurial profile) in a cabbage-corn or capsicum-corn rotation in a field experiment site located in the HuaXi district of Guiyang, China, and buried carbonate rock tablets at different depths of soil profiles to calculate the dissolution rate of carbonate rock by monitoring the weights of the tablets. The results indicated that soil CO2 increased due to animal manure addition, but the rate of dissolution of the carbonate rock tablets was reduced, which was attributed to the increase in the pH in acidic soil after animal manure addition because the relationship between the dissolution rate of carbonate rock and soil pH indicated that the weathering rate of carbonate rock was controlled by pH and not by CO2 in acidic soil. Thus, the contribution of H+ ions (mainly exchangeable acid) in acid soil as a weathering agent to the weathering of underlying carbonate (and/or aglime) may lead to the overestimation of the CO2 consumption through chemical weathering at the regional/global scale using hydro-chemical methods.","Carbonate weathering; CO2 source/sink; Soil/atmospheric CO2",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030093390

In this paper, a survey is carried out to understand the structure of the present price models. Then, two restructured price models are proposed and compared with the price model most commonly used. To increase the transparency, price models should be based on users’ measured consumption profile; while to reduce the peak load, adoption of a pricing strategy based on a load demand component is an effective way. Consequently, users with flat consumption profiles will reduce cost, whereas users with steep consumption profiles will have a cost increase, both when charging the load demand cost based on the maximum daily or hourly peak load. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","District heating; Load pricing strategy; Peak load reduction; Price model; Transparency","Climate change; Cost effectiveness; District heating; Transparency; Cost fluctuation; Cost-effective methods; Cost-increases; Load demand; Peak load reductions; Price models; Pricing strategy; Reduce costs; Costs; building; climate change; cost analysis; demand analysis; efficiency measurement; energy efficiency; heating; numerical model; price determination; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082355726

To assess the distribution of native Argentine populations of P. nodiflora as a function of the environment, we conducted long-term roadside surveys and associated the occurrence of the plant with climatic, geographical, demographical and vegetation cover variables in a generalised linear mixed model. The plant was recorded in 230 of 431 sites, mostly east of 66°W and north of 39°S. According to the best model, which predicted the data 58% better than random assignment, its occurrence was associated with temperature variables (mean annual values and daytime range) and relative humidity. Based on these associations, we generated a presence probability map for the occurrence of P. nodiflora in southern South America. Understanding the environmental determinants of the distribution of weeds in their native range provides valuable baseline data to further manage the spread of alien species. © 2017 European Weed Research Society","biological control; distribution; invasive species; modelling; spatial dynamics","biocontrol agent; biodiversity; biological control; biological invasion; demography; ecological modeling; environmental factor; herb; invasive species; native species; prediction; relative humidity; riparian zone; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; species occurrence; vegetation cover; weed; Argentina; Phyla nodiflora; Verbenaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017247046

We hypothesized that the chronic consumption of caloric (sucrose, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), maltodextrin) and non-caloric (sucralose) solutions under 2-hour intermittent access, alongside the consumption of a high-fat high-sucrose diet, would result in differential obesity-associated metabolic abnormalities in mice. Male C57BL/6 mice had ad libitum access to an HFHS diet and to water (water control group). In addition, some mice had access, 2 h/day, 5 days/week (randomly chosen) for 12 weeks, to different solutionsi) a sucrose solution (2.1 kJ/ml), ii) an HFCS solution (2.1 kJ/ml), iii) a maltodextrin solution (2.1 kJ/ml) and a sucralose solution (60 mM) (n = 15/group). Despite no changes in total caloric intake, 2 h-intermittent access to the sucrose, HFCS or maltodextrin solutions led to increased body weight and accumulation of lipids in the liver when compared to the group consuming water only. The HFCS and sucrose solutions induced a higher fat mass in various fat depots, glucose intolerance, increased glucose oxidation at the expense of lipid oxidation, and a lower hypothalamic expression of NPY in the fasted state. HFCS also reduced proopiomelanocortin expression in the hypothalamus. 2 h-intermittent access to sucralose did not result in significant changes in body composition, but caused a stronger expression of CART in the hypothalamus. Finally, sucrose intake showed a trend to increase the expression of various receptors in the nucleus accumbens, linked to dopamine, opioid and endocannabinoid signaling. In conclusion, 2 h-intermittent access to caloric solutions (especially those sweetened with sucrose and HFCS), but not sucralose, resulted in adverse metabolic consequences in high-fat high-sucrose-fed mice. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Diabetes; Fructose; Metabolism; Obesity; Sucrose; Sugar","acetyl coenzyme A; carboxylase; cholesterol; corn syrup; dopamine; endocannabinoid; fatty acid; fatty acid synthase; fructokinase; fructose; glucokinase; glucose; glucose 6 phosphatase; high density lipoprotein; lipid; maltodextrin; neuropeptide; opiate; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP); proopiomelanocortin; pyruvate kinase; sucralose; sucrose; sweetening agent; triacylglycerol; water; agouti related protein; Agrp protein, mouse; corn syrup; glucose; neurotransmitter receptor; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anthropometric parameters; Article; bioaccumulation; body composition; body weight; caloric intake; comparative study; controlled study; diet restriction; diet supplementation; drinking behavior; fat mass; feeding behavior; food intake; fructose metabolism; glucose intolerance; glucose oxidation; glucose tolerance; hypothalamus; indirect calorimetry; lipid diet; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; liver; male; mouse; nonhuman; nucleus accumbens; obesity; priority journal; protein expression; sugar intake; sweetened beverage; sweetness; Western diet; animal; caloric intake; disease model; drug effects; exploratory behavior; genetics; lipid peroxidation; metabolic disorder; metabolism; physiology; randomization; Agouti-Related Protein; Animals; Body Composition; Body Weight; Diet, High-Fat; Disease Models, Animal; Energy Intake; Exploratory Behavior; Feeding Behavior; Glucose; High Fructose Corn Syrup; Lipid Peroxidation; Liver; Male; Metabolic Diseases; Mice; Nucleus Accumbens; Random Allocation; Receptors, Neurotransmitter; Sweetening Agents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016471538

At the same time, local authorities are increasingly taking action on climate change by focusing on reducing GHG emissions and efficiency improvement opportunities. To assess and reduce the overall greenhouse gas emission level from an urban area, it is necessary to identify all the activities and processes which generate these emissions. GHG inventory gives an opportunity to get wider knowledge for city's community about spatial emission processes and emissions contribution of key sources categories at the local scale. Inventory is being used for decision-making purposes and strategic planning in emission reduction policy. The goal of this paper was to clarify the major methodological challenges of GHG monitoring at the urban level. The paper is based on the discussion of different methods and approaches to assessing GHG emissions at the local level. It is presented sectoral GHGs emission trends in selected urban areas and compared CO2 emission level in different countries and metropolises and variable European cities guidance. The study determines the inventory tools of GHGs emission taking into account the characteristics of main sources at local levels. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences,2017.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020306415

Rhizosphere bacteria play critical roles in plant growth, health, and development and are shaped primarily by soil communities. Using Illumina next-generation sequencing and high-resolution mass spectrometry, we characterized bacterial communities of wild-type (Col-0) Arabidopsis thaliana and an acyclic line (OX34) ectopically expressing the circadian clock-associated cca1 transcription factor, relative to a soil control, to determine how cycling dynamics affected the microbial community. Microbial communities associated with Brachypodium distachyon (BD21) were also evaluated.RESULTS: Significantly different bacterial community structures (P = 0.031) were observed in the rhizosphere of wild-type plants between light and dark cycle samples. Furthermore, 13% of the community showed cycling, with abundances of several families, including Burkholderiaceae, Rhodospirillaceae, Planctomycetaceae, and Gaiellaceae, exhibiting fluctuation in abundances relative to the light cycle. However, limited-to-no cycling was observed in the acyclic CCAox34 line or in soil controls. Significant cycling was also observed, to a lesser extent, in Brachypodium. Functional gene inference revealed that genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were likely more abundant in near-dawn, dark samples. Additionally, the composition of organic matter in the rhizosphere showed a significant variation between dark and light cycles.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the rhizosphere bacterial community is regulated, to some extent, by the circadian clock and is likely influenced by, and exerts influences, on plant metabolism and productivity. The timing of bacterial cycling in relation to that of Arabidopsis further suggests that diurnal dynamics influence plant-microbe carbon metabolism and exchange. Equally important, our results suggest that previous studies done without relevance to time of day may need to be reevaluated with regard to the impact of diurnal cycles on the rhizosphere microbial community.","Arabidopsis; Bacterial community structure; Diurnal rhythm; Rhizosphere","Arabidopsis protein; carbon; CCA1 protein, Arabidopsis; RNA 16S; transcription factor; Arabidopsis; bacterial phenomena and functions; bacterium; biodiversity; Brachypodium; circadian rhythm; classification; genetics; high throughput sequencing; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; physiology; plant development; rhizosphere; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Bacteria; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Biodiversity; Brachypodium; Carbon; Circadian Rhythm; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Microbiota; Plant Development; Rhizosphere; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil Microbiology; Transcription Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040538905

First, what is the media visibility of actors relevant to policy development and advocacy on climate change? Second, given the political and economic context of climate policy-making in Canada, does greater or lesser media visibility reflect effectiveness in climate policy advocacy? Multiple interpretive frameworks characterize Canadian political discourse about climate change, with fragmentation between the federal government, opposition political parties, provincial governments, and environmental organizations. Contrary to expectations, environmental organizations had high levels of media visibility while the relative invisibility of fossil fuel corporations was notable in the media coverage of Canadian climate discussions.

Furthermore, a single promoter is insufficient to account for transcription of mdcR, a regulatory gene that is convergent to other mdc genes. MdcR, a LysR-type transcriptional regulator, was shown to bind specifically to a site where it can activate mdc-gene transcription. Although mdcR deletion prevented growth on malonate, a 1 nt substitution in the promoter of mdcA enabled MdcR-independent growth on this carbon source. Regulation was characterized by methods including transcriptional fusions, quantitative reverse transcription PCR, reverse transcription PCR, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and gel shift assays. Moreover, a new technique was developed for transcriptional characterization of low-copy mRNA by increasing the DNA copy number of specific chromosomal regions. MdcR was shown to respond to malonate, in the absence of its catabolism. These studies contribute to ongoing characterization of the structure and function of a set of 44 LysR-type transcriptional regulators in A. baylyi ADP1. © 2017 The Authors.","Gene amplification; LysR; Malonate; Multiple promoters; Operon structure","beta galactosidase; complementary DNA; genomic DNA; malonic acid; Acinetobacter baylyi; amino acid metabolism; Article; bacterial growth; carbon source; catabolism; controlled study; copy number variation; degradation; dissociation constant; DNA sequence; enzyme activity; gel mobility shift assay; gene cluster; gene dosage; gene expression; gene structure; genetic regulation; genetic transcription; MdcR gene; mutagenesis; nonhuman; operon; priority journal; promoter region; protein DNA binding; protein expression; regulator gene; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020427230

Within this discourse of ‘extreme’ weather, the health sector is promoting climate-controlled indoor environments as a sensible coping strategy. Such responses mask our constant and ongoing adaptations to weather, which are becoming more dynamic and varied in mobile and globalised societies. In this paper, we are interested in reconceptualising adaptation as a series of everyday and remembered experiences with weather, which are situated within and carried by bodily social practices that contribute to keeping warm and cool. We are particularly concerned with what happens to these practices when those who carry them become mobile, through migration to other countries and climates. We consider the proposition that practices involved in staying warm or cool become more adaptable and innovative when they move. We explore these ideas through a study of international students who had recently moved to Melbourne, Australia from a range of countries. Using a ‘practice memory scrapbook’ method, we consider how student practices are resurrected, modified and/or transformed on arrival to a new locale, where memories are carried forward and disrupted by local varieties. Our analysis redefines the goal of adaptation as achieving tolerable, interesting, manageable, exciting, challenging and curious conditions; rather than pursuing comfort, familiarity and safety. We conclude that increasing exposure to varied weather conditions may enhance adaptive responses, and call for further research with mobile populations to provide further insight into adaptation to weather. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","air-conditioning; climate change adaptation; heat; Social practices; thermal comfort; weather","adaptive management; air conditioning; climate change; climate conditions; extreme event; heating; indoor air; student; Australia; Melbourne; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019571928

The biomass infrastructure and energy generation technology needs to be continually adapted and upgraded if it is to meet the ever-increasing demands for energy services. Although decentralized energy supply schemes based on the ORC technology have proven to be efficient, many problems related to fluctuations in heat demand, indirect plant control and varying fuel properties still remain unsolved. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a multifunctional system tool, to allow an in-depth analysis of decentralized bioenergy applications and finally to aid in the design and operation of biomass-fired cogeneration plants. The paper describes the optimisation of biomass-based energy supply via innovative and novel components which will allow continuous control of the energy input at the plant. The integration of the energy input within the plant control system has shown to be certainly beneficial for achieving of stable working conditions and enhanced system efficiency of decentralised applications. The presented optimisation approach was not only based on the implementation of new hardware control system components, but it also included a high-effective model predictive control. The main scientific target of the presented methodology was the development of the predictive mathematical models of biomass-based energy conversion plants. New knowledge has been gathered in the fields of process identification, process control algorithms and load management. The main innovative aspect of the study is the development and creation of a simulation environment for the performance analysis of district heating supply systems based on grid simulations. For this, a modular application for the simulation of load profiles was applied, in which 3D geo-data building models and detailed hydraulic grid infrastructure simulation were integrated within an innovative urban energy management platform. This enabled not only the analysis of load management scenarios, but also reliable heat demand forecasts in order to estimate the optimal control parameters for the predicted load characteristics. The main target of the research work was the improvement of the sustainability of biomass-based energy supply concepts. The CO2 emissions savings potential which was mobilised as the result of the project activities is related mainly to the fuel savings linked to the enhancement of the annual system efficiency. In the case of an analysed ORC pilot plant with 1 MW electric output, the fuel demand could be reduced by 6,300 m3 wood chips yearly. The substitution of fossil fuel-based heat and electricity which has been achieved in the course of the optimisation has enabled a summary emissions reduction of 583 tons CO2 yearly. © 2017, ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

Sampling was conducted at the upper, middle and lower reaches over two tidal cycles in 2013 and 2014. Methane and N2O emissions varied significantly over tidal cycles at all sites. Methane and N2O emissions measured at all locations and in both campaigns varied substantially in time, with the maximum to minimum flux ratio in a cycle varying between 2.5 - 9 and 1.7–4.7 times, respectively. Methane emissions peaked just before or at slack tides. In comparison, no clear patterns were observed between the N2O emissions and the tidal cycle despite there being large variations in N2O emissions in some cases. Methane concentrations were elevated during low tides whereas N2O concentrations showed no clear pattern over the tidal cycle. Surface water concentrations and tidal currents played important roles in CH4 and N2O emissions, but wind did not. Our findings show that measurements at a single point in time and site would result in significant errors in CH4 and N2O emission estimates.

The nano-SnOs synthesized by the CVT under 15 vol% CO/(CO + CO2) atmosphere were characterized using XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, etc. The results showed that tetragonal structure nano-SnO diskette and sphere with uniform granularity of 50–100 nm were obtained with high purity. During the CVT process, CO-CO2 mixed gases could reduce SnO2 to SnO and act as a CVT medium to take away the newly formed gaseous SnO, resulting in the decrease of the partial pressure of SnO. In addition, the nano-SnOs could enhance the SCR deNOx activity of activated carbon (AC), and both the reaction temperature window of AC and the NO conversion were increased if the AC was coated by nano-SnOs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Chemical vapor transport; Nano-SnO; Reduction volatilization; SCR activity","Activated carbon; Carbon; Chemical vapor deposition; Transport properties; Variable speed transmissions; Catalytic properties; Chemical vapor transport; Denox activities; High temperature; Nano-SnO; Reaction temperature; Synthesis time; Tetragonal structure; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013787759

The region acts as sink and source for atmospheric CO2. However, the efficiency of the biological carbon pump to sequester atmospheric CO2 and export particulate organic carbon from the surface is not well known. To quantify the upper ocean carbon export flux and to estimate the efficiency of biological carbon pump in the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean, seawater profiles of total 234Th were measured from surface to 300 m depth at 13 stations from 19.9°N to 25.3°S in a transect along 87°E, during spring intermonsoon period (March–April 2014). Results showed enhanced in situ primary production in the equatorial Indian Ocean and the central Bay of Bengal and varied from 13.2 to 173.8 mmol C m−2 d−1. POC export flux in this region varied from 0 to 7.7 mmol C m−2 d−1. Though high carbon export flux was found in the equatorial region, remineralization of organic carbon in the surface and subsurface waters considerably reduced organic carbon export in the Bay of Bengal. Annually recurring anticyclonic eddies enhanced organic carbon utilization and heterotrophy. Oxygen minimum zone developed due to stratification and poor ventilation was intensified by subsurface remineralization. 234Th-based carbon export fluxes were not comparable with empirical statistical model estimates based on primary production and temperature.

Using a framework based on migration aspirations and capabilities, this paper examines how climate stresses (such as droughts that cause a long-term decline in harvests) and climate shocks (i.e. acute food shortages and sudden flooding) may affect migration decision-making in rural Malawi. Drawing on survey (n = 255), interview (n = 75) and focus group (n = 93) data from rural and urban dwellers, we find that climate stresses typically do not change rural dwellers’ aspiration to leave their homes, except for a small group of younger farmers from better-off households. However, these same stresses may erode human, financial and social capital, thus reducing migration capability. Data also reveal that acute shocks erode both the migration aspirations and capabilities of even the most dedicated would-be migrant. Drawing from these two findings, this paper concludes that climate change is likely to increase barriers to migration rather than increasing migration flows in countries like Malawi where the economy is still predominately rural. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agriculture; aspirations and capabilities; climate change; migration; urbanization","agriculture; climate change; climate effect; decision analysis; decision making; food security; household income; population migration; questionnaire survey; rural area; urbanization; Malawi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964546357

This may be particularly the case in the transport sector, where there is a large private sector presence and substantial investment needs, and in low-income countries, where climate action is unlikely to be the first priority for public finances. However, it is unclear whether private finance can deliver the full range of actions that are needed for a low carbon transition, or what role the public sector can and should play to mobilise these resources. Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, is one of many cities in lower and middle income countries seeking to break away from business-as-usual trajectories and pursue more sustainable forms of urban development.

Comparing the public and private perspectives provides the opportunity to explore the financing mechanisms and policy frameworks appropriate for different kinds of low-carbon investment, and to consider how governments in developing countries can lay the foundations for compact, connected low-carbon cities. © 2017 The Authors","Finance; Mitigation; Transport; Urban",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014774464

However, local distribution networks face voltage-rise problems when numerous PV systems are connected. In particular, rooftop-type PVs on detached houses can be widely installed in Japan. In that case, the voltage rise in low-voltage wires or service wires is significant because of the high resistance of these wires. In terms of network operators, spatial distribution scenarios for PV installation cannot be prespecified because each PV installation is determined by the particular customer. This paper evaluates PV-installable capacity from a systematic perspective under voltage constraints in medium- and low-voltage networks with a consideration of voltage control equipment [under-load tap changer (ULTC) and step voltage regulator (SVR)]. Through the use of optimal parameters for ULTC and SVR, PV-installable capacity can be improved. In particular, PV-installable capacity around the end of a feeder can be significantly increased by installing a SVR. In addition, this paper analyzes the effect of load sharing of pole transformers for reducing voltage rise in terms of PV-installable capacity to compare with an installation of a SVR. Through numerical simulations, the SVR is shown to be more advantageous than the load sharing of pole transformers for increasing PV-installable capacity. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Control equipment; Greenhouse gases; Poles; Voltage control; Voltage distribution measurement; Voltage regulators; Wire; Local distribution networks; Low voltage distribution network; Low voltage network; Optimal parameter; Photovoltaic generation; Pole transformer; Step voltage regulators; Under-load tap changer; Electric machine control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017501684

Study focus The coastal watershed in central Japan along the Sea of Japan has suffered large amounts of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition from northeastern Asia. However, the quantitative influences of atmospheric N deposition onto forested watersheds in the two basins and riverine N export into coasts remain unclear. To evaluate the current contribution of atmospheric N deposition, N deposition rates from the atmosphere to both basins, and N export rates from the rivers to the sea were quantified. New hydrological insight for the region Deposition rates of bulk N in each basin exceeded 1000 mg m−2 year−1, more than 60% of which was supplied from winter to early spring by westerly winds. Annual deposition rates in the two basins did not differ, but annual export rates of inorganic N from the Kita River were significantly higher than those from the Minami River. These results suggest that symptoms of N saturation in the Kita River forested watershed are more serious. Furthermore, recent increasing trends of riverine N concentrations may have caused shifts in the limiting nutrient for coastal primary production from N to phosphorous. We suggest reductions in nitrate exports from forests as a strategy to improve nitrate pollution to both downstream waters and coastal ecosystems; however such efforts would involve intercontinental-scale actions in reducing N emissions. © 2015 The Authors","Atmospheric N deposition; Coastal ecosystem; Nitrogen saturation; Riverine N export; Trans-boundary air pollution",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952360330

Potential production rates and net accumulation of N2O from tank substrate corresponded to N availability. N2O was produced in excess at all N levels due to a low level of N2O reductase activity which agreed well with a low abundance of N2O reducers compared to nitrite reducers. Transcriptional activation, however, indicated that expression of denitrification genes may be enhanced with increasing N supply eventually leading to more efficient N2O turnover with potential for adaptation of denitrifier communities to higher N levels.

Using the case of international retailers, this article examines whether, and under what conditions, non-state actors might be capable of assuming the governance roles that have historically been played by national governments. This article concludes that external governance pressures can, if they are aligned, robust and of sufficient duration, have a significant influence on internal governance processes and on corporate strategies and actions. However, the specific actions that are taken by companies – in particular those that require significant capital investments – are constrained by the ‘business case’. That is, companies will generally only invest capital in situations when there is a clear financial case (i.e. where the benefits outweigh the costs, when the rate of return meets or exceeds company targets) for action. That is, the extent to which external governance pressures can force companies to take action, in particular challenging or transformative actions that go beyond the boundaries of the business case, is not at all clear. This is particularly the case if the business case weakens, or if the opportunities for incremental change are exhausted. In that context, the power of non-state actors to force them to consider radical changes in their business processes and their use of energy therefore seems to be very limited.

Understanding the effects of Amazon deforestation is important to preserve not only the climate, but also economic activities that depend on it, in particular, agricultural productivity and hydropower generation. This study calculates the source of water vapor contributing to the precipitation on economically relevant regions in Amazonia according to different scenarios of deforestation. These regions include the state of Mato Grosso, which produces about 9% of the global soybean production, and the basins of the Xingu and Madeira, with infrastructure under construction that will be capable to generate 20% of the electrical energy produced in Brazil. The results show that changes in rainfall after deforestation are stronger in regions nearest to the ocean and indicate the importance of the continental water vapor source to the precipitation over southern Amazonia. In the two more continental regions (Madeira and Mato Grosso), decreases in the source of water vapor in one region were offset by increases in contributions from other continental regions, whereas in the Xingu basin, which is closer to the ocean, this mechanism did not occur. As a conclusion, the geographic location of the region is an important determinant of the resiliency of the regional climate to deforestation-induced regional climate change. The more continental the geographic location, the less climate changes after deforestation. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","General circulation models; Regional effects; Vegetation-atmosphere interactions","atmosphere-biosphere interaction; deforestation; evaporation; general circulation model; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; water vapor; Amazonia; Brazil; Madeira Basin; Mato Grosso; Xingu Basin; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021095929

Understanding how the environment (natural and built), climate event risk, societal interactions, and governance reflect community resilience for adaptive management is critical for envisioning urban and natural environments that can persist through extreme weather events and longer-term shifts in climate. To be successful, this interaction of these five domains must result in maintaining quality of life and ensuring equal access to the benefits or the protection from harm for all segments of the population. An exhaustive literature review of climate resilience approaches was conducted examining the two primary elements of resilience—vulnerability and recoverability. The results of this review were examined to determine if any existing frameworks addressed the above five major areas in an integrated manner. While some aspects of a resilience model were available for existing sources, no comprehensive approach was available. A new conceptual model for resilience to climate events is proposed that incorporates some available structures and addresses these five domains at a national, regional, state, and county spatial scale for a variety of climate-induced events ranging from superstorms to droughts and their concomitant events such as wildfires, floods, and pest invasions. This conceptual model will be developed in a manner that will permit comparisons among governance units (e.g., counties) and permit an examination of best reliance practices. Published 2017.

Therefore, reduction in windblown methane is one of the important measures to mitigate atmospheric greenhouse effect. In China, weak coal seam of low permeability is common in coal mines, so it is beset with difficulties to decrease the methane emission rate by means of gas drainage from the virgin coal seam, further to decrease the windblown mine gas. Utilizing the pressure relief and permeability and fluidity improvement effect in coal mining an approach to release methane emission through surface borehole was established, for example establishing a comprehensive deformation fracture model of surface borehole in extraction area based on quantitative rule of overlying rock movement in pit and forming a technology to select the surface borehole arrangement site in extraction area on the basis of deformation of bore frame structure and distribution characteristics of extraction flow field. And optimization technology of shape and structure of surface borehole in extraction area on the basis of ultimate stress analysis of surface borehole casing was given. The technology overcomes effectively the problem that surface borehole casing is vulnerable to premature fracture due to impact of strata movement on the surface borehole, and further increases the drainage result of the surface borehole. The technology has been test in China Shanxi Jincheng Sihe Coal Mine, achieving good results, including 12,000 Nm3/d pure methane drainage rate from single borehole, 85% methane concentration and 1.1 million Nm3 accumulative methane drainage, which demonstrate practicability and advanced performance of the technology. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Coal mine; Drainage with pressure relief; Emission of methane; Emission reduction; Fracture proof; Surface borehole","Atmospheric temperature; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Coal; Coal deposits; Coal mines; Deformation; Emission control; Extraction; Fracture; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouses; Solar radiation; Stress analysis; Atmospheric greenhouse; Distribution characteristics; Emission reduction; Methane concentrations; Methane emission rates; Optimization technology; Pressure relief; Surface boreholes; Methane; borehole; coal mine; coal mining; coal seam; cracking (fracture); drainage; emission control; methane; optimization; stress analysis; vulnerability; China; Jincheng; Shanxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018758515

However, the neglect of its expansion and scarce analyses of the dynamics have made the overall disease burden and the risk distribution of the disease being unclear in mainland China. In this study, we described epidemiological characteristics of 2117 reported human TBE cases from 2006 to 2013 in mainland China. About 99% of the cases were reported in forest areas of northeastern China, and 93% of reported infections occurred during May–July. Cases were primarily male (67%), mostly in 30–59 years among all age-gender groups. Farmers (31.6%), domestic workers (20.1%) and forest workers (17.9%) accounted for the majority of the patients, and the proportions of patients from farmers and domestic workers were increasing in recent years. The epidemiological features of TBE differed slightly across the affected regions. The distribution and features of the disease in three main endemic areas of mainland China were also summarized. Using the Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) model, we found that the presence of TBE was significantly associated with a composite meteorological index, altitude, the coverage of broad-leaved forest, the coverage of mixed broadleaf-conifer forest, and the distribution of Ixodes persulcatus (I. persulcatus) ticks. The model-predicted probability of presence of human TBE cases in mainland China was mapped at the county level. The spatial distribution of human TBE in China was largely driven by the distributions of forests and I. persulcatus ticks, altitude, and climate. Enhanced surveillance and intervention for human TBE in the high-risk regions, particularly on the forest areas in north-eastern China, is necessary to prevent human infections. © 2017 The Authors","China; Endemic areas; Epidemiology; Risk assessment; Risk map; Tick-borne encephalitis","adult; age distribution; agricultural worker; Article; China; disease surveillance; domestic worker; epidemiological data; female; forest worker; geographic distribution; global disease burden; high risk population; human; infection prevention; infection risk; Ixodes persulcatus; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; nonmedical occupations; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; sex difference; tick borne encephalitis; adolescent; aged; animal; animal dispersal; child; China; forest; incidence; infant; isolation and purification; Ixodes; middle aged; newborn; physiology; preschool child; prevalence; tick borne encephalitis; Tick borne encephalitis virus; virology; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Animal Distribution; Animals; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Encephalitis Viruses, Tick-Borne; Encephalitis, Tick-Borne; Female; Forests; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Ixodes; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018261723

Many evaluation methods exist to assess the climate regulation service on regional and global scales. However, the processes driving local scale effects are poorly understood. We established a new method, which combined the cooling effects of forest and cooling costs to assess the value of climate regulation of a local scale forest. The inhabitable value of cooling service of forests for the farming area and built-up area and the payable value only for the built-up area were considered separately. The climate regulation effects of a forest in Fanggan, a mountainous village of East China, were studied. In 2014, the economic value of the cooling effects of the forest was 3727 USD per ha per year.

The members of IC 1805 were selected from their location in the various color-color and color-magnitude diagrams, and the presence of Hα emission, mid-infrared excess emission, and X-ray emission. The reddening law toward IC 1805 is nearly normal (RV = 3.05 ± 0.06). However, the distance modulus of the cluster is estimated to be 11.9 ±0.2 mag (d = 2.4 ± 0.2 kpc) from the reddening-free color-magnitude diagrams, which is larger than the distance to the nearby massive star-forming region W3(OH) measured from the radio VLBA astrometry. We also determined the age of IC 1805 (τMSTO = 3.5 Myr). In addition, we critically compared the age and mass scale from two pre-main-sequence evolution models. The initial mass function with a Salpeter-type slope of Γ = -1.3 ±0.2 was obtained and the total mass of IC 1805 was estimated to be about 2700 ±200 M⊙. Finally, we found our distance determination to be statistically consistent with the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution Data Release 1, within the errors. The proper motion of the B-type stars shows an elongated distribution along the Galactic plane, which could be explained by some of the B-type stars being formed in small clouds dispersed by previous episodes of star formation or supernova explosions. © 2017.

Surface water samples were collected monthly from October 2009-September 2010. In addition, the concentration of chlorophyll-a was determined. The DOC and POC mean concentration varied between 80-340 μM and 60-115 μM, respectively. The results showed that the concentrations of these parameters were mainly influenced by human activities and season. Higher concentrations of DOC (150-340 μM) and POC (75-115 μM) were found at stations near the populated area, aquaculture and palm oil plantation. In addition, higher concentrations of DOC (200-275 μM) and POC (105-150 μM) were also recorded during the monsoon season due to runoff from terrestrial sources and resuspension from bottom sediments. No significant correlation between the low molecular weight (LMW) fractions of DOC and chlorophyll-a (R2=0.0096, p&gt;0.05) further supports the hypothesis that phytoplankton not playing key role in regulating the organic carbon distribution.

Next, the research gathers interviewee perspectives on the applicability of the 5 Principles in relation to Manila's existing resettlement landscape, and identifies any amendments or foreseen challenges to them. Finally, it explores the perceptions of resettlement, DRR, and CCA actors on the feasibility of employing resettlement as CCA in Manila, including any challenges that may impede the strategy. The findings suggest that existing resettlement infrastructure could be enhanced to provide effective CCA as identified by the 5 Principles, such as initiatives with in-city relocation sites and vertical housing.

The main vision of CISMOB is to promote innovative ways to reduce carbon footprint and increase the sustainability of urban areas by improving the efficiency in the use of urban transport infrastructure through ICT. In a context of increasing availability of sensor technology to monitor and record large amounts of data, a common challenge to policy makers is to identify the best practices to take advantage of these new sources of data. Namely, how can we use this information to prioritize intervention areas, to manage efficiently current road networks, to inform citizens and motivate them to choose more sustainable mobility options. CISMOB is focused on improving the implementation of regional policies and local mobility programmers by having a thorough understanding about the different transport related impacts and the main vulnerabilities associated to different zones of the territory. Policy and local mobility programs should not be focused in minimizing a particular parameter (ex. Levels of congestion), but rather to promote holistic approaches.

Results suggest that ship-induced ozone contribution to the total surface ozone exceeds 5% over the sea and near the coastline, while an increase up to 5% is simulated over a large portion of the European land. The largest impact (i.e., an increase up to 30%) is simulated over the Mediterranean Sea. In addition, shipping emissions are simulated to increase NO2 mixing ratio more than 90%, locally, and to modify the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere through hydroxyl radical formation (increase by 20–60% over the sea along the European coasts and near the coastal zone). Therefore, emissions from ships may counteract the benefits derived from the anthropogenic emissions reduction strategies over the continent. Simulations suggest regions where shipping emissions have a major impact on ozone mixing ratio compared to individual anthropogenic emission sector categories.

The samples were characterized by XRD, FE-SEM, TEM, N2-adsorption-desorption, XPS, Raman, UV–vis and PL spectroscopy. Bimetallic Au/Ag NPs were presented over the TiO2 NWs as an alloy, thus exhibited strong absorption of visible light due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) excitation. The synergistic effect in plasmonic Au/Ag alloy NPs for selective photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2 to CO and hydrocarbons under visible light irradiation was investigated. The present design of plasmonic Au/Ag NPs co-decorated TiO2 NWs leads to remarkably enhanced photoactivity of CO2 reduction to CO. The CO evolution rate as a main product over the Au-Ag alloy NPs coated TiO2 NWs was 1813 μmole-g-catal.−1 h−1 at selectivity 98%. This amount was approximately 1.72 time larger comparing to Au-NPs/TiO2 NWs, 1.84 fold more than the Ag-NPs/TiO2 NWs, 72.52 fold than the TiO2 NWs and 201 fold more than the amount of CO produced over the bare TiO2-NPs. This great enhancement can be attributed to synergistic effects in Au/Ag-NPs, enhanced visible light absorption due to Au-Ag alloy formation and improved charge separation in LSPR-excited TiO2 NWs. In addition, turnover productivity is introduced to investigate the effect of operating parameters on the performance of photocatalysts. The plasmonic reaction mechanism of Au-Ag NPs in conjunction with LSPR excitation and charge transport to understand the reaction pathway is described. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 photoreduction; H2 reductant; Plasmonic Au-Ag alloy; Synergistic effect; TiO2 NWs; Visible light","Carbon dioxide; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Light; Light absorption; Plasmons; Silver; Surface plasmon resonance; Titanium dioxide; Au-Ag alloys; Photo-reduction; Reductants; Synergistic effect; Visible light; Silver alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85003009429

Despite its importance, the relative effect of relevant functional traits for carbon storage has remained mostly untested in different bioclimatic regions. Aims: In this study, different components of functional diversity such as community-weighted means of trait values (CWM), functional trait diversity (Rao’s quadratic diversity), functional richness (FRi), functional evenness (FEv) and functional divergence (FDiv) were used to associate carbon content of above-ground biomass, litter and soil in four bioclimatic regions including warm and cold-steppe, semi-steppe rangelands and oak dry forest in the south-west of Iran. Methods: Several key important traits highly associated with carbon storage including specific leaf area (SLA), height (H), leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus content (LNC and LPC), leaf longevity, wood specific gravity and life form were determined to quantify single and multiple traits that contribute to different components of plant functional diversity. Results: The results showed that CWM of H, Chamaephyte life form, LNC and LPC were among the most important aspects of functional diversity that positively predicted carbon storage in above-ground biomass and soil. We also observed the negative association of carbon storage with FEv of LNC, Rao of LNC and FEv of multiple traits in the rangelands and the negative association of carbon storage with FDiv of SLA in the forest. Conclusions: Our results indicate that different components of functional diversity are essential for a mechanistic understanding of the role of plant diversity for carbon storage. The negative associations between FDiv and FEv and carbon storage do not provide support for the complementarity niche hypothesis. Our results suggest that in the more functionally diverse ecosystems dominated by functionally important species with key traits, the so-called functional identity does indeed promote carbon storage, at least in these semi-arid ecosystems. © 2017 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor & Francis.","biodiversity loss; biomass ratio hypothesis; Biosphere Reserve of Tang-Sayyad; carbon input and loss; distance-based FD framework; trait-based approach",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031924965

The AFIR method has been applied extensively to molecular systems to elucidate the mechanism of chemical reactions such as homogeneous catalysis. The present PBC/AFIR approach found 274 local minima for carbon crystals in the C8 unit cell described by the generalized gradient approximation-Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional. Among many newly predicted structures, three low-lying structures, which exhibit somewhat higher energy compared with those previously predicted, such as Cco-C8 (Z-carbon) and M-carbon, are further discussed with calculations of phonon and band dispersion curves. Furthermore, approaches to systematically explore two- or one-dimensional periodic structures are proposed and applied to the C8 unit cell with the slab model. These results suggest that the present approach is highly promising for predicting crystal structures. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,"Calculations; Catalysis; Artificial forces; First principles; Generalized gradient approximations; Homogeneous catalysis; Low-lying structures; Molecular systems; Perdew-burke-ernzerhof; Periodic boundary conditions; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023193320

In order to prevent heat-related illness, it is recommended that workers take breaks during working hours. However, this would lead to reductions in worktime and labor productivity. In this study, we estimate the economic cost of heat-related illness prevention through worker breaks associated with climate change under a wide range of climatic and socioeconomic conditions. We calculate the worktime reduction based on the recommendation of work/rest ratio and the estimated future wet bulb glove temperature, which is an index of heat stresses. Corresponding GDP losses (cost of heat-related illness prevention through worker breaks) are estimated using a computable general equilibrium model throughout this century. Under the highest emission scenario, GDP losses in 2100 will range from 2.6 to 4.0% compared to the current climate conditions. On the other hand, GDP losses will be less than 0.5% if the 2.0 °C goal is achieved. The benefit of climate-change mitigation for avoiding worktime loss is comparable to the cost of mitigation (cost of the greenhouse gas emission reduction) under the 2.0 °C goal. The relationship between the cost of heat-related illness prevention through worker breaks and global average temperature rise is approximately linear, and the difference in economic loss between the 1.5 °C goal and the 2.0 °C goal is expected to be approximately 0.3% of global GDP in 2100. Although climate mitigation and socioeconomic development can limit the vulnerable regions and sectors, particularly in developing countries, outdoor work is still expected to be affected. The effectiveness of some adaptation measures such as additional installation of air conditioning devices or shifting the time of day for working are also suggested. In order to reduce the economic impacts, adaptation measures should also be implemented as well as pursing ambitious climate change mitigation targets. © 2017 The Author(s).

Doubling CO2 produces a poleward shift of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) midlatitude jet that is driven primarily by cloud shortwave feedback and modulated by ice albedo feedback, in agreement with earlier studies. More surprisingly, for CO2 increases smaller than ~25 %, the SH jet shifts equatorward. Nonlinearities are also apparent in the Northern Hemisphere, but with less zonal symmetry. Baroclinic instability theory and climate feedback analysis suggest that as the CO2 forcing amplitude is reduced, there is a transition from a regime in which cloud and circulation changes are largely decoupled to a regime in which they are highly coupled. In the dynamically coupled regime, there is an apparent cancellation between cloud feedback due to warming and cloud feedback due to the shifting jet, and this allows the ice albedo feedback to dominate in the high latitudes. The extent to which dynamical coupling effects exceed thermodynamic forcing effects is strongly influenced by cloud microphysics: an alternate model configuration with slightly increased cloud liquid (LIQ) produces poleward jet shifts regardless of the amplitude of CO2 forcing. Altering the cloud microphysics also produces substantial spread in the circulation response to CO2 doubling: the LIQ configuration produces a poleward SH jet shift approximately twice that produced under the default configuration. Analysis of large ensembles of the Canadian Earth System Model version 2 demonstrates that nonlinear, cloud-coupled jet shifts are also possible in comprehensive models. We still expect a poleward trend in SH jet latitude for timescales on which CO2 increases by more than ~25 %. But on shorter timescales, our results give good reason to expect significant equatorward deviations. We also discuss the implications for understanding the circulation response to small external forcings from other sources, such as the solar cycle. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Atmospheric circulation; Climate change; Cloud feedback; Cloud microphysics","atmospheric circulation; atmospheric modeling; baroclinic instability; carbon dioxide; climate change; cloud microphysics; extratropical environment; nonlinearity; Northern Hemisphere; Southern Hemisphere; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982957461

One such system is cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) derived from acid hydrolysis of cellulosic materials, such as plants, tunicates and agriculture biomass. The utilization of colloidal CNCs can aid in the reduction of carbon dioxide that is responsible for global warming and climate change. CNCs are excellent candidates for the design and development of functional nanomaterials in many applications due to several attractive features, such as high surface area, hydroxyl groups for functionalization, colloidal stability, low toxicity, chirality and mechanical strength. Several large scale manufacturing facilities have been commissioned to produce CNCs of up to 1000 kg/day, and this has generated increasing interests in both academic and industrial laboratories.

In Ireland, the Dublin Port Tunnel (DPT) was opened in 2006 as a dedicated route for HGVs between Dublin Port and the motorway system in order to reduce the HGV volume in the city centre. An HGV management strategy to restrict HGVs travelling through the city centre was also introduced. The aim of this study was to estimate the emission changes brought about by these infrastructural and regulatory changes. A transport model built in VISUM was utilized. Emissions were calculated using COPERT 4. The results showed that the DPT and HGV management strategy reduced the traffic in the city centre, and the HGV management improved traffic speed distribution. However the DPT and HGV management resulted in vehicles travelling further (travel distance increased by 16% and 51%, respectively) and increased the total emissions (increased by 8% and 21% in NOx, respectively). Total traffic and emission changes over time in Dublin were also estimated in this study. The traffic conditions and emissions in 2006, 2007 and 2013 were evaluated and the results indicated that a travel demand reduction in 2013 could also improve speed distribution.

At the forefront of the renaissance of large hydropower dams are Chinese companies, as the builders of the world's largest dams at home and abroad, opening up opportunities for low- and middle-income countries. However, large hydropower dams, despite their possible developmental and carbon reduction contributions, are accompanied by huge economic costs, profound negative environmental changes and social impacts. Using fieldwork data from four hydropower projects in Ghana, Nigeria, Cambodia and Malaysia, this paper evaluates the behaviour of Chinese stakeholders engaged in large hydropower projects in Asia and Africa. We do this by first exploring the interests of the different Chinese stakeholders and then by investigating the wider implications of these Chinese dams on the local, national and international contexts. The paper concludes that hydropower dams will continue to play a prominent role in future efforts to increase energy security and reduce energy poverty worldwide, therefore the planning, building and mitigation strategies need to be implemented in a more sustainable way that takes into account national development priorities, the needs of local people and the impacts on natural habitats.

Political ecology, however, highlights that good governance and effective land management at the local level can offset the impact of population growth and development on environmental degradation. In this paper, we provide an innovative argument derived from political ecology to explain deforestation, but rather than pursing a “bottom up” approach to governance, we take a “top down” approach. We argue that the state can ease deforestation rates by weaning rural populations off of the consumption of biomass for their energy needs by expanding rural electrification access. Using a panel analysis of 158 countries for the years 1990, 2000, and 2010, we find that not only does rural electrification cause deforestation rates to decrease, but also that it is more robust in explaining deforestation than population growth or development. Our study provides two innovations to political ecology: it highlights that the state can help, rather than hinder, local populations with managing their local environments in a more sustainable way by providing them with (public goods-based) energy alternatives, and; it supplements political ecology's qualitative focus on environmental degradation with a generalized quantitative analysis of state-based initiatives on deforestation. Our results suggest that current global initiatives addressing deforestation—specifically the Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) agenda of the United Nations’ Framework Convention on Climate Change—should not only assist local land managers, but also work with the state to ensure universal access to electricity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","deforestation; political ecology; REDD; rural electrification","deforestation; electricity supply; emission control; innovation; land management; rural development; rural electrification; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014103307

However, the conventional energy review made for big companies is laborious and costly to execute especially for small-sized and micro companies. Therefore, many smaller companies have been left out of the work to promote energy efficiency. This in turn means that they will also lose a significant cost savings potential. This project aims at creating an adaptable model for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to use in assessing their individual energy efficiency. The model may be used for both surveying the current use of energy in a company, as well as, for determining necessary improvements in energy-saving goals set.

Studies suggest that climate-driven drought regulates wildfires, but these overlook subsurface processes leading to hydrological drought, an important driver. Here, we show that models which include hydrological processes better predict area burnt than those solely based on climate data. We report that the Borneo landscape has experienced a substantial hydrological drying trend since the early twentieth century, leading to progressive tree mortality, more severe than in other tropical regions. This has caused massive wildfires in lowland Borneo during the past two decades, which we show are clustered in years with large areas of hydrological drought coinciding with strong El Niño events. Statistical modelling evidence shows amplifying wildfires and greater area burnt in response to El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) strength, when hydrology is considered. These results highlight the importance of considering hydrological drought for wildfire prediction, and we recommend that hydrology should be considered in future studies of the impact of projected ENSO strength, including effects on tropical ecosystems, and biodiversity conservation. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Many of these crops are grown in semi-arid regions or subtropical regions where rainfall is seasonal and as a result the vast majority of these perennial, evergreen orchards are under irrigation. This represents a significant irrigation requirement and with more emphasis being placed on the conservation of water and orchard profitability, it is becoming increasingly important to accurately estimate water use of these crops and schedule irrigation accordingly. The FAO-56 procedure is a simple, convenient and reproducible method for estimating water use. However, the transferability of crop coefficients between different orchards and growing regions is not always readily achieved, due largely to differences in canopy size and management practices. In addition, as subtropical crops tend to exhibit a higher degree of stomatal control over transpiration than most other agricultural crops, some measure of canopy or leaf resistance must be taken into account when using models based on atmospheric demand. The challenge is therefore to provide reliable and dynamic estimates of canopy resistance from relatively simple parameters which can be of use to irrigation consultants and farmers for determining the water requirements of these crops. The challenge remains to ensure that these dynamic estimates are realistic and readily applicable to a number of growing regions. The derivation of transpiration crop coefficients, based on canopy cover and height and a dynamic estimate of leaf resistance, provided reasonable estimates of transpiration in three orchards in contrasting climates, suggesting that this approach could prove useful in future for subtropical crops.","Effective fractional cover; Leaf resistance; Transpiration; Transpiration crop coefficients; Vapour pressure deficit",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021441639

The spectra were obtained with the Keck 10 m telescope, including light coming from within 0.5 arcsec of the star, corresponding typically to within a few to tens of astronomical units of the star, and covering nearly the entire visible wavelength range from 3640 to 7890 Å. We establish detection thresholds by injecting synthetic laser emission lines into our spectra and blindly analyzing them for detections. We compute flux density detection thresholds for all wavelengths and spectral types sampled. Our detection thresholds for the power of the lasers themselves range from 3 kW to 13 MW, independent of distance to the star but dependent on the competing ""glare"" of the spectral energy distribution of the star and on the wavelength of the laser light, launched from a benchmark, diffraction-limited 10 m class telescope.

Besides Chile's main mining products, copper, molybdenum and iron, the production of lithium carbonate from lithium containing brines has become strategically important due to the rising demand for battery technologies worldwide. Its energy-intensive production may affect the ecological footprint of the product and the country's climate targets. Thus, the use of solar technologies for electricity and heat production might constitute an interesting option for CO2 mitigation. This study aims to quantify the impacts of the lithium carbonate production processes in Chile on climate change, and to identify site-specific integration options of solar energy technologies to reduce GHG life-cycle emissions. The considered solar integration options include a parabolic trough power plant with a molten salt storage, a solar tower power plant with molten salt receiver and molten salt storage, a one-axis tracking photovoltaic energy system for electricity, and two solar thermal power plants with Ruths storage (steam accumulator) for thermal heat production. CSP plants were identified as measures with the highest GHG mitigation potential reducing the CO2 emissions for the entire production chain and the lithium production between 16% and 33%. In a scenario that combines solar technologies for electricity and thermal energy generation, up to 59% of the CO2 emissions at the lithium production sites in Chile can be avoided. A comparison of the GHG abatement costs of the proposed solar integration options indicates that the photovoltaic system, the solar thermal plant with limited storage and the solar tower power plant are the most cost effective options. © 2017 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023594718

A local ASM group mining an alluvial gold deposit agreed to allow the research team to collect eight samples of ore material immediately before it was to be processed by their sluice and eight samples taken immediately upon exit from their sluice. Each sample was sieved into three grain size portions (<75 μm, 75–500 μm and >500 μm) and each portion assayed for gold content. The results indicate that the sluice at this site is capturing approximately 91% of the gold that enters the sluicing system, and the grain size distribution of the gold particles suggests that mercury amalgamation methods employed by the miners post sluicing are likely to be very efficient as well. Although this study and sample size is extremely small, and should not be taken as a full replacement of more elaborate geologic sampling and metallurgical analysis, this method could provide a useful tool for practitioners who want to quickly evaluate ASM gold processing methods and consider the effectiveness of introducing alternative processing technologies, especially those that aim to reduce mercury emissions from ASM. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Artisanal and small-scale mining; Gold; Gravity separation; Mercury","Gold; Grain size and shape; Mercury (metal); Metals; Miners; Processing; Separation; Testing; Artisanal and small scale mining; Gold recovery rate; Grain size distribution; Gravitational separation; Gravity separation; Metallurgical analysis; Minimally invasive; Processing technologies; Gold deposits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010843519

This book has presented and assessed various approaches to assessing climate change risks and adaptation in Africa. These assessments are approached from multiple lenses that include climate model-linked biophysical modeling, multilogit analysis, and social approaches (e.g., focus group discussions and interviews). The focus of the book was predominantly dryland agricultural systems in which resource-constrained smallholder farmers operate. The results from different cases highlighted in the book give a strong indication that climate change is already having significant impacts on agricultural systems in SSA, especially smallholder crop and pastoral farming systems. However, it is apparent that there are considerable differences in the impacts from one place to the other and across farming systems, states, crops, etc. As such, although it is clear that adaptation is imperative, the direction and scope of such actions should not only be guided by regional and national imperatives, but also take into account local specificities. For smallholder crop farmers and livestock keepers, climate change is experienced within the context of their livelihood, which is tied to their past, present, and future. They have historically had to deal with the vagaries of climate and have developed several strategies to cope with and adapt to climate change and variability. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Studies that evaluate ecological and socio-economic sustainability-factors of these production techniques are scarce. In this study, we analyze the greenhouse gas emissions along vegetable supply chains based on a life cycle approach and investigate factors of the socio-economic system towards future market diffusion of these new-old technologies based on the Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture Systems (SAFA) guidelines of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Data of the supply-chains of lettuce, spinach, scallions and red radish was collected from field trials in different climatic regions in Austria and compared to existing commercial systems in Austria and Italy. The results show, that unheated winter vegetable production is feasible. Greenhouse gas emissions of unheated vegetables are lower with 0.06–0.12 kg CO2 equivalent versus 0.61–0.64 kg CO2 equivalent per kg fresh product crops from heated systems. Due to small packaging units unheated vegetables show maxima of 0.58 kg CO2 equivalent per kg product. Heated products were outreached by two times when individual shopping trips to the farm were taken into account. Keeping salad frost-free was not found to contribute to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional systems. The analysis reveals that a diffusion of unheated winter harvest systems depend primarily on 11 interdepending socio-economic factors. An innovative subsidy system and the creation of a positive image of winter harvest from unheated vegetables production together with an increased utilization rate of polytunnel areas and the consultancy for producers and processors are the most influential factors towards a sustainable market diffusion of winter harvest produce. © 2017 The Authors","Frost-hardy vegetables; Greenhouse gas emissions; Low-energy system; Seasonality; Vegetable production; Winter harvest","Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Cultivation; Diffusion; Economic analysis; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Harvesting; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Vegetables; Food and agriculture organizations; Low energy system; Production techniques; Seasonality; Socio-economic factor; Socio-economic systems; Sustainability assessment; Vegetable productions; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016599069

An on-demand mode solid laser in the 1064 nm band was proposed previously. In this paper, we provide a fiber laser for on-demand modes in the 1550 nm band to prescribe the pure and high-quality emission of a higher-order transverse laser mode, based on a simple construction with one spatial light modulator (SLM) and a single-mode erbium-doped fiber (SM-EDF). The SLM is designated to generate the desired higher-order mode and separate the higher-order mode and the fundamental mode. The fundamental mode oscillates in the fiber ring laser, and therefore the SM-EDF can be pumped with a single-mode 980 nm laser, no matter what higher-order mode is prescribed. In this proof-of-principle experiment, high-quality higher-order modes are observed from LP01 to LP105. Stable emission and real-time switching between modes can be easily realized by altering the phase on the SLM. In addition, the propagation of the LP01, LP11, LP21, and LP02 modes from the fiber laser is also demonstrated in a four-mode few-mode fiber. © 2017 Chinese Laser Press.","Laser beam shaping; Lasers, erbium; Phase modulation; Spatial light modulators","Fiber lasers; Fibers; Laser beams; Light modulation; Phase modulation; Pumping (laser); Ring lasers; Solid state lasers; Erbium doped fibers; Higher-order modes; Laser beam shaping; Lasers , erbium; Proof-of-principle experiments; Real-time switching; Spatial light modulators; Transverse laser mode; Light modulators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020802133

National capacity and legal frameworks have been adjusted to make the country eligible for REDD+ financing. In some local areas, activities have been implemented to ‘produce’ carbon credits intended for the international voluntary carbon market. Through a case study of a pilot REDD+ project in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, we examine how REDD+ has intersected with property rights institutions and agrarian change to influence changing property relations and commodity markets. Our findings show that REDD+ implemented through state and local institutions has articulated with the local political economy to coproduce conditions that embody local norms, needs, and desires. Specifically, local actors negotiate state-sanctioned tenurial instruments used for REDD+ governance, not for the purposes of carbon sequestration but instead in order to reassert their rights to land and forest for the cultivation of boom crops—the antithesis of REDD+ objectives. In the fine balancing act of adjusting local forestland holdings, REDD+ implementation has effectively facilitated increased opportunities for upland villagers to strategically claim land titles from local political authorities in the form of communal land certificates for forests called ‘Red Books’. In securing communal Red Books, villagers redefine or co-constitute the purpose of REDD+ to secure land for cash crop and commercial timber production. As with other forms of environmental governance, REDD+ is thus co-constituted locally in line with state and local institutions and histories and present day realities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Co-production; Local livelihoods; Property rights; REDD+; Transnational governance; Vietnam","agrarian change; deforestation; emission control; governance approach; land rights; livelihood; political economy; Tay Nguyen; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015173917

Based on nine consecutive years of monthly monitoring of pH, alkalinity, oxygen, and temperature, we calculated the pCO2 and CO2 flux and related these to environmental drivers. Variations in annual rainfall, with extreme low levels along 2012–2014 caused the water level to decrease up to 1 m. Low water levels were associated with higher concentrations of chlorophyll-a and organic carbon as well as reduced water transparency. Under these conditions, pCO2 increased and the lake was predominantly a source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Applying a generalized linear model, we found that water temperature, water column stability, and water level were linked to pCO2. The influences of predicted regional changes in rainfall associated with low water levels will according to our model further deteriorate the water quality and enhance CO2 emissions from the lake to the atmosphere. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Monitoring, climate changes; Peri Lake; Rainfall; Water quality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027839688

The main trigger of plant mortality is xylem hydraulic failure due to embolism and induced by the low pressures at which water is transported through xylem. As the Mediterranean basin will be severely affected by climate change, the aim of this study was to provide novel information about drought resistance and tolerance of one of its most widely distributed and common genera as a case study: the genus Cistus. Different functional and anatomical traits were evaluated in four co-occurring Cistus species in the Mediterranean Montado ecosystem. Soil water availability for each species was also assessed to evaluate if they show different ecological niches within the area. Results showed physiological and xylem anatomical differences between the four co-occurring species, as well as in the soil water availability of the sites they occupy. Despite the significant differences in embolism resistance across species, no trade-off between hydraulic safety and efficiency was observed. Interestingly, species with narrower vessels showed lower resistance to embolism than those with higher proportions of large conduits. No correlation, however, was observed between resistance to embolism and wood density. The four species showed different water-use and drought-tolerance strategies, occupying different ecological niches that would make them cope differently with drought. These results will allow us to improve the predictions about the expected changes in vegetation dynamics in this area due to ongoing climate change. © The Author 2017.

Marine mammals equipped with biologging devices are now being used to fill the data gaps in these logistically difficult to sample regions. Since 2002, instrumented animals have been generating exceptionally large data sets of oceanographic CTD casts (>500,000 profiles), which are now freely available to the scientific community through the MEOP data portal (http://meop.net). MEOP (Marine Mammals Exploring the Oceans Pole to Pole) is a consortium of international researchers dedicated to sharing animal-derived data and knowledge about the polar oceans. Collectively, MEOP demonstrates the power and cost-effectiveness of using marine mammals as data-collection platforms that can dramatically improve the ocean observing system for biological and physical oceanographers.

Among natural disasters, drought is of great interest to scientists due to the extraordinary diversity of their severity and duration. Motivated by the development of a potential approach to investigate future possible droughts in a probabilistic framework based on climate change projections, a methodology to consider thirteen future climate projections based on four emission scenarios to characterize droughts is presented. The proposed approach uses a regional climate model coupled with a physically-based hydrology model (Watershed Environmental Hydrology Hydro-Climate Model; WEHY-HCM) to generate thirteen equally likely future water supply projections. The water supply projections were compared to the current water demand for the detection of drought events and estimation of drought properties. The procedure was applied to Shasta Dam watershed to analyze drought conditions at the watershed outlet, Shasta Dam. The results suggest an increasing water scarcity at Shasta Dam with more severe and longer future drought events in some future scenarios. An important advantage of the proposed approach to the probabilistic analysis of future droughts is that it provides the drought properties of the 100-year and 200-year return periods without resorting to any extrapolation of the frequency curve. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate projections; Drought condition; Global climate model (GCM); Shasta Dam watershed (SDW),emission scenarios; Watershed Environmental Hydrology Hydro-Climate Model (WEHY-HCM)","Climate change; Dams; Disasters; Drought; Electric power system interconnection; Hydrology; Water supply; Watersheds; Climate change projections; Climate projection; Drought conditions; Emission scenario; Future climate projections; Global climate model; Regional climate modeling; Socio-economic development; Climate models; atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; climate modeling; climate prediction; drought; emission; hydrological modeling; regional climate; twenty first century; water supply; watershed; Article; climate change; comparative study; controlled study; dam (barrier); drought; history; mathematical model; methodology; physically based hydrology model; probability; regional climate model; simulation; water and water related phenomena; water demand; water supply; watershed; Watershed Environmental Hydrology Hydro Climate Model; California; Shasta Dam; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011252771

Various methods are suggested for the control of internal space factors of greenhouses but require significant amount of energy. Photovoltaics integrated in the greenhouse roof could be used to supply a part of this energy with no significant effect on greenhouse crop yield. Accordingly, aim of this work is to present the potential reduction of the cost of energy needed for greenhouse heating and cooling in southern European and Mediterranean regions, by implementing renewable energy sources. Furthermore, the potential carbon footprint reduction resulting when using renewables compared to conventional energy sources is also studied. Thus, the integration of a PV system on the greenhouse roof for electricity production was studied and the effects on energy needs and greenhouse environmental impact were considered. Two case studies were considered for a 1 ha tomato greenhouse in central Greece: (a) covering a small percentage of the greenhouse roof (0.65%) by a PV system of about 10 kWp and (b) covering about 6.5% of the greenhouse roof by a PV system of 100 kWp. It was found that a PV system covering only 6.5% of the roof surface could be enough to completely cover the electricity needs for the auxiliary processes of a greenhouse. The estimated PV electricity production could reduce the life cycle impact of a greenhouse by 5-10%.","Heating; Life cycle impact; Photovoltaics; Solar energy",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028836662

Modeling potential distributions of invasive weeds can prioritize locations for monitoring and control efforts, increasing management efficiency. Forecasts of invasion risk at regional to continental scales are enabled by readily available downscaled climate surfaces together with an increasing number of digitized and georeferenced species occurrence records and species distribution modeling techniques. However, predictions at a finer scale and in landscapes with less topographic variation may require predictors that capture biotic processes and local abiotic conditions. Contemporary remote sensing (RS) data can enhance predictions by providing a range of spatial environmental data products at fine scale beyond climatic variables only. In this study, we used the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and empirical maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models to model the potential distributions of 14 invasive plant species across Southeast Asia (SEA), selected from regional and Vietnam’s lists of priority weeds. Spatial environmental variables used to map invasion risk included bioclimatic layers and recent representations of global land cover, vegetation productivity (GPP), and soil properties developed from Earth observation data. Results showed that combining climate and RS data reduced predicted areas of suitable habitat compared with models using climate or RS data only, with no loss in model accuracy. However, contributions of RS variables were relatively limited, in part due to uncertainties in the land cover data. We strongly encourage greater adoption of quantitative remotely sensed estimates of ecosystem structure and function for habitat suitability modeling. Through comprehensive maps of overall predicted area and diversity of invasive species, we found that among lifeforms (herb, shrub, and vine), shrub species have higher potential invasion risk in SEA. Native invasive species, which are often overlooked in weed risk assessment, may be as serious a problem as non-native invasive species. Awareness of invasive weeds and their environmental impacts is still nascent in SEA and information is scarce. Freely available global spatial datasets, not least those provided by Earth observation programs, and the results of studies such as this one provide critical information that enables strategic management of environmental threats such as invasive species. © 2017 Truong, Hardy and Andrew.","Invasibility; MaxEnt; MODIS; Native invasive species; Non-native invasive species; Southeast Asia; Species distribution modeling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021067219

To be in accordance with the certified green-mark products implementation since 2002, the benefit analysis was presented to connect with the trends of related sustainability indicators, including electricity consumption, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, tap water consumption, municipal solid waste (MSW) and industrial waste (IW) recycling ratios, and renewable electricity purchase. At this period, the electricity consumption per capita slightly increased from 8.5 MWh in 2002 to 10.4 MWh in 2012. By contrast, CO2 emissions intensity remarkably decreased from 0.71 kg CO2/US$ in 2002 to 0.53 kg CO2/US$ in 2012. More consistently, the tap water consumption per capita dropped from 0.35 m3/capita-day in 2001 to 0.27 m3/capita-day in 2012. The resource recycling ratios (i.e., 40.40, and 82.40 %) from MSW and IW in 2011 have been relatively high as compared to those in 2002 (i.e., 15.55 and 72.67 %). Furthermore, the renewable electricity purchased by the Taipower (one of the nation-owned enterprises) remarkably increased from 1933.3 GWh in 2002 to 3183.9 GWh in 2012. It was positively connected with experiencing a significant progress towards green economy and CO2 emissions mitigation in Taiwan partly due to GPP from the green-mark products consumption and the renewable electricity purchase. Finally, some global adaptation and mitigation strategies for GPP and green-mark products were addressed in the paper. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Benefit connection; Green public procurement; Green-mark product; Greenhouse gas emissions mitigation; Promotion measure; Resource recycling","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cost analysis; cost-benefit analysis; environmental economics; fuel consumption; green economy; greenhouse gas; innovation; legal system; mitigation; municipal solid waste; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949983515

In this work, features of the instability, in the presence of a zero-electron emission material at the thruster exit plane, are analyzed using coherent Thomson scattering. Limiting the electron emission at the exit plane alters the localization of the accelerating electric field and the expected drift velocity profile, which in turn modifies the amplitude and localization of the ECDI. The resulting changes to the standard thruster operation are expected to favor an increased contribution by the ECDI to electron current. Such an operation is associated with a degradation of thruster performance and stability. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Coherent scattering; Cyclotrons; Electric field effects; Electric fields; Electrons; Hall thrusters; Drift instability; Drift velocities; Electron currents; Electron cyclotrons; Exit planes; Microturbulence; Thomson scattering; Thruster performance; Electron emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020028728

Density functional theory is used to study the adsorption process and identify the key interactions which drive it at ambient temperatures. A detailed adsorption model which represents the adsorption process is derived and used to extract thermodynamic properties from previously reported adsorption isotherms. We find that after adsorption of a single molecule to the face of the metal cluster, a nanostructured surface is formed which enables adsorption of additional CH4 molecules at reduced entropic penalty thanks to on-surface hopping motions and retention of significant translational freedom. Binding of the CH4 molecules to the MOF is dominated by electrostatic interactions with negatively charged carboxylate groups, while CH4-CH4 dispersion interactions are important only at high pressures. Last, the MOF-specific adsorption model is compared against the single-site Langmuir model.

However, there is environment cost for producing PV systems, including all carbon emissions generated from all phases of manufacturing supply chain. Thus, energy payback time (EPBT) has become important criteria to evaluate the performance PV systems. Estimating EPBT of PV systems relies on life cycle analysis (LCA) assessment. Current carbon footprint (CF) calculation uses long-run CF averaging method, which generates static CF information. However, solar PV Supply chain is quite dynamic because PV system components may be manufactured in different regions and use different power sources. Thus, the averaging method is not able to capture the dynamics of CF and that also implies that the uncertainties and data quality of CF auditing are negatively impacted. This study proposes an IoT-based dynamic carbon footprint approach to address the challenges above. The proposed method aims to capture LCA measuring data from IoT sensors and calculate dynamic CF of PV module across PV supply chain. The dynamic CF allows each PV module to have unique CF pedigree information based on its source of parts, the mix of energy types used during the manufacturing stage, and other CF related allocation data.

CMV (strain Fny) infection affects M. persicae feeding behavior and performance on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), Arabidopsis thaliana and cucurbits in varying ways. In Arabidopsis and cucurbits, CMV decreases host quality and inhibits prolonged feeding by aphids, which may enhance virus transmission rates. CMV-infected cucurbits also emit deceptive, aphid-attracting volatiles, which may favor virus acquisition. In contrast, aphids on CMV-infected tobacco (cv. Xanthi) exhibit increased survival and reproduction. This may not increase transmission but might increase virus and vector persistence within plant communities. The CMV 2b counter-defense protein diminishes resistance to aphid infestation in CMV-infected tobacco plants. We hypothesised that in tobacco CMV and its 2b protein might also alter the emission of volatile organic compounds that would influence aphid behavior. Results: Analysis of headspace volatiles emitted from tobacco plants showed that CMV infection both increased the total quantity and altered the blend produced. Furthermore, experiments with a CMV 2b gene deletion mutant (CMV?2b) showed that the 2b counter-defense protein influences volatile emission. Free choice bioassays were conducted where wingless M. persicae could choose to settle on infected or mock-inoculated plants under a normal day/night regime or in continual darkness. Settling was recorded at 15 min, 1 h and 24 h post-release. Statistical analysis indicated that aphids showed no marked preference to settle on mock-inoculated versus infected plants, except for a marginally greater settlement of aphids on mock-inoculated over CMV-infected plants under normal illumination. Conclusions: CMV infection of tobacco plants induced quantitative and qualitative changes in host volatile emission and these changes depended in part on the activity of the 2b counter-defense protein. However, CMV-induced alterations in tobacco plant volatile emission did not have marked effects on the settling of aphids on infected versus mock-inoculated plants even though CMV-infected plants are higher quality hosts for M. persicae. © 2017 The Author(s).","2b protein; Cucumovirus; Induced susceptibility; Jasmonates; Plant-herbivore interactions; Plant-virus interactions; Potyvirus; RNA silencing; Secondary metabolism; Semiochemical; Systemic induced resistance","Cucumber mosaic virus 2b protein; unclassified drug; viral protein; virus vector; volatile organic compound; 2b protein, cucumber mosaic virus; viral protein; volatile organic compound; aphid; Article; CMV 2b gene; controlled study; Cucumber mosaic virus; gene deletion; Myzus persicae; Nicotiana tabacum; nonhuman; protein analysis; protein function; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; virus cell interaction; virus gene; virus infection; virus transmission; animal; aphid; Cucumovirus; feeding behavior; genetics; host pathogen interaction; insect vector; metabolism; pathogenicity; physiology; plant disease; RNA interference; tobacco; virology; Animals; Aphids; Cucumovirus; Feeding Behavior; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Insect Vectors; Plant Diseases; RNA Interference; Tobacco; Viral Proteins; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018990003

In this context, command-and-control involves a limit on the total emissions and penalties for any polluter exceeding this environmental limit, while carbon tax involves a variable cost for emissions. We also propose two novel policy options that should be considered by policy makers for transportation emissions: (1) a per unit per mile transportation penalty, and (2) a collective transportation emissions policy with a limit on total transportation emissions that encourages emission and cost efficient facility networks. We devise an exact algorithm to solve the arising discontinuous nonlinear integer problem. We also consider simplified versions of the problem to gain analytical insights on factors driving the solutions for the more accurate yet complex scenarios. We develop a realistic dataset from the auto industry gleaned from publicly available sources to highlight key results of the model. Through analysis of this representative data, we identify the environmental limits and penalties that would drive the company to compliance. We find that stricter regulations without high penalties would not assure compliance as the benefits of increased scale associated with a centralized plant frequently outweigh the regulatory penalties. At the strategic level, a production emissions tax does not encourage companies to reduce production emissions. However, high lump sum penalties with intermediate limits reduce both regional production and total transportation emissions. We find that for regional production emissions, while a command and control scheme with a high lump sum emissions penalty is effective in reducing emissions, a per unit carbon tax has no effect. Interestingly the opposite is true for total transportation emissions, where we observe that the per unit per mile transportation emissions tax is more effective than a command and control scheme. Finally, we also find that companies with low production pollution, low demand or high transportation costs should consider decentralization to comply with the environmental regulations. © 2017","Environmental regulations; Facility location; Network design","Automotive industry; Complex networks; Costs; Digital storage; Emission control; Laws and legislation; Location; Regulatory compliance; Taxation; Transportation; Command and control; Emissions policies; Exact algorithms; Facility locations; Location decisions; Network design; Reducing emissions; Transportation cost; Environmental regulations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014473462

Both advances refine the approach of implementing residual load duration curves (RLDCs) to capture integration challenges. In this paper we derive RLDCs for eight world regions (based on region-specific time series for load, wind and solar) and implement them into the REMIND model. Therein we parameterize the impact of short-term storage using the highly-resolved model DIMES. All RLDCs and the underlying region-specific VRE time series are made available to the research community. We find that the more accurate accounting of integration challenges in REMIND does not reduce the prominent role of wind and solar in scenarios that cost-efficiently achieve the 2 °C target. Until 2030, VRE shares increase to about 15–40% in most regions with limited deployment of short-term storage capacities (below 2% of peak load). The REMIND model's default assumption of large-scale transmission grid expansion allows smoothening variability such that VRE capacity credits are moderate and curtailment is low. In the long run, VRE become the backbone of electricity supply and provide more than 70% of global electricity demand from 2070 on. Integration options ease this transformation: storage on diurnal and seasonal scales (via flow batteries and hydrogen electrolysis) and a shift in the non-VRE capacity mix from baseload towards more peaking power plants. The refined RLDC approach allows for a more accurate consideration of system-level impacts of VRE, and hence more robust insights on the nature of power sector decarbonization and related economic impacts. © 2016","Climate mitigation; Electricity storage; Integrated Assessment Models; Integration of variable renewables","Electric energy storage; Electric power systems; Hydrogen storage; Time series; Climate mitigations; Electricity storages; Electricity supply; Global electricity demands; Hydrogen electrolysis; Integrated assessment models; Renewables; Research communities; Climate models; alternative energy; assessment method; electricity supply; energy market; environmental economics; regional economy; renewable resource; storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979765684

Improving this understanding is vital for managing these forests as carbon sinks, a part of climate change mitigation efforts. A critical question is how secondary stand development in eastern U.S. forests has influenced long-term recovery from 19th century agricultural abandonment, and how this has affected aboveground carbon storage and co-varying stand-scale habitat characteristics. To answer this question we employed a longitudinal study based on twelve years of empirical data (2001–2013) collected from 60 permanent monitoring plots within 16 reference stands at Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller (MBR) National Historical Park in Woodstock, VT. We also used 150 years of documentary data from park management records. MBR Park was the first parcel of land actively reforested in the U.S. The Park's current forest mosaic reflects a history of alternate reforestation pathways and varied successional trajectories indicative of secondary forest recovery occurring across the broader northeastern forest landscape. This research evaluates the effects of reforestation pathways (planting vs. natural regeneration), management regimes (long-term low harvest intensities at varied harvest frequencies), and stand development trajectories on biomass outcomes and late-successional habitat. We generated biometrics indicative of stand structural complexity, including the H′ structural diversity index, and aboveground biomass (live trees, snags, and downed coarse woody debris pools) estimates. Multivariate analyses evaluated the predictive strength of reforestation pathway, management history, and site characteristics relative to aboveground carbon pools and stand structural complexity. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis ranked reforestation method as the strongest predictor of long-term mean total aboveground carbon storage, while harvest frequency, and stand age were selected as secondary variables. CART ranked percent conifer as the strongest predictor of H′, while harvest intensity and frequency were selected as secondary variables. Our results suggest that a variety of long-term recovery pathways converge on high levels of aboveground carbon storage, including both conifer plantations and naturally regenerated hardwood stands, but silvicultural management can dramatically alter those trajectories. Total aboveground biomass (i.e., carbon) co-varied with H′ (R2 = 0.25). Thus, our dataset showed a positive relationship between forest carbon storage and structural complexity, supporting the concept of multifunctional forestry emphasizing late-successional habitats. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Aboveground biomass; Forest carbon; Natural regeneration; Plantation forestry; Secondary forests; Structural development","Biomass; Climate change; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Harvesting; Multivariant analysis; Recovery; Reforestation; Secondary recovery; Timber; Trajectories; Above ground biomass; Forest carbons; Natural regeneration; Plantation forestry; Secondary forests; Structural development; Forestry; aboveground biomass; biomass allocation; biomonitoring; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; coniferous tree; ecosystem dynamics; forest ecosystem; forest management; habitat mosaic; park management; plantation forestry; reforestation; regeneration; secondary forest; silviculture; stand structure; succession; temperate forest; Agriculture; Biomass; Eastern USA; Forests; Harvesting; Reforestation; United States; Vermont; Coniferophyta",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014575866

Given the implications of climate change on water and soil quality, it is important for watershed managers, stakeholders, and policymakers to understand not only the effectiveness of different conservation practices in improving water quality, but also the cost-effectiveness of a watershed-level policy program designed for implementing conservation practices. A system of points measuring the efficiency of five conservation practices in reducing nutrient (nitrogen [N] and phosphorus [P]) runoff are estimated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in this study for the Boone River watershed (BRW) in north central Iowa. The points can be interpreted as indices of the environmental benefits associated with each conservation practice. Among the various market instruments proposed as resource and cost-revelation mechanisms, competitive biddings, also referred to as ""reverse auctions"" or procurement auctions, have come to the attention of researchers and policymakers. Competitive bidding mechanisms induce landowners to submit bids close to their opportunity costs, thus increasing the budgetary cost-effectiveness and revealing the true costs of adopting different conservation practices.

We performed anoxic incubations using freshly collected sediment, along with water samples harvested from a tropical wetland, amended with 13C-methane (0.67 atm) to test the capacity of its microbial community to perform anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) linked to the reduction of the humic fraction of its NOM. Collected evidence demonstrates that electron-accepting functional groups (e.g., quinones) present in NOM fueled AOM by serving as a terminal electron acceptor. Indeed, while sulfate reduction was the predominant process, accounting for up to 42.5% of the AOM activities, the microbial reduction of NOM concomitantly occurred. Furthermore, enrichment of wetland sediment with external NOM provided a complementary electron-accepting capacity, of which reduction accounted for ~100 nmol 13CH4 oxidized · cm-3 · day-1. Spectroscopic evidence showed that quinone moieties were heterogeneously distributed in the wetland sediment, and their reduction occurred during the course of AOM. Moreover, an enrichment derived from wetland sediments performing AOM linked to NOM reduction stoichiometrically oxidized methane coupled to the reduction of the humic analogue anthraquinone-2,6- disulfonate.

Following the example of ecocertified logging companies, we argue that other extractive industries managing large concessions should engage in antipoaching activities as part of their environmental management plans. Onshore hydrocarbon concessions should also adopt antipoaching protocols as a standard because they represent a biodiversity threat comparable to logging. We examined the spatiotemporal patterns of small- and large-mammal poaching in an onshore oil concession in Gabon, Central Africa, with a Bayesian occupancy model based on signs of poaching collected from 2010 to 2015 on antipoaching patrols. Patrol locations were initially determined based on local intelligence and past patrol successes (adaptive management) and subsequently with a systematic sampling of the concession. We generated maps of poaching probability in the concession and determined the temporal trends of this threat over 5 years. The spatiotemporal patterns of large- and small-mammal poaching differed throughout the concession, and likely these groups will need different management strategies. By elucidating the relationship between site-specific sampling effort and detection probability, the Bayesian method allowed us to set goals for future antipoaching patrols. Our results indicate that a combination of systematic sampling and adaptive management data is necessary to infer spatiotemporal patterns with the statistical method we used. On the basis of our case study, we recommend hydrocarbon companies interested in implementing efficient antipoaching activities in their onshore concessions to lay the foundation of long-needed industry standards by: adequately measuring antipoaching effort; mixing adaptive management and balanced sampling; setting goals for antipoaching effort; pairing patrols with large-mammal monitoring; supporting antipoaching patrols across the landscape; restricting access to their concessions; performing random searches for bushmeat and mammal products at points of entry; controlling urban and agricultural expansion; supporting bushmeat alternatives; and supporting land-use planning.

Besides the γ rays emitted in the decay of the known neutron single-particle states in Sn133 additional γ strength in the energy range 3.5-5.5 MeV was observed for the first time. Since the neutron-separation energy of Sn133 is low, Sn=2.402(4) MeV, this observation provides direct evidence for the radiative decay of neutron-unbound states in this nucleus. The ability of electromagnetic decay to compete successfully with neutron emission at energies as high as 3 MeV above threshold is attributed to a mismatch between the wave functions of the initial and final states in the latter case. These findings suggest that in the region southeast of Sn132 nuclear structure effects may play a significant role in the neutron versus γ competition in the decay of unbound states. As a consequence, the common neglect of such effects in the evaluation of the neutron-emission probabilities in calculations of global β-decay properties for astrophysical simulations may have to be reconsidered. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,"Carbon; Neutron emission; Tin; Wave functions; Astrophysical simulations; Emission probabilities; Energy ranges; Nuclear structure; Radiative decay; Relativistic energy; Separation energy; Single particle state; Gamma rays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019839546

A basal diet with no oil added was the control, and the treatment diets were supplemented with sunflower oil (2%) only, or sunflower oil (2%) in combination with fish oil (1%) or algae oil (1%). Four fermentation units were used per treatment. RUSITEC fermenters were inoculated with rumen digesta. Substrate degradation, fermentation end-products (volatile fatty acids, lactate, gas, methane, and ammonia), and microbial protein synthesis were determined. Fatty acid profiles and microbial community composition were evaluated in digesta samples. Numbers of representative bacterial species and microbial groups were determined using qPCR. Microbial composition and diversity were based on T-RFLP spectra. The addition of oils had no effect on substrate degradation or microbial protein synthesis. Differences among diets in neutral detergent fiber degradation were not significant (P = 0.132), but the contrast comparing oil-supplemented diets with the control was significant (P = 0.039). Methane production was reduced (P < 0.05) with all oil supplements. Propionate production was increased when diets containing oil were fermented. Compared with the control, the addition of algae oil decreased the percentage C18:3 c9c12c15 in rumen digesta, and that of C18:2 c9t11 was increased when the control diet was supplemented with any oil. Marine oils decreased the hydrogenation of C18 unsaturated fatty acids. Microbial diversity was not affected by oil supplementation. Cluster analysis showed that diets with additional fish or algae oils formed a group separated from the sunflower oil diet. Supplementation with marine oils decreased the numbers of Butyrivibrio producers of stearic acid, and affected the numbers of protozoa, methanogens, Selenomonas ruminantium and Streptococcus bovis, but not total bacteria. In conclusion, there is a potential to manipulate the rumen fermentation and microbiota with the addition of sunflower, fish or algae oils to ruminant diets at appropriate concentrations. Specifically, supplementation of ruminant mixed rations with marine oils will reduce methane production, the acetate to propionate ratio and the fatty acid hydrogenation in the rumen. © 2017 Vargas, Andrés, Snelling, López-Ferreras, Yáñez-Ruíz, García-Estrada and López.","Dietary fats; Microbial community composition; QPCR; Rumen microbiota; Rusitec fermenters; TRFLP","algae oil; edible oil; fish oil; lactic acid; methane; propionic acid; sunflower oil; unclassified drug; unsaturated fatty acid; volatile fatty acid; anaerobic fermentation; Article; bacterium culture; bioreactor; Butyrivibrio; colorimetry; controlled study; fatty acid analysis; hydrogenation; methanogen; microbial community; neutral detergent fiber; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; polymerase chain reaction; principal component analysis; protein synthesis; protozoon; real time polymerase chain reaction; restriction fragment length polymorphism; rumen microorganism; Selenomonas ruminantium; species composition; species diversity; Streptococcus equinus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021209084

Mapping the city into local climate zones (LCZs), with unique air temperature regimes, could be a useful tool supporting urban planners in their decision making. The LCZ scheme is currently being used to globally map LCZs as a part of the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) initiative. In this paper we evaluate the thermal behavior of LCZs for three Belgian cities, Brussels, Antwerp and Ghent, based on modelled air temperature.

In the near future, severe environmental changes in the Arctic Ocean are expected to lead to modifications of phytoplankton communities. Here, we used a combination of linear inverse modeling and ecological network analysis to study changes in food webs before, during, and after an anomalous warm water event in the eastern Fram Strait of the West Spitsbergen Current (WSC) that resulted in a shift from diatoms to flagellates during the summer (June-July). The model predicts substantial differences in the pathways of carbon flow in diatom- vs. Phaeocystis/nanoflagellate-dominated phytoplankton communities, but relatively small differences in carbon export. The model suggests a change in the zooplankton community and activity through increasing microzooplankton abundance and the switching of meso- and macrozooplankton feeding from strict herbivory to omnivory, detritivory and coprophagy. When small cells and flagellates dominated, the phytoplankton carbon pathway through the food web was longer and the microbial loop more active. Furthermore, one step was added in the flow from phytoplankton to mesozooplankton, and phytoplankton carbon to higher trophic levels is available via detritus or microzooplankton. Model results highlight how specific changes in phytoplankton community composition, as expected in a climate change scenario, do not necessarily lead to a reduction in carbon export. © 2017 Vernet, Richardson, Metfies, Nöthig and Peeken.","carbon cycling; flagellates; food web; inverse model; phytoplankton",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020062266

Electrochemical conversion of CO2 into industrially relevant chemicals is a leading strategy because it would allow sustainable production of commodity chemicals. In this review, we outline the current progress in nanostructuring gold, copper, and alloy catalysts for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. In general, Au catalysts show structure and voltage dependent CO selectivity alongside the H2 evolution reaction. The ability to tune CO to H2 product distributions is appealing for downstream processing into a variety of industrially relevant chemicals. Cu catalysts produce a wider range of products, and current efforts focus on controlling the product distribution by tuning the catalyst size, structure, oxidation state, and crystallographic orientation. Finally, we discuss the emerging field of computational electrocatalysis with emphasis on the computational hydrogen electrode method. The combination of experiment and computation is important because it provides fundamental insight into chemical processes driving catalytic CO2 conversion.

Here, we predict the radio emission from V830 Tau b, the youngest (2 Myr) detected exoplanet to date. We model the wind of its host star using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations that take into account the reconstructed stellar surface magnetic field. Our simulations allow us to constrain the local conditions of the environment surrounding V830 Tau b that we use to then compute its radio emission. We estimate average radio flux densities of 6 to 24 mJy, depending on the assumption of the radius of the planet (one or two Jupiter radii). These radio fluxes are not constant along one planetary orbit, and present peaks that are up to twice the average values. We show here that these fluxes are weakly dependent (a factor of 1.8) on the assumed polar planetary magnetic field (10 to 100 G), opposed to the maximum frequency of the emission, which ranges from 18 to 240 MHz. We also estimate the thermal radio emission from the stellar wind. By comparing our results with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and the Very Long Baseline Array observations of the system, we constrain the stellar mass-loss rate to be 3 × 10-9M yr-1, with likely values between ∼ 10-12 and 10-10M· yr-1. With these values, we estimate that the frequency-dependent extension of the radio-emitting wind is around ∼ 3 to 30 stellar radii (R∗) for frequencies in the range of 275 to 50 MHz, implying that V830 Tau b, at an orbital distance of 6.1 R∗, could be embedded in the regions of the host star's wind that are optically thick to radio wavelengths, but not deeply so. We also note that planetary emission can only propagate in the stellar wind plasma if the frequency of the cyclotron emission exceeds the stellar wind plasma frequency. In other words, we find that for planetary radio emission to propagate through the host star wind, planetary magnetic field strengths larger than ∼ 1.3 to 13 G are required. Since our radio emission computations are based on analogies with solar system planets, we caution that our computations should be considered as estimates. Nevertheless, the V830 Tau system is a very interesting system for conducting radio observations from both the perspective of radio emission from the planet as well as from the host star's wind. © 2017 ESO.","Planet-star interactions; Planets and satellites: magnetic fields; Stars: low-mass; Stars: winds, outflows","Extrasolar planets; Magnetic fields; Magnetism; Magnetohydrodynamics; Magnetoplasma; Orbits; Planets; Radio astronomy; Satellites; Solar system; Three dimensional computer graphics; Magneto-hydrodynamics simulations; Planet-star interactions; Planetary magnetic fields; Planetary radio emissions; Planets and satellites; Solar system planets; Stars: low mass; Stars: winds , outflows; Stars",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020173639

However, the role of animal mobility as a possible mitigating strategy in response to climate change has not been clearly documented. To understand this role, we investigated (i) the major methodological challenges linked to the diversity of grazing areas and other forage resources exploited by these systems and enteric emissions of methane; (ii) the impacts of grazing practices (carbon sequestration/emission) on soil and biomass carbon fluxes. We developed an approach based on two existing models (OSTRAL: Outil de Simulation du TRoupeau ovin ALlaitant and CASA: Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach) that we adapted and used in combination. This approach was applied to three French Mediterranean sheep and crop farming systems with different degrees of flock mobility (sedentary, single transhumance and double transhumance). The preliminary results produced by the whole farm model OSTRAL showed that two systems (sedentary and double transhumance) causing low carbon emissions. In the sedentary system, higher animal productivity offsets the increase in GHG emissions (in CO2eq) caused by feed production. In the pastoral system, grazing reduced total GHG emissions (in CO2eq). The CASA model proved to be useful to simulate the carbon balance under dynamic land cover in natural environments, whether used for grazing or not. This model can help assess the impact of grazing practices and carbon fluxes in systems linked to natural environments. The results of the first application showed that seasonal mobility of livestock increases the contribution of rangeland to feeding systems and improves the non-renewable energy balance of the system. It is thus extremely important to include the specificities of animals grazing in rangelands outside the structural limits of the farm when evaluating GHG emissions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","GHG; Grazing practices; Mitigation; Mobility; Pastoral farming systems","adaptive management; biomass; carbon balance; carbon emission; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; climate change; energy balance; forage; grazing; greenhouse gas; land cover; livestock farming; methane; mobility; pastoralism; sheep; France; Mediterranean Region; Animalia; Ovis aries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017302301

Although the EU is projected to reach this goal, its achievement of objectives under its Emissions Trading System (ETS) may be delayed by carbon leakage, which is defined as a situation in which the reduction in emissions in the ETS region is partially offset by an increase in carbon emissions in the non-ETS regions. We study the interaction between emissions and hydropower availability in order to estimate the magnitude of carbon leakage in the South-East Europe Regional Electricity Market (SEE-REM) via a bottom-up partial equilibrium framework. We find that 6.3% to 40.5% of the emissions reduction achieved in the ETS part of SEE-REM could be leaked to the non-ETS part depending on the price of allowances. Somewhat surprisingly, greater hydropower availability may increase emissions in the ETS part of SEE-REM. However, carbon leakage might be limited by demand response to higher electricity prices in the non-ETS area of SEE-REM. Such carbon leakage can affect both the competitiveness of producers in ETS member countries on the periphery of the ETS and the achievement of EU targets for CO2 emissions reduction. Meanwhile, higher non-ETS electricity prices imply that the current policy can have undesirable outcomes for consumers in non-ETS countries, while non-ETS producers would experience an increase in their profits due to higher power prices as well as exports. The presence of carbon leakage in SEE-REM suggests that current EU policy might become more effective when it is expanded to cover more countries in the future. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon leakage; CO2 emissions; Energy Community; EU ETS","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Electric industry; Electric power system interconnection; Emission control; Gas emissions; Hydroelectric power; International law; Power markets; Carbon leakage; CO2 emissions; Emissions reduction; Emissions trading system; Energy Community; EU Emissions Trading Systems; Partial equilibrium; Regional electricity markets; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electricity supply; emission control; emissions trading; energy market; European Union; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019947527

As a result, it differs among and within species due to both local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity. These phenotypic variations in tree height-diameter allometry determine tree productivity, resistance and resilience to climate variation and, ultimately, the success of plant material used in restoration projects. We tested the effect of climate change and population origin on the phenotypic variation of tree allometry in four pine species at an early stage of development (ca. 11 years old) based upon data originated from multi-site provenance tests and planted along a wide climatic range in south-western Europe. For a representative sample of populations from each species, we used already-developed species-specific height-diameter allometric models to assess changes in allometry between present and future climatic conditions. We found that Pinus halepensis and Pinus pinaster were the most plastic species, while Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra showed negligible plastic responses. In addition, our models stressed that pine tree height-diameter allometry will change and phenotypic variation could increase, except in P. sylvestris, under future environmental conditions. For some of the species, this might allow the selection of phenotypes better suited to novel climatic conditions. These foreseeable changes in tree height-diameter allometry (among and within-species) could entail eco-evolutionary effects on the early forest plantation dynamics. Therefore, restoration and reforestation plans should consider these effects, as they may interfere with production and/or environmental goals. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Climate change; Early developmental stages; Forest plantations; Intraspecific phenotypic variation; Multi-site provenance tests; Plasticity; Resilience; Restoration","Biology; Climate change; Conservation; Image reconstruction; Plasticity; Reforestation; Restoration; Developmental stage; Forest plantation; Phenotypic variations; Provenance tests; Resilience; Forestry; allometry; climate change; coniferous tree; developmental stage; diameter; ecosystem resilience; environmental conditions; height; intraspecific variation; local adaptation; phenotypic plasticity; plantation forestry; population dynamics; provenance; reforestation; restoration ecology; Europe; Pinus halepensis; Pinus nigra; Pinus pinaster; Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006476438

In order to further probe the mechanisms in peat bog areas and contextualize them at the catchment scale, this experimental study identifies runoff formation at two opposite hillslopes in a peaty mountain headwater; a slope with organic peat soils and a shallow phreatic zone (0.5 m below surface), and a slope with mineral Podzol soils and no detectable groundwater (> 2 m below surface). Similarities and differences in infiltration, percolation and preferential flow paths between both hillslopes could be identified by sprinkling experiments with Brilliant Blue and Fluorescein sodium. To our knowledge, this is the first time these two dyes have been compared in their ability to stain preferential flow paths in soils. Dye-stained soil profiles within and downstream of the sprinkling areas were excavated parallel (lateral profiles) and perpendicular (frontal profiles) to the slopes' gradients. That way preferential flow patterns in the soil could be clearly identified. The results show that biomat flow, shallow subsurface flow in the organic topsoil layer, occurred at both hillslopes; however, at the peat bog hillslope it was significantly more prominent. The dye solutions infiltrated into the soil and continued either as lateral subsurface pipe flow in the case of the peat bog, or percolated vertically towards the bedrock in the case of the Podzol. This study provides evidence that subsurface pipe flow, lateral preferential flow along decomposed tree roots or logs in the unsaturated zone, is a major runoff formation process at the peat bog hillslope and in the adjacent riparian zone. © Author(s) 2017.",,"Catchments; Dyes; Forestry; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Peat; Pipe flow; Soils; Solvents; Wetlands; Changing climate; Dye stained soils; Fluorescein sodiums; Formation process; Hydrologic cycles; Preferential flows; Shallow subsurface; Unsaturated zone; Runoff; climate change; dye; experimental study; headwater; hillslope; hydrological cycle; identification method; latitude; mountain region; peatland; riparian zone; runoff; subsurface flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021340294

Thus, there is growing interest in improving estimates of the GHG balance in response to land-use changes (LUCs) involving agriculture and forestry, for national-scale reporting, and for carbon (C) offsets. Large agricultural areas in Europe, Russia and North America are reverting to forest, either naturally or through planting, after abandonment of agricultural land, and this trend may have a substantial impact on carbon budgets. We report results of a pilot project in the Mixedwood Plains ecozone of eastern Canada to analyze the change in the C budget on a landscape over 15 years on abandoned cropland where woody vegetation is regenerating. Thirty-six plots (2 km × 2 km) with paired aerial photographs taken circa 1994 and circa 2008 at a scale of 1:10,000 or larger were randomly selected from the 20 km × 20 km National Forest Inventory (NFI) grid. A spatially-explicit version of the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3) was used to estimate impacts of LUC on C stocks and fluxes. Polygons identifying areas of LUC within each photo plot were delineated, classified, and evaluated to provide input data for the model. The rate of C accumulation in our study area was found to be relatively constant over the entire simulation period, at 1.07 Mg C/ha/yr. Abandoned agricultural land reverting to woody lands could play an important role in regional and national C sequestration in Canada, but more research is required to quantify the areal extent of this LUC. © 2017","Aerial photography; CBM-CFS3; Cropland; Land-cover change analysis; Mixedwood Plains; Scaling-up; Woody carbon stock","carbon; organic matter; soil organic matter; carbon; abandoned land; aerial photography; agricultural land; carbon budget; carbon sequestration; ecozone; international agreement; land cover; land use change; scale effect; vegetation dynamics; wood; woody plant; afforestation; agricultural land; Article; biomass; carbon dynamics; cropland; dead organic matter; decision support system; deforestation; forest; land use; landscape; net biome productivity; net ecosystem productivity; net primary productivity; Ontario; pasture; photography; pilot study; productivity; scale up; tree; vegetation; woody land; agriculture; chemistry; wood; Canada; Europe; Ontario [Canada]; Russian Federation; Agriculture; Carbon; Ontario; Pilot Projects; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013414461

The international multidisciplinary ICP IM (International Cooperative Programme on Integrated Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Ecosystems) programme studies the integrated effects of air pollution and climate change on ecosystems in unmanaged and calibrated forested catchments. We calculated site-specific annual input-output budgets for sulphate (SO4) and total inorganic nitrogen (TIN[dbnd]NO3-N + NH4-N) for 17 European ICP IM sites in 1990–2012. Temporal trends for input (deposition) and output (runoff water) fluxes and the net retention/net release of SO4 and TIN were also analysed. Large differences in the input and output fluxes of SO4 and TIN reflect important gradients of air pollution effects in Europe, with the highest deposition and runoff water fluxes at IM sites located in southern Scandinavia and in parts of Central and Eastern Europe and the lowest fluxes at more remote sites in northern European regions. A significant decrease in the total (wet + dry) deposition of non-marine SO4 and bulk deposition of TIN was found at 90% and 65% of the sites, respectively. Output fluxes of non-marine SO4 in runoff decreased significantly at 65% of the sites, indicating positive effects of the international emission abatement actions in Europe during the last 20 years. Catchments retained SO4 in the early and mid-1990s, but this shifted towards a net release in the late 1990s, which may be due to the mobilization of legacy S pools accumulated during times of high atmospheric SO4 deposition. Despite decreased deposition, TIN output fluxes and retention rates showed a mixed response with both decreasing (9 sites) and increasing (8 sites) trend slopes, and trends were rarely significant. In general, TIN was strongly retained in the catchments not affected by natural disturbances. The long-term annual variation in net releases for SO4 was explained by variations in runoff and SO4 concentrations in deposition, while a variation in TIN concentrations in runoff was mostly associated with a variation of the TIN retention rate in catchments. The net release of SO4 from forest soils may delay the recovery from acidification for surface waters and the continued enrichment of nitrogen in catchment soils poses a threat to terrestrial biodiversity and may ultimately lead to a higher TIN runoff through N-saturation. Continued monitoring and further evaluations of mass balance budgets are thus needed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Mass balance; Net release; Nitrogen; Retention; Sulphur; Trends","Air pollution; Biodiversity; Budget control; Climate change; Deposition; Ecology; Ecosystems; Emission control; Forestry; Nitrogen; Pollution; River pollution; Runoff; Soils; Sulfur; Water pollution; Central and Eastern Europe; Emission reduction policies; Environmental Monitoring; Mass balance; Net release; Retention; Terrestrial biodiversity; Trends; Catchments; acidification; atmospheric pollution; catchment; climate change; concentration (composition); deposition; emission control; environmental monitoring; flux measurement; inorganic nitrogen; integrated approach; mass balance; runoff; soil pollution; sulfate; trend analysis; water pollution; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009833838

Studies that have examined biogeophysical impacts of these crops noted a positive feedback between near-surface cooling and enhanced evapotranspiration (ET), but also potential unintended consequences of soil moisture and groundwater depletion. To better understand hydrometeorological effects of perennial bioenergy crop expansion, this study conducted high-resolution (2-km grid spacing) simulations with a state-of-the-art atmospheric model (Weather Research and Forecasting system) dynamically coupled to a land surface model. We applied the modeling system over the Southern Plains of the United States during a normal precipitation year (2007) and a drought year (2011). By focusing the deployment of bioenergy cropping systems on marginal and abandoned farmland areas (to reduce the potential conflict with food systems), the research presented here is the first realistic examination of hydrometeorological impacts associated with perennial bioenergy crop expansion. Our results illustrate that the deployment of perennial bioenergy crops leads to widespread cooling (1–2 °C) that is largely driven by an enhanced reflection of shortwave radiation and, secondarily, due to an enhanced ET. Bioenergy crop deployment was shown to reduce the impacts of drought through simultaneous moistening and cooling of the near-surface environment. However, simulated impacts on near-surface cooling and ET were reduced during the drought relative to a normal precipitation year, revealing differential effects based on background environmental conditions. This study serves as a key step toward the assessment of hydroclimatic sustainability associated with perennial bioenergy crop expansion under diverse hydrometeorological conditions by highlighting the driving mechanisms and processes associated with this energy pathway. © 2016 The Authors.

The results indicate that individual conservation practices were effective in reducing a particular pollutant load, but combined practices were more effective in reducing multiple pollutant loads simultaneously. Of the individual best management practices (BMPs) assessed, no-till was the most effective in reducing multiple pollutant loads (reduced surface runoff by an average of 25%, sediment by 46%, atrazine by 46%, total N by 9%, soluble P by 16%, and total P by 29%). When BMPs were combined, pollutant load reductions were increased significantly (at α = 0.05) for all pollutants, both under baseline and future climate scenarios. The reductions in runoff and pollutant loads for each decade of future climate ranged from 15 to 25% for surface runoff, 32–68% for sediment loss, 37–60% for atrazine loss, 5–13% for soluble N loss, 12–35% for total N loss, 9–41% for soluble P loss, and 33–60% for total P loss. © 2017","Atrazine; Best management practice (BMP); Climate change; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)","Agricultural runoff; Herbicides; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Pollution; Runoff; Sediments; Soil conservation; Agricultural watersheds; Best management practice (BMPs); Best management practices; Conservation practices; Future climate scenarios; Long-term conservation; Soil and water assessment tool; Soil and Water assessment tools; Climate change; agricultural catchment; atrazine; basin management; best management practice; climate change; conservation management; nitrogen; phosphorus; quantitative analysis; runoff; soil and water assessment tool; Indiana; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014418950

The latest announcements of proposed and implemented legislation steps show that future legislation will be even more stringent. The currently leading announced legislation, which concerns a large number of global manufacturers, is the legislation from the United States (US) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Both announced new legislation for CO2, Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Phase II. CARB is also planning additional Ultra Low NOx regulations. Both regulations are significant and will require a number of technologies to be used in order to achieve the challenging limits. AVL published some engine related measures to address these legislation steps. With regard to CO2, the upcoming legislation cannot be achieved without significant technology steps in both the powertrain and the vehicle. The present publication addresses how to fill the gap between the feasible fuel consumption improvement on the engine and the vehicle targets. Significant fuel consumption improvements can be gained by improving the energy management and auxiliary losses of the commercial vehicle under real driving conditions and utilizing advanced or off-cycle technology credits for the regulated certification method. In addition, the control of more flexible components can be connected to information outside of the powertrain, and used for predictive thermal management and predictive shifting. The thermal management improvement may also include the recovery of waste heat for propulsion. This publication introduces the available technologies and rates their potentials for implementation for the said legislation steps. Additionally, as a result of the evaluation, a concept of a future truck powertrain will be shown. Truck OEMs will need to make their decisions on technology road maps based on the market penetration of different truck applications.

In this paper, our results suggest that TE modules can potentially be a solution for domestic indoor space heating whilst using renewable electricity. The test results of the space heating application of TE modules in a laboratory environment (19–21 °C) and outside courtyard low-temperature environment (1–5 °C) demonstrate that sufficient temperature difference can be achieved with TE modules so as to satisfy UK thermal comfort levels. The heating COP test results of TE modules also suggest an acceptable heat pump efficiency for the domestic heating application. Consequently and in order to ascertain its potential feasibility, a domestic heating application of TE modules to a Pre-1900s mid-terrace UK dwelling using hybrid renewable energy of solar energy and wind energy is presented. Our calculations suggest that a TE heating system, powered by local hybrid renewable energy and energy storage, can partly meet the domestic heating demand and could achieve a theoretical energy saving efficiency of 64.03% and reduce the CO2 emission of 4305.40 kg/year compared with using generic electricity radiator for the domestic space heating whilst the average heating COP remains at 1.8. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Domestic heating; Irradiation; Renewable energy; Solar; Thermoelectric module","Carbon dioxide; Electric energy storage; Energy conservation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heating equipment; Irradiation; Solar energy; Space heating; Temperature; Thermoelectricity; Wind power; Domestic heating; Domestic heating systems; Hybrid renewable energies; Low temperature environment; Renewable energies; Solar; Temperature differences; Thermo-electric modules; Heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017276768

Correct modeling of these processes is important to numerical weather forecast and climate prediction. In order to obtain a more thorough understanding of the land surface processes over the Gobi landscape, we evaluated the performance of the Common Land Model (CoLM) at Dunhuang station in Gansu Province of China to determine whether the model formulation, driven by observational data, is capable of simulating surface fluxes over the underlying desert surface. In comparison with the enhanced observation data collected at Dunhuang station over the period 22–28 August 2008, the results showed that the surface albedo simulated by CoLM was larger than that in the observation, and the simulated surface temperature was lower than the observed. After the measured values were used to correct the surface albedo, the solar radiation absorbed by the ground surface was more consistent with the measurements. A new empirical relationship of the surface thermal exchange coefficient rah was used to modify the thermal aerodynamic impedance. The simulated soil surface temperature became significantly closer to the observed value, and the simulated surface sensible heat as well as net radiative fluxes were also improved. © 2017, The Chinese Meteorological Society and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","land surface model; numerical simulation; parameterization scheme","atmospheric modeling; climate prediction; common land; computer simulation; land surface; landscape; parameterization; radiative transfer; sensible heat flux; soil surface; surface temperature; weather forecasting; China; Dunhuang; Gansu; Gobi Desert",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021635461

However, there is little consensus regarding what salinity thresholds will significantly alter the production of GHGs or the physiochemical properties of wetland soils. This study used a fine-scale salinity gradient to determine the impact of seawater concentration on the potential production of CH4, CO2 and N2O and associated soil properties using bottle incubations of tidal freshwater marsh soils from the Min River estuary, SE China. Potential CH4 production was unaffected by salinities from 0 to 7.5‰, but declined significantly at 10‰ and above. Potential CO2 production was stimulated at intermediate salinities (5 to 7.5‰), but inhibited by salinities ≥15‰, while potential N2O production was unaffected by salinity. In contrast, soil dissolved organic carbon and NH4 +-N generally increased with salinity. Overall, this research indicates salinities of ~10–15‰ represent an important tipping point for biogeochemical processes in wetlands.

Herein, we report a facile and scalable approach to prepare fluorescent carbon dots (FCDs) via a one-pot reaction of citric acid with ethylenediamine at 150 °C under ambient air pressure. The resultant FCDs possess an optical bandgap of 3.4 eV and exhibit strong excitation-wavelength-independent blue emission (λEm = 450 nm) under either one- or two-photon excitation. Owing to their low cytotoxicity and long fluorescence lifetime, these FCDs were successfully used as internalized fluorescent probes in human cancer cell lines (HeLa cells) for two-photon excited imaging of cells by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy with a high-contrast resolution. They were also homogenously mixed with commercial inks and used to draw fluorescent patterns on normal papers and on many other substrates (e.g., certain flexible plastic films, textiles, and clothes). Thus, these nanomaterials are promising for use in solid-state fluorescent sensing, security labeling, and wearable optoelectronics. © 2017 THE AUTHORS","Carbon dots; Fluorescence lifetime imaging; Patterning; Scalable; Two-photon","Cell culture; Chemical sensors; Lanthanum compounds; Nanostructured materials; Organic polymers; Photons; Textile blends; Carbon dots; Fluorescence lifetime imaging; Patterning; Scalable; Two photon; Fluorescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027492073

Paddy soils are important agricultural soils worldwide, especially in Asia. Thus, a better understanding of the relationship between SOC of paddy soils and climate variables is crucial to a robust understanding of the potential effect of climate change on the global carbon cycle. A soil profile data set (n = 1490) from the Second National Soil Survey of China conducted from 1979 to 1994 was used to explore the relationships of SOC density with mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) in six soil regions and eight paddy soil subgroups. Results showed that SOC density of paddy soils was negatively correlated with MAT and positively correlated with MAP (P < 0.01). The relationships of SOC density with MAT and MAP were weak and varied among the six soil regions and eight paddy soil subgroups. A preliminary assessment of the response of SOC in Chinese paddy soils to climate indicated that climate could lead to a 13% SOC loss from paddy soils. Compared to other soil regions, paddy soils in Northern China will potentially more sensitive to climate change over the next several decades. Paddy soils in Middle and Lower Yangtze River Basin could be a potential carbon sink. Reducing the climate impact on paddy soil SOC will mitigate the positive feedback loop between SOC release and global climate change. © 2017, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agricultural Ecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","climate change; mean annual precipitation; mean annual temperature; paddy soils; soil organic carbon","air temperature; climate change; climate effect; organic carbon; paddy field; precipitation (climatology); soil carbon; soil organic matter; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018856768

These climate changes are likely to alter forest water budgets of which plant transpiration (T) forms a significant component. Plant transpiration is regulated by stomata behavior of particular species, which is constrained by ambient air and soil conditions. Here, we measured sap flow in a Scots pine (Pinus Sylvestris) plantation in a low energy Scottish headwater catchment during the main summer growth period. Effects of rainfall on forest transpiration, as well as the response of T to four environmental variables were investigated at a daily scale. In this boreal environment, transpiration was mainly restricted by radiation and vapor pressure deficit. Air temperature was the least important controlling factor. Soil water became an important factor when rainfall was limited. Frequent but small rain events dictated that precipitation met short-term transpiration demand most of the time. The trees needed supplementary water from antecedent soil water stores when weekly rainfall was below ∼8 mm, but such periods were rare. Water exchange mainly occurred in the canopy or upper 10 cm of the soil, with 47% of rainfall transpired, 45% intercepted and <8% evaporated from the soil surface. Understanding interactions between forests and their hydroclimate, as well as the role of forests in water partitioning is crucial to assist a sustainable land and water management in a changing climate. Whilst such studies are common in semi-arid regions, they are limited in boreal zones, therefore, our findings are a valuable contribution to understanding plant-water relations in a changing environment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate; Evapotranspiration; Hydrology; Sap flow; Scots pine; Water partition","air temperature; ambient air; boreal forest; catchment; coniferous tree; environmental assessment; evapotranspiration; headwater; hydrology; niche partitioning; plantation forestry; precipitation (climatology); sap flow; stomatal conductance; water exchange; Scotland; United Kingdom; Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017161195

The industrial environ¬mental demand function relates industrial pollution intensity to the local price of pollution, while controlling for characteristics such as sector, scale, and ownership. The local environmental supply function specifies the pollution price imposed by the host community as pollution rises. The model provides a good fit to available data on provin¬cial variations in China's pollution levy, or industrial emissions charge. Our results also suggest that Chinese industry has reduced emissions significantly in response to the levy. © 2006 Adrian Muller and Thomas Sterner.

Aerosol number concentrations and meteorological data from Shijiazhuang, Nanjing, and Suzhou were combined with the MIX Asian emission data and the HYSPLIT model. Furthermore, the diurnal variation, size distribution, and main sources of air pollutants and aerosols were selectively characterized in the North China Plain (NCP) and the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). High values of particulate matter concentrations (PM), including PM2.5 and PM10, occurred in the northwestern and central regions of eastern China. Elevated PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations represented natural dust sources and anthropogenic resident, power plant, industry, and traffic emissions sources, respectively. The concentrated distributions of SO2 were similar to those of PM. The CO concentrations were distributed uniformly in China. High O3 values occurred above the Qinghai province. During the observation period, the air masses mainly originated from the northwest NCP and from the southwest or northeastern ocean in the YRD, resulting in high concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and CO in the NCP, the average values of which were 61.8 ± 40.0, 118.8 ± 66.4, 24.1 ± 24.6 μg m−3, and 1.2 ± 0.9 mg m−3, respectively, and were 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, and 1.3 times larger than those in the YRD. NO2 had higher concentrations in the YRD with an average of 43.7 ± 24.8 μg m−3, which was 1.2 times larger than that in the NCP. The diurnal variations of PM, NO2 and CO had bimodal distributions and SO2 and O3 had unimodal distributions in the NCP and YRD. The aerosol number concentrations had average values of 12,661 ± 5266, 11,189 ± 5905, and 12,797 ± 5931 cm−3 in Shijiazhuang, Nanjing, and Suzhou. Their diurnal variations displayed trimodal peaks at 18:00–21:00, 11:00–14:00, and 06:00–08:00, and their spectra distributions were all unimodal with peaks at 60–70, 60–70, and 100–110 nm, respectively. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"carbon dioxide; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; aerosol; air pollutant; dust; particulate matter; aerosol; air mass; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); diurnal variation; emission inventory; meteorology; particle size; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollution monitoring; size distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; air monitoring; air pollutant; Article; China; concentration (parameters); dust; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; seasonal variation; secondary organic aerosol; spatial analysis; temporal analysis; aerosol; air pollutant; analysis; chemical model; environmental monitoring; China; Hebei; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]; North China Plain; Qinghai; Shijiazhuang; Suzhou; Yangtze Delta; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; China; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Models, Chemical; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018826500

However, mechanisms driving N losses via nitrate leaching or N2O emissions remain unknown. Herein we investigated long-term pig manure applications in upland red soils by assessing soil N transformation dynamics. Methods: Pig manure was applied with or without lime over a 14-year period in four treatments: No manure (CK); Low-rate manure (LM, 150 kg N ha−1 y−1); High-rate manure (HM, 600 kg N ha−1 y−1); High-rate manure and lime (HML, 600 kg N ha−1 y−1 and 3000 kg Ca(OH)2 ha−1 (3y)−1). 15N tracing was used to quantify gross N transformation and N dynamics. Results: Prolonged manure application increased soil gross N mineralization and NH4 + immobilization, although the increase was only significant for HM. Both rates were further enhanced by lime addition. Gross autotrophic nitrification also increased with increasing manure application, and further increased with lime addition. In contrast, dissimilatory NO3 − reduction to NH4 + (DNRA) and NO3 − immobilization were negligible irrespective of manure application. Thus, NO3 − produced via autotrophic nitrification was not converted to NH4 + and microbial biomass N, and accumulated in soil. Gross autotrophic nitrification was positively correlated with N2O emissions and NO3 − leaching, suggesting it largely determined N losses. Conclusions: Autotrophic nitrification governs N losses in upland red soils receiving repeated manure applications, and attempts to reduce N emissions or N leaching should therefore control this. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","15N tracing; Fertilizer application rate; Gross N mineralization; Gross nitrification; Long-term manure application; N loss","fertilizer application; long-term change; manure; nitrification; nitrogen; pig; red soil; transformation; upland region; China; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007165418

The porous carbon microspheres exhibited regular spherical morphology, hierarchical porous, localized graphitization structure and the oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of carbon spheres. The pore size and specific surface area could be tuned by the amount of KOH during the activation process. The porous carbon microspheres displayed maximum specific capacitance of 384.5 F/g at scan rate of 5 mV/s and ultra-high rate capacitance of 137.3 F/g at the current density of 100 A/g. The high capacitance retention of the porous carbon microspheres (over 97%, even with 5000 charge/discharge cycles) demonstrated its superior cycling stability.

At UG79, the optimal air temperature for the half-hourly NEE occurred between 17 and 20 °C, which was relatively low for semi-arid grasslands. The saturated NEE (NEEsat) and temperature sensitivity coefficient (Q10) of ecosystem respiration (RE) exhibited clear seasonal and interannual variations, which increased with canopy development and the soil water content (SWC, at 5 cm). The total NEE values for the growing seasons from 2005 to 2008 were −32.0, −41.5, −66.1, and −89.8 g C m−2, respectively. Both the amounts and distribution of precipitation during the growing season affected the NEE. The effects of grazing on the CO2 flux increased with the grazing intensity. During the peak growth stage, heavy grazing and winter grazing decreased NEEsat and gross primary production (45 % for HG and 34 % for WG) due to leaf area removal. Both RE and Q10 were clearly reduced by heavy grazing. Heavy grazing changed the ecosystem from a CO2 sink into a CO2 source, and winter grazing reduced the total CO2 uptake by 79 %. In the early growing season, there was no difference in the NEE between CG and UG79. In addition to the grazing intensity, the effects of grazing on the CO2 flux also varied with the vegetation growth stages and SWC. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon flux; eddy covariance; grazing pressure; growing season; net ecosystem exchange; semiarid region; steppe; China; Nei Monggol; Leymus chinensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955293772

China has consumed refined copper up to 95 million ton (Mt) for economic development from 1949 to 2013, which is mainly concentrated in equipment (36%) and infrastructure (45%). During the period, only 16% of consumed copper (about 15.5Mt) transformed to scrap and others were still in in-use stocks. While from 2014 to 2022, generated scrap is almost 1.2 times (about 18.3Mt) as much as that before 2013, over 50% of which are from equipment. This is due to majority of refined copper is consumed during the past decade. Therefore China would face explosive increasing scrap generation in the next two or three decades for temporal delay of social economic system. The ratio of recycling efficiency rate (RER) increased all the time and it's high to 58% in 2013. Although recycling copper scrap can conserve energy and reduce emission, it accompanied by some issues for increasingly complex composition. To alleviate the problem of copper shortage and make full use of huge potential scrap resources, some policy recommendations are put forward for the Chinese government: (1) Adjust copper resource policy and pay more attention to copper recycling industry. (2) Develop copper recycling industries to accommodate explosively increasing scrap and enforce extended producer responsibilities to recycle equipment by the way of reusing, remanufacturing and recycling etc. (3) For environmental and social problems, gradually guide copper recycling industry optimization. Make full use of rural-urban surplus labor force to construct social recycling network and encourage copper recycling enterprises improve technology and optimize plant design to reach the level of cleaner production. © 2017 The Authors","Copper consumption; Copper scrap; Scrap recycling; Substance flow analysis","Copper; Copper compounds; Equipment; Pollution control; Recycling; Scrap metal reprocessing; Complex compositions; Economic development; Extended producer responsibility; Policy recommendations; Recycling efficiency; Scrap recycling; Social economic system; Substance flow analysis; Copper scrap; copper; efficiency measurement; material flow analysis; optimization; recycling; resource assessment; waste technology; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016147982

This paper applies index decomposition analysis and a whole process treatment perspective to identify the factors facilitating air pollution reduction across three stages: source prevention, process control, and end-of-pipe treatment. Empirical research using data from China's Jiangsu Province and its 13 cities reveals differences in local approaches to pollution prevention. At the provincial level, end-of-pipe treatment remains the primary approach to control air pollution emissions, indicating that the pattern of “pollute first, govern later” has not yet been fundamentally reversed. At the city level, 13 cities can be divided into four types, based on their approach to air pollution treatment: the leading type, process-dependent type, end-dependent type, and lagging type. Of these, 7 cities are using multiple control approaches, reflecting the comprehensive effect of whole process treatment.

To take full advantage of the environmental benefits of wind energy, wind power forecasting has to be studied to overcome the troubles brought by the variable nature of wind. Power forecasting for regional wind farm groups is the problem that many power system operators care about. The high-dimensional feature sets with redundant information are frequently encountered when dealing with this problem. In this paper, two kinds of feature set construction methods are proposed which can achieve the proper feature set either by selecting the subsets or by transforming the original variables with specific combinations. The former method selects the subset according to the criterion of minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance (mRMR), while the latter does so based on the method of principal component analysis (PCA). A locally weighted learning method is also proposed to utilize the processed feature set to produce the power forecast results. The proposed model is simple and easy to use with parameters optimized automatically. Finally, a case study of 28 wind farms in East China is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2017, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","feature set; locally weighted learning model; minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance (mRMR); principal component analysis (PCA); regional wind power forecasting",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019160209

A lamellar structure is present in the undoped alloy, while a tetragonal martensite with irregular shape is present in the carbon-doped alloy. B2-structured precipitates form upon annealing in both alloys, whose size and volume fraction increases with increasing annealing time. Lamellar coarsening also occurs during annealing of the undoped alloy. Two different thermo-mechanical treatments were applied to the carbon-doped alloy in order to decrease the grain size and disperse the martensite, which produced a significant increase in strength. The changes in yield strength are discussed in terms of the underlying strengthening mechanisms, i.e., phase boundary strengthening, grain boundary strengthening, interstitial strengthening, and precipitation strengthening. The carbon addition results in a sharp increase in ductility of the as-cast alloy, a feature ascribed to microband formation during the tensile test arising from the increase of lattice friction stress.

Surface water pH slowly increased during the following decades, but biological recovery lagged behind chemical recovery. Fortunately, this situation is changing. In the past few years, northeastern US fish populations have begun to recover in lakes that were historically incapable of sustaining wild fish due to acidic conditions. As lake ecosystems across the eastern United States recover from acid deposition, the stress to the most susceptible populations of native coldwater fish appears to be shifting from acidification effects to thermal impacts associated with changing climate. Extreme summer temperature events – which are expected to occur with increasing frequency in the coming century – can stress and ultimately kill native coldwater fish in lakes where thermal stratification is absent or highly limited. Based on data from northeastern North America, we argue that recovery from acid deposition has the potential to improve the resilience of coldwater fish populations in some lakes to impacts of climate change. This will occur as the amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the water increases with increasing lake pH. Increased DOC will reduce water clarity and lead to shallower and more persistent lake thermoclines that can provide larger areas of coldwater thermal refuge habitat. Recovery from acidification will not eliminate the threat of climate change to coldwater fish, but secondary effects of acid recovery may improve the resistance of coldwater fish populations in lakes to the effects of elevated summer temperatures in historically acidified ecosystems. This analysis highlights the importance of considering the legacy of past ecosystem impacts and how recovery or persistence of those effects may interact with climate change impacts on biota in the coming decades. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","acid deposition; acid rain; acid rain recovery; brook trout; climate change; coldwater fish; lake stratification; Salvelinus fontinalis; thermocline; water clarity","acid deposition; acid rain; acidification; climate change; climate effect; dissolved organic carbon; lake; salmonid; stratification; thermocline; United States; Salvelinus fontinalis; acid rain; acid rain; animal; climate change; Europe; fish; lake; North America; population dynamics; Acid Rain; Animals; Climate Change; Europe; Fishes; Lakes; North America; Population Dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007228146

We evaluated peat volume from two commonly referenced maps of peat distribution and depth published by Wetlands International (WI) and the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), and used regionally specific values of carbon density to calculate carbon stocks. Results: Peatland extent and volume published in the MoA maps are lower than those in the WI maps, resulting in lower estimates of carbon storage. We estimate Indonesia's total peat carbon store to be within 13.6 GtC (the low MoA map estimate) and 40.5 GtC (the high WI map estimate) with a best estimate of 28.1 GtC: the midpoint of medium carbon stock estimates derived from WI (30.8 GtC) and MoA (25.3 GtC) maps. This estimate is about half of previous assessments which used an assumed average value of peat thickness for all Indonesian peatlands, and revises the current global tropical peat carbon pool to 75 GtC. Yet, these results do not diminish the significance of Indonesia's peatlands, which store an estimated 30% more carbon than the biomass of all Indonesian forests. The largest discrepancy between maps is for the Papua province, which accounts for 62-71% of the overall differences in peat area, volume and carbon storage. According to the MoA map, 80% of Indonesian peatlands are <300 cm thick and thus vulnerable to conversion outside of protected areas according to environmental regulations. The carbon contained in these shallower peatlands is conservatively estimated to be 10.6 GtC, equivalent to 42% of Indonesia's total peat carbon and about 12 years of global emissions from land use change at current rates. Conclusions: Considering the high uncertainties in peatland extent, volume and carbon storage revealed in this assessment of current maps, a systematic revision of Indonesia's peat maps to produce a single geospatial reference that is universally accepted would improve national peat carbon storage estimates and greatly benefit carbon cycle research, land use management and spatial planning. © 2017 The Author(s).","Carbon emissions; Carbon pools; Climate change mitigation; Peat degradation; Tropical peatlands; Wetlands","biodiversity; carbon cycle; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; degradation; ecosystem service; land use change; land use planning; map; peatland; uncertainty analysis; wetland; Indonesia; Papua [(PRV) Indonesia]",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019357660

In this study, kitchen garden topsoils (0–25 cm) were sampled from the area around three smelters in France, with different Cd and Pb contamination levels. Effect of a phosphate amendment (a mixture of diammonium phosphate and hydroxyapatite) on the environmental availability and phytoavailability of Cd and Pb was evaluated by different chemical extractions and cultivating lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), respectively. Changes in the distribution of Cd and Pb were found in most contaminated soils after phosphate amendment. An increase of Cd and Pb in the residual phase was highlighted in almost all carbonated contaminated soils, whereas a decrease of Pb in the exchangeable, water and acid-soluble phase was observed in most contaminated soils with the lowest carbonate contents. The concentrations of extractable Cd and Pb using calcium chloride and acetic and citric acids generally decreased after the soil amendment. Lettuces grown on amended soils were acceptable for human consumption as regard to Pb concentration. In contrast, some lettuces were unacceptable for human consumption, since the concentrations of Cd in the leaves were higher than the European legislation limit. Surprisingly, in carbonated soils with very low concentration of Cd, the Cd concentrations in lettuce reached up to the European legislation limit, making the lettuce unacceptable for human consumption. Our study highlighted the fact that the total metal concentration in soils does not always allow to predict the metal accumulation in the edible parts of vegetables in order to make a judgement about their acceptability or unacceptability for human consumption. © 2017 Soil Science Society of China","chemical amendment; contamination; immobilisation; lettuce; metal; urban soil","bioavailability; contaminated land; extraction method; immobilization; leafy vegetable; legislation; metal; phosphate; soil amendment; topsoil; urban area; France; Lactuca; Lactuca sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020743783

Little unanimity in the literature exists on the effects of livestock grazing on soil carbon and biodiversity, in part, due to uncontrolled grazing pressure from native and feral animals. Paired paddock contrasts at three, long-term (>8 years) study locations in the southern Australian rangelands were used to examine the effects of managing grazing intensity through the use of exclusion fencing and rotational grazing on soil organic carbon (SOC), soil nitrogen (TN), ground cover and biodiversity (flora and invertebrates). Grazing management had no effect on SOC or TN on grey soils (Vertisols), but for red soils (Lixisols), significantly higher levels of SOC were found for both the 0 to 5 and 5 to 10-cm soil depths (0·3% and 0·27% respectively) and associated with increased TN. We found strong and consistent relationships among SOC and higher perennial (p < 0·001), higher litter (p < 0·05) cover and close proximity to trees (p < 0·05). Managing grazing intensity resulted in significantly higher perennial ground cover (p < 0·001) on Vertisols (8·9 to 11%) and Lixisols (12·5 to 15%) and higher plant diversity (both native and exotic) but negatively impacted invertebrate diversity, indicating trade-offs between production and resources. We provide evidence that the effects of grazing management on SOC are mediated by ground cover and increased organic matter supply and/or reduced soil carbon redistribution (erosion), which indicates that the management of grazing intensity may provide a tool to avoid soil carbon loss in rangelands.

A noxious invasive plant, Chromolaena odorata, has invaded broad regions, but limited attention has been paid to clarify the ecological impacts of this invasive plant on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage in invaded ecosystems. This study was conducted to investigate changes in the labile and total soil C and N fractions in the surface and subsurface soil layers in non-invaded plots, plots with slight (30%) or severe (100%) invasion, and a restored forest plot with native tree and shrub species within a tropical savanna. Our results showed that different severities of C. odorata invasion induced inconsistent responses of the soil C and N fractions in the investigated tropical savanna. In particular, slight invasion did not alter or decreased the total and labile soil C and N fractions, and severe invasion significantly increased most of the total and labile soil C and N fractions. The encroachment of woody species significantly increased the soil C and N contents, with significantly higher increases than in the invaded plots. Our results suggest that the impacts of invasion on soil C and N fractions could vary depending on invasion severity. Therefore, comparisons of the invaded and non-invaded plots with invasion duration or severity overlooked are likely to result in biased conclusions regarding the invasioninduced ecological consequences in terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, C. odorata invasion can alter soil nutrient conditions according to the needs of C. odorata establishment at different stages and consequently affect the soil C and N contents in this tropical ecosystem. © 2017 Wei et al.","C sequestration; Ecological functioning; Global changes; Nutrient cycling; Plant invasion; Soil fertility; Woody encroachment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020003385

This result indicates an important funding source for the government to control PM2.5 pollution in the region. In the econometric analysis, the mean WTP is found to significantly relate with income, expense, age and education level. It decreases with income, age and educational level, but increases with expense, and it is higher for females, people who have children, own cars and apartments but lower for those having larger families.

However, few studies have investigated the photosynthetic CO2 uptake potential of different urban tree species across seasons. In particular little is known about photosynthetic CO2 uptake in cities with a subtropical, oceanic climate where evergreen species are dominant. We addressed this shortcoming by measuring net photosynthetic rates of ten native and exotic tree species during different seasons and times of the day in Auckland, New Zealand. We also assessed the potential of leaf nitrogen (N) concentration as a proxy for net photosynthetic capacities of urban trees, which is of particular importance to upscale leaf-level photosynthetic CO2 uptake to local and regional scales. In addition, we compared measured net photosynthetic capacities (light-saturated net photosynthetic rates) with carbon (C) sequestration rates estimated using tree growth measurements and allometric equations. Mean net photosynthetic capacities ranged between 2.37 and 10.48 μmol m−2 s−1 across all seasons and were closely related to tree C sequestration rates, suggesting that increased photosynthesis enhances growth rates and therefore tree C sequestration rates. Given that winter net photosynthetic capacities remained high in evergreen species (3.38–13.96 μmol m−2 s−1), with almost 50% higher mean net photosynthetic capacity compared to summer across all species, we suggest that tree planting programmes for CO2 mitigation should favour long living evergreen tree species with high basal area increments (BAI). Leaf N explained 43% and 57% of the variability of photosynthetic capacities across species in summer and winter, respectively. These results indicate that leaf N may be used as a proxy for net photosynthetic capacities of commonly planted urban trees in Auckland. However, further research is required to provide robust models that may be used to estimate photosynthetic CO2 uptake at a local and urban scale. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Allometric equations; Carbon sequestration; Leaf nitrogen; Leaf-level gas exchange; New Zealand; Urban greening",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006132076

However, extant plant trait distributions will not allow extrapolations to novel community assemblages in future climates, which will require a mechanistic understanding of the trade-offs that determine trait diversity. In this study, we show how physiological trade-offs involving leaf mass per unit area (LMA), leaf lifespan, leaf nitrogen, and leaf respiration may explain the distribution patterns of evergreen and deciduous trees in the temperate and boreal zones based on (1) an evolutionary analysis of a simple mathematical model and (2) simulation experiments of an individual-based dynamic vegetation model (i.e., LM3-PPA). The evolutionary analysis shows that these leaf traits set up a trade-off between carbon- and nitrogen-use efficiency at the scale of individual trees and therefore determine competitively dominant leaf strategies. As soil nitrogen availability increases, the dominant leaf strategy switches from one that is high in nitrogen-use efficiency to one that is high in carbon-use efficiency or, equivalently, from high-LMA/long-lived leaves (i.e., evergreen) to low-LMA/short-lived leaves (i.e., deciduous). In a region of intermediate soil nitrogen availability, the dominant leaf strategy may be either deciduous or evergreen depending on the initial conditions of plant trait abundance (i.e., founder controlled) due to feedbacks of leaf traits on soil nitrogen mineralization through litter quality. Simulated successional patterns by LM3-PPA from the leaf physiological trade-offs are consistent with observed successional dynamics of evergreen and deciduous forests at three sites spanning the temperate to boreal zones. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","dynamic global vegetation model; evolutionarily stable strategy; forest succession; game theory; leaf traits; LM3-PPA; nitrogen cycle","climate effect; deciduous forest; evergreen forest; game theory; leaf; modeling; nitrogen cycle; physiology; prediction; vegetation dynamics; vegetation type; nitrogen; soil; chemistry; forest; nitrogen cycle; plant leaf; soil; theoretical model; tree; Forests; Models, Theoretical; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Cycle; Plant Leaves; Soil; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85003781961

Humans are an imperative component of the Earth's ecosystems as we transform them to meet our economic and cultural needs. 2. Seas and oceans contribute to the local, regional and global development of human society. The downside of this development is environmental deterioration resulting from increasing competition for sea space and coastal areas between different and conflicting interests. 3. Natural environmental stressors are exacerbated by anthropogenic pressures in the drainage areas of all aquatic systems. The interplay of such pressures is particularly pronounced in semi-enclosed seas such as the Baltic Sea, which are often multi-use and multi-stakeholder areas. 4. The ecosystem goods and services offered by the Baltic Sea can be classified as provisioning (resources obtained by exploitation for e.g. human food), regulating (direct natural regulation processes, e.g. Gas and climate regulation), cultural (non-material benefits, e.g. Recreation) and supporting (processes necessary to sustain the other goods and services, e.g. Primary production). 5. The management of the Baltic Sea ecosystem has its success stories, such as regulations for the exploitation of living resources and discharges of hazardous substances. It also has its failures, eutrophication management being perhaps the most evident one. 6. Trans-national networking and cross-border cooperation are crucial for improving the health of the Baltic Sea ecosystem. This is not always easy because the different countries around the Baltic Sea experience different social constraints. 7. The large-scale anthropogenic pressures on the Baltic Sea can only be dealt with by ecosystem-based management (EBM). EBM is an integrated approach to management that considers the entire ecosystem, including humans, and aims to maintain the sustainable supply of ecosystem goods and services by keeping the ecosystem in a healthy, productive and resilient condition. 8. Marine spatial planning (MSP) may be the vehicle for scientific knowledge to inform and influence decision-making.","Conflicting interests; Ecosystem goods and services environmental legislation; Ecosystem-based management; Fish-stock management; Habitat restauration; International cooperation; Management of nutrient inputs; Marine spatial planning; Nature conservation; Science-based advice; Sustainable use",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033685443

Especially in relation to global climate change, cities play a major role considering the impacts of extreme heat waves on the population. For urban planners, it is important to know which types of urban structures are beneficial for a comfortable urban climate and which actions can be taken to improve urban climate conditions. Therefore, it is essential to differ between not only urban and rural environments, but also between different levels of urban densification. To compare these built-up types within different cities worldwide, Stewart and Oke developed the concept of local climate zones (LCZ) defined by morphological characteristics. The original LCZ scheme often has considerable problems when adapted to European cities with historical city centers, including narrow streets and irregular patterns. In this study, a method to bridge the gap between a classical land use/land cover (LULC) classification and the LCZ scheme is presented. Multitemporal Landsat 8 data are used to create a high accuracy LULC map, which is linked to the LCZ by morphological parameters derived from a high-resolution digital surface model and cadastral data. A bijective combination of the different classification schemes could not be achieved completely due to overlapping threshold values and the spatially homogeneous distribution of morphological parameters, but the attribution of LCZ to the LULC classification was successful. © The Authors.

This article describes a generalized model that describes the efficacy of different indoor air quality improvement strategies as a function of the primary source(s) of indoor air contaminants of concern. The model is then used as a framework to compare the impact of two different ventilation approaches (a continuous exhaust ventilation strategy compared to a runtime ventilation strategy) on two indoor air compounds (CO2 and formaldehyde) based on primary data gathered in 10 homes in Gainesville, FL. The findings from the Gainesville data suggest that the two approaches provided similar efficacy for reducing CO2 concentrations, but the continuous exhaust system was not as effective at decreasing interior concentrations of formaldehyde, as compared to the runtime ventilation strategy. The simplified, generalized model could be used as a framework to analyze and compare existing detailed modeling and experimental results to bring about a greater understanding of the relative efficacy and tradeoffs of different IAQ mitigation strategies in homes, as well as inform guidance or standards addressing indoor air quality in residential buildings and serve as a decision-making tool for building industry professionals responsible for specifying ventilation systems in homes. © 2017 by the authors.","Contaminant modeling; Indoor air quality; Ventilation","air quality; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); decision making; efficiency measurement; formaldehyde; indoor air; pollutant; pollutant source; pollutant transport; residential location; ventilation; Florida [United States]; Gainesville; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021633519

Coastal marshes provide flood abatement, carbon and nutrient sequestration, water quality maintenance, and habitat for fish, shellfish, and wildlife, including species of concern, such as the saltmarsh sparrow (Ammodramus caudacutus). We present a climate change adaptation strategy (CCAS) adopted by scientific, management, and policy stakeholders for managing coastal marshes and enhancing system resiliency. A common adaptive management approach previously used for restoration projects was modified to identify climate-related vulnerabilities and plan climate change adaptive actions. As an example of implementation of the CCAS, we describe the stakeholder plans and management actions the US Fish and Wildlife Service and partners developed to build coastal resiliency in the Narrow River Estuary, RI, in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. When possible, an experimental BACI (before-after, control-impact) design, described as pre- and post-sampling at the impact site and one or more control sites, was incorporated into the climate change adaptation and implementation plans. Specific climate change adaptive actions and monitoring plans are described and include shoreline stabilization, restoring marsh drainage, increasing marsh elevation, and enabling upland marsh migration.

CH3OH is the most commonly purchased carbon source for sewage denitrification. Until recently, greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting protocols consistently ignored the liberation of anthropogenic CO2 attributable to CH3OH. This oversight can likely be attributed to a simplifying notion that CO2 produced through activated-sludge-process respiration is biogenic because most raw-sewage carbon is un-sequestered prior to entering a WWTP. Instead, a biogenic categorization cannot apply to fossil-fuel-derived carbon sources like CH3OH. This paper provides a summary of how CH3OH use at DC Water's Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant (AWTP; Washington, DC, USA) amounts to 60 to 85% of the AWTP's Scope-1 emissions. The United States Environmental Protection Agency and Water Environment Federation databases suggest that CH3OH CO2 likely represents one quarter of all Scope-1 GHG emissions attributable to sewage treatment in the USA. Finally, many alternatives to CH3OH use exist and are discussed. © IWA Publishing 2017.","Anthropogenic greenhouse gas; Global-warming mitigation; Methanol; Methodology; Nitrogen removal; Sewage treatment","Activated sludge process; Carbon dioxide; Denitrification; Environmental Protection Agency; Gas emissions; Methanol; Nitrogen; Nitrogen removal; Sewage pumping plants; Sewage treatment; Toxicity; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Anthropogenic carbon dioxide; Carbon source; Derived carbons; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Methodology; United States environmental protection agency; Wastewater treatment plants; Water environment federations; Greenhouse gases; alcohol; fossil fuel; glycerol; methanol; nitrogen; carbon dioxide; methanol; sewage; waste water; water pollutant; activated sludge; anthropogenic effect; carbon emission; denitrification; global warming; greenhouse gas; methanol; methodology; nitrogen; pollutant removal; sewage treatment; wastewater treatment plant; activated sludge; anaerobic digestion; Article; biomass; carbon footprint; carbon source; denitrification; energy consumption; government; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; hydrolysis; methylotroph; nitrogen concentration; sewage treatment; United States; waste water treatment plant; chemistry; procedures; sewage; waste disposal facility; waste water; water pollutant; United States; Washington [United States]; Carbon Dioxide; Greenhouse Effect; Methanol; Nitrogen; Sewage; Waste Disposal Facilities; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024499069

Pollution dispersion models assume that the concentrations decrease monotonically with raising wind speed. This convenient assumption breaks down when applied to flows with local recirculations such as those found in topographically complex coastal areas. This study looks at a practically important and sufficiently common case of air pollution in a coastal valley city. Here, the observed concentrations are determined by the interaction between large-scale topographically forced and local-scale breeze-like recirculations. <br><br> Analysis of a long observational dataset in Bergen, Norway, revealed that the most extreme cases of recurring wintertime air pollution episodes were accompanied by increased large-scale wind speeds above the valley. Contrary to the theoretical assumption and intuitive expectations, the maximum NO2 concentrations were not found for the lowest 10ĝ€m ERA-Interim wind speeds but in situations with wind speeds of 3ĝ€mĝ€sĝ'1. To explain this phenomenon, we investigated empirical relationships between the large-scale forcing and the local wind and air quality parameters. We conducted 16 large-eddy simulation (LES) experiments with the Parallelised Large-Eddy Simulation Model (PALM) for atmospheric and oceanic flows. The LES accounted for the realistic relief and coastal configuration as well as for the large-scale forcing and local surface condition heterogeneity in Bergen. They revealed that emerging local breeze-like circulations strongly enhance the urban ventilation and dispersion of the air pollutants in situations with weak large-scale winds. Slightly stronger large-scale winds, however, can counteract these local recirculations, leading to enhanced surface air stagnation. <br><br> Furthermore, this study looks at the concrete impact of the relative configuration of warmer water bodies in the city and the major transport corridor. We found that a relatively small local water body acted as a barrier for the horizontal transport of air pollutants from the largest street in the valley and along the valley bottom, transporting them vertically instead and hence diluting them. We found that the stable stratification accumulates the street-level pollution from the transport corridor in shallow air pockets near the surface. The polluted air pockets are transported by the local recirculations to other less polluted areas with only slow dilution. This combination of relatively long distance and complex transport paths together with weak dispersion is not sufficiently resolved in classical air pollution models. The findings have important implications for the air quality predictions over urban areas. Any prediction not resolving these, or similar local dynamic features, might not be able to correctly simulate the dispersion of pollutants in cities. © Author(s) 2017.",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); large eddy simulation; nitrogen oxides; pollutant transport; urban society; wind velocity; Bergen; Hordaland; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020930307

Through photochemistry, higher-order hydrocarbons are generated, coagulating into aerosols and resulting in global haze layers. Here we present a state-of-the-art photochemical model for Pluto's atmosphere to explain the abundance profiles of CH4, C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6, the total column density of HCN, and to predict the abundance profiles of oxygen-bearing species. The CH4 profile can be best matched by taking a constant-with-altitude eddy diffusion coefficient Kzz profile of 1 × 103 cm2 s–1 and a fixed CH4 surface mixing ratio of 4 × 10–3. Condensation is key to fitting the C2 hydrocarbon profiles. We find that C2H4 must have a much lower saturation vapor pressure than predicted by extrapolations of laboratory measurements to Pluto temperatures. We also find best-fit values for the sticking coefficients of C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, and HCN.

We developed a new sea-surface temperature (SST) record based on planktonic foraminiferal Mg/Ca for the last 7200 years. This record reveals several significant shifts between warmer and colder conditions. Temperatures averaged 27.5 °C ca. 7200 cal. years BP, then climbed to 28.2 °C from 6500 to 5500 cal. years BP. At 5500-4500 cal. years BP we identified the coldest period (26.8 °C) of the analyzed period. For the last 4500 years SST again averaged 27.5 °C but the profile is rather variable. The last ca. 1000 years recorded the warmest SST averaging 28.5 °C. We record, for the first time in this region, a cool interval, ca. 1000 years in duration, centered on 5000 cal years BP concomitant with a wet period recorded in Borneo. The record also reflects a warm interval from ca. 1000 to 500 cal years BP that may represent the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Variations in the East Asian Monsoon (EAM) and solar activity are considered as potential drivers of SST trends. However, hydrology changes related to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability, shifts of the Western Pacific Warm Pool and migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone are more likely to have impacted our SST temporal trend. Our findings indicate that climatic patterns in the region might be in phase with ENSO and out of phase with the EAM. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","East Asian Monsoon; Foraminifera; Holocene; Mg/Ca; Paleoclimatology; Southeastern Asia; Sunda Shelf","Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climatology; Solar energy; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; East Asian monsoon; Foraminifera; Holocenes; Paleoclimatology; Southeastern Asia; Sunda shelves; Oceanography; calcium; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; Holocene; intertropical convergence zone; magnesium; paleoclimate; planktonic foraminifera; proxy climate record; sea surface temperature; solar activity; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; Southeast Asia; Sunda Shelf; Foraminifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017625418

Results show that the WRF-Chem model successfully captures the distribution and magnitude of and variation in SJV aerosols during the cold season. However, aerosols are not well represented in the warm season. Aerosol simulations in urban areas during the cold season are sensitive to model horizontal resolution, with better simulations at 4 km resolution than at 20 km resolution, mainly due to inhomogeneous distribution of anthropogenic emissions and precipitation that is represented better in the 4 km simulation. In rural areas, the model sensitivity to grid size is rather small. Our observational analysis reveals that dust is a primary contributor to aerosols in the SJV, especially during the warm season. Aerosol simulations in the warm season are sensitive to the parameterization of dust emission in WRF-Chem. The GOCART (Goddard Global Ozone Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport) dust scheme produces very little dust in the SJV, while the DUSTRAN (DUST TRANsport model) scheme overestimates dust emission. Vertical mixing of aerosols is not adequately represented in the model based on CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared pathfinder Satellite Observation) aerosol extinction profiles. Improved representation of dust emission and vertical mixing in the boundary layer is needed for better simulations of aerosols during the warm season in the SJV. © 2017 Author(s).

Adding to the limited calibration information available for modern tropical forests, we analyzed plant leaf and leaf wax carbon isotopic compositions in forest canopy trees across a highly biodiverse, 3.3 km elevation gradient on the eastern flank of the Andes Mountains. We sampled the dominant tree species and assessed their relative abundance in each tree community. In total, 405 sunlit canopy leaves were sampled across 129 species and nine forest plots along the elevation profile for bulk leaf and leaf wax n-alkane (C27–C33) concentration and carbon isotopic analyses (δ13C); a subset (76 individuals, 29 species, five forest plots) were additionally analyzed for n-alkanoic acid (C22–C32) concentrations and δ13C. δ13C values display trends of +0.87 ± 0.16‰ km−1 (95% CI, r2 = 0.96, p &lt; 0.01) for bulk leaves and +1.45 ± 0.33‰ km−1 (95% CI, r2 = 0.94, p &lt; 0.01) for C29 n-alkane, the dominant chain length. These carbon isotopic gradients are defined in multi-species sample sets and corroborated in a widespread genus and several families, suggesting the biochemical response to environment is robust to taxonomic turnover. We calculate fractionations and compare to adiabatic gradients, environmental variables, leaf wax n-alkane concentrations, and sun/shade position to assess factors influencing foliar chemical response. For the 4 km forested elevation range of the Andes, 4–6‰ higher δ13C values are expected for upland versus lowland C3 plant bulk leaves and their n-alkyl lipids, and we expect this pattern to be a systematic feature of very wet tropical montane environments. This elevation dependency of δ13C values should inform interpretations of sedimentary archives, as 13C-enriched values may derive from C4 grasses, petrogenic inputs or upland C3 plants. Finally, we outline the potential for leaf wax carbon isotopes to trace biomarker sourcing within catchments and for paleoaltimetry. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Altitude effect; Amazon; Andes; Biomarker; Carbon isotopes; Leaf wax; Peru","altitude; biomarker; carbon isotope; isotopic analysis; isotopic composition; leaf; tropical forest; wax; Andes; Peru; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015370876

Previous economic impact assessments of air pollution focused on benefits from environmental regulations while ignoring climate policies. In this study, we examine the health and economic impacts from PM2.5 pollution under various air pollution control strategies and climate policies scenarios in the megacity of Shanghai. The estimation adopts an integrated model combining a Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model, exposure-response functions (ERFs), and a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. The results show that without control measures, Shanghai's mortality caused by PM2.5 pollution are estimated to be 192 400 cases in 2030 and the work time loss to be 72.1 h/cap annually. The corresponding GDP values and welfare losses would be approximately 2.26% and 3.14%, respectively. With an estimated control cost of 0.76% of local GDP, Shanghai would gain approximately 1.01% of local GDP through local air pollution control measures and climate policies. Furthermore, the application of multiregional integrated control strategies in neighboring provinces would be the most effective in reducing PM2.5 concentration in Shanghai, leading to only 0.34% of GDP loss. At the sectoral level, labor-intensive sectors suffer more output loss from PM2.5 pollution. Sectors with the highest control costs include power generation, iron and steel, and transport. The results indicate that the combination of multiregional integrated air pollution control strategies and climate policies would be cost-beneficial for Shanghai. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Air pollution; Air pollution control; Costs; Economic and social effects; Environmental regulations; Greenhouse gases; Pollution; Pollution induced corrosion; Computable general equilibrium model; Control measures; Economic impacts; Integrated control strategy; Integrated modeling; Labor intensive; Macroeconomic impact; Response functions; Pollution control; atmospheric pollution; cost-benefit analysis; economic impact; environmental policy; Gross Domestic Product; health impact; megacity; mortality; particulate matter; pollution control; power generation; absenteeism; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; Article; China; climate; control strategy; economic aspect; energy consumption; greenhouse gas; health impact assessment; industrial production; particulate matter; sensitivity analysis; welfare; air pollutant; air pollution; human; theoretical model; China; Shanghai; air pollutant; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020427032

Research on land use and analysis of variations in carbon stock have practical applications in the optimization of land use and the mitigation of climate change effects. This study was conducted in Baixiang and Julu counties in the Taihang Piedmont by employing the trend analysis method to characterize the variation in county land use and carbon stock. The findings show that in both counties, agricultural and unused land areas decreased while built-up land area increased, and the reduction in cropland was the main reason behind the agricultural land reduction. An inflection point appeared on the cropland curves of Julu, because the cropland area decreased by 1576.97 hm2 from 2004 to 2006. Cropland area in Baixiang decreased from 1996 to 1998 by a total of 129.89 hm2 and then remained relatively stable after 1998. The total carbon storage and variation in land use in the two counties displayed similar trends.

In this review, we have summarized the current state-of-the-art development on the fabrication of high-performance supercapacitors. From the electrode material perspective, a variety of materials have been explored for advanced electrode materials with smart material-design strategies such as carbonaceous materials, metal compounds and conducting polymers. Proper nanostructures are engineered to provide sufficient electroactive sites and enhance the kinetics of ion and electron transport. Besides, new-concept supercapacitors have been developed for practical application. Microsupercapacitors and fiber supercapacitors have been explored for portable and compact electronic devices. Subsequently, we have introduced Li-/Na-ion supercapacitors composed of battery-type electrodes and capacitor-type electrode. Integrated energy devices are also explored by incorporating supercapacitors with energy conversion systems for sustainable energy storage.

This electrostatic tension between the Cu+ and Cu0 surface sites responsible for the MEOM mechanism suggests a unique strategy for designing more efficient and selective electrocatalysts for CO2RR to valuable chemicals (HCOx), a critical need for practical environmental and energy applications.","CO dimerization; CO2 activation; Cu metal embedded in oxidized matrix; Density functional theory; Electrochemical reduction of CO2","carbon dioxide; copper; Article; catalyst; dimerization; electrochemical analysis; electrode; embedding; priority journal; quantum mechanics; surface property",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021450323

Yet, methanogenic archaea are present in those sediments, suggesting a potential for methanogenesis. We used an isotope dilution method based on sediment bag incubation and spiking with 13C-CH4 to quantify CH4 turnover rates in sediment from Aarhus Bay, Denmark. In two independent experiments, highest CH4 production and oxidation rates (&gt;200 pmol cm-3 d-1) were found in the top 0-2 cm, below which rates dropped below 100 pmol cm-3 d-1 in all other segments down to 16 cm. This drop in overall methane turnover with depth was accompanied by decreasing rates of organic matter mineralization with depth. Molecular analyses based on quantitative PCR and MiSeq sequencing of archaeal 16S rRNA genes showed that the abundance of methanogenic archaea also peaked in the top 0-2 cm segment. Based on the community profiling, hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic methanogens dominated among the methanogenic archaea in general, suggesting that methanogenesis in surface sediment could be driven by both CO2 reduction and fermentation of methylated compounds. Our results show the existence of elevated methanogenic activity and a dynamic recycling of CH4 at low concentration in sulfate-rich marine surface sediment. Considering the common environmental conditions found in other coastal systems, we speculate that such a cryptic methane cycling can be ubiquitous. © 2017 Xiao, Beulig, Kjeldsen, Jørgensen and Risgaard-Petersen.","Isotope dilution; Methane oxidation; Methanogenesis; Methanogenic archaea; Surface sediment","methane; sulfate; Article; biomass production; carbon mineralization; controlled study; diffusion flux; DNA extraction; DNA sequence; gas chromatography; geochemical analysis; incubation time; mass spectrometry; methanogenesis; methanogenic archaeon; Methanomicrobiales; microbial community; nonhuman; oxidation; real time polymerase chain reaction; sediment; sequence analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021730554

The results show that three periods with high-frequency and high-severity fires occurred during the periods 18.5-15.0, 13.0-11.5, and 4.3-0.8 ka, respectively. This record was compared with major pollen taxa and pollen diversity indices from the same core, and tentatively related to the regional climate proxy records with the aim to separate climate-from human-induced fire activity, and discuss vegetation-fire-climate interactions. The results suggest that fire was mainly controlled by climate before 4.3 ka and by the combined actions of climate and humans after 4.3 ka. Before 4.3 ka, high fire activity corresponded to cold and dry climatic conditions, while warm and humid climatic conditions brought infrequent and weak fires. Fire was an important disturbance factor and played an important role in forest dynamics around the study area. Vegetation responses to fire after 4.3 ka are not consistent with those before 4.3 ka, suggesting that human influence on vegetation and fire regimes may have become more prevalent after 4.3 ka. The comparisons between fire activity and vegetation reveal that evergreen oaks are flammable plants and fire-tolerant taxa. Alnus is a fire-adapted taxon and a nonflammable plant, but density of Alnus forest is a key factor to decide its fire resistance. The forests dominated by Lithocarpus/Castanopsis and/or tropical trees and shrubs are not easy to ignite, but Lithocarpus/Castanopsis and tropical trees and shrubs are fire-sensitive taxa. Fire appears to be unfavourable to plant diversity in the study area. © Author(s) 2017.",,"charcoal; environmental disturbance; fire history; forest dynamics; palynology; Postglacial; proxy climate record; shrub; species diversity; tolerance; China; Qinghai; Qinghai Lake; Yunnan; Alnus; Quercus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020271723

By comparing the EBIC images of an untested and a degraded laser from the same laser bar, we show that the p-n junction position of the degraded laser has shifted towards the n-doped region and the carrier interface at the p-side of the p-n junction of the degraded laser became less sharp than in the original laser diode. This p-n junction position shift leads to carrier compensation in the active and the n-doped regions, which subsequently leads to an imbalance in the hole and electron concentrations in the active region and a reduction in the emission efficiency of InGaN quantum wells. This occurs because a displacement of the p-n junction, from its optimal position, results in a minority carrier loss, as the latter has a higher probability of recombining non-radiatively en-route to the active region. The minority carrier diffusion lengths were also calculated using two different theoretical models. The results show that the electron diffusion length in the p-doped region in the degraded laser is longer than that in the untested laser. The reason may also be related to the compensation effect or the reduced recombination rate in the degraded laser, which will result in an increase in the threshold current of the laser and the degradation of the laser. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Degradation; Doping (additives); Electric currents; Electron beams; Electrons; Energy gap; Gallium alloys; III-V semiconductors; Indium alloys; Lighting; Scanning electron microscopy; Semiconductor alloys; Semiconductor diodes; Semiconductor junctions; Wide band gap semiconductors; Carrier compensation; Compensation effects; Degradation mechanism; Electron concentration; Electron diffusion length; Electron-beam-induced current; Emission efficiencies; Minority carrier diffusion length; Quantum well lasers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049533223

Excitation spectra of SrAl2Si2O8: Eu2+ gives two broad excitation bands maximizing at 270 and 330 nm, resulting from splitting Eu2+ energy levels in octahedral crystal field. Eu single doped SrAl2Si2O8 luminescent material exhibits two emission bands at about 406 and 616 nm. Intensity of the blue emission from Eu2+ is always strong, compared with that of the red emission band of Eu3+. Reduction from Eu3+ to Eu2+ can be explained with the model of charge compensation. Blue emission in SrAl2Si2O8: xEu was strengthened after incorporation of Tb, which can be explained by electron transfer from Tb3+ to Eu3+ (Tb3++Eu3+ → Tb4+ +Eu2+). Under 230 nm excitation, intensity of Tb3+ emission was nearly unchanged and that of Eu2+ was increased, obviously due to the delivery of more electrons to Eu3+.

Nitrogen fixation is an energy-demanding process requiring tight control of metabolism and redox state. It is of great interest to understand the bacteroid differentiation process and the roles of energy storage molecules, such as glycogen and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), in maintaining the Rhizobium-legume symbioses. Traditional biochemical assays for checking phenotypic changes of mutants require a large volume of starting materials, which is difficult for unculturable, terminally differentiated bacteroids. Here we present a label-free technique that allows the identification and characterization of phenotypic changes of bacteria at the single-cell level. This work demonstrates the application of single-cell Raman spectra (SCRS) to differentiate Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae wild-type and mutants under different conditions. We found symbiotically differentiated bacteroids and free-living bacteria differed primarily at a Raman biomarker, cytochrome c, corresponding to a bacteroid-specific terminal oxidase. We demonstrated that, for the first time, SCRS were able to link phenotypic changes and specific genetic mutants, in this case, single and double mutations in synthesis of carbon storage molecules glycogen and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB).

However, experimental evidence for C sequestration potential (Csp) in China’s forest ecosystems and its spatial patterns remain unclear, although a deep understanding is essential for policy-makers making decisions on reforestation. Here, we surveyed the literature from 2004 to 2014 to obtain C density data on forest ecosystems in China and used mature forests as a reference to explore Csp. The results showed that the C densities of vegetation and soil (0–100 cm) in China’s forest ecosystems were about 69.23 Mg C/ha and 116.52 Mg C/ha, respectively. In mature forests, the Csp of vegetation and soil are expected to increase to 129.26 Mg C/ha (87.1%) and 154.39 Mg C/ha (32.4%) in the coming decades, respectively. Moreover, the potential increase of C storage in vegetation (10.81 Pg C) is estimated at approximately twice that of soil (5.01 Pg C). Higher Csp may occur in the subtropical humid regions and policy-makers should pay particular attention to the development of new reforestation strategies for these areas. In addition to soil nutrients and environment, climate was an important factor influencing the spatial patterns of C density in forest ecosystems in China. Interestingly, climate influenced the spatial patterns of vegetation and soil C density via different routes, having a positive effect on vegetation C density and a negative effect on soil C density. This estimation of the potential for increasing forest C storage provided new insights into the vital roles of China’s forest ecosystems in future C sequestration. More importantly, our findings emphasize that climate constraints on forest C sequestration should be considered in reforestation strategies in China because the effects of climate were the opposite for spatial patterns of C density in vegetation and soil. © 2017, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agricultural Ecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","carbon density; forest; reforestation; sequestration potential; storage","carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; forest ecosystem; forest soil; future prospect; reforestation; waste disposal; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021194433

Based on daily data of air quality index (AQI) in 31 Chinese provincial capital cities in 2014, this study aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of ambient air pollution and the influencing factors. The spatial and temporal patterns of AQI were presented using GIS map and heat map, respectively. We constructed a hierarchical linear model to quantify the effects of meteorological and socioeconomic factors on AQI. In 2014, the air quality nonattainment (AQI >100) rate was 34.6% on average (1.9 to 74.4%). Air pollution levels were highest in winters and lowest in summers. We found substantial spatial variations of AQI, with the highest values in the middle-east area of the North China Plain. The city-level AQI was positively associated with vehicle population, industrial dust emission, and GDP per capital, which cumulatively explained 67.5% of spatial variations of AQI. The city-level AQI also increased with city’s annual atmospheric pressure but decreased with annual mean temperature. Daily AQI within a city decreased with daily temperature, sunshine duration, wind speed, precipitation, and relative humidity. The national analyses indicate that the ambient air quality in China exhibits significant geographical and seasonal variations which were mainly driven by socioeconomic and meteorological factors. The findings would help to understand the underlying reasons for spatial health disparities and would provide important information to guide targeted policy response to ambient air pollution. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Air quality; China; Meteorological factors; Socioeconomic conditions; Spatiotemporal variations","air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric pressure; GIS; industrial emission; pollution control; seasonal variation; socioeconomic indicator; spatiotemporal analysis; China; North China Plain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020643000

Most of the existing studies use the average estimation method to investigate the main drivers of CO2 emissions in the iron and steel industry. However, the data distribution of economic variables is often not normal distribution, and the tail of the data hidden important information. In order to provide a realistic basis for emission reduction in this industry, this study uses the quantile regression model to explore the driving forces of CO2 emissions under high, medium and low emission levels. The results show that the effect of economic growth on CO2 emissions in the upper 90th quantile provinces is stronger than those in other quantile provinces due to the differences in fixed–asset investment and automobile production. However, the impact of energy efficiency in the upper 90th quantile provinces is lower than those in other quantile provinces. The influence of industrialization in the lower 10th quantile provinces is stronger than those in other quantile provinces. The influence intensity of energy structure has a similar story owing to the differences in coal consumption. Therefore, policymakers should focus on the heterogeneous effects of driving forces on CO2 emissions in different quantiles during the process of carbon reductions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Quantile regression approach; The iron and steel industry","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Investments; Iron; Normal distribution; Regression analysis; Steelmaking; Automobile production; Data distribution; Economic variables; Emission reduction; Energy structures; Estimation methods; Heterogeneous effects; Quantile regression; Iron and steel industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017580115

However, it is not yet clear how effective eco-driving is for different transit service and fuel types. As policymakers consider implementing eco-driving, they also need comparisons of eco-driving against other fuel-conserving strategies, such as purchasing alternative fuel vehicles. Using a case study of transit operations in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, this paper evaluated eco-driving for two very different service types – local urban service and express service. The authors simulated the implementation of transit eco-driving strategies using an innovative, streamlined algorithm designed to minimize fuel consumption by limiting instantaneous vehicle specific power while maintaining average speed and conserving total distance. Fuel consumption and fuel-cycle emissions were compared across the monitored driving cycles and their modified eco-driving cycles. The savings from eco-driving were also compared to fuel and emissions reductions expected via the conversion of the transit fleets to compressed natural gas (CNG), another popular fuel conservation strategy. The results showed that eco-driving would be a potentially very cost-effective strategy for local and express bus transit operations. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollutants; Alternative fuel; Bus; Eco-driving; Energy; Greenhouse gas","Alternative fuels; Buses; Compressed natural gas; Cost effectiveness; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Air pollutants; Alternative fuel vehicles; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Cost effective strategies; Eco-driving; Emissions reduction; Energy; Vehicle specific power; Fuels; alternative fuel; atmospheric pollution; emission control; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; natural gas; policy implementation; policy making; strategic approach; traffic emission; transport vehicle; urban service; Atlanta; Georgia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082363405

There are numerous methods and metrics for quantifying species range shifts, but we currently lack a comprehensive review of existing approaches used in species range shift studies. Location: Global. Time period: 2013 – 2014. Major taxa studied: All taxa. Methods: We conducted a quantitative literature review to first identify the methods currently used for defining a species' range over a particular time and then to identify metrics used for measuring changes in species ranges over time. We provide a roadmap for the selection of methods and metrics for measuring species ranges and species range shifts by discussing opportunities, assumptions and constraints of the different approaches. Results: Our literature review revealed six main methods for defining species ranges: observational studies, grid-based mapping, convex hull, kriging, species distribution modelling and hybrid methods. These methods are used with three main metric classes to measure species range shifts: changes in range limit, size and the probability of species occurrences or suitability. Most methods for defining species ranges and subsequent range shifts can be applied to different spatial extents and resolutions and taxa. However, only species distribution models (SDMs) and hybrid methods allow for the exploration of the relationship between species occurrence and environmental variables, and only these methods can be used for forecasting species ranges into future environments. Likewise, the inclusion of ecological processes in range shift calculations requires researchers to use hybrid methods or mechanistic models. Main conclusions: Our review revealed a high diversity of methods and metrics used to quantify species range shifts. As these methods and metrics underlie many of the conservation strategies proposed for climate change mitigation (e.g., protection of refugia), we urge the conservation community to evaluate underlying approaches for defining species ranges and measuring species range shifts with an equal level of scrutiny as the conservation strategies that these methods and metrics enable. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; global change; grid-based map; hybrid method; mechanistic model; meta-population model; range contraction; range expansion; SDM; species distribution","biodiversity; climate change; global change; map; metapopulation; population modeling; range expansion; spatial distribution; species occurrence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019621656

However, it remains unclear how the carbon balance responds to recurrent drought and recovery. To understand the carbon balance response to recurrent drought, we monitored dynamic changes in the physiological traits of two species during cycles of drought and recovery, Amorpha fruticosa and Robinia pseudoacacia, which are planted widely on the Loess Plateau. We found that the two species performed similarly in response to drought; both showed growth cessation and a reduction of carbon assimilation and respiration under cycles of drought and recovery. The soil water content (SWC) at the stress point of the fluorescence parameters was lower than those of gas exchange and water potential, which were higher in the second drought than in the first drought, except aboveground respiration, which may enhance the risk of drought-related mortality. After rewatered, leaf photosynthesis recovered fully and root respiration increased; however, the aboveground carbon flux of the plants did not fully recover due to leaf shedding. In addition, drought caused a decrease in the stem diameter, which impeded phloem function and carbon translocation and redistribution, resulting in a decrease in non-structural carbohydrates in local plant tissues under drought in both species. Furthermore, A. fruticosa showed higher total non-structural carbohydrates. Our results suggest that plants that had experienced drought were more sensitive when faced with subsequent drought, and recurrent drought enhanced the risk of mortality in plants. © 2017","Drought cycles; Non-structural carbohydrates; Physiological responses; Rewatered; Soil respiration","angiosperm; carbohydrate; carbon balance; carbon flux; climate change; deciduous tree; drought stress; growth; legume; mortality; phloem; photosynthesis; physiological response; soil respiration; soil water; translocation; China; Loess Plateau; Amorpha fruticosa; Robinia pseudoacacia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015797006

Studies have shown that PM2.5 pollution is strongly related to the land use pattern at the micro-scale and optimizing the land use pattern has been suggested as an approach to mitigate PM2.5 pollution. However, there are only a few researches analyzing the effect of land use on PM2.5 pollution. This paper employed land use regression (LUR) models and statistical analysis to explore the effect of land use on PM2.5 pollution in urban areas. Nanchang city, China, was taken as the study area. The LUR models were used to simulate the spatial variations of PM2.5 concentrations. Analysis of variance and multiple comparisons were employed to study the PM2.5 concentration variances among five different types of urban functional zones. Multiple linear regression was applied to explore the PM2.5 concentration variances among the same type of urban functional zone. The results indicate that the dominant factor affecting PM2.5 pollution in the Nanchang urban area was the traffic conditions. Significant variances of PM2.5 concentrations among different urban functional zones throughout the year suggest that land use types generated a significant impact on PM2.5 concentrations and the impact did not change as the seasons changed. Land use intensity indexes including the building volume rate, building density, and green coverage rate presented an insignificant or counter-intuitive impact on PM2.5 concentrations when studied at the spatial scale of urban functional zones.

Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100101, China","A regional climate model, WRF-Chem, was used to investigate the feedback between aerosols and meteorological conditions in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). The numerical experiments (15-km horizontal resolution) with and without the aerosol effects are driven by reanalysis of data for 1–31 March 2009, when a heavy pollution event (13–19 March) occurred. The results showed that the model captured the spatial and temporal meteorological conditions and aerosol optical characteristics during the heavy pollution days. Aerosols induced cooling at the surface and warming in the middle troposphere due to their radiative effects, and resulted in a more stable PBL over the IGP. Aerosol-induced 2-m relative humidity (RH) was increased. The stable PBL likely led to the surface PM2.5 concentration increase of up to 21 μg m−3 (15 %) over the IGP. For the TP, the atmospheric profile did not drastically change due to fewer radiative effects of aerosols in the PBL compared with those over the IGP. The aerosol-induced RH decreased due to cloud albedo and cloud lifetime effect, and led to a reduction in surface PM2.5 concentration of up to 17 μg m−3 (13 %). These results suggest a negative and positive feedback over the TP and IGP, respectively, between aerosol concentrations and changes of aerosol-induced meteorological conditions. Similar positive feedbacks have been observed in other heavily polluted regions (e.g., the North China Plain). The results have implications for the study of air pollution on weather and environment over the TP and IGP. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Aerosol; Feedback; Indo-Gangetic Plain; Meteorological conditions; Tibetan Plateau","aerosol; albedo; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; climate feedback; climate modeling; concentration (composition); meteorology; particulate matter; regional climate; relative humidity; troposphere; China; Gangetic Plain; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975318521

Here, we compile and analyze riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration data from 1402 United States Geological Survey (USGS) gauge stations to examine the spatial variability and environmental controls of DOC concentrations in the United States (U.S.) surface waters. DOC concentrations exhibit high spatial variability in the U.S., with an average of 6.42 ± 6.47 mg C/L (Mean ± Standard Deviation). High DOC concentrations occur in the Upper Mississippi River basin and the southeastern U.S., while low concentrations are mainly distributed in the western U.S. Soil properties such as soil organic matter, soil water content, and soil sand content mainly show positive correlations with DOC concentrations; forest and shrub land have positive correlations with DOC concentrations, but urban area and cropland demonstrate negative impacts; and total instream phosphorus and dam density correlate positively with DOC concentrations. Notably, the relative importance of these environmental controls varies substantially across major U.S. water resource regions. In addition, DOC concentrations and environmental controls also show significant variability from small streams to large rivers. In sum, our results reveal that general multi-linear regression of twenty environmental factors can partially explain (56%) the DOC concentration variability. This study also highlights the complexity of the interactions among these environmental factors in determining DOC concentrations, thus calls for processes-based, non-linear methodologies to constrain uncertainties in riverine DOC cycling. © 2017 by the authors.","Dissolved organic carbon; General multi-linear regression; Spatial variability; Terrestrial-aquatic continuum","Dissolution; Environmental engineering; Organic carbon; Rivers; Soil moisture; Soils; Stream flow; Dissolved organic carbon; Environmental control; Environmental factors; Multi-linear regression; Riverine carbon fluxes; Spatial variability; Terrestrial-aquatic continuum; United states geological surveys; Water resources; aquatic environment; carbon cycle; carbon flux; concentration (composition); dissolved organic carbon; environmental factor; multiple regression; river basin; soil organic matter; soil water; spatial variation; surface water; terrestrial environment; Mississippi River; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020672827

However, scant explicit and systematical exploration is being done on regional and national CO2 emission volumes. The aim of this work is therefore to provide an improved bottom-up spatial-integration system, relevant to CO2 emissions at factory level, to allow a more accurate estimation of the CO2 emissions from cement production. Based on this system, the sampling data of cement production lines were integrated as regional- and national-level information. The integration results showed that each ton of clinker produced 883 kg CO2, of which the process, fuel, and electricity emissions accounted for 58.70%, 35.97%, and 5.33%, respectively. The volume of CO2 emissions from clinker and cement production reached 1202 Mt and 1284 Mt, respectively, in 2013. A discrepancy was identified between the clinker emission factors relevant to the two main production processes (i.e., the new suspension preheating and pre-calcining kiln (NSP) and the vertical shaft kiln (VSK)), probably relevant to the energy efficiency of the two technologies. An analysis of the spatial characteristics indicated that the spatial distribution of the clinker emission factors mainly corresponded to that of the NSP process. The discrepancy of spatial pattern largely complied with the economic and population distribution pattern of China. The study could fill the knowledge gaps and provide role players with a useful spatial integration system that should facilitate the accurate estimation of carbon and corresponding regional mitigation strategies in China. © 2017, Institute of Geographic Science and Natural Resources Research (IGSNRR), Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","bottom-up estimation; cement industry; China; CO2 emissions; spatial integration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015665470

Because the surface area of a human body is limited to 2 m2, the key challenge in this field is how to realize a high areal capacitance for SCs, while achieving rapid charging, good capacitive retention, flexibility, and waterproofing. To address this challenge, low-cost materials are used including multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT), reduced graphene oxide (RGO), and metallic textiles to fabricate composite fabric electrodes, in which MWCNT and RGO are alternatively vacuum-filtrated directly onto Ni-coated cotton fabrics. The composite fabric electrodes display typical electrical double layer capacitor behavior, and reach an ultrahigh areal capacitance up to 6.2 F cm−2 at a high areal current density of 20 mA cm−2. All-solid-state fabric-type SC devices made with the composite fabric electrodes and water-repellent treatment can reach record-breaking performance of 2.7 F cm−2 at 20 mA cm−2 at the first charge–discharge cycle, 3.2 F cm−2 after 10 000 charge–discharge cycles, zero capacitive decay after 10 000 bending tests, and 10 h continuous underwater operation.

To assess the impact of irrigation over the California Central Valley (CCV) on the regional climate of the U.S. Southwest, simulations are run (for three dry and three wet years) both with and without the irrigation scheme. Incorporation of the irrigation scheme resulted in simulated surface air temperature and humidity that were closer to observations, decreased depth of the planetary boundary layer over the CCV, and increased convective available potential energy. The result was an overall increase in precipitation over the Sierra Nevada range and the Colorado River basin during the summer. Water vapor rising from the irrigated region mainly moved northeastward and contributed to precipitation in Nevada and Idaho. Specifically, the results indicate increased precipitation on the windward side of the Sierra Nevada and over the Colorado River basin.

In this study, the use of biochar as a soil amendment is examined in order to assess the feasibility and effectiveness for enhanced CH4 removal in landfill covers when incorporated under high compaction conditions and relatively low soil moisture. Four different cover configurations were tested in large soil columns for ∼510 days and potential CH4 oxidation rates were determined following long-term incubation in small batch assays. Cover designs tested include: a thin biochar layer at 15–18 cm; 2% mixed soil-biochar layer at 20–40 cm; 2% mixed soil-uncharred wood pellets at 20–40 cm; and soil obtained from intermediate cover at an active landfill site. The placement of a thin biochar layer in the cover significantly impacted moisture distribution and infiltration, which in turn affected CH4 oxidation potential with depth. An increase in CH4 removal rates was observed among all columns over the 500 day incubation period, with steady-state CH4 removal efficiencies ranging from ∼60 to 90% in the final stages of incubation (inlet load ∼80 g CH4 m−2 d−1). The thin biochar layer had the lowest average removal efficiency as a result of reduced moisture availability below the biochar layer. The addition of 2% biochar to soil yielded similar CH4 oxidation rates in terminal assays as the 2% uncharred wood pellet amendment. CH4 oxidation rates in terminal assays were positively correlated with soil moisture, which was affected by the materials’ water holding capacity. The high water holding capacity of biochar led to higher oxidation rates within the thin biochar layer, supporting the initial hypothesis that biochar may confer more favorable physical conditions for methanotrophy. Ultimate performance was apparently affected by soil type and CH4 exposure history, with the highest oxidation rates observed in the unamended field soil with higher initial methanotrophic activity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biocovers; Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Landfill gas emissions; Methanotrophy","biochar; methane; soil organic matter; unclassified drug; soil; charcoal; climate change; emission; feasibility study; global climate; greenhouse gas; laboratory method; landfill; methane; methanotrophy; microbial activity; oxidation; pollutant removal; soil amendment; soil type; wood; Article; carbon footprint; feasibility study; global climate; landfill; microbial activity; oxidation; physical chemistry; soil amendment; soil analysis; soil moisture; microbiology; oxidation reduction reaction; soil; waste disposal; waste disposal facility; wood; Methane; Oxidation-Reduction; Refuse Disposal; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Waste Disposal Facilities; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011878117

This article focuses on the equality of China's national carbon allowance allocations for provincial economic development while taking into account the uncertainties in provincial economic output and business-as-usual carbon emission. The allocation equality assessment under an uncertainty model was developed based on the Gini coefficient of accumulated carbon emission per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) and Monte Carlo simulations. It was used to compare the equity and related provincial carbon abatement burdens between the grandfathering allocations under an absolute cap and the output-based benchmarking allocations under a relative cap. The results showed that the volatilities of national carbon abatement and accumulated carbon emission per unit of GDP were more stable under the relative cap. The benchmarking mechanism resulted in a more equitable allowance allocations for provincial economic development and mitigated shocks in provincial output volatility to the equity of national overall allowance allocations. This mechanism was expected to produce a more evenly distributed carbon abatement burden-sharing across provinces, and to reduce the uncertainties of provincial carbon abatements. The benchmarking mechanism is thus proposed as an appropriate choice for China's current equitable provincial carbon allowance allocations. Policy relevance The trade-off between economic development and carbon emission reduction is the most controversial issue in climate change negotiations. The uncertainties in economic outputs and carbon emission also pose great challenges. With the obvious imbalance and uncertainty in provincial developments, the equitable allocation of carbon allowances among provinces is the key for China to develop a national carbon emission trading scheme. The comparison of allocation mechanisms under uncertainty provides more practical suggestions for policy making in China. Benchmarking results in more equitable allowance allocation and yields more even and stable abatement burden-sharing across provinces.

In order to determine the equilibrium combustion products involving 10 species, a solving scheme which can be used for different fuel blends consisting of CnHm and CαHβOγ generic structures was developed. The constituted solving scheme was then applied for four different mixtures which were diesel, 20 and 50 % biodiesel additions (by volume), and 100% biodiesel. The change in mole fraction of the fuels and their blends was determined as a function of temperature, pressure and equivalence ratio. Besides, mass-based combustion product rates of CO2, CO and NO for a unity of fuel mass were also investigated for different temperatures and equivalence ratios. The results show that the addition of biodiesel to diesel fuel does not have any significant effect on the change in the mole fraction of the combustion products. However, the addition of biodiesel reduces slightly the formation of CO and NO, while CO2 shows a slightly increasing trend. In terms of mass-based combustion product rates, the biodiesel addition reduces the amount of CO2, CO and NO products because it increases the molecular weight of the fuel blends. © Universiti Malaysia Pahang Publishing.","Biodiesel; Chemical equilibrium; Combustion model; Diesel",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038609177

Compared to other pollutant emissions from the coal-fired power plant, CO2 reached up to 99.28%. Therefore, the control of CO2 emission from the coal-fired power plants was very important. Based on the BP neural network, the amount of CO2 emission from the generation side of coal-fired power plants was calculated via carbon balance method. The results showed that unit capacity, coal quality and unit operation load had great influence on the CO2 emission from coal-fired power plants in Guangdong Province. The use of high volatile and high heat value of coal also can reduce the CO2 emissions.

Plants may further accelerate defence deployment by ‘priming’ appropriate defences in response to environmental cues that reliably predict impending attack. However, the population- and community-level ecological consequences of such priming remain relatively unexplored. We recently discovered that the volatile emissions of male Eurosta solidaginis prime the antiherbivore defences of its host plant, tall goldenrod (Solidago altissima). This co-evolved system provides a unique opportunity to study the ecological consequences of priming in a natural system. We explored effects of the priming cue on neighbouring ramets at varying distances from the emission source by quantifying subsequent levels of foliar herbivory, as well as plant growth and flower production (which might reveal trade-offs between investment in growth or reproduction and defence). We observed a linear increase in leaf damage with distance from the emission source (up to our maximal distance of 1 m), consistent with the hypothesis that the intensity of priming corresponds to the intensity of exposure to the fly emission. Unexpectedly, ramets nearest the emission source also exhibited a short-term increase in growth-rate; however, this effect did not persist to the end of the season or increase flower production. Instead, ramet's mid-distance from the emission source exhibited reduced growth and flower production compared to those nearer or farther away. Synthesis. The responsiveness of Solidago altissima ramets to herbivore-associated cues across a distance of 1 m or more is highly relevant in this system, where individual ramets frequently grow within a few cm of one another. Furthermore, the resulting mosaic of ramets primed to varying degrees might influence herbivore (and consequently predator) distributions. The unexpected decline in flower production by mid-distance ramets suggests that the effects of plant priming on ecological interactions among plants and other organisms (such as tritrophic interactions and competition) may feed back onto plant fitness in complex, and as yet unexplored, ways.

The US$35 billion in subsidies provided by countries every year to the fishing sector leads to more and more boats being built, even as 90% of fish stocks are either fully exploited or overfished. An estimated US$444 billion in subsidies are provided annually for the production of fossil fuels by G20 countries, even as evidence emerges that oil, gas and coal reserves must remain unexploited to limit global warming increases to 2 °C. Of course, each country has its own development priorities, livelihood concerns and need for food and energy security. Agreeing upon subsidy reform is a complex undertaking that requires the assessment of social, political and historical considerations, as well as the involvement of international and transnational legal regimes that govern climate change, energy, fisheries and trade. This article reviews proposals for reform within the World Trade Organization and regional trade agreements, including the new disciplines on fisheries subsidies that were endorsed in the text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Although the latter agreement is unlikely to enter into force, consensus is emerging on the need to prohibit subsidies that contribute to overfishing or that are linked to illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing. The article shows how these legal developments might inform attempts to limit fossil fuel production and consumption subsidies. It highlights the need for learning and open deliberation about subsidy reform by affected stakeholders, including representatives from international organizations and civil society. It also points to new arrangements that link compliance with subsidy rules to standards and benchmarks from fisheries regimes, and demonstrates how such inter-regime connections are legitimate in the context of the fragmentation of international law. While reform to fisheries subsidies is still preliminary and fraught, there are useful lessons for the equally important project of energy transitions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Climate change; Energy transitions; Fisheries subsidies; Fossil fuel subsidies; Fragmentation; Trans-Pacific Partnership; World Trade Organization","benchmarking; climate change; compliance; energy planning; fishery management; fishery production; fishery regulation; fossil fuel; fragmentation; fuel consumption; global warming; international cooperation; project management; stakeholder; stock assessment; subsidy system; trade relations; World Trade Organization; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016036780

Quantitative researchon region ecological compensation was undertaken by establishing the ecological compensationcoefficient and ecological compensation model based on the carbon-neutral principal. The resultsshowed that there were significant differences in carbon sources and carbon sequestration in thedifferent cities. Out of all the cities investigated, Changsha had the highest carbon emissions andHuaihua had the largest carbon sequestration. In terms of per capita, Xiangtan had the highestcarbon emissions and Zhangjiajie had the largest carbon sequestration. Through the quantification ofcarbon compensation in the cities of Hunan, we found that Changsha, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan, Hengyang,Yueyang, and Loudi were in a state of ecological deficit, and should pay an amount of ecologicalcompensation, respectively. Meanwhile, the other eight cities (Shaoyang, Changde, Zhangjiajie,Yiyang, Chenzhou, Yongzhou, Huaihua, and Xiangxi) were in a state of ecological surplus; they couldreceive some ecological compensation, respectively.

This paper aims to offer a method for evaluating the emissions from yard tractors during loading. First, an assignment model of export containers is built to capture the behavior of tractor arrivals at each block when the loading begins and the queuing theory is used to model the congestion happening in the yard. Second, emissions from yard tractors are evaluated based on the forecast arrivals. The emissions are categorized into two types: one from those tractors which are moving at normal speed and the other from those tractors sitting in traffic jam or at the stop-and-go state. Terminals with different calls and diversified storage utilization are simulated to show the performance of the proposed method and identify potential measures for traffic management aiming to reduce transport emissions. It is shown that the emissions from the yard tractors are closely related to the location of export containers and should be a main concern in operating a busy terminal. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Emissions; Export container; Green port; Queuing theory; Yard tractor","Carbon dioxide; Containers; Particulate emissions; Port terminals; Queueing theory; Railroad yards and terminals; Stress analysis; Tractors (truck); Traffic congestion; Waterway transportation; Container terminal; Export containers; Green ports; Maritime transportation; Queuing theory; Storage utilization; Transport emissions; Yard tractors; Loading; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; container terminal; emission control; port; traffic emission; traffic management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017156010

Box 5003, Aas, 1432, Norway","Chronically elevated nitrogen (N) deposition has led to severe nutrient imbalance in forest soils. Particularly in tropical and subtropical forest ecosystems, increasing N loading has aggravated phosphorus (P) limitation of biomass production, and has resulted in elevated emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and reduced uptake of methane (CH4), both of which are important greenhouse gases. Yet, the interactions of N and P and their effects on greenhouse gas emissions remain elusive. Here, we report N2O and CH4 emissions together with soil N and P data for a period of 18 months following a single P addition (79 kg P ha-1, as NaH2PO4 powder) to an N-saturated, Masson pine-dominated forest soil at TieShanPing (TSP), Chongqing, south-western (SW) China. We observed a significant decline in both nitrate (NO3-) concentrations in soil water (5 and 20 cm depths) and in soil N2O emissions, following P application. We hypothesise that enhanced N uptake by plants in response to P addition, resulted in less available NO3- for denitrification. By contrast to most other forest ecosystems, TSP is a net source of CH4. P addition significantly decreased CH4 emissions and turned the soil from a net source into a net sink. Based on our observation and previous studies in South America and China, we believe that P addition relieves N inhibition of CH4 oxidation. Within the 1.5 years after P addition, no significant increase of forest growth was observed and P stimulation of forest N uptake by understorey vegetation remains to be confirmed. Our study indicates that P fertilisation of N-saturated, subtropical forest soils may mitigate N2O and CH4 emissions, in addition to alleviating nutrient imbalances and reducing losses of N through NO3- leaching. © Author(s) 2017.",,"biomass; coniferous tree; denitrification; forest ecosystem; forest soil; greenhouse gas; growth rate; leaching; methane; nitrous oxide; phosphorus; soil emission; soil nutrient; soil water; subtropical region; understory; China; Chongqing; Hubei; South America; Tieshan [Hubei]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021355873

However, little is known regarding EET at HS adlayers that are bound or complexed to the surface of natural solids. Here, we investigated EET process on seven types of HS adlayers by forming electroactive biofilms (EABs) and monitoring the biocurrent generation. The HS immobilized surfaces were carried out by firstly modifying glassy carbon surfaces via electrochemical reduction of aryl diazonium salts to create amino-functionalized surfaces, and then various HSs were covalently bonded to these amino groups via linkage molecules. The results showed that the HS adlayers formed from Leonardite, Elliott Soil and Pahokee Peat humic acids (HAs) facilitated EET by forming more active EABs, whereas the Suwannee River and Aldrich HAs, Suwannee River and Pahokee Peat fulvic acids (FAs) hindered EET. The EET positively correlated with electron accepting capacity and wettability of the HSs, and negatively correlated with the polarity of the HSs, and only weakly correlated with electron donating capacity and zeta potential of the HSs. Microscopic images showed that the thickness and viability of the biofilms varied based on the HS properties.

Moench, were investigated in four geographical sites of the Volga region and the Urals located in the forest-steppe and steppe zones. Variations of the studied parameters between geographical points depended both on the species and on the structural organization of the leaf. The highest level of variation was observed for leaf area and pigment content per unit leaf area, the size and the number of chloroplasts in the cell changed to a lesser extent. The leaf thickness, leaf area and mesophyll cell sizes mostly depended on the plant species. C. scabiosa had large leaves (40–50 cm2) with large thickness (280–290 μm) and large mesophyll cells (up to 15000 μm3). The leaves of H. arenarium and E. virgata were ten times smaller and characterized by 1.5 times smaller thickness and 2−3 times smaller cell size. Geographical location and climate of the region affected leaf density, proportion of partial tissue volume, and the ratio of the photosynthetic pigments. In the southern point of Volga region with the highest climate aridity, all studied species were characterized by maximum values of volumetric leaf density (LD), due to the high proportion of sclerenchyma and vascular bundles, and specificity of the mesophyll structure. With the decline in latitude, chlorophyll (Chl) and carotenoid (Car) contents in leaf area were reduced, the ratio Chl/Car was increased, and the ratio Chl a/b was declined. The reduction of the pigment content in the leaf in all species was associated with a reduction in the amount of Chl per chloroplast, and for C. scabiosa and H. arenarium it was associated also with the reduction of chloroplast amount in the leaf area. In turn, chloroplast number per leaf area and the total cell area (Ames/A) depended on the ratio of the number and size of mesophyll cells inherent to this plant species. At the same time, we found a similar mechanism of spatial organization of leaf restructuring for all studied species—decrease in Ames/A was accompanied by increasing in the proportion of intercellular air spaces in the leaf. It is concluded that variations in structural and functional parameters of the photosynthetic apparatus of steppe plants were associated with plant adaptation to climate features. General direction of the changes of leaf parameters of the studied species with aridity was the increase of LD and the decrease of pigment content per leaf area however the cellular mechanisms of changes in the pigment content and integral parameters of mesophyll were determined by the plant species properties. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","adaptation; carotenoids; cell parameters; chlorophyll; climate aridization; geographic latitude; intraspecific variations; mesophyll structure; partial tissue volumes; photosynthetic apparatus; steppe plants",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018338260

It is a challenge for the agricultural sector to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and maintain agricultural production. However, dual-level uncertainties exist in the processes of agricultural GHG accounting and emission reduction management. In this research, an integrated approach for identifying adaptation strategies in agricultural GHG emission reduction management was developed through incorporating life cycle analysis (LCA) of agricultural production into a general mathematical programming model. This approach strengthened the applicability of LCA and the comprehensiveness of programming models in generating agricultural adaptive actions under different GHG emission restriction targets. Also, dual-level uncertainties of LCA and adaptation management can be effectively addressed. A case study was proposed to illustrate application of the approach in Dalian City, China. The results indicated that farming patterns in eight districts would change significantly. The total area of maize fields would account for the primary proportion (i.e., 40–45 %) in its agricultural sector. Rice, peanut and cabbage fields would be the minor contributors in terms of GHG emissions. In addition to effective rainfall (i.e., [156, 259] mm/ha), a certain amount of water would be supplied for agricultural irrigation to maximize the city’s agricultural yields. Compared with other agricultural crops, rice fields would need the largest amount of irrigation water (i.e., [153.72, 277.98] Mt) to meet the requirements of local government plans. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Adaptation management; Agricultural production; GHG reduction; Life cycle analysis; Uncertainty","Agriculture; Crops; Emission control; Food supply; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Mathematical programming; Uncertainty analysis; Adaptation strategies; Agricultural irrigation; Agricultural productions; GHG reductions; Global warming impact; Life cycle analysis; Mathematical programming models; Uncertainty; Life cycle; adaptive management; agricultural production; carbon emission; emission control; global warming; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; numerical model; uncertainty analysis; China; Dalian; Liaoning; Arachis hypogaea; Brassica oleracea var. capitata; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962679394

This paper analyses the heterogeneity of motivations to adopt silvopastoral practices, a social-ecological innovation for soil conservation and carbon emission reduction. We use Q methodology to identify smallholders' views with regard to these practices in a community in the forest frontier in Chiapas (Mexico). The analysis uncovers three main perspectives: self-sufficient pioneers, environmentally-conscious followers and payment-dependent conservatives. We discuss these perspectives around three topics: smallholders' predisposition to adopt silvopastoral practices, their views about needing external payments to sustain their livelihood and the diffusion of innovative sustainable practices. We relate these perspectives with livelihood characteristics and with observed adoption levels under a pilot programme to promote silvopasture. Our findings suggest that incentives other than payments may be more appropriate for those more likely to adopt, and that payments could encourage rent-seeking strategies and not necessarily promote permanent behavioural change. We suggest ways for designing more effective and adaptive environmental conservation programmes to foster adoption and continuation of social-ecological innovations. © 2017, Elsevier",,"carbon emission; conservation planning; ecological economics; emission control; incentive; innovation; livelihood; smallholder; soil conservation; sustainable development; technology adoption; tropical forest; Chiapas; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012118990

In this study, we investigated the impact of this histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor on expression/activity of cytochrome P450 family 1 (CYP1) and on metabolism of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), in colon epithelial cells. Sodium butyrate (NaBt) strongly potentiated the BaP-induced expression of CYP1A1 in human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells. It also co-stimulated the 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity induced by the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a prototypical ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Up-regulation of CYP1A1 expression/activity corresponded with an enhanced metabolism of BaP and formation of covalent DNA adducts. NaBt significantly potentiated CYP1A1 induction and/or metabolic activation of BaP also in other human colon cell models, colon adenoma AA/C1 cells, colon carcinoma HT-29 cells, or in NCM460D cell line derived from normal colon mucosa. Our results suggest that the effects of NaBt were due to its impact on histone acetylation, because additional HDAC inhibitors (trichostatin A and suberanilohydroxamic acid) likewise increased both the induction of EROD activity and formation of covalent DNA adducts. NaBt-induced acetylation of histone H3 (at Lys14) and histone H4 (at Lys16), two histone modifications modulated during activation of CYP1A1 transcription, and it reduced binding of HDAC1 to the enhancer region of CYP1A1 gene. This in vitro study suggests that butyrate, through modulation of histone acetylation, may potentiate induction of CYP1A1 expression, which might in turn alter the metabolism of BaP within colon epithelial cells. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Butyrate; Colon epithelial cells; CYP1A1; DNA adducts; Histone deacetylases; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; benzo[a]pyrene; butyric acid; cytochrome P450 1A1; ethoxyresorufin deethylase; histone deacetylase 1; histone deacetylase inhibitor; histone H3; histone H4; suberanilohydroxamic acid; trichostatin A; unclassified drug; benzo[a]pyrene; beta catenin; butyric acid; CTNNB1 protein, human; CYP1A1 protein, human; cytochrome P450 1A1; HDAC1 protein, human; histone; histone deacetylase 1; histone deacetylase inhibitor; Article; cell metabolism; colon adenoma; colon carcinoma; colon epithelium; DNA adduct; drug protein binding; enhancer region; enzyme activity; genotoxicity; HCT 116 cell line; histone acetylation; histone modification; HT-29 cell line; human; human cell; human cell culture; in vitro study; metabolic activation; priority journal; protein expression; receptor upregulation; antagonists and inhibitors; colon; drug effects; drug inactivation; genetics; metabolism; Benzo(a)pyrene; beta Catenin; Butyric Acid; Colon; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; DNA Adducts; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; HCT116 Cells; Histone Deacetylase 1; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Histones; HT29 Cells; Humans; Inactivation, Metabolic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994460644

Engineers interested in contributing to the SDGs must be able to understand not only each goal in depth but also their integrated nature. This paper first emphasizes the importance of: (i) incorporating the SDGs in engineering education; (ii) making engineers aware of their contribution to the SDGs; and (iii) encouraging engineers to embrace a new systems-thinking mindset to address the SDGs in an integrated manner. The second part of this paper proposes an engineering analytical cross-impact analysis approach to quantify the interactions among the SDGs and organize and prioritize the goals that could most impact the others. Our analysis shows that focusing on SDGs 04 (Education), 06 (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene), 07 (Energy), 11 (Cities), but especially 12 (Consumption), 16 (Governance), and 17 (Partnerships), will influence the other goals and aid in their success. It was also found that focusing on eliminating poverty (SDG 01), counter-intuitively, worsens poverty, since it inhibits the other goals on which poverty depends on. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.","Cross impact; Cross-cutting; Engineering education; Epistemic network; Methodology; SDGs; Sustainable Development Goals; Systems thinking","Climate change; Engineers; Planning; Sanitation; Sustainable development; System theory; Cross impact; Cross-cutting; Methodology; SDGs; Systems thinking; Engineering education",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030571048

yet, it has never been quantified for the slow but persistent increase in leaf area index (LAI) observed over the past 30 years (Earth greening). Here we isolate the fingerprint of increasing LAI on surface air temperature using a coupled land-atmosphere global climate model prescribed with satellite LAI observations. We find that the global greening has slowed down the rise in global land-surface air temperature by 0.09 ± 0.02 °C since 1982. This net cooling effect is the sum of cooling from increased evapotranspiration (70%), changed atmospheric circulation (44%), decreased shortwave transmissivity (21%), and warming from increased longwave air emissivity (â 29%) and decreased albedo (â 6%). The global cooling originated from the regions where LAI has increased, including boreal Eurasia, Europe, India, northwest Amazonia, and the Sahel. Increasing LAI did not, however, significantly change surface air temperature in eastern North America and East Asia, where the effects of large-scale atmospheric circulation changes mask local vegetation feedbacks. Overall, the sum of biophysical feedbacks related to the greening of the Earth mitigated 12% of global land-surface warming for the past 30 years. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

However, the region experienced haze episodes on 3-14 December 2013. The authors performed simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) to examine the impacts of meteorological conditions, aerosol radiative feedbacks (ARFs; including aerosol direct and nearly first indirect effect), and internal and external emissions reduction scenarios on particulate matter smaller than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) concentrations. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time the WRF-Chem model has been used to study air quality in this region. The model reasonably reproduced the meteorological conditions and PM2.5 concentrations. The analysis demonstrated that the highest-PM2.5 event was associated with a cold surge that promoted the impingement of northern pollutants on the region, and PM2.5 concentrations were sensitive to the emissions from the Yangtze River delta (16.6%) and the North China Plain (12.1%). This suggests that efforts toward coastal air quality improvement require regional cooperation to reduce emissions. Noticeably, ARFs were unlikely to increase PM2.5 concentrations in the coastal region, which was in contrast to the case in northern China. ARFs induced strong clean wind anomalies in the coastal region and also lowered the inland planetary boundary layer, which enhanced the blocking of northern pollutants crossing the high terrain in the north of Fujian Province. This indicates that ARFs tend to weaken the haze intensity in the southeastern coastal region. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","Aerosols; Air quality; Coastal meteorology; Cold air surges; Dispersion; Radiative forcing","Aerosols; Air quality; Atmospheric radiation; Boundary layers; Coastal zones; Dispersion (waves); Emission control; Meteorology; Pollution; River pollution; Weather forecasting; Air quality improvement; Coastal meteorologies; Cold air; Meteorological condition; Planetary boundary layers; Radiative forcings; Regional cooperation; Weather research and forecasting models; Atmospheric movements; aerosol; aerosol composition; air quality; boundary layer; coastal zone; concentration (composition); emission control; emission inventory; haze; particulate matter; radiative forcing; China; Fujian",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019414127

Compared to a considerable number of studies on oligotrophic lakes and oceanic waters, little evidence for the importance of N deposition has been generated for eutrophic lakes, even though emphasis has been placed on reducing external N inputs to control eutrophication in these lakes. Our high-resolution observations of atmospheric depositions and riverine inputs of biologically reactive N species into eutrophic Lake Dianchi (the sixth largest freshwater lake in China) shed new light onto the contribution of N deposition to total N loads. Annual N deposition accounted for 15.7% to 16.6% of total N loads under variable precipitation conditions, 2-fold higher than previous estimates (7.6%) for the Lake Dianchi. The proportion of N deposition to total N loads further increased to 27-48% in May and June when toxic blooms of the ubiquitous non-N2 fixing cyanobacteria Microcystis spp. are initiated and proliferate. Our observations reveal that reduced N (59%) contributes a greater amount than oxidized N to total N deposition, reaching 56-83% from late spring to summer. Progress toward mitigating eutrophication in Lake Dianchi and other bloom-impacted eutrophic lakes will be difficult without reductions in ammonia emissions and subsequent N deposition. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Aquatic ecosystems; Budget control; Eutrophication; Meteorological problems; Nitrogen; River pollution; Ammonia emissions; Atmospheric depositions; Atmospheric nitrogen; Atmospheric nitrogen deposition; Fresh water lakes; High resolution observations; Oligotrophic lakes; Phytoplankton growth; Lakes; nitric acid; nitrogen; nitrogen dioxide; nitrous acid; nitrogen; algal bloom; ammonia; atmospheric deposition; cyanobacterium; eutrophic environment; eutrophication; freshwater environment; growth; lake water; nitrogen; nutrient budget; nutrient enrichment; phytoplankton; aquatic environment; Article; atmospheric deposition; chemical analysis; China; cyanobacterium; dry deposition; eutrophication; limit of detection; Microcystis; nitrogen deposition; precipitation; seasonal variation; surface area; urban area; water retention; watershed; wet deposition; eutrophication; lake; phytoplankton; China; Dianchi Lake; Yunnan; Cyanobacteria; Microcystis; China; Eutrophication; Lakes; Nitrogen; Phytoplankton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021670287

These dynamics are mainly driven by increasing inter-annual precipitation variability. However, how ecosystem carbon processes respond to changes in precipitation is not well understood, due to a lack of substantial experimental evidence that combines increased and decreased precipitation treatments. This study, a 3-year field manipulation experiment with five precipitation levels conducted in a semi-arid steppe, examined the impacts of increased and decreased precipitation on ecosystem CO2 (GEP: gross ecosystem photosynthesis; ER: ecosystem respiration; NEE: net ecosystem CO2 exchange), water exchange (ET: evapotranspiration), and resource use efficiency (CUE: carbon use efficiency; WUE: water use efficiency). We found that decreased precipitation reduced ecosystem CO2, water exchange and resource use efficiency significantly, while increased precipitation did not cause significant influence on them. That is, they responded more sensitively to decreased precipitation. Soil water availability was the most important driver determining changes in GEP, ER and ET. Changes in NEE, CUE and WUE were predominately regulated by soil temperature. Photosynthesis at leaf and ecosystem levels showed significantly greater sensitivity to changed precipitation than respiration and ET, and therefore determined the trends of net carbon uptake and resource use efficiency. This study highlighted an asymmetric response of ecosystem carbon and water processes to altered precipitation. This is potentially important for improving our understanding of how possible future changes in precipitation will affect the carbon cycle. Taking this asymmetric response into consideration will inevitably reduce uncertainties in predicting the dynamics of the global carbon cycle.

The characteristics of carbon emissions in Shandong province are presented during 2005–2014, and this paper explores the spatial autocorrelation of carbon emissions branches in 17 cities. The results show that the total amount of carbon emissions in Shandong province presented a steady growth, whereas the growth rate was low, and the proportion of coal consumption in energy structure was significantly higher than the national average. In addition, the spatial pattern of the carbon emissions in 17 cities presented obvious regionally distinction. Furthermore, the affecting factors governing carbon emissions are decomposed based on the Kaya identity. The results reveal that economic scale was the key factor to increase the carbon emissions, whereas energy efficiency was the main factor of carbon emissions reduction. Therefore, this paper draws government should promote carbon emissions reduction given priority to some regions virtually, while encouraging emission reduction in others. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Carbon emissions; Influencing factors; Spatial autocorrelation; Temporal and spatial differentiation","autocorrelation; carbon emission; economy of scale; emission control; energy efficiency; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Shandong; Torreya nucifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015639759

Here, we examined the relationship between extreme ozone and PM2.5 (particular matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm) events and the representative meteorological parameters such as daily maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum relative humidity (RHmin), and minimum wind speed (Vmin), using the location-specific 95th or 5th percentile threshold derived from historical reanalysis data (30 years for ozone and 10 years for PM2.5). We found that ozone and PM2.5 extremes were decreasing over the years, reflecting EPA's tightened standards and effort on reducing the corresponding precursor's emissions. Annual ozone and PM2.5 extreme days were highly correlated with Tmax and RHmin, especially in the eastern U.S. They were positively (negatively) correlated with Vmin in urban (rural and suburban) stations. The overlapping ratios of ozone extreme days with Tmax were fairly constant, about 32%, and tended to be high in fall and low in winter. Ozone extreme days were most sensitive to Tmax, then RHmin, and least sensitive to Vmin. The majority of ozone extremes occurred when Tmax was between 300 K and 320 K, RHmin was less than 40%, and Vmin was less than 3 m/s. The number of annual extreme PM2.5 days was highly positively correlated with the extreme RHmin/Tmax days, with correlation coefficient between PM2.5/RHmin highest in urban and suburban regions and the correlation coefficient between PM2.5/Tmax highest in rural area. Tmax has more impact on PM2.5 extreme over the eastern U.S. Extreme PM2.5 days were more likely to occur at low RH conditions in the central and southeastern U.S., especially during spring time, and at high RH conditions in the northern U.S. and the Great Plains. Most extreme PM2.5 events occurred when Tmax was between 300 K and 320 K and RHmin was between 10% and 50%. Extreme PM2.5 days usually occurred when Vmin was under 2 m/s. However, during spring season in the Southeast and fall season in Northwest, high winds were found to accompany extreme PM2.5 days, likely reflecting the impact of fire emissions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Extreme weather events; Ozone; PM2.5","Air pollution; Environmental Protection Agency; Ozone; Rural areas; Weather information services; Wind; Aerodynamic diameters; Correlation coefficient; Environmental factors; Extreme weather events; Maximum temperature; Meteorological parameters; Overlapping ratio; PM2.5; Air quality; aerodynamics; air quality; atmospheric pollution; extreme event; ozone; particulate matter; quantitative analysis; relative humidity; seasonal variation; wind velocity; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010369554

Studying soil organic carbon (SOC) change in the upland phaeozem of Northeast China under different tillage modes has great theoretical and practical significance for reducing greenhouse gases emissions, increasing soil carbon stocks, and ensuring food security. This study applied the DAYCENT model to simulate six long-term experimental sites in the phaeozem region, and through calibration and validation analysis, it concluded that the DAYCENT model could effectively simulate the dynamic change of SOC in the upland phaeozems; hence, the relevant parameters of each site were determined. Under future climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, RCP 4.5), SOC change in agricultural soils (0-20 cm topsoil) of four different management scenarios (fertilizer application, manure amendment, straw return, no-tillage) was simulated. The overall simulated trend was no-tillage > straw return > manure amendment > fertilizer application. Fertilizer had no evident effect on increasing SOC, but the effect would be better if combined with manure; both straw return and no-tillage had the general effect of improving SOC and the simulated values rose rapidly with a large increasing rate within a short period; however, the increasing rate became gentle after 2050, reached a relatively stable level after 2080, then gradually reached carbon saturation. Untill 2100, the SOC content of each site reached a relatively higher level by adopting the no-tillage treatment, where the SOC contents of Harbin, Hailun, Nehe, Dehui, Gongzhuling and Lishu were 2.36 g/100 g, 2.81 g/100 g, 2.22 g/100 g, 2.38 g/100 g, 1.97 g/100 g and 2.01 g/100 g, respectively. The SOC contents increased by 52.47% when compared with the initial value, and the simulated average annual increase of SOC for 84 years was 0.0082 g/100 g. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate scenario RCP4.5; No-tillage; Phaeozem; Soil organic carbon (SOC)","agricultural soil; fertilizer application; future prospect; long-term change; management practice; model test; organic carbon; Phaeozem; scenario analysis; soil carbon; zero tillage; China; Dehui; Gongzhuling; Hailun; Harbin; Heilongjiang; Heilongjiang; Jilin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021665791

Examining the adaptive potential of irrigated area expansion under climate change is therefore critical. Here, we assess the effects of irrigated area expansion on crop yields based on county-level data during 1980-2011 in northern China and estimate climate impacts under irrigated area scenarios in the 2030s. Based on regression analysis, there is a statistically significant effect of irrigated area expansion on reducing negative climate impacts. More irrigated areas indicate less heat and drought impacts. Irrigated area expansion will alleviate yield reduction by 0.7-0.8% in the future but associated yield benefits will still not compensate for greater adverse climate impacts. Yields are estimated to decrease by 4.0-6.5% under future climate conditions when an additional 4.4% of irrigated area is established, and no fundamental yield increase with an even further 10% or 15% expansion of irrigated area is predicted. This finding suggests that expected adverse climate change risks in the 2030s cannot be mitigated by expanding irrigated areas. A combination of this and other adaptation programs is needed to guarantee grain production under more serious drought stresses in the future. © 2017 by the authors.","Adaptation; Climate; Drought; Irrigated area; SPEI","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; drought; governance approach; irrigation system; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; yield response; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019624172

In some cities located along waterfronts, multimodal transportation that includes ferry trips plays an important role in public transportation. Compared with roadway traffic, ferry service can often provide shorter routes between given origins and destinations as well as reduce emissions. However, in some areas with high ferry demand, travel delay occurs frequently because of traffic congestion caused by drivers waiting to board the ferry, which can significantly increase travel time and decrease its reliability. In addition, changes in other factors, such as fuel prices, also may influence drivers’ decision making processes in terms of route choice. In this paper, a study focusing on travel time and travel time reliability of ferry service during peak travel periods is performed. Furthermore, as a key result an emission loss model under multimodal conditions is developed that also takes travel cost into account. The analysis of route choice is conducted based on a mixed logit model which is able to handle individual preference. Based upon validation with data from the Seattle area, the proposed model is verified as an efficient way to analyse emission factors in a multimodal transportation environment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Emission; Ferry traffic; Multimodal transportation; Route choice; Travel time reliability","Decision making; Mass transportation; Modal analysis; Multimodal transportation; Neutron emission; Reliability; Transportation routes; Travel time; Urban growth; Decision making process; Environmental problems; Individual preference; Mixed logit models; Public transportation; Route choice; Traffic conditions; Travel time reliability; Traffic congestion; emission; maritime transportation; reliability analysis; traffic congestion; travel behavior; travel time; Seattle; United States; Washington [United States]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014935368

The industrial sector plays a significant role in China's economic growth and CO2 emissions. This is the first study to present a specific investigation on the retrospective decomposition (1993–2014) and prospective trajectories (2015–2035) of China's industrial CO2 emission intensity (ICEI) and industrial CO2 emissions (ICE), aiming at China Industrial Green Development Plan 2016–2020 targets and China's 2030 CO2 emission-reduction targets. We introduce process carbon intensity, investment and R&amp;D factors into the decomposition model and make a combination of dynamic Monte Carlo simulation and scenario analysis to identify whether and how the targets would be realized from a sector-specific perspective. The results indicate that investment intensity is the primary driver for the increase in ICEI, while R&amp;D intensity and energy intensity are the leading contributors to the reduction in ICEI. Under existing policies, it is very possible for the industrial sector to achieve the 2020 and 2030 intensity-reduction targets. However, the realization of 2030 emission-peak target has some uncertainties and needs extra efforts in efficiency improvement and structural adjustment. All the five scenarios would achieve the 2020 and 2030 intensity-reduction targets, except Scenario N4 for China Industrial Green Development Plan 2016–2020 target. Nonetheless, only three scenarios would realize the 2030 emission-peak target. With strong efficiency improvement and structural adjustment, ICE would hit the peak in 2025. In contrast, with high/low efficiency improvement and weak structural adjustment, ICE would fail to reach the peak before 2035.

A major challenge to empirically answering this question is the fact that the choices of residential location and travel mode are jointly made by households. The unique context of urban housing in Beijing provides us a natural experiment to separate residential location and travel choices of households living in the resettlement and reformed housing units. We take advantage of the largely exogenous residential locations of those living in the resettlement and reformed housing in Beijing and use the Heckman two-step method to correct a potential bias in estimating vehicle fuel consumption. To identify the heterogeneous effects of different subway stations, we use the travel time to city center by subway to proxy a subway station's value to users. We find robust evidence supporting that subway proximity reduces a household's probability of owning a car and subsequent fuel consumption. More valuable subway stations discourage nearby households’ car ownership rate by a greater extent.

While many studies have used satellite data to examine the trends in aerosol optical depth (AOD), very few have investigated the trends in aerosol properties associated with particle size, morphology, and light absorption. In this study, we investigate decadal-scale (13-15 year) trends in aerosol loading and properties during 2001-2015 over three populous regions: the Eastern United States (EUS), Western Europe (WEU), and Eastern and Central China (ECC). We use observations from MISR (Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer) and MODIS (Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). Relationships between aerosol property trends and air pollutant emission changes are examined. We find that annual mean AOD shows pronounced decreasing trends over EUS and WEU regions, as a result of considerable emission reductions in all major pollutants except for mineral dust and ammonia (NH3). Over the ECC region, AOD increases before 2006 due to emission increases induced by rapid economic development, fluctuates between 2006 and 2011, and subsequently decreases after 2011 in conjunction with effective emission reduction in anthropogenic primary aerosols, sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). The fraction of small-size AOD (&lt;0.7 μm diameter), Ångstrom exponent and single-scattering albedo have generally decreased, while the fractions of large-size (&gt;1.4 μm diameter), nonspherical and absorbing AOD have generally shown increasing trends over EUS and WEU regions, indicating that fine and light-scattering aerosol constituents have been more effectively reduced than coarse and light-absorbing constituents. These trends are consistent with the larger reduction ratios in SO2 and NOx emissions than in primary aerosols, including mineral dust and black carbon (BC). Over the ECC region, no significant trends are observed with respect to size distribution, morphology, or light absorption, which we attribute to a simultaneous increase in emissions of SO2, NOx, and primary aerosols including BC before 2006, and a simultaneous decrease after 2011. This study demonstrates the importance and usefulness of satellite-borne sensors, particularly MISR, in association with evaluating the effectiveness of air pollution control policies. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","aerosol; AOD; emissions; particle property; satellite","Aerosols; Air pollution control; Atmospheric aerosols; Carbon; Dust; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Emission control; Image reconstruction; Light absorption; Light scattering; Nitrogen oxides; Particle size; Particulate emissions; Pollution; Pollution control; Pollution induced corrosion; Radiometers; Reduction; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Spectrometers; Sulfur dioxide; Aerosol optical depths; Air pollutant emission; Airborne particulate; Economic development; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Multiangle imaging spectroradiometer; Particle properties; Single scattering albedo; Air pollution; aerosol; aerosol property; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; economic development; emission control; MODIS; nitrogen oxides; optical depth; particle size; particulate matter; pollution policy; satellite data; satellite sensor; trend analysis; China; United States; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019615522

At present, the system is the longest in the world, and its daily passenger volume exceeds 9 × 106 travelers every work day. In this study, we comprehensively assessed the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in the 14 lines of Shanghai's metro system through field measurements in the metro (subway) system and real-time data acquisition at the nearest state-run air sampling sites. We ranked and clustered the 14 lines according to the PM2.5 concentrations and the relative concentrations in the halls and on the platform of the metro station and inside the train for each line. We identified the factors that influence the PM2.5 concentration, and found that the external environment appears to have the strongest influence on air quality. In addition, the age of the line, type of platform (screen door versus half-height security door), air-conditioning filtration system, and other factors influenced the PM2.5 concentration for each line.

Here, we explore how tree litter inputs interact with understory plant management to influence belowground processes in a managed forest plantation. Methods: We conducted a two-factor nested experimental manipulation of pine litter and understory vegetation in a nutrient-poor Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica plantation. Three levels of tree litter manipulation (ambient litter, litter removal and litter addition) were nested in two levels of understory manipulation (understory intact and understory removal). After two years of manipulation, mineral soils were analyzed for total and extractable C, N and P concentrations, N mineralization, enzyme activities, as well as the microbial community structure (as indicated by phospholipid fatty acids). Results: Litter removal had little impact on C and nutrient cycling as well as microbial biomass and community structure in this low nutrient pine plantation; however, litter addition and the removal of the understory vegetation had large impacts on these processes. Litter addition elevated soil microbial biomass, acid phosphatase and β-1, 4-glucosidase activities, by a much greater degree when the understory vegetation was intact than when the understory was removed. Litter addition also reduced soil available P by 39% when the understory vegetation was intact, and reduced soil available P by 74% and NO3 −–N by 45% when the understory was removed. Litter addition significantly reduced the ratio of Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria as well as the ratio between PLFA markers cy17:0 and 16:1ω7. Understory removal reduced the ratio of PLFA markers cy17:0 to 16:1ω7. Conclusions: Our study results show that, in this managed pine plantation, soil microbial community structure and function were more sensitive to an increase rather than to a decrease in pine litter inputs. Further, we found that the presence of understory vegetation can increase soil microbial biomass and alleviate the reduction in available N and P concentrations induced by pine litter addition. Thus, preservation of the understory vegetation is an effective way to maintain the functional stability of managed forests on nutrient-poor soils. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Litter; Nutrient availability; Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica; Soil microbial community; Understory vegetation","asymmetry; community structure; coniferous forest; ecosystem function; litter; microbial community; nutrient availability; soil microorganism; understory; Negibacteria; Pinus sylvestris; Posibacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996774938

Since diesel powers are one of the major sources of energy for mobile underground mining equipment, the adverse health effects of DPM are of a great concern. This paper used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method to study the effect of entry inclination on DPM plume distribution in a dead end entry. An upward mining face and a downward mining face were built with a truck and a loader in loading operation close to the face area. A species transport model with incorporated buoyancy effect was used to examine the DPM dispersion pattern for the above steady-state scenarios. High DPM and temperature regions were identified for the two different faces. The model was used to assess the role of auxiliary ventilation in reducing DPM exposures of underground miners working in those entries. In this study, it is suggested to provide local ventilation at least three times of the diesel exhaust rate to be able to lower the average DPM level for the mining upward face. The requirement for local ventilation is much less for the mining downward face. This can provide guidelines for good working practices and selection of diesel emission reduction technologies underground. © 2017","Computational fluid dynamics; Diesel particulate matter; Entry inclination; Ventilation","Buoyancy; Computational fluid dynamics; Dispersions; Emission control; Fluid dynamics; Metal drawing; Mining equipment; Underground equipment; Ventilation; Ventilation exhausts; Adverse health effects; Auxiliary ventilation; Computational fluid dynamics methods; Diesel particulate matters; Dispersion patterns; Entry inclination; Species transport models; Underground mining equipment; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017162247

To figure out the environmental changes of a coastal lagoon and its contribution to carbon burial, two sediment cores were collected in Xincun Lagoon, southeastern Hainan Island and 210Pb activities, grain size parameters, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total inorganic carbon (TIC) and stable carbon isotopes (δ13C) were measured. The results show that in 1770–1815, the decreasing water exchange capacity with outer open water, probably caused by the shifting and narrowing of the tidal inlet, not only diminished the currents and fined the sediments in the lagoon, but also reduced the organic matter of marine sources. From 1815 to 1950, the sedimentary environment of Xincun Lagoon was frequently influenced by storm events. These extreme events resulted in the high fluctuation of sediment grain size and sorting, as well as the great variation in contributions of terrestrial (higher plants, soils) and marine sources (phytoplankton, algae, seagrass). The extremely high content of TIC, compared to TOC before 1950 could be attributed to the large-scale coverage of coral reefs. However, with the boost of seawater aquaculture activities after 1970, the health growth of coral species was severely threatened, and corresponding production and inorganic carbon burial flux reduced. The apparent enhanced inorganic carbon burial rate after 1990 might result from the concomitant carbonate debris produced by seawater aquaculture. This result is important for local government long-term coastal management and environmental planning. © 2017, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agricultural Ecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","carbon burial flux; coastal lagoon; coral reef; environmental change; human activity; organic matter; southeastern Hainan Island","aquaculture; carbon isotope; catchment; coastal lagoon; coral reef; environmental change; human activity; local government; reconstruction; seawater; China; Hainan; Xincun Bay; algae; Anthozoa; Embryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018833668

Compared with the same period in the previous three years (2012–2014), the tropospheric vertical column densities of NO2 and SO2 in 2015 were significantly reduced in Beijing and its surroundings. During the WCP, aerosol optical depth was reduced most significantly in Beijing, while NO2 and SO2 were reduced most significantly in Hebei and Tianjin, respectively. The meteorological conditions were also favorable during this period. During the WCP, the North China Plain was located under high pressure from the north of China. A southward pressure gradient force and weak northerly and northeasterly winds blocked the transport of pollution from southern and western parts of the industrial area (Hebei, Shanxi and Shandong provinces). Cold air masses pushed southwards weakly. These conditions were beneficial to the removal of air pollutants in Beijing. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

To develop and adopt sustainable management practices, it is essential to better understand and quantify the impacts of management practices on plant phenology and carbon fluxes. In this study, we combined multiple data sources, including in-situ PhenoCam digital images, eddy covariance data, and satellite data (Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) to examine the impacts of burning, baling, and grazing on canopy dynamics, plant phenology, and carbon fluxes in a pasture in El Reno, Oklahoma in 2014. Landsat images were used to assess the baling area and the trajectory of vegetation recovery. MODIS vegetation indices (VIs) were used in the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) to estimate gross primary production (GPPVPM) at a MODIS pixel for the flux tower (baled) site. For comparison between baled and unbaled conditions, we used MODIS VIs for a neighbor MODIS pixel (unbaled) and ran VPM. Daily PhenoCam images and green chromatic coordinate (GCC) tracked canopy dynamics and plant phenology well. The grassland greened up immediately after burning in April. GCC values showed two peaks with the similar magnitude because of quick recovery of grassland after baling. Satellite-derived VIs and GPPVPM showed that the pasture recovered in one month after baling. The GPPVPM matched well (R2 = 0.89) with the eddy covariance-derived GPP (GPPEC). Grazing in the late growing season did not influence plant phenology (VIs and GCC) and carbon uptake (GPP) as plants were in the late growing stage. Neither did it affect GPP differently in those two conditions because of even grazing intensity. The reduction in GPP after baling was compensated by higher GPP after large rain events in late July and early September, causing little seasonal differences in GPP (-0.002 g C m−2 day−1) between the baled and unbaled conditions. Interactions of different management practices with climate make it complicated to understand the impacts of different management practices on carbon dynamics and plant phenology. Thus, it is necessary to further investigate the responses of pastures to different management practices under different climate regimes at multiple temporal and spatial scales. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Eddy covariance (EC); Green chromatic coordinate (GCC); Gross primary production (GPP); PhenoCam images; Plant phenology; Vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM)","carbon cycle; coordinate; eddy covariance; grass; grazing management; growing season; Landsat; MODIS; pasture; photosynthesis; pixel; primary production; satellite data; satellite imagery; sustainable development; Oklahoma [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012044122

A price on carbon is expected to generate demand for carbon offsets. In a market-based framework, the carbon price should be high enough to compensate for opportunity costs. We studied a highly-modified agricultural system in the Guanzhong- Tianshui economic region of China that is typical of many temperate agricultural zones in western China. We quantified the economic returns from agriculture and from carbon plantings (both monoculture and ecological plantings) under five carbon-price scenarios. The mean carbon sequestration is 34 Mg·hm-2·a-1, and the average annual payment increased to 1146 CNY·hm-2 at a medium carbon price of 50 CNY·Mg-1 CO2-e. Thus, areas of high priority for conservation and restoration may be restored relatively cheaply in the presence of a carbon market. Overall, however, less carbon is sequestered by ecological plantings (i.e., mixed native trees and shrubs) compared to agriculture. © The Author(s) 2017.","Carbon sequestration; Carbon-price; Economic returns; Guanzhong-Tianshui economic region; Net present value",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034776736

Here, a one-step thermal processing approach is reported for the efficient production of high performance perovskite HFs, with precise control over their cation stoichiometry. In contrast to traditional production methods, this approach directly uses earth-abundant raw chemicals in a single thermal process. This approach can control cation stoichiometry by avoiding interactions between the perovskites and polar solvents/nonsolvents, optimizes sintering, and results in high performance HFs. Furthermore, this method saves much time and energy (≈ 50%), therefore pollutant emissions are greatly reduced. One successful example is Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ HFs, which are used in an oxygen-permeable membrane. This exhibits high oxygen permeation flux values that exceed desired commercial targets and compares favorably with previously reported oxygen-permeable membranes. Studies on other perovskites have produced similarly successful results. Overall, this approach could lead to energy efficient, solid-state devices for industrial application in energy and environmental fields. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The past temperature variations are critical to reveal the driving mechanism of climate change and to reduce the uncertainty in predicting future climates. Pre-instrument climatic variability is poorly understood, because of the scarcity of centuries-long climatic data. Here, we present a 211-year (1803–2013) growing season (May–July) temperature reconstruction based on tree-ring width chronology of Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) from Zhangguangcai Mountains in Northeast China. The reconstruction accounted for 41.3% of the temperature variance during the calibration period from 1959 to 2013. The temperature reconstruction was similar to other nearby temperature reconstructions and correlated well spatially to gridded land and ocean surface temperature data. We identified four major cold periods (1839–1846, 1884–1901, 1906–1908 and 1941–1958) and three major warm periods (1855–1880, 1918–1932 and 1998–2013) in the past 211 years.

Non-selective blocker of neuronal and endothelial synthases, Nω-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), did not affect HCO3 – production, but inhibited secretion after pretreatment with omeprazole. Non-selective cyclooxygenase blocker indomethacin inhibited HCO3 – production under conditions of normal synthase activity and in the presence of L-NNA, but was ineffective when co-administered with 7-nitroindazole. It was concluded that neuronal and endothelial synthases are involved in different mechanisms of regulation of HCO3 – secretion in the gastric mucosa induced by mild irritation. Activation of neuronal synthase stimulated HCO3 – production, which is mediated mainly through activation of cyclooxygenase. Theoretically, activation of endothelial synthase should suppress HCO3 – production. The effect of endothelial synthase depends on acid secretion in the stomach and bicarbonate concentration in the submucosa, as it was demonstrated in experiments with intravenous NaHCO3 infusion. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","bicarbonates; endothelial and neuronal nitric oxide synthases; indomethacin; stomach; weak irritants","7 nitroindazole; bicarbonate; endothelial nitric oxide synthase; indometacin; n(g) nitroarginine; neuronal nitric oxide synthase; omeprazole; prostaglandin synthase; sodium chloride; 7-nitroindazole; bicarbonate; indazole derivative; indometacin; nitric oxide synthase; omeprazole; prostaglandin synthase; protein binding; sodium chloride; Article; basal lamina; basolateral membrane; blood flow velocity; comparative study; controlled study; enzyme activity; in vivo study; male; nonhuman; rat; splanchnic blood flow; stomach acid secretion; stomach blood flow; stomach irritation; stomach mucosa; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; drug effects; enzymology; metabolism; Sprague Dawley rat; stomach mucosa; Animals; Bicarbonates; Gastric Mucosa; Indazoles; Indomethacin; Male; Nitric Oxide Synthase; Omeprazole; Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases; Protein Binding; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Sodium Chloride",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020074286

Thus, NOx emission reduction is critical for improving air quality, especially in severely air-polluted regions (e.g., North China). In this study, the source of NOx was investigated by the isotopic composition (δ15N) of particulate nitrate (p-NO3-) at Beihuangcheng Island (BH), a regional background site in North China. It was found that the δ15N-NO3- (n = 120) values varied between -1.7‰ and +24.0‰ and the δ18O-NO3- values ranged from 49.4‰ to 103.9‰. On the basis of the Bayesian mixing model, 27.78 ± 8.89%, 36.53 ± 6.66%, 22.01 ± 6.92%, and 13.68 ± 3.16% of annual NOx could be attributed to biomass burning, coal combustion, mobile sources, and biogenic soil emissions, respectively. Seasonally, the four sources were similar in spring and fall. Biogenic soil emissions were augmented in summer in association with the hot and rainy weather. Coal combustion increased significantly in winter with other sources showing an obvious decline. This study confirmed that isotope-modeling by δ15N-NO3- is a promising tool for partitioning NOx sources and provides guidance to policymakers with regard to options for NOx reduction in North China. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Air quality; Emission control; Isotopes; Nitrogen compounds; Nitrogen oxides; Atmospheric particles; Biomass-burning; Isotopic analysis; Isotopic composition; Mixing models; Mobile sources; NOx emissions; Particulate nitrate; Coal combustion; coal; isotope; nitrate; nitrogen 15; nitrogen oxide; oxygen 18; coal; nitric oxide; air quality; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; Bayesian analysis; combustion; isotopic analysis; isotopic composition; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; pollutant source; soil emission; air quality; Article; Bayes theorem; biomass; chemical analysis; China; combustion; environmental temperature; falling; fractionation; particulate matter; seasonal variation; simulation; soil; spring; summer; weather; winter; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; incineration; China; Air Pollutants; Bayes Theorem; China; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Incineration; Nitric Oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020884709

It produces approximately 42% of Italian cow milk and an important part of Italian pork (40.6%) and beef (31.6%, including culled cows and veal meat). Moreover, Lombardy contributes for 11.5% to the Italian chicken meat production and for 7.53% to rabbit meat. The objective of the study was to estimate the total global warming potential (GWP) of milk and meat productions in Lombardy through a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach and to evaluate the mitigation potential of milk and pork productions. The animal products considered were cow milk and meats from swine, cattle, chickens and rabbits, which represent the almost totality of meat produced in Lombardy. Milk productions and milk composition of Lombardy farms were obtained from the Italian Breeders Association recordings and converted into Fat and Protein Corrected Milk (FPCM). The total GWP of milk production at farm gate in Lombardy was calculated using the mean value of 1.37 kg CO2 eq./kg FPCM, obtained in previous LCA analyses on 102 dairy farms representative of farming systems in Lombardy. The functional unit was 1 kg of FPCM leaving the farm gate. Total meat production in Lombardy was obtained from official statistical data on slaughtered animals. For estimating GWP of meat production the results of previous LCA studies were used; the functional unit was 1 kg of live weight leaving the farm gate. The total GWP of cow milk production in Lombardy was 6.12 Mt CO2 eq.; the most part (90.8%) was generated by farms from lowland, 5.8% from mountains and 3.4% from hills. Results indicate that in Lombardy emission mitigation strategies have to be primarily applied to lowland farms. The total GWP of meat production in Lombardy was 8.5 Mt CO2 eq. Total GWP from milk and meat production in Lombardy was quantified in 14.6 Mt CO2 eq. The most contributing sectors to regional GWP from livestock are dairy and pork. Considering the protein content of animal products, it is noticeable that pork meat and milk had similar contributions to the total protein supply from milk and meat in Lombardy (42.2 vs 37.1% for milk and pork, respectively) but different impacts on GWP (41.9% vs 24.7%, respectively). Beef production gives a small contribution to protein supply but a high contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. Mitigation potentials were evaluated by applying to dairy and pork operations the GWP figures of actual farms of low impact. The results showed that the dissemination of already existing best farming practices could lead to approximately 22% reduction of Lombardy GWP for milk and 37% reduction for pork production. The regional multi-commodity analysis allows to evaluate the mitigation potential of technical measures within each sector as well as to identify mitigation strategies at a territorial level based on structural changes of livestock population. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Global warming potential; LCA; Meat; Milk; Regional assessment","Agriculture; Animals; Carbon dioxide; Dairies; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Meats; Proteins; Emission mitigation; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Livestock production; Milk; Mitigation strategy; Regional assessment; Technical measures; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006321081

The paper refers to air protection policy priorities adopted by the government of Poland in 1990, and reviews policy instruments envisaged for their implementation. Additionally, it discusses international priorities and how the government of Poland attempts to address these in its policy. After defining cost-effectiveness, this paper reviews how the choice of policy instruments influences the costs of pollution control policy. Then, the recent Polish experience with charges, environmental funds, and transferable permits is confronted with the cost-effectiveness principles. The paper concludes that Poland has developed an extensive system of pollution fees which serves a revenue-raising purpose and gives modest incentives to abate, although the cost-effectiveness of this mechanism needs improvement. A potential role for transferable permits is emphasized. © 2006 Adrian Muller and Thomas Sterner.

The following abstract was inadvertently omitted from the proceedings. 2.43. Food ‘Costs’. Mainvil, L. Background: Economic (structural) factors, including income and food price, may partially explain socioeconomic inequalities in diet quality, obesity and health outcomes. Internationally, healthy foods and dietary patterns tend to cost more than less healthy options. Calories from energy-dense foods (refined grains, fats/oils, added sugars) are relatively low cost; whereas, calories from nutrient-rich foods (fresh fruits/vegetables, lean meats/chicken) are relatively high cost. Greater variety and cultural acceptability also increases food costs. The NZ Food Cost Survey has been monitoring retail food prices for a weekly basket of healthy food in New Zealand since 1972. In 2014 methodological updates ensured food types and amounts were culturally acceptable and achieved both dietary guidelines and nutrient requirements. Methods: The availability and retail price (ignoring ‘specials’) of 161 foods in four large supermarkets in Auckland,Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin were recorded annually. The weekly estimated food costs for individuals following a basic (cooked from scratch), moderate and liberal diet were calculated by city. Results: Auckland ‘basic’ healthy food costs ranged from $27 (1 year old) to $67 (adolescent male) per week in 2016. For example, an Auckland household of four, basic healthy food costs were $233 per week (man $64, woman $55, adolescent boy $67, 10 years old $47), which is 41% of a full-time (pre-tax) income on the minimum wage. Most of this cost came from fruits/vegetables (30%), meats/proteins (27%) and dairy (17%). While food prices in New Zealand fell slightly in 2016, food costs have been rising over time. Full results are reported elsewhere (http://www.otago.ac.nz/humannutrition/ research/food-cost-survey). Conclusions: Threats to healthy food affordability include inadequate incomes (rising unemployment, declining real wages/benefits due to rising housing and other costs), reduced food supply (global climate change impacts), and increased food demand (global food security, population growth, bio-fuels). These threats can be managed with sustainable environmental, agricultural/food chain, economic and social welfare policies. © 2017 by the authors.

The authors, as partners of the project, want to clarify that its main contribution, which is the central part of the paper, is the cooperative ITS architecture design and implementation. Specifically, the implementation of the Collaborative Learning Unit (CLU). Accordingly, the authors have decided to reduce and modify Section 5, that should be removed and replaced with the following: 5. Field Experimentation This section presents a summary of the results and the process followed with the aim of testing the architecture functionality using real data coming from predefined ICSI scenarios. As has been mentioned in previous sections, two scenarios have been selected for this experimentation, corresponding to the two field trials scheduled in Pisa (Italy) and Lisbon (Portugal). For the first test scenario, a location in the access point of the Pisa city centre has been selected. Real data about historical pollution levels in the city has been incorporated to the experimentation. On the other hand, in Lisbon, the system was tested along the A5 highway, and the trials were executed in order to assess the performance of the communications, namely in terms of the IT2S communication. Real data about the vehicles traffic flow in the A5 highway has been incorporated in order to test the CLU in a context as close to the real one as possible. The main goal of the experimentation is to show that the system, by the aggregation of distributed sensors data and the implementation of collaborative intelligence, can provide relevant information related to the analysed use cases to the users, and therefore improve their decision making while using their vehicles. 5.1. Urban Scenario in Pisa, Italy Pisa is a city in Tuscany, central Italy, on the right bank of the mouth of the River Arno on the Tyrrhenian Sea. It is the capital city of the Province of Pisa. In this city, some areas have a controlled access through Restricted Traffic Zones (RTZs) and Low Emission Zones (LEZ). These LEZs are a way to reduce the pressure of non-residential traffic in highly touristic destinations. The objective of LEZs is to control the pollution level in highly congested and populated zones. In this context, and having the collected data about the traffic flow and the parking availability, the proposed urban test scenario includes the implementation of the following use cases: • Alternative transport services; • Monitoring and reduction of air pollution; • Alternative paths signalling/route guidance; and • Cooperative parking slots monitoring. The system constantly monitors the pollution of the roads in the RTZ and LEZs of Pisa. As has been explained before, when it predicts that the level of pollution can exceed the threshold, it suggests leaving the car in the parking area, continuing the trip using alternative transport services. In addition, the system estimates in real-time the number of free slots in the parking lot. In this way, it can recommend the most appropriate parking lot to leave the vehicle. This fact highlights the opportunity to provide intermodal transport solutions. Table 3 shows the tasks performed by the different components of the architecture in order to accomplish the requirements of the test scenario. (Table presented). The verification of some of these use cases have been reproduced in the laboratory due to the need of producing events related to current pollution levels. 5.2. Highway Scenario in Lisbon, Portugal The A5 highway of Lisbon is a 25 km (16 miles) long motorway that connects the capital city of Portugal to Cascais. The first section of this infrastructure was opened in 1944, becoming the first motorway in Portugal and one of the firsts in the world. Nowadays, it is the most travelled motorway of the country and one of the most congestion prone ones. Six GWs were installed on the motorway road side cabinets. The RSUs were interconnected, and together with the GWs made possible the implementation of the platform on the field trial location. Field trials were performed by partners of the ICSI project (IT, BRISA and INTECS). The following summarizes the tested use cases, not being the purpose of this work the detailed description of those trials, which will be subject of forthcoming works. In this context, the proposed highway test scenario includes the implementation of the following use cases: • Monitoring of anomaly in traffic flows (congestion); • Accident warning; and • Road works warning. The proposed IT’S? distributed architecture provides in-route traveller information about traffic and road conditions according to both static and dynamic rules. In this way, drivers who are approaching a traffic iam caa take some precaution measures, like reducing; trie speed inadvance. Each RSU’s GW is configured to get Abnormal Traffic events (e.g., accident or roads work warning) from the next GW ontthe road. Additionally, each GW also gets Vehicle Counter events. These events come from the GW’s attached sensors, and they ere delivered to the CLU in order to detect congestion using the implemented artificial intelligence. In line with this, if congestion is detected, a Congestion Level event is launched. Each GW is listening for Csngestion Level events from itself and from the next GW on the roai in order to act wiih foresight and wain the drivers about expected trafficjumps.

Corrigendum to “A gradient of nutrient enrichment reveals nonlinear impacts of fertilization on Arctic plant diversity and ecosystem function”. Ecol Evol. 2017;7:4072. https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.3079 In a recent paper (Prager et al.,), we presented results for abundance-weighted plant diversity measures generated by a plant community composition data file that miscoded plot ID as species abundance. We recalculated the Shannon and Simpson indices and find that they now follow a similar nonlinear trend as species richness and ecosystem function. These changes are reflected in an updated Figure 2 (a–c). (Figure presented.) The abstract should reflect this change as “Our results suggest that only relatively large levels of fertilization … significantly alter the capacity for plant diversity and CO2 exchange in Arctic tundra.” In the discussion, the plant diversity subheading should now read “Plant diversity declines with increasing nutrient availability” followed by “We found that nutrient enrichment did not affect species richness (S) or abundance-weighted diversity indices until high levels of addition (Fig. 2a–c).” We thank Laura Gough for uncovering our error, and we also acknowledge additional funding sources (NSF 1026843 and 1637459). We provide additional information about the plant composition data used for our plant diversity calculations below (Gough,).

By designing energy efficient plants, it is possible to save significant amounts of money. For eficient production, companies must optimize their energy consumption. Data analytics and automation software can play a key role in accessing hidden energy savings. With price points increasing, production costs rising and regulations ever-changing, there are number of challenges that UK manufacturers have having to combat. While energy consumption can be reduced by improving the monitoring and control of energy usage in infrastructure, the prospet of a complete system infrastructure overhaul is unfeasible for many manufacturers. Numatic, a manufacturer of industrial, commercial and domestic cleaning equipment, is saving 21.8% on its gas consumption with a building management system (BMS). It has also signed an initiative called the Climate Change Agreements scheme, which sets demanding targets to help reduce carbon emissions and improve energy efficiency. Scottish manufacturer Heliex Power has solved an energy problem by recovering energy from a ubiquitous energy source, vapour. Developed in conjuction with researchers at City University, London, Heliex's technology uses screw compressors, working in reverse, to recapture lost energy and generate electricity in an economically viable way.",,"Carbon; Climate change; Costs; Energy utilization; Environmental regulations; Intelligent buildings; Manufacture; Automation software; Building management system; Cleaning equipments; Climate Change Agreements; Economically viable; Generate electricity; Monitoring and control; Screw compressors; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021775695
