However, how thermal plumes correlate with the logarithmic law of temperature and how the velocity profile changes with pressure gradient are not fully understood. Here, we perform three-dimensional (3D) simulations of turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection in a slim box without the front and back walls, with aspect ratio width : depth : height = L: D: H= 1 : 1 / 6 : 1 (corresponding to the x, y, and z coordinates, respectively), in the Rayleigh number Ra= [1 × 10 8, 1 × 10 10] for Prandtl number Pr= 0.7. To investigate the structures of the viscous and thermal boundary layers, we examine the velocity profiles in the streamwise and vertical directions (i.e. U and W) along with the mean temperature profile throughout the plume-impacting, plume-ejecting, and wind-shearing regions. The velocity profile is successfully quantified by a two-layer function of a stress length, ℓu+=ℓ0+(z+)3/2[1+(z+/zsub+)4]1/4, as proposed by She et al. (J Fluid Mech, 2017), though it is neither Prandtl–Blasius–Pohlhausen (PBP) type nor logarithmic. In contrast, the temperature profile in the plume-ejecting region is logarithmic for all simulated cases, attributed to the emission of thermal plumes. The coefficient of the temperature log law, A, can be described by the composition of the thermal stress length ℓθ0∗ and the thicknesses of thermal boundary layer zsub∗ and zbuf∗, i.e. A≃zsub∗/(ℓθ0∗zbuf∗3/2). The adverse pressure gradient responsible for turning the wind direction contributes to intensively emitting plumes and the logarithmic temperature profile at the plume-ejecting region. The Nusselt number scaling and the local heat flux in the slim box are consistent with previous results for confined cells. Therefore, the slim-box RBC is a preferred system for investigating in-box kinetic and thermal structures of turbulent convection with the large-scale circulation in a fixed plane. © 2019, The Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Direct numerical simulation; Heat transport; Rayleigh–Bénard convection; Wall-bounded turbulence","Aspect ratio; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Direct numerical simulation; Heat flux; Natural convection; Prandtl number; Pressure gradient; Temperature control; Thermal plumes; Adverse pressure gradient; Boundary layer structure; Heat transport; Large-scale circulation; Logarithmic temperature; Rayleigh; Three-dimensional (3-D) simulation; Wall bounded turbulence; Thermal logging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067032770

Nevertheless, it is a great challenge to obtain a specific heteroatom-doped carbon material with hierarchical structure as a general doping strategy is missing. Herein, carbon materials doped with P, S and both of them are designed and precisely prepared through in-situ polymerization. Used as anode for sodium-ion batteries, the best performing material displays a high specific capacity of 368.6 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles. A high capacity of 159.8 mAh g−1 is achieved at a large current density of 5 A g−1. Impressively, this material also delivers robust storage performances for lithium. According to the first-principles method and detailed experimental data, the expanded interlayer distance and enhanced electronic conductivity of the microcrystalline region can be attributed to C−S and P−C bonds, while the high surface capacitance contribution can be assigned to surface C−S species and highly exposed edges of the microcrystalline region.

The environmental consequences of these policies must be evaluated with environmental management tools such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Therefore, the main goal of the study is to analyze the life-cycle environmental performance of waste disposition in three different landfills located in three distinct geographical areas of Peru: i)the hyper-arid coast; ii)the Andean highlands; and, iii)the Amazon Rainforest. With this aim in mind, a comparative analysis is provided regarding the waste treatment process as compared to other landfill technologies (i.e., biogas combustion or energy recovery)and open dumpsters. The modelling of these systems was performed with the EASETECH waste LCA tool, including a sensitivity analysis in terms of waste composition and waste decay rates. Results show that landfill gas (LFG)treatment reduces greenhouse gas (GHG)emissions considerably. However, these remain higher in the Amazon as compared to the Andean Highlands (+105%)and the hyper-arid coast (+17%). Most of the decomposition in the Amazon basin occurs within 5 years after disposition (80%)due to heat and humidity, whereas in the other regions values were below 55%. LFG treatment or recovery is necessary for these emissions to be lower than in open dumpsters. The implementation of these technologies would strengthen the country's action plan regarding the Paris Agreement in the waste sector. In other impact categories, the transitioning from dumpsters to landfills is most visible in the soil and water compartments. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","GHG emissions; Latin America; Life cycle assessment; Sanitary landfills; Waste management","Artificial life; Biogas; Decay (organic); Environmental impact; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Waste incineration; Waste management; Waste treatment; Environmental consequences; Environmental management tool; Environmental performance; GHG emission; Latin America; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle perspectives; Waste treatment process; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059196004

A windy day is defined according to the threshold of 2 m·s−1, which can effectively remove or reduce air pollution of Beijing. Wintertime windy days in Beijing, preceding autumn sea surface temperature and large-scale climate indices are separated into the interannual and interdecadal components. For the interannual component, the preceding autumn sea surface temperature in central western Pacific Ocean, Polar/Eurasia pattern, and Scandinavia pattern are identified as predictors of wintertime windy days in Beijing. For the interdecadal component, the identified predictors include the preceding autumn sea surface temperature in northeastern part of North Atlantic Ocean, Arctic Oscillation, and North Atlantic Oscillation. We develop statistical models for the interannual and interdecadal components based on these preceding autumn predictors, and take them together to predict wintertime windy days in Beijing. The leave-one-out cross-validation for 1979–2016 time series shows that 76% of the total variance of observed wintertime windy days in Beijing can be predicted. Hindcast experiments for the period of 1999–2016 also yield the high prediction skills. The physical mechanisms responsible for links between these predictors and wintertime windy days in Beijing are also discussed. The statistical models proposed herein are expected to be applied to and aid to improve seasonal forecasting of wintertime windy days in Beijing. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"air-sea interaction; Arctic Oscillation; autumn; climate modeling; climate prediction; North Atlantic Oscillation; regional climate; sea surface temperature; winter; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Beijing [China]; China; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Central)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056639743

In particular, non-transportation sources including volatile chemical products (VCP) are increasing in relative importance due to both the current and historical focus on controlling transportation emissions. These findings have major implications for photo-chemical air quality modeling used to determine appropriate and effective regulatory controls to meet limits for primary and secondary pollutants. Using a regional air quality model, we quantify the changes in ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) simulated for updated VOC emissions reported in the recent literature relative to a baseline inventory for California. Results show that simulated maximum 8-hr ozone concentrations could increase by 17.4 ppb in summer and by 15.6 ppb in winter, and the 24-hr maximum PM2.5 could increase by 7.8 μg/m3 in winter. Impacts reflect differences in the spatial location of VCP source emissions relative to those for transportation. However, compared to measurement data, model performance is not substantially improved by the adjustment of VOC emissions of current sources. In brief, augmented VOC emission inventories impact simulated concentrations of pollutants, but may not improve the performance of models used for the design of emission control policy without more refined representation of missing VCPs sources in the inventory. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Emission inventories; Ozone; Particulate matter; Volatile organic compounds","Air quality; Emission control; Ozone; Particles (particulate matter); Quality control; Uncertainty analysis; Volatile organic compounds; Air quality modeling; Emission inventories; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Ozone concentration; Particulate Matter; Regional air quality modeling; Volatile chemicals; Volatile organic compound (VOC); Particulate emissions; ozone; volatile organic compound; air pollution control; air quality; Article; California; concentration process; exhaust gas; meteorology; particulate matter; photochemistry; priority journal; seasonal variation; secondary organic aerosol; summer; traffic and transport; urban area; winter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065721765

Aiming at the problem of groundwater pollution in the key polluted area of the Hougao region-the Dawu water source-the pollutant transport model is established to explore the process of pollution transport. There are many types of groundwater pollutants in the Hougao area. Among them, ammonia nitrogen, chloride, petroleum, and benzene exceed the standard most seriously. In order to facilitate the research, we selected typical pollutants for in-depth study. The ammonia nitrogen is used as the control index of domestic and industrial waste water in the policy documents of pollution emission. It can show the specific situation of industrial waste water and domestic waste water pollution changing with time. Thus, the ammonia nitrogen with a higher exceeding standard is selected as the pollution factor in this simulation. Pollutant transport under the conditions of strong pumping and stop pumping is simulated. It is found that the pollutant is effectively controlled due to the pumping and discharging effects under the action of strong pumping, from 4 to 5 times exceeding the standard to slightly exceeding the standard. However, there is still a trend of migration to the eastern water supply area. After the pumping is stopped, the pollutant quickly migrates to the Xixia centralized water supply area, causing serious pollution to the water supply area. Finally, four other hydraulic interception wells are set up in the 500 m east of Hougao's four wells to further control the pollutant transport. When hydraulic interception wells and strong pumping wells are used together, the scope of ammonia nitrogen pollution is basically controlled near the interception wells, and it does not continue to spread to the eastern water supply area. The maximum monitoring value of pollution is 0.11 mg/L, which is controlled within the standard limit of three types of groundwater, and the pollutant control effect is the best, providing certain reference for similar pollution control work. © 2019 by the authors.","Dawu water source area; Groundwater pollution; Numerical simulation; Pollution control","Ammonia; Chlorine compounds; Computer simulation; Groundwater; Industrial emissions; Pollution control; Pumps; Solute transport; Water pollution control; Water supply; Comprehensive analysis; Groundwater modeling; Pollutant transport; Pollutant transport modeling; Pollution transport; Solute transport model; Three-dimensional geological modeling; Water source areas; Groundwater pollution; groundwater pollution; hydrogeology; hydrological modeling; hydrological response; interception; numerical method; pollutant transport; pollution control; solute transport; well water; China; Henan; Xixia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070554031

We constructed a game model of PM2.5 (all particulate matter that has an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm)that is based on the transmission and retention of PM2.5 and that accounts for the direct costs, economic development effects and health benefits of the control of PM2.5. In addition, we conceived a new method to allocate the benefits of cooperative efforts based on changes in welfare. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region of China was studied as an example for this model. The results show that cooperation is an effective strategy for PM2.5 control in this region in 2015. The aggregate indirect cost was 30.87% lower in the cooperative case than the non-cooperative case. Cooperation increases the health benefits and economic effects by 2.3 billion Yuan. The most negative effects of economic development come from manufacturing and industry, and the health benefits of free rider are small based on transmission matrix.

Economic dispatch of energy storage system under micro-grid environment is a typical multi-stage stochastic programming problem. The purpose of this paper is to propose an economic dispatch model for the energy storage system satisfying the non-anticipative constraints. The objective function is constructed based on the minimum dispatching cost of the micro-grid, and the accurate mathematical description of the feasible region is given. By solving these problems, we can obtain economic dispatch results of the energy storage system satisfying the non-anticipative constraints.

In this study, separation plates are installed near the spray nozzle to reduce the NOx emission of the burner. However, this geometry modification of burner can cause strong vibration in 660 MWe HFO boiler. The NOx emissions of zero, two, four and six separation plates are predicted using three-dimensional numerical simulations and compared to the experimental data. The NOx emission level is predicted at 473, 437, 422 mg/m3 at 3% O2 with two, four and six separation plates respectively. While significant NOx emission reduction achieved in the case of six separation plates, its effect on combustion instability is also revealed by using three-dimensional finite element method (FEM). The time delay is calculated by tracking the droplets convective time before combustion and the steady simulation results of the boiler with zero and six separation plates are fed into the acoustic solver. The installation of six separation plates leads the mean time delay at 52.5 ms and positive linear growth rate. The conclusions indicate that the method of installation of six separation plates to reduce NOx emission can cause combustion instability in HFO boiler. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Burner structure; Combustion instability; Heavy oil-fired burner; NOx emission; Numerical simulation","Boilers; Combustion; Computer simulation; Crude oil; Emission control; Heavy oil production; Nitrogen oxides; Numerical models; Plates (structural components); Separation; Spray nozzles; Stability; Time delay; Combustion instabilities; Geometry modifications; Linear growth rate; NOx emissions; Numerical predictions; Separation plates; Three-dimensional finite element method; Three-dimensional numerical simulations; Growth rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066296595

The results showed that the addition of Co2+ made particles content in deposits increased remarkably. The change of particles content in deposits was related inversely to the change of cathodic zero potential with the increase of the concentration of cobalt sulfate. Zero charge potential of cathode was shifted to much more negative region. The negative shift of the zero potential, combining with positive shift of the zeta potential, increased the electrostatic force between the particle-adsorbed metallic cations and the cathode. It not only benefits to the transportation of particles in solution towards cathode, but also shortens their residence time on cathodic surface. Meanwhile, entry of particles is also promoted. For metals deposition, reduction resistance of metallic cations rises greatly and deposition current at cathodic potentiodynamic polarization decreases after cobalt sulfate has been added into electrolyte. These factors are favorable for increasing particles content in deposits. In addition, physical model of diamond particles deposition state before and after the addition of Co2+ has been discussed. © 2019","Cobalt sulfate; Composite electrodeposition; Ni-diamond; Particle content in deposits; Zero charge potential","Cathodes; Cobalt deposits; Deposits; Diamond deposits; Diamonds; Electrodeposition; Electrolytes; Metals; Positive ions; Sulfur compounds; Cobalt sulfate; Composite electrodeposition; Deposition current; Diamond composites; Electrochemical measurements; Particle content; Reduction resistance; Zero-charge potential; Cobalt compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065189172

A synthetic wastewater (NO3 −-N, 15 mg/L) was treated through the batch experiment, which included three inoculation cycles (7 days/cycle), and was conducted at 25 °C. Four natural plant substrates, namely, rice straw (RS), wheat straw (WS), ryegrass (RG), and reed (RD), were used as carbon sources and supplemented at the rate of 1% (w/v). The results showed that both RS and WS performed well in promoting NO3 −-N removal (79.55–97.07%). While RG removed only 22.08% of NO3 −-N in the first cycle, the removal efficiency increased afterward (86.09–95.82%). Conversely, the NO3 −-N removal rate of RD decreased from 95.10 to 24.77% as a result of its low ability to supply carbon. With respect to the microorganisms, the RS treatment resulted in more bacteria and denitrifying genes such as narG, nirK, nirS, and norB than other treatments, while the highest number of nosZ gene copies was recorded in the WS treatment. Sequencing results revealed that Firmicutes (18.19–56.96%), Proteobacteria (38.82–74.80%), and Bacteroidetes (3.15–4.15%) were three dominant bacterial phyla for RS, WS, and RD treatments. Furthermore, the genera Enterobacter, Massilia, and Bacillus were the main denitrifying bacteria participating in the NO3 −-N removal. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated that the denitrifying genus Sphingobacterium played an important role in enhancing nitrogen removal.

To explore these problems, this study conducted an empirical analysis, using a decomposition and difference-in-differences approach. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Overall, China's emission trading pilots have driven a significant decline in the carbon intensity, resulting in an average annual decline of approximately 0.026 tons/10,000 yuan in the pilot provinces. (2) In the sample period, emission trading pilots had a sustained and stable effect on carbon intensity with no time lag.

As an important part of urban natural gas supply, coal bed methane (CBM)accounted for 3.4% of the China's total natural gas production in 2017 and had an increase of 9.2% year-on-year compared with last year. In response to government promotion and so as to maintain the steady production of CBM, some enhancing-production approaches have been taken in CBM fields, and one of the effective approaches is the installation of compressors in gathering networks. However, due to the complexity of CBM gathering networks, the pressurization scheme lacks guidance in practice and is mainly decided by experience. To guide the practical production process, this paper proposes a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP)model to optimize the pressurization scheme. The MINLP model considers the cost of facilities and electricity and maximizes the daily net profit of CBM field companies. Then, a two-stage improved genetic algorithm-particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. Finally, the model is applied to a real CBM field with 132 production wells, 10 manifolds and 1 central processing facility (CPF)in China. The result shows that the optimal scheme can increase the total production from 3.39 × 105 m3/d to 3.73 × 105 m3/d with a growth rate of 10.0%, and the daily net profit increases 2.49 × 104CNY/d (about 3.70 × 103USD/d). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Coal bed methane; Gathering network; Genetic algorithm; Optimization; Pressurization scheme","Coal; Coal bed methane; Coal combustion; Coal deposits; Gas supply; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Natural gas well production; Natural gasoline plants; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Pressurization; Profitability; Smoke; Stages; Central processing facilities; Clean energy sources; Effective approaches; Mixed integer nonlinear programming models; Natural-gas production; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Practical production; Smokeless combustion; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065812749

Thus, it is necessary to elucidate the modification mechanism induced by carbon coating. For this purpose, bare ZnMn2O4, carbon-derivative-coated ZnMn2O4, and carbon-coated ZnO-MnO composite materials have been synthesized and investigated in-depth. Herein, high-temperature synchrotron radiation diffraction is used to monitor the phase transition from ZnMn2O4 to ZnO-MnO composite during the carbonization process. The electrochemical performance has been evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic cycling, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The carbon- and carbon-derivative-coated samples display well-improved cycling stability in terms of suppressed electrode polarization, a moderate increase in resistance, and slight capacity variation. The influence of carbon coating on the intrinsic conversion process is investigated by ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, which reveals the evolution of Zn and Mn oxidation states. This result confirms that the strong capacity variation of the bare ZnMn2O4 is induced not only by the reversible charge storage in the solid electrolyte interphase but also by the phase evolution of active materials.

Rare-earth-doped nanoparticles (RENPs) have emerged as a leading candidate for theranostics because of their versatile synthesis and modification chemistries, photostability, and relative safety. Furthermore, their bright, tunable fluorescence using near-infrared (NIR) excitation enables multispectral imaging with high signal-to-background ratios. In this work, we have synthesized double-shelled RENPs with tunable properties for optimal fluorescent imaging, photoacoustic imaging, and photothermal therapy. The properties of the double-shelled RENPs were tailored by controlling the density of rare-earth ions (i.e., activator or sensitizer) by using either a functional amorphous organic or a crystalline outermost shell. This study systematically analyzes the effects of the functional organic or inorganic outermost shell on the imaging and photothermal conversion properties of our RENPs. Despite the weaker infrared absorption enhancement, the functional organic outermost shell impregnated with a low density of rare-earth ions led to minimal reduction of fluorescence emissions. In contrast, the higher density of rare-earth ions in the inorganic shell led to higher infrared absorption and consequently significant reduction in emissions arising from the undesired optical attenuation. Inorganic shell thickness was therefore modified to reduce the deleterious attenuation, leading to brighter emissions that also enabled the in vitro SWIR detection of ∼2500 cells/cluster. Using the enhanced infrared properties that arise from this functional inorganic layer, which could be engineered to respond to either NIR or SWIR, we demonstrated that (1) bright SWIR emissions allowed detection of small cell clusters; (2) strong PA signals allowed clear visualization of particle distribution within tumors; and (3) strong photothermal effects resulted in localized elevated temperatures. Collectively, these results highlight the utility of these double-shelled RENPs as theranostic agents that are compatible with both photoacoustic or fluorescent imaging platforms. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","imaging; infrared nanoparticles; photoacoustic; photothermal; theranostic","Diagnosis; Imaging techniques; Infrared absorption; Infrared devices; Light absorption; Medical applications; Metal ions; Nanoparticles; Photoacoustic effect; Rare earths; Shells (structures); Synthesis (chemical); Absorption enhancement; Biomedical applications; Near-infrared excitation; Particle distributions; Photo-thermal; Photo-thermal conversions; Photothermal properties; theranostic; Fluorescence imaging; lanthanide; metal nanoparticle; nanoshell; absorption; animal experiment; animal model; Article; biomedical engineering; breast tumor; concentration (parameter); controlled study; elemental analysis; energy transfer; hydrodynamics; in vitro study; infrared radiation; limit of detection; luminescence; mouse; nonhuman; particle size; photoacoustics; photothermal therapy; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; synthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071372119

As the real world has already witnessed a 0.5°C global mean surface temperature warming increment, the observed climate changes associated with the half-degree warming may be analogues for future projections. This hypothesis is examined by comparing the heat extreme changes in China derived from the observational records to projections of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) low-warming experiment, which is the first short-term stabilized simulation dedicated for the 1.5 and 2°C warming targets. The results of the CESM historical simulations are also evaluated. From the perspective of spatially aggregated, the heat extreme changes in China under the historical 0.5°C warming are detectable in observations. The nighttime extremes manifest more significant increase than daytime extremes. Heat extreme changes under the past half-degree warming increment are reasonably captured in the historical simulations with slightly weaker magnitudes. The changes in the intensity indices in observations are better reproduced by the historical simulations than the frequency and duration indices. For the heat extreme changes in the future 0.5°C warming, the observational records can serve as conservative analogues in daytime extremes, while the nighttime extreme indices show comparable or weaker changes. The future reduction of anthropogenic aerosol emissions will amplify the increase of heat extremes in comparison to present day especially during daytime in China. Given the possibly intensified extremes associated with future aerosol reductions, more attention should be paid to the currently heavy polluted regions. ©2019.

However, as yet, there is a lack of work to quantify the GHG emissions and guide cities on how best to reduce emissions. By using the life cycle assessment method, this study is therefore designed to estimate the GHG emissions from urban buildings during the period of 1999–2016, to figure out the major contributors, and finally, to propose potential effective measures for GHG emissions reduction in Macau. The results show that total GHG emissions from buildings have grown quickly from 1.52 million metric tons (Mt) CO2e in 1999 to 5.91 Mt CO2e in 2016. The use phase contributes to most GHG emissions during the whole life stage, accounting for 65.75% of the total GHG emissions, followed by construction stage (33.72%). The unit GHG emissions in the construction stage is 1.47 (0.84–3.82) tons CO2e/m2, while for the use stage, unit GHG emissions from resident and non-resident buildings in 2016 are up to 65.33 and 3316.37 CO2e/m2/year, respectively. It is noted that EoL stage has ‘negative value’, indicating that it could generally bring some environmental benefits due to materials recycling. e.g. In 2016, the environmental impacts and benefits in the EoL stage are 21.12 and 85.94 Kt CO2e, respectively. The gaming industry and clean electricity should be the key points of building GHG emission reduction in Macau.

In this study, we developed a method of examining, screening and applying online data from the country's improving continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS)to reevaluate a “bottom-up” emission inventory of China's coal-fired power sector. The benefits of China's current national emission standards and ultra-low emission policy for the sector were quantified assuming their full implementation. The derived national average emission factors of SO2, NOx and particulate matter (PM)were 1.00, 1.00 and 0.25 kg/t-coal respectively for 2015 based on CEMS data, smaller than those of previous studies that may not fully recognize improved emission controls in recent years. The annual emissions of SO2, NOx and PM from the sector were recalculated at 1321, 1430 and 334 Gg respectively, 75%, 63% and 76% smaller than our estimates based on a previous approach without the benefit of CEMS data. The results imply that online measurement with proper data screening can better track the recent progress of emission controls. The emission intensity (the ratio of emissions to economic output)of Northwest China was larger than that of other regions, attributed mainly to its less intensive economy and industry. Transmission of electricity to more-developed eastern provinces raised the energy consumption and emissions of less-developed regions. Judged by 95 percentiles of flue-gas concentrations measured by CEMS, most power plants met the current national emission standards in 2015 except for those in Northwest and Northeast China, while plants that met the ultra-low emission policy were much scarcer. National SO2, NOx and PM emissions would further decline by 68%, 55% and 81% respectively if the ultra-low emission policy can be strictly implemented, implying the great potential of the policy for emission abatement. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CEMS; Coal-fired power plant; Emission control; Ultra-low emission policy","Coal; Emission control; Energy utilization; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas plants; Nitrogen oxides; Online systems; Power control; Uncertainty analysis; CEMS; Coal-fired power plant; Continuous emission monitoring; Continuous emission monitoring system; Emission inventories; Flue gas concentration; Less-developed regions; Low emission; Particulate emissions; atmospheric pollution; coal-fired power plant; concentration (composition); emission control; emission inventory; particulate matter; pollution policy; air pollution control; article; China; electric power plant; monitoring; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; China; electric power plant; environmental monitoring; industry; legislation and jurisprudence; particulate matter; prevention and control; procedures; standards; China; coal; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Industry; Nitrogen Oxides; Particulate Matter; Power Plants; Sulfur Dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065570838

This study was therefore initiated to determine the sub- and super-critical CO2 flow characteristics in a large reconstituted bituminous coal sample (203 mm in diameter and 1 m in length) by performing three sets of N2 and CO2 injections with injection pressures from 6 MPa to 10 MPa under 11 MPa axial stress and at 37 °C. It was observed that, unlike N2 permeability which increases with injection pressure, CO2 permeability exhibits reductions with injection pressure due to greater swelling effects at elevated CO2 pressures. The second N2 injections into the coal sample previously flooded with CO2 showed reductions in permeability compared to the first N2 injection into the original coal sample, because the coal structure had been altered considerably by the CO2 flows. The pressure build-up at downstream for CO2 injection is always lower than that for the first N2 injection due to reduced CO2 flows as a result of decreased permeability, which also contributes to the lower pressure development at downstream for the second N2 injections. The pressure profiles along the sample are similar for the first N2 and CO2 injections with relatively greater pressure decays for CO2, while considerable pressure reductions were observed for the second N2 injections, especially in the regions near the injection point where greater CO2 pressures previously existed, causing greater structural rearrangement in those regions. The second N2 injection causes less volumetric strain of the sample than the first due to the altered coal structure induced by the prior CO2 flows which impede gas flow in the sample. © 2019","CO2 sequestration; Coal permeability; Core flooding test; Large coal sample; Super-critical CO2","Bituminous coal; Floods; Flow of gases; CO2 sequestration; Coal permeabilities; Coal sample; Core flooding test; Critical CO2; Carbon dioxide; bituminous coal; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; estimation method; experimental study; gas flow; permeability; reduction; swelling; temperature effect; testing method",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067021306

Based on the investigation and calculation of the existing researches, this paper summarizes the sources of air pollutants, chemical compositions, and driving factors of PM variations in subway. It evaluates the toxicity and health risks of pollutants. In this paper, the problems and challenges during the deployment of air pollution governance are discussed. Results show that the global PM compliance rate of subway is about 30%. Subway air pollution is endogenous, which means that pollutants mainly come from mechanical wear and building materials erosions. Particles are mainly metal particles, black carbon, and floating dust. The health risks of some chemical elements in the subway have reached critical levels. The variations of PM concentrations show spatial-temporal characteristics, which are mainly controlled by train age, brakes types, and environmental control systems. The authors then analyze the dynamics of interactions among government, companies and public during the air pollution governance by adding the following questions: (a) who pays the bill; (b) how to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of policies; (c) how the public moves from risk perception to actions; (d) how to develop clean air technology better so as to ultimately incentivize stakeholders and to facilitate the implementation of subway clean air programme in a resilient mode. © 2019 by the authors.","Particulate matter (PM); Pollution governance dynamics; Subway air pollution; Subway clean air programme","C (programming language); Chemical elements; Cost effectiveness; Environmental management; Health risks; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution control; Railroads; Risk perception; Chemical compositions; Clean air; Environmental control system; Microbial pollution; Particulate Matter; Pm concentrations; Problems and challenges; Spatial-temporal characteristics; Air pollution; atmospheric pollution; governance approach; health risk; organic pollutant; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollution control; pollution policy; risk perception; toxicity; urban pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071021856

Moreover, heterogeneous panel non-causality test is employed to analyze the causality among variables based on regional data. The empirical results reject the existence of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis in whole samples (NSEA-10), Northeast Asian countries (NEA-4), and Southeast Asian countries (SEA-6). Non-renewable energy is the big source of emissions, while renewable energy can reduce emissions in panel data. The development of tourism may lead to the environmental degeneration.

Though extensive effort has been made to investigate the genomic basis of local adaptation to climate across the latitudinal range of tree species, less is known for altitudinal clines. We used exome capture to genotype 451 Populus trichocarpa genotypes across altitudinal and latitudinal gradients spanning the natural species range, and phenotyped these trees for a variety of adaptive traits in two common gardens. We observed clinal variation in phenotypic traits across the two transects, which indicates climate-driven selection, and coupled gene-based genotype-phenotype and genotype-environment association scans to identify imprints of climatic adaptation on the genome. Although many of the phenotype- and climate-associated genes were unique to one transect, we found evidence of parallelism between latitude and altitude, as well as significant convergence when we compared our outlier genes with those putatively involved in climatic adaptation in two gymnosperm species. These results suggest that not only genomic constraint during adaptation to similar environmental gradients in poplar but also different environmental contexts, spatial scale, and perhaps redundant function among potentially adaptive genes and polymorphisms lead to divergent adaptive architectures. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

We integrated eddy covariance (EC) C-CO2 flux measurements and the Agroscope Reckenholz-Tänikon footprint tool to analyze C-CO2 dynamics at the landscape-scale as well as in local-scale urban forest patches during one year. The approach measured the C-CO2 flux from different contributing areas depending on wind directions and atmospheric stability. Although the study landscape was a net carbon source (2.98 Mg C ha-1 yr-1), we found the mean CO2 flux in urban forest patches was -1.32 μmol m-2s-1, indicating that these patches function as a carbon sink with an annual carbon balance of -5.00 Mg C ha-1. These results indicate that urban forest patches and vegetation (i.e., green infrastructure) composition can be designed to maximize the sequestration of CO2. This novel integrated modeling approach can be used to facilitate the study of the multi-scale effects of urban forests and green infrastructure on CO2 and to establish low-carbon emitting planning and planting designs in the subtropics. © 2019 by the authors.","ART footprint tool; Carbon dioxide offsets; Green infrastructure; Nature-based solutions; Urban ecosystems","carbon balance; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sink; eddy covariance; flux measurement; infrastructure; integrated approach; subtropical region; urban ecosystem; urban forestry; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070672725

By applying the latest 2012 Chinese multi-regional input–output table, this study evaluated the impacts of carbon tax on tax burdens and sectoral competitiveness in Chinese provinces when considering either production-based or consumption-based emissions. Our results indicated that, in the scenario of cutting production tax for carbon tax, the developed provinces, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu, who are much bigger payers of production tax, are net beneficiaries of carbon tax. In contrast, recycling the tax revenues to low-income households makes the less-developed provinces in the central and western China become net revenue receivers. Furthermore, for competitiveness effects, the emission intensive sectors, such as Electricity and hot water production and supply, Petroleum and gas, and Metal products, are impacted vitally under both accounting principles in all provinces. Nevertheless, compared with the production-based principle, a consumption-based carbon tax could reduce the unfavorable competitiveness effects of most affected sectors in the less-developed provinces, while slightly increasing those effects in the developed provinces. Our results provide new information on the regional impacts of carbon tax based two different accounting principles with different tax revenue recycling scenarios. © 2019 The Society for Policy Modeling","Accounting principles; Carbon emissions; China; Multi-regional input–output analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063236863

However, many barriers to formulating national legislation to address climate change have so far prevented its enactment. The bottom-up approach adopted in the international climate regime sets a good example. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the regional legislation to address climate change in China through exploring the following two questions: whether it is necessary to enact climate change legislation at regional level first and whether it is feasible to develop such regional legislation in the absence of national climate change law. Design/methodology/approach: This paper analyses the necessity and feasibility of regional legislation to address climate change. Section 2 introduces the current legislative framework on climate change in China. Section 3 investigates whether it is better to push the legislative agenda at regional, rather than national level. Section 4 analyses the feasibility of establishing regional legislative systems. Section 5 explores the key issues in formulating and promoting regional legislation. Findings: This paper concludes that it is necessary and feasible to pilot regional legislation before enacting national legislation. Under these circumstances, local governments can take the initiative to begin formulating regional legislation. Originality/value: Addressing climate change needs immediate action and effective measures. It is, thus, necessary to reconsider the approach that China should adopt when developing legislation on climate change. This paper contributes to broadening current knowledge of regional climate change legislation in China. © 2019, Jianwei Zhang, Xiaoyi Jiang and Xiaobin Pan.","China; Climate change; National policy; Paris Agreement; Regional legislation","bottom-up approach; climate change; feasibility study; international agreement; knowledge; planning legislation; policy development; regional climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064013452

The climate response to INDC emission reduction is a focus in climate change science. In this study, data from 32 global climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) were applied to investigate the changes in the mean and extreme high temperatures in Central Asia (CA) under the INDC scenario above the present-day level. The results show that the magnitude of warming in CA is remarkably higher than the global mean. Almost all the regions in CA will experience more intense, more frequent, and longer-lasting extreme high-temperature events. In comparison with the INDC scenario, the reduced warming of the 2.0◦C/1.5◦C target scenarios will help avoid approximately 44–61%/65–80% of the increase in extreme temperature events in terms of the intensity, frequency, and duration in CA. These results contribute to an improved understanding of the benefits of limiting global warming to the 2.0◦C/1.5◦C targets, which is paramount for mitigation and adaptation planning. © 2019 by the authors.

Based on the 2003-2015 Shandong Province transportation energy consumption data, this paper uses the top-down method to calculate the carbon emissions of transportation in Shandong Province.On this basis, the grey relational degree analysis method is used to study the impact of seven factors, namely per capita GDP, total population, energy consumption per unit GDP, private car ownership, tourism income, freight turnover and passenger turnover, on the carbon emissions of transportation in Shandong Province. According to the analysis results, the above influencing factors are closely related to the carbon emissions of transportation in Shandong Province. The impact degree is from large to small: passenger turnover > freight turnover > per capita GDP > total population > energy consumption per unit > tourism income> private car ownership.

However, little is known about the effect of ICM on root growth and methane (CH4) emission of paddy rice. In this study, two rice varieties, Wuyunjing 24 and Yongyou 2640, were grown. A field experiment was conducted with three crop management treatments including zero nitrogen fertilization (0N), local farmer practice (LFP), and ICM. Root morphophysiological traits and CH4 emission from the paddy field were investigated. ICM significantly increased mean grain yield by 29.9%, with the effect attributed mainly to an increase in mean total number of spikelets by 26.4% compared to LFP. ICM increased root and shoot biomass, root length, number of roots, root oxidation activity (ROA), root bleeding rate, and root total and active absorbing surface area by respectively 24.4%, 25.7%, 17.1%, 9.3%, 18.7%, 29.5%, 12.1%, and 24.7%. The concentrations of malic, succinic, and acetic acids in root exudates were respectively 5.8%, 6.0%, and 10.5% higher in ICM than in LFP. Compared to LFP, ICM significantly decreased the rate of CH4 emission during emission peak stages and reduced total CH4 emission by 17.1%. The root morphophysiological traits were positively and significantly correlated with grain yield, whereas root length, specific root length, ROA, and root total and active absorbing surface area were negatively and significantly correlated with total CH4 emission.

Based on statistics from 2005 to 2015, carbon emission efficiency and the differences in 30 provinces of China were rated by the Modified Undesirable Epsilon-based measure (EBM) Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) Model. Additionally, we further analyzed the influencing factors of carbon emission efficiency's differences in the Tobit model. We found that the overall carbon emission efficiency was relatively low in China. The level of carbon emission efficiency is the highest in the East region, followed by the Central and West regions. As for the influencing factors, industrial structure, external development, and science and technology level had a significant positive relationship with carbon emission efficiency, whereas government intervention and energy intensity demonstrated a negative correlation with carbon emission efficiency. The contributions of this paper include two aspects. First, we used the Modified Undesirable EBM DEA Model, which is more accurate than traditional methods. Secondly, based on the data's unit root testing and cointegration, the paper verified the influencing factors of carbon emission efficiency by the Tobit model, which avoids the spurious regression. Based on the results, we also provide several policy implications for policymakers to improve carbon emission efficiency in different regions. © 2019 by the authors.

Energy policy goals in these countries have been characterised by expanding the deployment of renewable energy technologies in the electricity mix in the medium term (i.e., until 2030). This tacitly signals a transformation of socio-technical systems by 2030 and beyond. Nevertheless, how these policy objectives actually translate into future scenarios that can also take into account a long-term perspective up to 2050 and correspond to local preferences remains largely understudied. This paper aims to fill this gap by identifying the most widely preferred long-term electricity scenarios for Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia. During a series of two-day workshops (one in each country), the research team, along with local stakeholders, adopted a participatory approach to develop multiple 2050 electricity scenarios, which enabled electricity pathways to be modelled using Renewable Energy Pathway Simulation System GIS (renpassG!S). We subsequently used the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) within a Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) to capture local preferences. The empirical findings show that local stakeholders in all three countries preferred electricity scenarios mainly or even exclusively based on renewables. The findings demonstrate a clear preference for renewable energies and show that useful insights can be generated using participatory approaches to energy planning. © 2019 by the authors.","Electricity scenarios; Energy modelling; Jordan; MCA; MENA; Morocco; Multi-criteria; Stakeholder participation; Sustainability; Tunisia","Computer science; Energy management; Sustainable development; Energy modelling; Jordan; MENA; Morocco; Multi-criteria; Stakeholder participation; Tunisia; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070540700

Women are often in great danger, where they should be safest. Violence against women is the most pervasive yet the least recognized human rights violation in the world. It is a profound health problem and femicide, is often the tragic end-point of violence. Females represent more than half of the Egyptian population, however, they remain vulnerable. Aim of the study: To describe and analyze data obtained from Zeinhom Morgue records in Cairo, regarding female deaths, throughout two years. To evaluate female deaths regarding age, cause, manner of death, location, perpetrator and motive. To describe the incidence of female homicides and their related injury patterns. To identify the risk factors and nature of violence from victimologic point of view. Finally, to describe the manner of death whether natural, homicidal, suicidal or accidental aiming for early identification of vulnerable females so that actions can be taken to prevent further mortality. Subjects and Methods: This is a national two year retrospective descriptive mortuary based study. The study population comprised of all adult females, aged 18 years and older, whose death was suspicious and medico-legal examination was ordered. Each investigation included a detailed case history, investigation, gross examination, histo-pathological and toxicological examinations. Data was collected from autopsy reports, hospital records and police records. From the available data the victim profile was made. Results: All female deaths aged 18 years and older were retrospectively reviewed for 2 years at Zeinhom morgue of Medico-legal Authority from a total of 1858 autopsy cases. The most common manner of death was homicide. The commonest cause of death in homicides was due to sharp traumatic injuries. Natural death was the least common manner of death and ischemic heart disease constituted the commonest cause. Falling from height was the most common method of suicidal related deaths. Regarding poisoned cases, insecticides and carbon monoxide were the most common detected poisons. According to the cause of death (trauma), blunt trauma injuries were the most common. Falling from height constituted the largest percent of cases under this group. Conclusion and recommendations: Females in the third decade of life with blunt injuries to the head and neck were the majority of adult female autopsies. Homicide was the most common manner of female death using sharp instruments after domestic arguments mainly by a spouse or relative. Accidental death came second mainly due to post-operative complications. In cases of suicide, falling from height was the commonest cause followed by poisoning. These findings could be useful for forensic pathologists and healthcare promoters in predicting and preventing female deaths. Moreover, this emphasizes the need for raising public awareness about the scale of female violence problem in our society. The results of this study indicates that, by not only a strong legal support network, but also by opportunities for economic independency, essential education and awareness, alternative accommodation and a change in attitude and mindset of society, judiciary, legislature, executive, men and most importantly women themselves can lower or even prevent such deaths specially suicidal. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine","Egypt; Female death; Homicide; Trauma; Violence","carbon monoxide; insecticide; accidental death; adult; Article; asphyxia; autopsy; blunt trauma; burn; carbon monoxide intoxication; cardiopulmonary insufficiency; cause of death; death; descriptive research; domestic violence; drowning; Egypt; Egyptian; electrocution; falling; female; forensic pathology; gender based violence; gunshot injury; hanging; head and neck injury; homicide; human; injury; intoxication; ischemic heart disease; kidney failure; medicolegal aspect; mortality; negligence; pneumonia; postoperative complication; retrospective study; strangulation; suicide; traffic accident; accident; adolescent; aged; brain hemorrhage; brain tumor; cause of death; child; epidemiology; forensic medicine; heart muscle ischemia; middle aged; morgue; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; young adult; Accidents; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain Neoplasms; Cause of Death; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Child; Egypt; Female; Forensic Medicine; Homicide; Humans; Middle Aged; Morgue; Myocardial Ischemia; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Suicide; Wounds and Injuries; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066628931

However, key landscape dynamic transfer processes that can affect land surface temperature (LST) and regional thermal environment (RTE) remain poorly understood, especially in the context of urban agglomerations. Hence we selected one of the world's most rapidly urbanized regions – the Pearl-River-Delta Metropolitan Region (PRDR) located in southern China as the case. With the help of Google Cloud Computing, Markov model, and spatial analyses, we have further quantified the strong contributions of urbanization and urban agglomeration development to RTE dynamics and evolution. Specifically, we revealed (1) the cooling effects of ecological land loss and gain are significantly different, which provides evidence that the existing natural ecosystems (especially forests) are valuable for climatic adaptation because newly constructed ecological land does not provide the same cooling effect. (2) We found that the RTE is not only influenced by land cover patterns and process but also significantly dominated by the specific land conversion processes. (3) From 1995 to 2015 in the PRDR, built-up land increased significantly, while the ecological land was significantly reduced, and the isolated urban heat islands were gradually connected and interacted with each other, forming the regional heat island. (4) We also proposed that the relationship between urbanization rate and temperature (RLST) may conform to the Environmental Kuznets Curve. This study enhances the understanding of RTE dynamics and evolution in urban agglomeration and provides important insights into existing natural ecosystem protection and climate adaptation planning. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate adaption and mitigation; Dynamic and evolution; Environmental Kuznets curve; Land cover conversion; Rapid urbanization; Regional thermal environment","Agglomeration; Atmospheric temperature; Dynamics; Economics; Ecosystems; Landforms; Markov processes; Climate adaption and mitigation; Environmental Kuznets curves; Land cover; Rapid urbanizations; Thermal environment; Land surface temperature; adaptive management; agglomeration; environmental management; environmental planning; Kuznets curve; land cover; land surface; metropolitan area; mitigation; surface temperature; urban development; urban economy; urbanization; Agglomeration; Dynamics; Economics; Ecosystems; Evolution; Islands; Surfaces; Temperature; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065894936

Synthetic microbial communities provide reduced-complexity models that allow an examination of ecological theories under defined and controlled conditions. In this study, we applied a multiphasic approach to study synthetic methane-oxidizing communities and species interactions as proxies to the natural communities. Our results confirm that, under selective pressures, natural-sediment communities of high complexity simplify rapidly, selecting for several major functional guilds, the major partners in methane oxidation being the Methylococcaceae methanotrophs and the Methylophilaceae methylotrophs, along with minor but persistent partners, members of Burkholderiales and Flavobacteriales. As a proof of concept, we established minimalist synthetic communities that were representative of the four functional guilds to demonstrate the dependency of the non-methane-utilizing species on the methanotrophs as the primary carbon-providing species. We observed that in communities consisting of multiple representatives of the key guilds, members of the same guild appeared to compete for resources. For example, when two methanotrophs of the same family were present, the two expressed similar key methanotrophy pathways and responded similarly to changing environmental conditions, suggesting that they perform a similar keystone function in situ. Similar observations were made for the Methylophilaceae. However, differences were noted in the expression of auxiliary and unique genes among strains of the same functional guild, reflecting differential adaptation and suggesting mechanisms for competition. At the same time, differences were also noted in the performances of partners with specific metabolic schemes. For example, a mutant of Methylotenera mobilis impaired in nitrate utilization behaved as a more efficient cooperator in methane consumption, suggesting that the loss of function may lead to changes in communal behavior. Overall, we demonstrate the robust nature of synthetic communities built of native lake sediment strains and their utility in addressing important ecological questions while using a simplified model. © 2019 Yu et al.","Methane oxidation; Methanotrophs; Species interactions; Synthetic community","methane; carbon; methane; nitrogen; Article; bacterial strain; bacterium isolation; Burkholderiales; controlled study; down regulation; Flavobacteriales; flow cytometry; gene expression; lake sediment; metagenomics; methanotroph; Methylococcaceae; Methylophilaceae; methylotroph; microbial community; nonhuman; organismal interaction; oxidation; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; synthesis; transcriptomics; carbon cycle; Flavobacteriaceae; genetics; lake; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; organismal interaction; oxidation reduction reaction; sediment; Burkholderiales; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Flavobacteriaceae; Geologic Sediments; Lakes; Methane; Methylococcaceae; Microbial Interactions; Microbiota; Nitrogen; Oxidation-Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070452024

Vibrational solvatochromic shift has been observed for dilute PCBM in organic solvents of varying polarity, but the spectral shift does not follow the order of solvent polarity, and its microscopic origin remains elusive. Here, we applied a mixed quantum/classical approach to simulate the infrared (IR) spectra for the ester carbonyl stretch of PCBM in dichloromethane, chloroform, and benzene. In this approach, the ester carbonyl group is treated quantum mechanically with a frequency map, and the rest of the system is described by molecular dynamics simulations. Based on the reasonable agreement with experimental IR spectra, we show that the specific directional interaction between the ester carbonyl group and its neighboring solvent molecules, which is not well captured by the solvent polarity, is primarily responsible for the observed solvatochromic shift. Furthermore, we find that the strength of this interaction also governs the solvation dynamics of the ester carbonyl group and the resulting frequency fluctuation, leading to a more inhomogeneously broadened spectrum for PCBM in chloroform compared to that in dichloromethane and benzene. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Benzene; Butyric acid; Dichloromethane; Molecular dynamics; Solvents; Directional interactions; Electronic materials; Frequency fluctuation; Molecular dynamics simulations; Molecular morphology; Organic semiconducting materials; Solvatochromic shifts; [6 ,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl esters; Esters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070538725

As climate change intensifies, climate change adaptation strategies, such as flood insurance, energy taxes, and other risky financial strategies, have drawn worldwide attention and discussion. Risk control methods have been widely used to mitigate the impact of climate change on past flood losses, but past risk control strategies on climate change have not focused on the exploration of the relationship between environment, society, and humans.

The Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) is the latest strategic economic area in China. In this study, a method of investigating the convergence of per capita carbon emissions in the YREB is proposed, and it includes the following models: σ convergence, stochastic convergence and β convergence. Besides, the five control variables per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), energy consumption structure, industrial structure, population density and urbanization rate are considered in the test models. In addition to testing the whole sample of 74 cities belonging to the Economic Belt, the convergence of three subgroups (municipalities, capital and sub-provincial cities and prefecture-level cities) is also tested by considering spatial effects. The following results are obtained: (1) although σ convergence and β conditional convergence are observed, stochastic convergence is not observed for the 74 cities; (2) the per capita GDP and energy structure are the key factors influencing the cities’ convergence, whereas the urbanization rate has a limited impact; and (3) improving the industrial structure and reducing the population density are effective methods of promoting the convergence of per capita carbon emissions among the capital and sub-provincial cities and municipalities, respectively. © The Author(s) 2018.","Carbon emission; cities; convergence; reduction; spatial effect; Yangtze River Economic Belt","Carbon; Economic and social effects; Industrial emissions; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Reduction; Rivers; Stochastic systems; Carbon emissions; cities; convergence; Spatial effect; Yangtze River; Energy utilization; carbon emission; convergence; emission control; energy use; Gross Domestic Product; strategic approach; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059479570

This study not only estimated the effects of meteorology and emission control measures on air quality improvement in Guangzhou but also assessed the contributions of emissions reduction from various sources through the combination of observation data and simulation results from Weather Research and Forecasting - Community Multiscale Air Quality (WRF-CMAQ) modeling system. Results showed that the favorable meteorological conditions in 2016 alleviated the air pollution. Compared to change in meteorology, implementing emission control measures in Guangzhou and surrounding cities was more beneficial for air quality improvement, and it could reduce the concentrations of SO2, NO2, PM2.5, PM10, and O3 by 9.7 μg m−3 (48.4%), 9.2 μg m−3 (17.7%), 7.7 μg m−3 (14.6%), 9.7 μg m−3 (13.4%), and 12.0 μg m−3 (7.7%), respectively. Furthermore, emission control measures that implemented in Guangzhou contributed most to the concentration reduction of SO2, NO2, PM2.5, and PM10 (46.0% for SO2, 15.2% for NO2, 9.4% for PM2.5, and 9.1% for PM10), and it increased O3 concentration by 2.4%. With respect to the individual contributions of source emissions reduction, power sector emissions reduction showed the greatest contribution in reducing the concentrations of SO2, NO2, PM2.5, and PM10 due to the implementation of Ultra-Clean control technology. As for O3 mitigation, VOCs product-related source emissions reduction was most effective, and followed by transportation source emissions reduction, while the reductions of power sector, industrial boiler, and industrial process source might not be as effective.

However, this practice has reduced livestock production and consequently decreased herders’ income in the region. In this study, light grazing was therefore re-introduced to investigate effects of converting cropland to grassland on soil erosion and CO2 emission under light grazing practice. The light grazing trials (10 adult sheep grazing to 7–8 cm of the initial grass height in 1530 m2 land area)were conducted, where soil loss, SOC erosion and CO2 emission were measured using 7Be technique and Li−COR Automated Soil CO2 Flux System. Soil and SOC erosion were 60% and 56% lower in the light grazed grassland and 46% and 29% lower in the un-grazed grassland when compared with cropland, respectively. Light grazing and un-grazing practices reduced soil CO2 emission by 15% and 33% respectively, relative to cropland. The mechanisms to control soil erosion by light grazing and un-grazing practices were similar, and governed by grass root biomass and near surface vegetation coverage. However, light grazing had higher potential than un-grazing practices in reducing Soil and SOC erosion and CO2 emission. Our results highlight the potential of light grazing in reducing soil erosion in the “Grain for Green” grassland ecosystems to achieve the dual goals of ecological and economic gains, and sustainability in China and elsewhere. © 2019 The Author(s)","CO2 emission; Light grazing; Plant biomass; Soil erosion; Soil organic carbon; Un-grazed grass","biomass; carbon emission; carbon sink; grass; grassland soil; grazing; income; livestock farming; phytomass; reintroduction; sheep; soil carbon; soil erosion; soil respiration; sustainability; China; Loess Plateau; Ovis aries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064619723

Conventional indoor climate design and control approaches are based on static thermal comfort/sensation models that view the building occupants as passive recipients of their thermal environment. To overcome the disadvantages of static models, adaptive thermal comfort models aim to provide opportunity for personalized climate control and thermal comfort enhancement. Recent advances in wearable technologies contributed to new possibilities in controlling and monitoring health conditions and human wellbeing in daily life. The generated streaming data generated from wearable sensors are providing a unique opportunity to develop a real-time monitor of an individual's thermal state. The main goal of this work is to introduce a personalized adaptive model to predict individual's thermal sensation based on non-intrusive and easily measured variables, which could be obtained from already available wearable sensors. In this paper, a personalized classification model for individual thermal sensation with a reduced-dimension input-space, including 12 features extracted from easily measured variables, which are obtained from wearable sensors, was developed using least-squares support vector machine algorithm. The developed classification model predicted the individual's thermal sensation with an overall average accuracy of 86%.

Experiments in the 0.2–0.5 GPa range were carried out in an internally heated pressure vessel equipped with a rapid-quench device. In these experiments, glass powder and pure CO gas were directly loaded into platinum capsules; during the runs, graphite precipitated, indicating that the equilibrium 2 CO = C + CO2 in the gas phase was reached. Experiments at higher pressures were carried out in a piston cylinder apparatus, starting with glass powder, graphite, and Ag2C2O4 as a source of CO2. Carbon contents in quenched glasses were measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Bulk carbon solubility is directly proportional to pressure and follows Henry's law with good approximation. The effect of temperature on solubility is small. Henry coefficients of bulk carbon solubility obtained by fitting all data were 2.15 ppm C/MPa for MORB, 1.57 ppm C/MPa for andesite and 2.14 ppm C/MPa for rhyolite. In almost all samples, bulk carbon contents were higher than the content of oxidized carbon (CO2 and carbonate). The difference is interpreted to be due to dissolved CO, consistent with bands in the 2100–2200 cm−1 range of the infrared and Raman spectra. For MORB, the solubility cCO of CO (expressed as wt.% carbon) may be described by the relationship log cCO MORB = −5.20 + 0.80 log fCO (R2 = 0.83), where fCO is CO fugacity, while the rhyolite data are best described by log cCO Rhyolite = −4.08 + 0.52 log fCO (R2 = 0.72). Our data imply that the solubility of carbon in silicate melts depends very strongly on whether or not graphite saturation in the gas phase is reached, as the equilibrium with graphite affects the fugacity of CO and CO2. If the equilibrium 2 CO = C + CO2 is attained through graphite precipitation, bulk carbon solubility will be close to the solubility of CO2 over a wide pressure and temperature range, since the gas phase consists mostly of CO2. Only at low pressures of a few 100 MPa or below, the fraction of CO in the gas phase becomes so large that bulk carbon solubility is significantly reduced compared to CO2. Low carbon solubilities may also be observed in situations where graphite precipitation is kinetically inhibited. This could have been the case in the source region of lunar fire fountain eruptions, where dissolved CO may have caused vapor saturation up to 4 km below the lunar surface. We argue that in a Hadean magma ocean on Earth, extensive graphite precipitation and a low atmospheric pressure on the surface could have stabilized a CO-rich atmosphere that may have limited carbon sequestration in the core. We suggest that dissolved CO in glasses may be easily overlooked, because the infrared extinction coefficient for CO (966 ± 229 l mol−1 cm−2 in rhyolite glass) is more than one order of magnitude lower than that of CO2 or carbonate. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon; CO; CO2; graphite; lunar volcanism; magma ocean; primordial atmosphere","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon monoxide; graphite; magma; silicate melt; solubility; volcanism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067601044

Using nationwide regulatory monitoring data of PM2.5 chemical components in South Korea, we aimed to compare the associations between daily exposure to PM2.5 components and mortality across six major cities. We obtained daily 24-h concentrations of PM2.5 and 11 PM2.5 components measured from 2013 to 2015 at single sites located in residential areas. We used death certificate data to compute the daily counts of nonaccidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory deaths. Using the generalized additive model, we estimated relative risks of daily mortality for an interquartile range increase in each pollutant concentration, while controlling for a longer-term time trend and meteorology. While elemental carbon was consistently associated with nonaccidental mortality across all cities, nickel and vanadium were strongly associated with respiratory or cardiovascular mortality in Busan and Ulsan, two large port cities.

We argue that efforts to develop these regional solutions require treating ecological and policy processes as interacting together. Through this approach, policy decisions affect ecological processes, and subsequent ecological changes create feedbacks into policy and political processes. Such a re-orientation can help uncover heretofore hidden “policy triggers”, thereby offering new and perhaps more durable climate solutions. We illustrate this with a case example of the interplay among boreal forest natural resource management policies that created path dependent extractive industries, which in turn, triggered path dependent carbon cycling processes within boreal ecosystems, causing higher carbon emissions. The ability to apply path dependency analysis in general, and identify creative solutions in particular, requires a much more systematic conversation between ecological and policy sciences. We illustrate how path dependent innovations can be identified and triggered, through our own integration of ecological and path dependency analysis: the use of arguably “easy to change, but hard to reverse” policy decisions over hunting licenses. This trigger is not just identified because it is consistent with climate science for managing predator-prey relationships towards lower carbon emissions, but because it holds promise in creating a durable solution even in the face of pressures to reverse course. Hence, the policy is also expected to help lower carbon emissions, in the same way forestry policies (inadvertently) helped increase carbon emissions over a century ago. Our goal is not to argue that this is the only or best solution that might emerge from integrating policy and ecological sciences, but rather to highlight how unforeseen, practical solutions can be nurtured when fostering conversations among largely qualitative historically inclined policy scientists that focus on the complex casual impacts of non-generalizable “critical junctures”, and largely quantitative ecologists seeking general patterns with complex ecosystems. We advance the significant work underway by path dependency focused policy scientists by calling for greater integration of knowledge across these disciplines that currently tend to treat knowledge from the other as “exogenous” shocks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Applied interdisciplinary problem solving; Carbon cycling; Designing policy for ecological punctuations; Large carnivore-ungulate prey interactions; Managing ecosystem carbon sequestration; Path dependency; Policy durability; Policy levers; Progressive incrementalism; Steering a low carbon ecology; Super wicked environmental problems; Sustaining ecosystem functioning","adoption; climate; climate change; conflict management; ecology; environmental policy; human; licence; moose; nonhuman; Note; priority journal; problem identification; problem solving; root cause analysis",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065720607

Alongside the vegetation change, several features of ecosystem functioning, such as ecosystem carbon sink capacity and soil carbon mineralisation rates, may be altered. It has remained largely uninvestigated how the grazing effects on carbon cycling processes depend on the duration of grazing. Here, we hypothesised that grazing affects ecosystem carbon sink through plant-driven processes (for example, photosynthesis) on shorter time-scales, whereas on longer time-scales changes in soil-driven processes (for example, microbial activity) become more important contributing to a decreased carbon sink capacity. To test this hypothesis, we investigated key processes behind ecosystem carbon cycling in an area that recently had become dominated by graminoids due to a high reindeer grazing intensity and compared these to the processes in an area of decades old grazing-induced graminoid dominance and in an area of shrub dominance with little grazer influence. In contrast to our hypothesis, areas of both old and recent grassification showed a similar carbon sink capacity. Yet the individual fluxes varied depending on the time passed since the vegetation shift: ecosystem respiration and mid-season photosynthesis were higher under old than recent grassification. In contrast, the extracellular enzyme activities for carbon and phosphorus acquisition were similar regardless of the time elapsed since grazer-induced vegetation change. These results provide novel understanding on how ecosystem processes develop over time in response to changes in the intensity of herbivory. Moreover, they indicate that both autotrophic and heterotrophic processes are controlled through multiple drivers that likely change depending on the duration of herbivory. © 2018, The Author(s).","carbon balance; CO2 flux; extracellular enzyme activities; herbivory; microbial respiration; reindeer","carbon balance; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sink; deer; ecosystem function; enzyme; enzyme activity; grass; herbivory; respiration; soil carbon; soil respiration; soil-vegetation interaction; subarctic region; tundra; Rangifer tarandus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059548957

Here, we quantify trend detection time and magnitude in gridded total CO2 fluxes - the sum of FFCO2 and natural carbon fluxes - under an idealized assumption that monthly total CO2 fluxes can be perfectly resolved at a 2 2 resolution. Using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) 'business-as-usual' emission scenarios to represent FFCO2 and simulated net biome exchange (NBE) to represent natural carbon fluxes, we find that trend detection time for the total CO2 fluxes at such a resolution has a median of 10 years across the globe, with significant spatial variability depending on FFCO2 magnitude and NBE variability. Differences between trends in the total CO2 fluxes and the underlying FFCO2 component highlight the role of natural carbon cycle variability in modulating regional detection of FFCO2 emission trends using CO2 observations alone, particularly in the tropics and subtropics where mega-cities with large populations are developing rapidly. Using CO2 estimates alone at such a spatiotemporal resolution can only quantify fossil fuel trends in a few places - mostly limited to arid regions. For instance, in the Middle East, FFCO2 can explain more than 75% of the total CO2 trends in ∼70% of the grids, but only ∼20% of grids in China can meet such criteria. Only a third of the 25 megacities we analyze here show total CO2 trends that are primarily explained (&gt;75%) by FFCO2. Our analysis provides a theoretical baseline at a global scale for the design of regional FFCO2 monitoring networks and underscores the importance of estimating biospheric interannual variability to improve the accuracy of FFCO2 trend monitoring. We envision that this can be achieved with a fully integrated carbon cycle assimilation system with explicit constraints on FFCO2 and NBE, respectively. © 2019 The Author(s).

Therefore, buildings within the existing stock and the new buildings are encouraged to achieve the energy performance restrictions and efficiency levels. In this context, a social housing archetype (Harct), which is constructed in each climate region of Turkey with a common design approach for temperate climate region, is evaluated as a base case to improve the energy performance for the cold climate region by the optimization of the life cycle cost (LCC). It is, namely, aimed to not only improve the energy performance of the archetype but also to ensure optimal cost efficiency as significant criterion. It is focused to optimize the façades of the Harct in terms of window width, and optic and thermo-physical properties of the façade with determining the efficient insulation thickness level for exterior walls and efficient glazing types for windows. Firstly, façade design is analysed to find out the minimum and maximum windows' widths to achieve the optimal window sizes. Secondly, optic and thermo-physical properties and cost data of the opaque and transparent façade elements have been designated among the market products in accordance with the current regulations. Energy model of the building has been run by Energy Plus simulation tool, in order to integrate it with GenOpt for optimization. Optimization was performed to carry out efficient frontier cases. The results were evaluated from life cycle cost (LCC) and energy efficiency point of view to highlight the cost optimal point. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

The detailed evaluation of solid waste options is significant not to end up with issues such as shutting down the plants and stopping the investments which may cause serious environmental problems as a result of uncontrolled landfill gas emissions. This research presents a theoretical model for energy recovery from the municipal solid waste (MSW) in Turkey, and the consequent carbon mitigation scenarios and financial strategies regarding the adoption of European Union acquis, respectively. The model predicts the population growth compatible with the baseline scenario of Turkish Statistical Institute data and the MSW generation for each city of Turkey between 2004–2043. The three scenarios, namely open dump, landfill and incineration, are taken into consideration for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy recovery from emissions and economics subject to the Turkish environmental regulations towards the progress of this adoption. The aim of the research is to fulfill the literature gap by proposing practical formulations and realistic models for the mentioned scenarios and considering the energy, economy and ecology nexus based on the regional characteristics of solid waste systems as a consequence of adapting the Turkish MSW regulations and management. Results show that the maximum potential of electricity production is estimated to be 3461–13,450 GW h (0.40–1.56 GW/annum) in the landfill scenario while it is 1572–8386 GW h (0.17–0.96 GW/annum) in the incineration scenario. According to the nationwide projections, Turkey will have consumed the electricity of 437 TW h and 2236 TW h by 2023 and 2043, respectively. While the landfill scenario would meet 0.40–1.40% and 0.15–0.60% of the nationwide electricity production for the interested years, respectively; the incineration scenario would supply 0.06–0.34% and 0.07–0.38% of the nationwide electricity consumption. The maximum total savings for the landfill and incineration scenarios would range from 35.2–66.7 and 32.7–64.5 billion $, respectively in a time horizon at which the total amount of wastes for the corresponding scenarios are equivalent to each other. It is stressed that the landfill scenario would be better for lowering the GHG emissions in case of proper emission control. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon mitigation; Economy; Energy recovery; Solid waste; Turkey","Carbon; Economics; Electric power generation; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Land fill; Population statistics; Recovery; Solid wastes; Waste incineration; Adverse environmental impacts; Carbon mitigation; Economy; Electricity-consumption; Energy recovery; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Regional characteristics; Turkey; Municipal solid waste; carbon; electricity generation; emission control; emissions trading; environmental policy; finance; greenhouse gas; landfill; municipal solid waste; theoretical study; waste management; Article; carbon footprint; ecology; economic aspect; electricity; energy recovery; European Union; hazardous waste site; incineration; landfill; municipal solid waste; population growth; prediction; solid waste management; Turkey (republic); Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064966064

Nonetheless, issues such as poor interface contact with an adjacent perovskite layer and obvious hysteresis phenomenon are bottlenecks that need to be overcome to make carbon-based PSCs (C-PSCs) more attractive in practice. Herein, we report an effective method to enhance the interfacial charge transport of C-PSCs by introducing the CuSCN material into the device. Two types of CuSCN-assisted devices were studied in this work. One was based on the deposition of an ultrathin CuSCN layer between the perovskite absorber layer and the carbon cathode (PSK/CuSCN/C), and the other was by infiltrating CuSCN solution into the carbon film (PSK/C-CuSCN) by taking advantage of the macroporous structure of the carbon. We have found that the CuSCN incorporation by both methods can effectively address the hysteretic feature in planar C-PSCs. The origin for the hysteresis evolution was unraveled by the investigation of the energy alignment and the kinetics of interfacial charge transfer and hole trap-state density. The results have shown that both types of CuSCN-containing devices showed improved interfacial charge carrier extraction, suppressed carrier recombination, reduced trap-state density, and enhanced charge transport, leading to negligible hysteresis. Furthermore, the CuSCN-incorporated C-PSCs demonstrated enhanced device stability. The power conversion efficiency remained 98 and 91% of the initial performance (13.6 and 13.4%) for PSK/CuSCN/C and PSK/C-CuSCN, respectively, after being stored under a high humidity (75-85%) environment for 10 days. The devices also demonstrated extraordinary long-term stability with a negligible performance drop after being stored in air (relative humidity: 33-35%) for 90 days. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","carbon-based; CuSCN; hysteresis; perovskite solar cells; stability","Carbon films; Carrier transport; Cell engineering; Charge transfer; Convergence of numerical methods; Electrodes; Heterojunctions; Hysteresis; organic-inorganic materials; Perovskite; Perovskite solar cells; Phase shift keying; Stability; Carbon-based; CuSCN; Hysteresis phenomenon; Interface engineering; Interfacial charge transfer; Macroporous structures; Organic-inorganic hybrid; Power conversion efficiencies; Copper compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071035790

Since 2013, the WRF-SMOKE-CMAQ model system has been used to build an air quality model system for daily air quality forecasting in Xi'an. The emission inventory was built based on several anthropogenic emission inventories and open access emission datasets, and the model evaluation is presented to verify the emission inventory for particulate matter in Xi'an. Comparing the daily observed and simulated fine particulate (PM2.5)concentrations for four winters in different years (from 2014 to 2017), the model performs well in all studied time periods. The correlation coefficient of the simulated daily PM2.5 concentration data are all larger than 0.58, reaches 0.80 in 2016, and the fraction of predictions within a factor of two of observations (FAC2)are all above 66%. The differences of simulated results based on emission-unchanged system between 2014 and 2015 indicate that the slightly deteriorating air quality of 2015 is affected by the unfavorable air diffusion condition. The PM10 concentration increases from 95.9 μg/m3 to 110.3 μg/m3, and the PM2.5 from 82.4 μg/m3 to 95.4 μg/m3. According to the error analysis in model performance, the serious polluted situation of 2016 is mostly because of the sharp increased dust emissions. The emission-unchanged simulated particulate matter concentrations have little variation from 2015 to 2016, but the observation data increase obviously, that results in dramatically change of Mean Bias (MB). The absolute MB of PM10 increase from 70.3 μg/m3 to 135.2 μg/m3, and PM2.5 from 0.46 μg/m3 to 69.9 μg/m3. While the improved air quality in 2017 is attributed to both the better weather condition and the emission-reductions. The emission-unchanged simulated results decrease, and the absolute MB even have bigger decrease, that of the PM10 concentration reduce by 47μg/m3, and PM2.5 by 37μg/m3. © 2019 The Authors","CMAQ; Model assessment; PM10; PM2.5; Xi'an","Air quality; Emission control; Particles (particulate matter); Smoke; CMAQ; Model assessment; PM10; PM2.5; Xi'an; Particulate emissions; air quality; atmospheric modeling; climate conditions; concentration (composition); dust; emission control; emission inventory; particulate matter; winter; air quality; article; correlation coefficient; diffusion; forecasting; particulate matter; prediction; simulation; smoke; weather; winter; China; Shaanxi; Xian",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065241649

Intensified water cycling and enhanced nutrient export will pose challenges to water quality management and affect multiple Best Management Practices (BMPs)efforts, which are aimed at reducing nutrient loads in SCRB. In addition to the physical impacts of climate change on terrestrial hydrology, our analyses demonstrate significant reductions in ET under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Changes in plant physiology induced by climate change may markedly affect water cycling and associated sediment and nutrient export. Results of this study highlight the importance of examining climate change impacts on water and nutrient delivery for effective watershed management. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Non-point source pollution; Nutrient export; Sediment load; Streamflow","Eutrophication; Greenhouse gases; Nutrients; Quality control; Quality management; River pollution; Rivers; Sediments; Soil conservation; Stream flow; Water conservation; Water management; Water pollution control; Water quality; Watersheds; Best management practice (BMPs); Climate change impact; Climate projection; Non-point source pollution; Nutrient export; Sediment loads; Soil and water assessment tool; Watershed management; Climate change; climate change; nonpoint source pollution; nutrient cycling; sediment transport; streamflow; water management; water quality; article; climate change; nonpoint source pollution; nutrient; pollution control; river basin; sediment; water quality; analysis; chemistry; hydrodynamics; Minnesota; river; standards; theoretical model; trends; water conservation; water cycle; water pollutant; water quality; Wisconsin; Saint Croix River; United States; Climate Change; Conservation of Water Resources; Hydrodynamics; Minnesota; Models, Theoretical; Rivers; Water Cycle; Water Pollutants; Water Quality; Wisconsin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065849847

While China is actively promoting the implementation of large-scale PV generation technology, there is still a lack of scientific knowledge of the generation potential in China. To address this deficiency, this study builds a GIS-based model with 600 land conversion factors incorporated to accurately estimate the large-scale PV power generation potential in China. The results show a potential installed capacity of 1.41 × 105 GW, corresponding to an annual power generation of 1.38874 × 1014 kWh or 21.4 times national electricity consumption in China 2016. If this potential were fully realized as a replacement for current fossil fuel-based power generation in China 2030, a reduction in China's carbon intensity of 63–68% compared to 2005 would result, which is sufficient to meet China's CO2 emission reduction commitment. On a provincial level, while generation potential in Northwest and Inner Mongolia together account for 86% of the total, China's eight economically developed coastal provinces only account for 1%. To achieve a maximum large-scale PV scenario in China 2030, the capacity of inter-regional transmission grids from Northwest region and Inner Mongolia to the regions with insufficient potential should reach an approximate 300 GW. Our study could provide decision-makers with the precise information on large-scale PV power generation map of China, and optimizing low carbon strategies and inter-regional power transmission for achieving sustainable development. © 2019","Geographic information system; Large-scale PV; Renewable energy development; Resource assessment","Carbon; Decision making; Electric power system interconnection; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Large scale systems; Photovoltaic cells; Planning; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Transmissions; CO2 emission reduction; Electricity-consumption; Fossil fuel-based power generation; High spatial resolution; Large-scale PV; Low-carbon transitions; Renewable energy development; Resource assessments; Geographic information systems; alternative energy; carbon emission; economic development; electricity; fossil fuel; GIS; photovoltaic system; power generation; resource assessment; resource development; spatial resolution; sustainable development; China; Nei Monggol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064440856

There are still many locations within different climate zones worldwide that do not have solar radiation measurements. Correlation between solar radiation and the more commonly measured meteorological variables such as temperature and sunshine hours is useful for locations with no measured solar radiation data. This is also useful for locations with measured solar radiation data, in that any missing data due to equipment breakdown or malfunction can be modelled. Global solar radiation (GSR) was modelled for 96 cities in different climate zones across China using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The novelty of this study is the climate zone approach, by which locations with similar climates were modelled together. Climate classification was based on both the traditional thermal climates and the solar climates. Two sets of models were developed based on measured diurnal temperatures and sunshine hours. Model performance in terms of the predictive power of ANN solar radiation models was evaluated through the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSEC). Error analysis of the predicted solar radiation as compared with the measured data was also conducted for each of the 96 cities. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Artificial neural networks; Energy use; Solar and thermal climate zones; Solar radiation; temperatures and sunshine hours","Location; Neural networks; Solar energy; Efficiency coefficient; Energy use; Global solar radiation; Global solar radiation (GSR); Meteorological variables; Solar radiation measurements; Solar radiation model; Sunshine Hour; Solar radiation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072125910

Lead is a typical non-ferrous metal. The lead industry is one of the top 10 water-consuming industries in China and suffers from the heavy burden of properly managing discharged wastewater containing heavy metals and organic pollutants. Accordingly, a water footprint analysis of lead refining was conducted in this study to enhance the water management in China’s lead industry. This study is part 2 of the environmental improvement for lead-refining series. Methods: In accordance with the ISO 14046 standard, life cycle assessment-based water footprint analysis was applied to a lead-refining enterprise in Jiangxi Province, China. Five midpoint (i.e., water scarcity, aquatic eutrophication, carcinogens, non-carcinogens, and freshwater ecotoxicity) and two endpoint (i.e., human health and ecosystem quality) indicators are utilized to assess the water footprint impact results. Results and discussion: Direct pollutant emissions are a major contributor to ecosystem quality and freshwater ecotoxicity, whereas indirect processes (i.e., industrial hazardous waste landfill, transport, and chemicals) contribute considerably to human health, aquatic eutrophication, and carcinogen categories. Chromium, copper, arsenic, and zinc were the key substances in the lead production chain, and their emissions exerted a significant impact on human health and ecosystem quality. Conclusions: Reducing direct copper emission was the most important key to minimizing ecosystem quality decline in China’s lead industry, and optimizing indirect processes was effective in mitigating the impact on human health. Enhancing wastewater treatment, increasing chemical consumption efficiency, optimizing transport and industrial hazardous waste disposal, improving supervision, issuing relevant governmental regulations, and adopting advanced wastewater treatment technologies are urgently needed to control the water footprint. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Direct pollutant emission; Lead refining; Life cycle assessment; Water footprint; Water resource","arsenic; carcinogen; chromium; copper; lead; zinc; Article; China; ecotoxicity; environmental impact assessment; environmental management; environmental monitoring; eutrophication; freshwater environment; hazard assessment; landfill; life cycle assessment; priority journal; waste disposal; waste water management; water analysis; water pollution; water quality; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059692133

Nurses play a critical role in mitigation to prevent the health impacts of climate change. Recommendations to mitigate climate change in higher education institutions reflect four themes: policy, people, process, and practice. This quality improvement project aimed to mitigate a metropolitan nursing school's impacts on climate change. Methods: A Sustainability Champion Workgroup was formed to address gaps identified in the organizational needs assessment. A No Waste November (NWN) campaign and a sustainability dashboard were created to engage participants and increase awareness about climate change and environmentally sustainable behaviors. A pre- and post-NWN survey, adapted from the Nurses' Environmental Awareness Tool, and waste disposal measurements over 6 weeks were used to assess the impact of these interventions. Results: The post-NWN survey showed the greatest increases in mean scores for the following environmentally sustainable behaviors: biking, walking, carpooling, or taking public transportation to work; leading or participating in recycling initiatives; serving on committees that purchase sustainable supplies; and composting. Waste disposal measurements revealed a higher proportion of recycling to landfill waste during 5 out of the 6 weeks of measurement. Conclusion: Nurses and higher education institutions play an important role in mitigating the human impacts on climate change through environmental sustainability initiatives. Barriers to adopting environmentally sustainable behaviors and incentives to support these behaviors also need to be examined and addressed in future projects. © Copyright 2019 Creative Health Care Management.","climate change; environmental sustainability; higher education institution; mitigation; nurses; nursing","adult; article; awareness; climate change; composting; environmental sustainability; female; human; human experiment; human impact (environment); landfill; male; needs assessment; nursing education; recycling; total quality management; walking; waste disposal; environmental protection; nursing education; organization; organization and management; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Humans; Organizational Objectives; Quality Improvement; Schools, Nursing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071418914

In order to analyze the factors that influence the provincial residential indirect carbon emissions in China, comprehensive structural decomposition analysis (SDA) and logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) models are established in this paper. The Liaoning province was selected due to its typical features as a province with higher urbanization rates. The model is based on input-output tables from 2002 to 2012, including those pertaining to the carbon emission coefficient (ΔF), energy intensity effect (ΔE), intermediate demand (ΔL), commodity structure (ΔS), residential consumption structure (ΔU), residential consumption ratio (ΔR), per capita GDP (ΔA) and population size (DP). The results show that the consumption of urban residents is the most common and significant section causing the growth of direct and indirect carbon emissions, both of which show an obvious upward trend. Nonmetal mining is the sector experiencing the greatest growth in indirect carbon emissions. The two most influential factors of indirect carbon emissions via the consumption of rural and urban residents are the intermediate demand effect (ΔL) and the per capita GDP effect (ΔA), respectively. Reducing energy intensity and optimizing commodity structures are the most effective ways to reduce indirect carbon emissions. © 2019 by the authors.","Indirect carbon emission; LMDI decomposition; Residential consumption; SDA decomposition","carbon emission; decomposition analysis; emission control; energy intensity; environmental factor; Gross Domestic Product; input-output analysis; pollution policy; residential development; urbanization; China; Liaoning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070773012

Reductions in tailpipe PM mass have concomitantly reduced accumulation-mode particle emissions. However, some strategies promote the emission of nucleation-mode particles, which are typically quantified on a number (PN)basis. We previously demonstrated that PN emissions from heavy-duty diesel vehicles equipped with various aftertreatment systems were inversely correlated, and gravimetric PM mass was positively correlated, with two in vitro assays. This present work expands on the analysis of PM mass and PN with in vitro assays to also include four additional PM metrics: suspended PM mass, active particle surface area, aggregate particle surface area, and accumulation-mode particle number. This new analysis shows that like gravimetric PM mass, suspended particle mass and accumulation mode particle number are well correlated with dithiothreitol consumption rate (DTT)and macrophage reactive oxygen species consumption rate (ROS)assays (R2 = 0.61–0.96). Data suggest that PM mass emissions dominated by nucleation-mode particles induce equal or slightly greater toxicity compared to PM mass dominated by accumulation-mode particles. Data also show that among all PM metrics, those used for regulating PM in the United States and Europe, namely gravimetric mass and solid PN are overall most correlated with in vitro toxicity. Moreover, continued exploration of alternative, low-cost, and more appropriate PM metrics is warranted to better understand the reproducibility of these findings on other engine applications, fuel types, and aftertreatment platforms. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Health effects; Metrics; Nanoparticles; Particle number; Suspended particle mass; Ultrafine particles","Exhaust systems (engine); Machine design; Nanoparticles; Nucleation; Toxicity; Health effects; Metrics; Particle numbers; Suspended particles; Ultrafine particle; Diesel engines; diesel fuel; dithiothreitol; reactive oxygen metabolite; aggregate; chemical analysis; diesel engine; emission; nanoparticle; particle size; quantitative analysis; reactive oxygen species; surface area; suspended particulate matter; toxicity; Article; controlled study; Europe; in vitro study; macrophage; mass; particle size; particulate matter; reproducibility; surface area; United States; air pollutant; analysis; animal; cell line; drug effect; exhaust gas; metabolism; motor vehicle; particle size; procedures; rat; surface property; toxicity; toxicity testing; Europe; United States; Air Pollutants; Animals; Cell Line; Macrophages; Motor Vehicles; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Rats; Reactive Oxygen Species; Reproducibility of Results; Surface Properties; Toxicity Tests; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065838747

The two heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) were systematically investigated, and the system with H2O2 exhibited higher reactivity for Bisphenol A (BPA) elimination and total organic carbon (TOC) reduction. The two systems were comprehensively compared in terms of degradation kinetics, transformation way, water matrix species and catalyst stability. Systems with H2O2 and PS can remove 100% and 80.2% of the BPA after 120 min (0.22 mmol/L), respectively([H2O2] = 22 mmol/L, [PS] = 22 mmol/L). The oxidant efficiency in system with H2O2 was obviously higher probably due to the less radical scavenging. A mechanism was proposed that the interface interactions between solid and liquid phase will affect the collision among molecular of oxidants and catalyst, as well as the lifetime of radicals during the their diffusion process. The quenching experiments demonstrated that the primary radical species in two systems were ·OHand SO4·-/·OH, respectively, thus causing the different BPA degradation pathways and by-products. The catalyst presented good structural stability and relatively low Fe leaching in both systems during the recycle. The valence state transformation from Fe2+ to Fe3+ after the reaction explained the gradual catalytic activity loss. In the tap water and municipal wastewater, the system with PS was less influenced by the real water matrix due to the lower university of SO4·- toward organics. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Coal fly ash; H2O2; Heterogeneous AOPs; Magnetite; Persulfate; Surface reaction","Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Coal ash; Degradation; Fly ash; Iron oxides; Linear transformations; Magnetite; Organic carbon; Oxidants; Phase interfaces; Phenols; Surface reactions; Advanced oxidation process; Bisphenol a degradations; Coal fly ash; H2O2; Heterogeneous AOPs; Municipal wastewaters; Persulfate; Structural stabilities; System stability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062868329

(2) The occurrence of a distinct seasonal cycle in air pollution which exhibit a sinusoidal pattern of fluctuations and can be described as “heavy winter and light summer.” Although the AQI generally decreased in other seasons, the air pollution intensity increased in winter with the rapid expansion of higher AQI value in the southern of Hebei and Shanxi. (3) The correlation analysis of daily meteorological factors and AQI shows that air quality can be significantly improved when daily precipitation exceeds 10 mm. In addition, except for O3, wind speed has a negative correlation with AQI and major pollutants, which was most significant in winter. Meanwhile, pollutants are transmitted dynamically under the influence of the prevailing wind direction, which can result in the relocation of AQI. (4) According to ESDA-GWR analysis, on an annual scale, car ownership and industrial production are positively correlated with air pollution; whereas increase of wind speed, per capita gross domestic product (GDP), and forest coverage are conducive to reducing pollution. Local coefficients show spatial differences in the effects of different factors on the AQI. Empirical results of this study are helpful for the government departments to formulate regionally differentiated governance policies regarding air pollution. © 2019 by the authors.

Here, we measured the water-soluble inorganic ions (WSII)and carbonaceous species in PM2.5, NH3 and NO2 at multiple sites in Beijing between September and November 2014. Relative to the pre-APEC period (September and October 2014), significant reductions in the average concentrations of WSII (69% for NO3−, 68% for SO42−, 78% for NH4+, and 29–71% for other species), elemental carbon (EC, 43%)and organic carbon (OC, 45%)in PM2.5 were found during the APEC period. The contributions of secondary inorganic ions (SIA, including SO42−, NO3−, and NH4+)to PM2.5 were significantly lower during the APEC period (9–44%), indicating a combination of lower gaseous precursor emissions and a relative weak secondary aerosol formation. Ion-balance calculations indicated that the PM2.5 sample in the pre-APEC period was alkaline but was acidic during the APEC period. Relatively lower mean concentrations of EC (1.5 μg m−3), OC (10.5 μg m−3), secondary organic carbon (SOC, 3.3 μg m−3), secondary organic aerosol (SOA, 5.9 μg m−3)and primary organic aerosol (POA, 10.0 μg m−3)appeared during the APEC period. The average concentrations of NH3 and NO2 at all road sites were significantly reduced by 48 and 60% during the APEC period, which is consistent with clear reductions in satellite NH3 columns over Beijing city in the same period. This finding suggests that reducing traffic emissions could be a feasible method to control urban NH3 pollution. During the APEC period, concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2 and CO from the Beijing city monitoring network showed significant reductions at urban (20–60%)and rural (18–57%)sites, whereas O3 concentrations increased significantly (by 93% and 53%, respectively). The control measures taken in the APEC period substantially decreased PM2.5 pollution but can increase ground O3, which also merits attention. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Ammonia; Chemical components; Emission control; PM2.5","Aerosols; Air pollution; Air quality; Alkalinity; Ammonia; Emission control; Ions; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Urban growth; Average concentration; Carbonaceous species; Chemical component; Economic Co-operation; PM2.5; Secondary organic aerosols; Secondary organic carbon; Water soluble inorganic ions; Quality control; ammonia; carbon; ion; nitrate; nitrogen dioxide; organic carbon; ozone; sulfate; aerosol; air quality; ammonia; Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum; atmospheric pollution; chemical compound; emission control; particulate matter; pollution effect; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution control; air quality; air sampling; Article; China; meteorology; particulate matter; priority journal; rural area; secondary organic aerosol; traffic; urban area; Beijing [China]; China; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Rim; Poa; Sia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065521959

The result is not significantly consistent with EKC hypotheses. The effect of export on air pollutant emissions presented an “inverse-U″ or “increasing linear” shape in eastern China, an “increasing linear” or “inverse-N″ shape in central China, and an “inverse-U″ shape in western China; the export had a promoting effect on air pollutants, which indicates air pollutants transferred into China. The effect of FDI on air pollutants presented an “inverse-U″ shape in eastern China, and a “decreasing linear” shape in western China; the effect of FDI for central China was a “decreasing linear” shape on SO2, an “inverse-N″ shape on NOx, and an “inverse-U″ shape on PM2.5. The FDI reduced air pollutants in all regions, which contradicts to the “pollution haven” hypothesis. On the whole, the industrialization level and population size increased air pollutants, whereas the R&amp;D reduced pollutants; the effects of population urbanization on air pollutants differed among regions.

This study aims to characterize the variability, distributions, and contributions of BB and fungal spores as sources of PM2.5 using a multiple organic tracer approach. PM2.5 samples were collected at four representative sites in Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China every 6 days for one year. In the laboratory, samples were analyzed for three anhydrides (levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan), two sugar alcohols (arabitol and mannitol), water-soluble inorganic ions, and elemental/organic carbon (EC/OC). Levoglucosan was the most abundant BB tracer (mean concentration = 81 ng/m3), and fungal spore tracers arabitol and mannitol had similar abundances (5.6 and 5.7 ng/m3, respectively). Anhydrides and sugar alcohols had high within-group correlations, indicating their respective common sources. Concentrations of tracers displayed large temporal variations but small spatial variations, suggesting strong seasonality in BB and fungal spore sources. BB sources were burning of grass, pine needles, hardwood and crop straw, which were originated from transboundary/cross-region transport and local fire spots. PCA analyses revealed that the common sources of fine aerosols in YRD were secondary inorganic aerosols, soil dust, BB and fungal spores. © 2019 Elsevier LtdBB and fungal spore tracers exhibited strong seasonality and day-to-day variation, respectively; while their spatial variation was small, indicating larger contributions from regional sources. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass burning; Fungal spore; Source identification; Spatial variation; Temporal variation","Aerosols; Biomass; Polyols; Tracers; Biomass-burning; Fungal spores; Source identification; Spatial variations; Temporal variation; Fungi; acid anhydride; arabinitol; galactosan; ion; levoglucosan; mannitol; mannosan; tracer; unclassified drug; carbon; ion; sugar alcohol; aerosol; biomass burning; correlation; fungus; source identification; spatial variation; spore; temporal variation; tracer; aerosol; Article; biomass; burn; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; crop; crop straw; dust; fungus spore; grass; nonhuman; particle size; particulate matter; pine; river; seasonal variation; soil; wood; aerosol; air pollutant; analysis; biomass; environmental monitoring; fire; microbiology; season; China; Yangtze Delta; Aerosols; Air Microbiology; Air Pollutants; Biomass; Carbon; China; Environmental Monitoring; Fires; Ions; Particulate Matter; Rivers; Seasons; Spores, Fungal; Sugar Alcohols",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065476457

A novel concept where coke is injected into the hotter gases for enhancement of fuel gas and reduction of CO2 emissions into air is proposed. Numerical, experimental and industrial investigations are carried out in this work. The effects of injecting mass rate and inserted depth on the mixed state of coke in the flue were numerically evaluated and the effect of the surface structure of coke on the reactions of gas–solid phases was analysed using the t-plot method, and the transient gas products were described during coke injection. The energy change of the flue gas under various injecting schemes was discussed during the tests. The results show that an injecting scheme comprising an injecting pressure of 1.0 MPa, an inserted depth of 500 mm and an injecting mass rate of 18 kg min−1 seems to be better. The value of the specific surface area of coke was 8.36 m2 g−1, while the coal was 20.59 m2 g−1. With the inserted depth at 400 and 500 mm, the recovery time of the flue gas was 545 and 565 s and the total calorific value accounted for 48.47 and 51.53%, respectively.

As a result, this process reduces CO2 emissions and increases energy of the flue gas. © 2018, © 2018 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.","calorific value; CO2 emissions; coke injection; Fuel gas; waste heat","Calorific value; Carbon dioxide; Coke; Energy policy; Flue gases; Flues; Fuels; Gas fuels; Solid state reactions; Waste heat; CO2 emissions; Energy changes; Energy crisis; High temperature; Metallurgical waste; Novel concept; Recovery time; T-plot method; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042214626

However, indirect N2O emissions from agriculture watershed water surfaces are poorly understood. Here, surface-dissolved N2O concentration in water bodies of the agricultural watershed in Eastern China, one of the most intensive agricultural regions, was measured over a two-year period. Results showed that the dissolved N2O concentrations varied in samples taken from different water types, and the annual mean N2O concentrations for rivers, ponds, reservoir, and ditches were 30 ± 18, 19 ± 7, 16 ± 5 and 58 ± 69 nmol L−1, respectively. The N2O concentrations can be best predicted by the NO3−-N concentrations in rivers and by the NH4+-N concentrations in ponds. Heavy precipitation induced hot moments of riverine N2O emissions were observed during farming season. Upstream waters are hot spots, in which the N2O production rates were two times greater than in non-hotspot locations. The modeled watershed indirect N2O emission rates were comparable to direct emission from fertilized soil. A rough estimate suggests that indirect N2O emissions yield approximately 4% of the total N2O emissions yield from N-fertilizer at the watershed scale. Separate emission factors (EF) established for rivers, ponds, and reservoir were 0.0013, 0.0020, and 0.0012, respectively, indicating that the IPCC (Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change) default value of 0.0025 may overestimate the indirect N2O emission from surface water in eastern China. EF was inversely correlated with N loading, highlighting the potential constraints in the IPCC methodology for water with a high anthropogenic N input. The surface indirect N2O emission rates were comparable to direct emission, but the IPCC default emission factor may overestimate indirect N2O emission in the region. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Emission factor; Emission rates; Indirect emission; IPCC; N2O concentrations","Agriculture; Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Lakes; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone layer; Rivers; Agricultural watersheds; Default emission factors; Emission factors; Emission rates; Heavy precipitation; IPCC; Potential constraints; Stratospheric ozone destruction; Watersheds; nitrogen fertilizer; nitrous oxide; surface water; fertilizer; nitrous oxide; concentration (composition); emission; nitrous oxide; water flux; water quality; watershed; agricultural worker; agriculture; Article; carbon footprint; China; concentration (parameter); ditch; environmental factor; geographic and geological phenomena; pond; precipitation; river; season; water supply; watershed; agriculture; air pollutant; analysis; environmental monitoring; procedures; soil; China; Agriculture; Air Pollutants; China; Environmental Monitoring; Fertilizers; Nitrous Oxide; Rivers; Seasons; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065501299

For photothermocatalytic CO2 reduction with CH4 under focused UV-visible-infrared (UV-vis-IR) irradiation, Co/Co-Al2O3 exhibits high light-to-fuel efficiency (27.1%) and production rates of CO and H2 (43.46 and 39.42 mmol min-1 g-1). Even with λ &gt; 690 nm focused vis-IR irradiation, it still exhibits high light-to-fuel efficiency (23.2%) and production rates of CO and H2 (24.62 and 18.97 mmol min-1 g-1). It is found that supporting Co nanoparticles on Co doped Al2O3 nanosheets significantly improves the photothermocatalytic durability compared to a reference catalyst of Co nanoparticles on Al2O3 nanosheets (Co/Al2O3). The improved durability is attributed to the fact that O atoms from Co doped Al2O3 in Co/Co-Al2O3 participate in the oxidation of C∗ species formed by both the complete dissociation of CH4 and the disproportionation of the produced CO as side-reactions of carbon deposition, thus significantly reducing the carbon deposition rate. The high photothermocatalytic activity is attributed to effective light-driven thermocatalysis, substantially boosted by new photoactivation: Co nanoparticles in Co/Co-Al2O3 act as thermocatalytic components. Both Co nanoparticles and Co doped Al2O3 in Co/Co-Al2O3 act as light absorbers due to their strong absorption over the entire solar spectral region. Their efficient photothermal conversion together with the IR heating effect of the focused irradiation causes an elevation in the surface temperature of Co/Co-Al2O3, thus triggering the thermocatalytic reaction. The focused irradiation substantially reduces the activation energy for CO2 reduction by CH4 on Co/Co-Al2O3, thus considerably promoting the catalytic activity. The photoactivation also promotes catalyst durability due to the inhibition of carbon deposition by CO disproportionation. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.",,"Activation energy; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Deposition rates; Durability; Fuels; Irradiation; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Nanosheets; Solar absorbers; Synthesis (chemical); Carbon deposition; Co Nanoparticles; Disproportionations; Photo activations; Photo-thermal conversions; Reference catalyst; Strong absorptions; Surface temperatures; Cobalt; aluminum oxide; catalysis; energy efficiency; fuel cell; infrared radiation; irradiation; nanocomposite; nanoparticle; reduction; ultraviolet radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070980163

The decadal climate prediction experiments (DPEs) by predicting near-term climate with initialized global climate models (GCMs) provide robust skill at predicting sea surface temperature variability in some ocean regions as the North Atlantic. However, the state-of-the-art DPEs, which reproduce the observed warming trend associated with forced climate change, fail at predicting land surface air temperature (SAT) interdecadal variability. Here, we develop an effective statistical-dynamical model to predict spatial and temporal evolutions in Northern-Hemisphere (NH) summer land SAT. We identify two dominant interdecadal variability modes of the NH summer land SAT, whose evolutions are synchronized with forced climate change and Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV), respectively. Based on statistical relationships with physical interpretations, time series of the forced responses and the AMV skillfully predicted by GCMs, the land SAT over the past one hundred years is predicted retrospectively with significantly improved skill compared to that predicted by the DPEs. Our results indicate that the decadal variability of the NH land SAT is predictable, with predictability rooted in atmospheric interdecadal circumglobal teleconnection (CGT) forced by the AMV. More skillful NH climate prediction by DPEs, which would be more practical for stakeholders and decision-makers, can be achieved by improving interdecadal CGT simulations in GCMs. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"decadal variation; Northern Hemisphere; prediction; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; temperature effect; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061594127

The strong crystalline field combined with ultrarelativistic electrons is one of very few cases where the Schwinger field can be experimentally achieved in the electron's rest frame. The radiation being emitted, the so-called channeling radiation, is a well studied phenomenon. However, only the first order diagram corresponding to emission of a single photon has been studied so far. We elaborate on how the two-photon emission process should be understood in terms of a two-step versus a one-step process, i.e., if one can consider one photon being emitted after the other, or if there is also a contribution where the two photons are emitted ""simultaneously."" From the calculated full probability we see that the two-step contribution is simply the product of probabilities for single photon emission while the additional one-step terms are, mainly, interferences due to several possible intermediate virtual states. These terms can contribute significantly when the crystal is thin. Therefore, in addition, we see how one can, for a thick crystal, calculate multiple photon emissions quickly by neglecting the one-step terms, which represents a solution of the problem of quantum radiation reaction in a crystal beyond the usually applied constant field approximation. We explicitly calculate an example of 180 GeV electrons in a thin silicon crystal and argue why it is, for experimental reasons, more feasible to see the one-step contribution in a crystal experiment than in a laser experiment. © 2019 authors.

The method utilizes a measurable variable (predictor) from the recent historical past to obtain a constrained estimate of change in an entity of interest (predictand) at a potential future CO2 concentration (forcing) from multi-model projections. This procedure first critically depends on an accurate estimation of the predictor from observations and models and second on a robust relationship between inter-model variations in the predictor-predictand space. Here, we investigate issues related to these two themes in a carbon cycle case study using observed vegetation greening sensitivity to CO2 forcing as a predictor of change in photosynthesis (gross primary productivity, GPP) for a doubling of preindustrial CO2 concentration. Greening sensitivity is defined as changes in the annual maximum of green leaf area index (LAImax) per unit CO2 forcing realized through its radiative and fertilization effects. We first address the question of how to realistically characterize the predictor of a large area (e.g., greening sensitivity in the northern high-latitude region) from pixel-level data. This requires an investigation into uncertainties in the observational data source and an evaluation of the spatial and temporal variability in the predictor in both the data and model simulations. Second, the predictor-predictand relationship across the model ensemble depends on a strong coupling between the two variables, i.e., simultaneous changes in GPP and LAImax. This coupling depends in a complex manner on the magnitude (level), time rate of application (scenarios), and effects (radiative and/or fertilization) of CO2 forcing. We investigate how each one of these three aspects of forcing can affect the EC estimate of the predictand (Î""GPP). Our results show that uncertainties in the EC method primarily originate from a lack of predictor comparability between observations and models, the observational data source, and temporal variability of the predictor. The disagreement between models on the mechanistic behavior of the system under intensifying forcing limits the EC applicability. The discussed limitations and sources of uncertainty in the EC method go beyond carbon cycle research and are generally applicable in Earth system sciences. © 2019 The Author(s).",,"Carbon; Photosynthesis; Plants (botany); Accurate estimation; Earth system science; Gross primary productivity; High-latitude regions; Measurable variables; Sources of uncertainty; Spatial and temporal variability; Temporal variability; Carbon dioxide; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; climate prediction; concentration (composition); historical record; numerical model; spatial variation; temporal variation; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071243421

The first Dutch geothermal sites proved that Hot Sedimentary Aquifers exploitation can play an important role in a future low-carbon energy mix. In this study, we estimate that with the expansion rate of the past four years, geothermal heat production from Lower Cretaceous Hot Sedimentary Aquifers could cover up to 20% of the heat demand in the province of Zuid-Holland by 2050. Although this is a significant amount, we show in this study that only 1% of the potentially recoverable heat will be recovered by 2050. This is because of inefficient doublet deployment on a ‘first-come, first served’ basis with operational parameters that focus on objectives of small decentralised heat grid demands. Instead, similar to the common-practise approach in the hydrocarbon industry, a regional coordinated ‘masterplan’ approach could be used to increase heat recovery. Utilising numerical simulations for flow and heat transfer in the subsurface, we showed that the heat recovery efficiency could be increased by tens of percentages with such coordinated doublet deployment. Based on calculations of the Levelized Costs Of Heat for both deployment strategies, we also show that current financial support schemes do not favour heat recovery optimisation. This study emphasises that although Hot Sedimentary Aquifer resources have the potential to cover a significant part of our energy demand, a radical change in financial support schemes and legislation are required to unlock their true potential. © 2019 The Authors","Direct-use; Geothermal field-development; Hot Sedimentary Aquifers; Low-carbon heat; Low-enthalpy; Recovery factor; Reservoir engineering","Aquifers; Expansion; Geothermal fields; Geothermal heating; Hydrogeology; Sedimentology; Direct use; Field development; Hot sedimentary aquifers; Low carbon; Low enthalpies; Recovery factors; Reservoir engineering; Waste heat; Cretaceous; energy planning; enthalpy; geothermal energy; geothermal engineering; heat production; heat transfer; legislation; radical; sedimentary structure; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064432769

This is because urban receiving waters are constantly at risk from pollutant inputs via stormwater runoff and wastewater discharge. This research study employed multiple approaches including principal component analysis, Bayesian Networks (BNs)modelling and geospatial analysis to identify patterns in the distributions of nutrients and metals in water and sediments in an urban river and the interactions between the two phases. In both, water and sediments, nutrient concentrations/loads varied in the order of total carbon (TC)> total nitrogen (TN)> total phosphorus (TP). The river sediments were found to contain the highest crustal metal loads, while in water, the marine-related metals had the highest concentrations. The BNs modelling of pollutant interactions between water and sediment phases indicated that nitrogen is more likely to be transferred from water to sediment than the opposite, while anthropogenic metals are more likely to be transferred from sediments to water. Further, geospatial analysis showed that TN, crustal metals and anthropogenic metal loads in sediments increased from upstream to downstream, while having a decreasing pattern in water. However, marine-related metals in both, water and sediments had increasing concentrations/loads from upstream to downstream. These spatial patterns are attributed to the interactions between water and sediment phases, sediment transport along the river and seawater intrusion in the estuarine area. The study outcomes are expected to contribute to enhancing the knowledge required for developing mitigation strategies to improve urban receiving water quality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Metals; Nutrients; Pollutant interactions; River sediments; Urban water pollution","Bayesian networks; Metal analysis; Metals; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Rivers; Sediment transport; Water pollution control; Water quality; Anthropogenic metals; Bayesian Networks (bns); Geo-spatial analysis; Mitigation strategy; Nutrient concentrations; Receiving water quality; River sediments; Wastewater discharge; River pollution; aluminum; barium; calcium; carbon; copper; iron; lead; magnesium; manganese; metal; nickel; nitrogen; phosphorus; potassium; river water; sea water; sodium; zinc; carbon; heavy metal; nitrogen; phosphorus; Bayesian analysis; concentration (composition); fluvial deposit; heavy metal; nutrient; pollutant transport; principal component analysis; river water; spatial analysis; water quality; Article; chemical interaction; concentration (parameter); controlled study; nutrient; river; sediment; sediment transport; urban area; water pollution; water quality; analysis; Bayes theorem; chemistry; China; environmental monitoring; procedures; river; sediment; water pollutant; Bayes Theorem; Carbon; China; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Metals, Heavy; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Rivers; Seawater; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065812779

Community interactions and dynamics among microorganisms, as well as their significance during the manufacturing processes, are central issues in modern food microbiology. Recent studies demonstrated that the emergence of a yeast prion termed [GAR+] in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is induced by coculturing with bacterial cells, resulting in the switching of the carbon metabolism. In order to facilitate mutualistic symbiosis among microorganisms, this mode of microbial interaction is induced between yeasts and lactic acid bacteria species used in traditional sake making. Thus, yeast prions have attracted much attention as novel platforms that govern the metabolic adaptation of cross-kingdom ecosystems.

If climate goals are achieved, China and India will have been the first major economies to develop via renewable energy sources. In this article, we examine the factors of projected population growth, available fossil-fuel reserves, and renewable energy installations required to develop scenarios in which both China and India may increase per capita energy consumption while remaining on trach to meet ambitious climate goals.

Although several carbon fixation pathways are known to exist, on Earth today nearly all global carbon fixation is driven by the Calvin cycle in oxygenic photosynthetic plants, algae, and Cyanobacteria. At other times in Earth history, other organisms utilizing different carbon fixation pathways may have played relatively larger roles, with this balance shifting over geological time as the environmental context of life has changed and evolutionary innovations accumulated. Among the most dramatic changes that our planet and the biosphere have undergone are those surrounding the rise of O2 in our atmosphere—first during the Great Oxygenation Event at ∼2.3 Ga, and perhaps again during Neoproterozoic or Paleozoic time. These oxygenation events likely represent major step changes in the tempo and mode of biological productivity as a result of the increased productivity of oxygenic photosynthesis and the introduction of O2 into geochemical and biological systems, and likely involved shifts in the relative contribution of different carbon fixation pathways. Here, we review what is known from both the rock record and comparative biology about the evolution of carbon fixation pathways, their contributions to primary productivity through time, and their relationship to the evolving oxygenation state of the fluid Earth following the evolution and expansion of oxygenic photosynthesis. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,"oxygen; carbon; carbon dioxide; oxygen; Archean; biology; carbon fixation; Chloroflexi; cyanobacterium; evolution; fossil; geochemical analysis; geological time; methanogenesis; Neoproterozoic; nonhuman; oxygenation; Paleozoic; photosynthesis; priority journal; Review; atmosphere; carbon cycle; chemistry; metabolism; Atmosphere; Biological Evolution; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Dioxide; Cyanobacteria; Earth, Planet; Oxygen",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062267426

The present work introduces the visible light as an external stimulus and for the first time demonstrates that methanol synthesis over Cu/ZnO catalysts can be effectively promoted by solar energy under atmospheric pressure. Experimental and theoretical studies document that hot electrons were photo-excited by localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) on Cu nanoparticles and such photo-excited hot electrons could transfer to ZnO through the metal-support interfaces. The hot electrons on Cu and ZnO synergistically facilitated the activation of reaction intermediates. Consequently, the activation energy was reduced by 40% and the methanol synthesis activity was promoted by 54%.

This study used adjustments to the planting structure in Zhangbei County, China, as an example to evaluate whether the carbon footprint per unit of economic benefit is a suitable indicator of low-carbon agriculture and to determine if low-carbon agriculture is not necessarily low-input non-intensive agriculture. RESULTS: The results showed that total greenhouse gas emissions increased; therefore, the adjustments to the planting structure were ostensibly not a low-carbon process. However, if we obtain the same economic benefit as the actual distribution of the planting industry by adopting the scenario of planting only grain crops, then the annual greenhouse gas emissions would be 1608.00 × 103 t CO2eq, and 5769.94 × 103 ha of farmland would be required. However, if we adopt the scenario of planting only vegetable crops, then only 82.52 × 103 ha of farmland would be required, and the annual greenhouse gas emissions would be 323.52 × 103 t CO2eq. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that the carbon footprint per unit of economic benefit is a suitable indicator to assess agricultural sustainability and that intensive agriculture with high input and high output is a form of low-carbon agriculture if the carbon footprint per unit of economic benefit is low. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry","carbon footprint; climate change; greenhouse gas emissions; low-carbon agriculture","carbon; agricultural land; agriculture; carbon footprint; China; cost benefit analysis; crop; economics; food grain; greenhouse gas; growth, development and aging; metabolism; procedures; sustainable development; vegetable; Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Footprint; China; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Crops, Agricultural; Edible Grain; Farms; Greenhouse Gases; Sustainable Development; Vegetables",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066914866

To promote the development of the biofuel industry, the Chinese central government has set a target that biofuel will account for 15% of transport energy consumption by 2020. The macroeconomic impacts of this policy, however, are unknown. This paper estimates the economic and environmental impacts on Yunnan of meeting this target using a demand-driven input–output model for Jatropha curcas L. biodiesel. The study combines life-cycle analysis and input–output analysis to establish the industrial relationship of the biodiesel sector with other sectors. The results show that meeting the biofuel policy target in 2020 will generate 296,780 thousand job opportunities annually (man-year) and increase household income. Meeting this target will also lower carbon emission by 11.39 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, valued at 2.41 billion Yuan. However, meeting the target will decrease tax revenue by 1.8 billion Yuan and reduce the provincial gross domestic product by 754.95 million Yuan. Thus, the industrialization of J. curcas L. biodiesel can contribute to the development of a green economy and is a positive response to the policies of energy conservation and emission reduction.

Abstract: Biotic interactions between trees and other plants may modulate the responses of alpine treelines to climate. Moderate disturbances could, therefore, accelerate upward shifts of alpine treelines as the climate warms by reducing the coverage of competitor plants and resetting interspecific interactions. Larch (Larix potaninii var. macrocarpa) treelines disturbed by fire on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau are good locales for testing this hypothesis. We characterized treelines in five large rectangular plots spanning undisturbed and fire-disturbed fir (Abies georgei) and larch treelines. The fires in the 1960s caused gaps in the reconstructed age structures of the larches during the 1970s but did not lead to downslope shifts in treeline position. Recruitment has instead increased since the 1980s within the disturbed larch treelines, with treelines shifting upward by 11–44 m. In contrast, the undisturbed larch and fir treeline positions remained mostly unchanged. We hypothesize that upslope shifts of alpine treelines are likely a consequence of climatic warming, but fire disturbances can accelerate these dynamics by altering interspecific interactions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Dendroecology; Fire disturbance; Interspecific competition; Tree recruitment; Treeline shift","Climate change; Fires; Dendroecology; Fire disturbance; Inter-specific competitions; Tree recruitments; Treeline; Forestry; Dynamics; Fires; Forestry; Larix; Plants; Recruitment; Testing; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064036941

In this study, we propose a simple approach to the optimal design of the fly ash and slag mixture in blended concrete that considers the carbon pricing, material cost, strength, workability, and carbonation durability. Firstly, the carbon pricing and the material cost are calculated based on the concrete mixture and unit prices. The total cost equals the sum of the material cost and the carbon pricing, and is set as the optimization's objective function. Secondly, 25 various mixtures are used as a database of optimization. The database covered a wide range of strengths between 25 MPa and 55 MPa and a wide range of workability between 5 and 25 cm in slump. Gene expression programming is used to predict the concrete's strength and slump. The ternary blended concrete's carbonation depth is calculated using the efficiency factors of fly ash and slag. Thirdly, the genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal mixture under various constraints. We provide examples to illustrate the design of ternary blended concrete with different strength levels and environmental CO2 concentrations. The results show that, for a suburban region, carbonation durability is the controlling factor in terms of the design of the mixture when the design strength is less than 40.49 MPa, and the compressive strength is the controlling factor in the design of the mixture when the design strength is greater than 40.49 MPa. For an urban region, the critical strength for distinguishing carbonation durability control and strength control is 45.93 MPa. The total cost, material cost, and carbon pricing increase as the concrete's strength increases. © 2019 by the authors.","CO2 emissions; Cost; Fly ash; Gene expression programming; Genetic algorithm; Slag","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Compressive strength; Concrete mixtures; Construction industry; Durability; Fly ash; Gene expression; Genetic algorithms; Mixtures; Optimal systems; Slags; Sustainable development; CO2 emissions; Construction companies; Controlling factors; Critical strength; Gene expression programming; Objective functions; Strength increase; Ternary blended concretes; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070592483

However, the underestimation of high PM2.5 concentrations problem is still exist in heavily polluted Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (JingJinJi)region due to AOD cannot adequately represent the correlation between high PM2.5 concentrations and independent variables and neglected the effects of missing AOD. Thus, the long- and short-term PM2.5 exposure risk estimate was reduced. This work introduces gaseous pollutant data (NO2, SO2, CO, and O3)related to primary emission and secondary transformation of pollutants as predictors into a deep neural network model to improve the underestimation of high PM2.5 concentrations based on AOD and meteorological factors. We predicted the PM2.5 concentration in the missing AOD areas, generated a daily continuous PM2.5 spatial distribution, and reduced estimated bias due to AOD deficiency. Grid-based 10-fold cross-validation (CV)was used to test the model performance. Results show that daily PM2.5 concentration CV R2 is 0.87 and the root-mean-square prediction error (RMSE)is 27.11 μg/m3. The CV R2 and RMSE are higher by 0.12 and lower by 9.72 μg/m3 than the model without gaseous pollutants (GASS)as predictors. In including the missing AOD, the average concentration of PM2.5 CV R2 is 0.86 and the RMSE is 16.95 μg/m3 in heavy polluted winter; the CV R2 and RMSE are higher by 0.07 and lower by 3.95 μg/m3, respectively, than when the missing AOD was excluded.

The light-saturated net photosynthetic rates of both ash and maple, the saturated intercellular CO2 concentration of ash, and the light saturation point, CO2-saturated net photosynthetic rate and maximum carboxylation rate of maple significantly decreased in impervious pavement, indicating that both the capacity of leaf photosynthesis and utilization of high light and CO2 concentrations were significantly reduced by land pavement. The down-regulation of photosynthesis in the impervious pavement was mainly due to the reduction of available soil water. Photosynthetic parameters of maple showed more sensitivity to the land pavement than those of ash.

While afforestation supports long-term ecosystem services like carbon sequestration and the reduction of soil and water loss, it also reduces the amount of available arable land, putting financial pressure on those who depend on it for their livelihoods. In an effort to balance both ecological and economic benefits, regional governments offer financial compensation to farmers to offset these pressures in the form of a dollar amount per hectare of reforested land. The current study explores participants' willingness to accept pay (WTA), along with the difference between the offered per hectare compensation and the amount deemed acceptable by RFFP participants in the region. To this end, 92 households from the representative afforestation area were surveyed in Huining County, Gansu Province, China - an area of strategic ecological importance in the Loess Plateau. The results showed 12.0% of the surveyed respondents to be satisfied with the current compensation policy, while 88.0% of respondents were not. The respondents' lower and upper WTA limits were $221/ha/year and $1331/ha/year, respectively, with an averageWTAof $777/ha/year. The compensation that respondents would be most willing to accept was distributed in the $444-888/ha/year and the $889-1331/ha/year ranges, accounting for 37.0% and 31.5% of the total responses, respectively. Gender, age, and education were found to be the main factors influencing a respondents' WTA. Results of the survey suggest that the actual compensation amount ($355/ha/year) is much lower than respondents' WTA, and that compensation measures and policies should be improved to guarantee a basic income. © 2019 by the authors.","Afforestation; Ecological benefits; Economic benefits; Rural development; Willingness to accept pay","Conservation; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Land use; Reforestation; Regional planning; Afforestation; Ecological benefits; Economic benefits; Rural development; Willingness to accept; Surveys; carbon sequestration; compensation system; economic conditions; ecosystem service; restoration ecology; rural development; urban forestry; willingness to pay; China; Conservation; Ecosystems; Land Use; Reforestation; Surveys; China; Gansu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071129366

The foot of the wave analysis (FOWA) for cyclic voltammetry, recently developed by Saveánt and Costentin, provides a powerful means to evaluate the performance of molecular electrocatalysts. However, there is a considerable amount of confusion in the community on how to interpret FOWA in multielectron electrochemical reactions. Herein, we further expand their earlier models from the Nernstian region to all scenarios (i.e., including non-Nernstian behavior) and systematically examine individual parameters, such as formal potentials and reaction rate constants, to explore deeper insights and limitations. Detailed analysis from in silico voltammograms based on different mechanistic models reveals characteristic features of FOWA traces for different kinetic phenomena, which is useful to diagnose kinetic profiles and elucidate the limits of FOWA. The lessons learned from these analyses are further used to reconcile the discrepancy of rate constants determined by FOWA versus other methods, such as time-resolved spectroscopy, for molecular electrocatalysts that catalyze proton reduction or the reduction of CO2 to CO. Such reconciliation demonstrates that electrochemical methods along with FOWA can serve as an alternative tool to determine kinetic information and probe mechanistic insights, which otherwise may be challenging and complicated to achieve by conventional methods. In addition, general guidelines and warnings are also presented to avoid potential errors or mishandling when using FOWA.

Under this model, provinces paid huge pollutant removal costs because they could not select the optimal pollutant removal rate based on their emission reduction capacity and their marginal cost of pollutant reduction. To overcome the ineffectiveness and high cost of the IER model, a generalized Nash equilibrium game (GNEG)model was constructed to achieve the State-set regional emission reduction target while minimizing the pollutant removal cost for each sub-region. Next, the case of Yangtze River Delta region was investigated using the GNEG model. Further, an incentive mechanism was suggested to improve the willingness of all participants. Result shows that the optimal SO2 removal solution in the GNEG model saved US$4.8 × 107 compared with the IER model, amounting to 3.1% of the total pollutant removal cost. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed to simulate the effects of changes in the State-set SO2 reduction targets and the upper and lower bounds on the optimal pollutant removal rate and the removal cost of each province. The proposed model will help policy makers develop pollutant-reduction strategies that improve the effectiveness and economic benefits of pollution control. © 2019","Air pollutant reduction; Generalized Nash equilibrium problem; Regional air pollution; Yangtze River Delta region","Air pollution; Computation theory; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Emission control; Game theory; Sensitivity analysis; Storm sewers; Air pollutants; Emission reduction targets; Generalized Nash equilibrium; Generalized Nash equilibrium problems; Incentive mechanism; Regional air pollution; Upper and lower bounds; Yangtze river delta; River pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066122603

In order to provide molecular insights on the effect of combustion environments on the formation of gas-phase species, in this paper, we study the temporal and spatial dependence of soot precursors growth mechanisms in an ethylene/oxygen/argon counterflow diffusion flame. As computational tools of investigation, we included fluid dynamics simulations and stochastic discrete modeling. Results show the relative importance of various reaction pathways in flame, with the hydrogen-abstraction-acetylene-addition mechanism contributing to the formation of pure hydrocarbons near the stagnation plane, and oxygen chemistry prevailing near the maximum temperature region, where the concentration of atomic oxygen reaches its peak and phenols, ethers and furan-embedded species are formed. The computational results show excellent agreement with measurements obtained using aerosol mass spectrometry coupled with vacuum-ultraviolet photoionization. Knowledge acquired in this study can be used to predict the type of compounds formed in various locations of the flame and eventually provide insights on the environmental parameters that influence the growth of soot precursors. Additionally, the results reported in this paper highlight the importance of modeling counterflow flames in two or three dimensions to capture the spatial dependence of growth mechanisms of soot precursors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"Aromatic compounds; Ethylene; Gas dynamics; Gases; Mass spectrometry; Oxygen; Soot; Stochastic systems; Aerosol mass spectrometry; Chemical and physical characteristics; Counterflow diffusion flames; Environmental parameter; Fluid dynamics simulations; Polycyclic aromatic compounds; Stochastic discrete model; Vacuum ultraviolet photoionization; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064699014

However, ozone (O 3 )pollution was found to steadily deteriorate in most part of eastern China, especially in developed regions such as Jing-Jin-Ji (JJJ), Yangtze River Delta region (YRD)and Pearl River Delta region (PRD). To shed more light on current O 3 pollution and its responses to precursor emissions, we integrate satellite retrievals, ground-based measurements together with regional numerical simulation in this study. It is indicated by multiple sets of observational data that NO x in eastern China has declined more than 25% from 2012 to 2016. Based on chemical transport modeling, we find that O 3 formation in eastern China has changed from volatile organic compounds (VOCs)sensitive regime to the mixed sensitive regime due to NO x reductions, substantially contributing to the recent increasing trend in urban O 3 . In addition, such transitions tend to bring about an ~1–1.5 h earlier peak of net O 3 formation rate. We further studied the O 3 precursors relationships by conducting tens of sensitivity simulations to explore potential ways for effective O 3 mitigation. It is suggested that the past control measures that only focused on NO x may not work or even aggravate O 3 pollution in the city clusters. In practice, O 3 pollution in the three regions is expected to be effectively mitigated only when the reduction ratio of VOCs/NO x is greater than 2:1, indicating VOCs-targeted control is a more practical and feasible way. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Emission sensitivity; Ozone pollution; Policy application; WRF-CMAQ","Air pollution; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Urban transportation; Volatile organic compounds; Chemical transport models; Ground based measurement; Ozone pollution; Pearl River Delta region; Satellite retrieval; Sensitivity Simulation; WRF-CMAQ; Yangtze river delta; River pollution; nitrogen oxide; volatile organic compound; atmospheric pollution; emission control; nitrogen oxides; ozone; policy implementation; pollution monitoring; volatile organic compound; air pollution control; Article; China; environmental monitoring; feasibility study; ozone layer; priority journal; process model; trend study; urban area; China; Guangdong; Jingjinji; Yangtze Delta; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065123187

European technology in wood pellet boilers was introduced into the United States over the past decade. However, these systems need to be designed and operated to minimize the emissions of air pollutants, particularly airborne particulate matter. One approach to minimize emissions is to improve system efficiency and limit the number of boiler cycles that include start-up and shut down periods where emission rates are higher by utilizing thermal storage as part of the boiler system. In this study, emissions from two 25 kW European-designed, but U.S. manufactured wood pellet boilers (PB and WPB) with thermal energy storage (TES) were measured in actual home operation using the EPA CTM-039 stack sampling method. These measurements allowed the estimation of the emissions reductions due to the presence of TES. PB had much higher emissions than WPB because PB had frequent local oxygen deficit-induced non-uniform combustion, which highlights the significance of periodic onsite oxygen tuning after the boiler installation. Particulate emissions were dominated by PM 2.5 and the particles mainly consisted of low melting point, alkali compounds such as K 2 SO 4 , KCl, Na 2 SO 4 , CaCl 2 , etc. Both PM 2.5 and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emissions increased linearly with CO because they are products of incomplete combustion. Optimum boiler operating conditions were found with 12% flue gas oxygen content for both systems to achieve minimum CO emissions, which is 2% higher than the manufacturer's set-point of 10%. The potential emissions reductions by using a system with TES instead of a non-TES system were estimated under three scenarios. The results showed both significant gaseous and particulate matter emissions reductions that demonstrate that modern, high-efficiency wood pellet boilers with TES systems can produce heat with lower total emissions compared to non-TES systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Emissions characterization; Emissions reduction; Thermal energy storage (TES); Wood pellet boiler","Air pollution; Boilers; Combustion; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Heat storage; Housing; Oxygen; Particles (particulate matter); Pelletizing; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Potash; Sodium sulfate; Thermal energy; Thermography (temperature measurement); Wood; Airborne particulate matters; Emissions reduction; Flue gas oxygen content; High efficiency and low emission; Incomplete combustion; Particulate matter emissions; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Wood pellet; Particulate emissions; calcium chloride; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; potassium chloride; potassium sulfate; sodium sulfate; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; biomass power; carbon emission; combustion; emission control; energy storage; PAH; particulate matter; residential energy; Article; boiler; carbon footprint; combustion; energy resource; flue gas; melting point; oxygen consumption; particulate matter; priority journal; thermogenesis; wood pellet boiler; air pollutant; analysis; chemistry; devices; heating; procedures; wood; United States; Air Pollutants; Heating; Particulate Matter; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064943744

When the supercritical CO2 flows back after fracturing, the formation water is lifted by the upward movement of CO2. Since the pressure gradually decreases along the wellbore and the temperature also decreases due to the CO2 expansion, it is easy to result in the formation of hydrate under the conditions of high pressure and low temperature. In order to prevent the clogging of the wellbore due to CO2 hydrate, the wellbore temperature and pressure need to be predicted and regulated. Based on the Span-Wagner CO2 gas state equation and the Fenghour gas transport equation, combined with the classical wellbore flow heat transfer model, a supercritical CO2 fracturing flowback wellbore flow model with heat source and sink considered is developed, the dual coupling solution of axial and radial borehole is realized by iterating the pressure and temperature and coupling of tubing-annulus-formation. The results show that the wellbore pressure and temperature both decrease from the bottom to the top of the well, which is similar to the flow in oil and gas production. The parameters such as discharge output, tubing size, formation temperature gradient and pressure gradient have a great influence on the wellbore temperature and pressure. The reduction of the discharge output and the increase of the tubing size can effectively keep the wellbore temperature high and reduce the risk of CO2 hydrate formation. The discharge time has almost no effect on the wellbore pressure, and only slightly affects the wellbore temperature. The results can provide guidance for the study of supercritical CO2 fracturing flowback. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Flowback; Fracturing; Supercritical CO2; Wellbore pressure; Wellbore temperature","Carbon dioxide; Equations of state; Fracture; Fracturing (fossil fuel deposits); Heat transfer; Hydration; Oil field equipment; Oil wells; Temperature; Tubing; Flowback; Formation temperature; Oil and gas production; Pressure and temperature; Supercritical CO2; Waterless technology; Wellbore pressure; Wellbore temperature; Boreholes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065084620

The high resolution (2 km × 2 km) data used was obtained via a remote sensing satellite (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) and verified by comparing it with average annual SO2 data recorded in ground monitoring stations. The correlation was found to be up to 0.95. Moreover, the data was cross-correlated with national and regional inventories of pollution sources. The results show that the regional characteristics of the spatial distribution obtained are consistent and the detailed characteristics are highly coincidental. Based on this, the new and detailed spatiotemporal variation was analyzed and the effect of emission reduction in urban agglomerations on the SO2 concentration in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China investigated. The results demonstrate that the distribution of SO2 pollution in the PRD has been transformed over the period studied. In the early stages, it had a traditional high-concentration type of distribution (with agglomeration areas like Guangzhou and Foshan as high-concentration pollution centers) and this has changed to the currently-observed low-concentration decentralized type of distribution (mainly distributed along administrative boundaries). In the last 10 years, significant SO2 emission reduction has occurred in prefecture-level cities, e.g., Foshan, Zhongshan, and Guangzhou (with emission-reduction amplitudes of 71%, 65%, and 57%, respectively). Foshan and Zhongshan are the top two prefecture-level cities in the PRD region in terms of significant reduction in rate of SO2 contribution. The SO2 contribution rate fell from 17% to 13% in Foshan and from 16% to 10% in Zhongshan. However, the relative contribution rates in Zhaoqing and Huizhou increased from 7% to 11% and from 6% to 10%, respectively. The size of the emission reduction and changes in SO2 contribution rates in the prefecture-level cities in the PRD region show that the government’s efforts to improve air quality have had a significant effect. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Assessment of emission reduction; Pearl river delta; Satellite remote �sensing; Sulfur dioxide","Agglomeration; Air quality; Emission control; Gems; Remote sensing; Rivers; Sulfur dioxide; Emission reduction; Ozone monitoring instruments; Pearl River delta; Pearl River Delta region; Regional characteristics; Remote sensing satellites; Spatio-temporal variation; Spatiotemporal characteristics; River pollution; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; image resolution; pixel; pollution incidence; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; spatiotemporal analysis; sulfur dioxide; China; Foshan; Guangdong; Guangzhou; Zhaoqing; Zhongshan; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073363720

Nonetheless, there remain uncertainties about their carbon storage estimations due to mangrove carbon-cycle processes affected by the interactions among climatic factors, hydro-geomorphic settings, and mangrove species. This study aimed to quantify how ecosystem carbon storage (ECS) (i.e., vegetation biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC)) was affected by intertidal locations and climatic factors based on new and published data from different latitudinal zones. Landward mangrove communities accumulated significantly higher carbon in both vegetation and soil compared with seaward mangrove communities. Average ECS of Dongzhai Harbor, Yingluo Bay, and Dongjiang Estuary were 351.35 Mg ha−1, 306.93 Mg ha−1, and 162.04 Mg ha−1, respectively. ECS values were underestimated because SOC storage accounting for more than 60% of ECS was only estimated on the top 100-cm sediment in this study. Compared with upland forests, there was remarkably higher SOC storage in mangroves, especially in Dongzhai Harbor and Yingluo Bay. Regression analysis indicated that ECS nonlinearly decreased as latitude increased. ECS significantly enhanced as air temperature of the coldest month (Tmin) and mean annual precipitation (Pmean) increased on a global scale, suggesting that Tmin and Pmean were the major controls of ECS. Nevertheless, ECS of mangroves in China was significantly correlated with mean annual air temperature (Tmean) and Tmin at a filed scale, and was nonlinearly increased as Tmin and Tmean increased. Therefore, the influencing factor of ECS spatial patterns was partly affected by statistical scales. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biomass; Carbon storage; Climate; Mangroves; Soil organic carbon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066244501

We modeled current and future potential distributions of invasive alien plant species using bioclimatic variables in the program Maxent. Our study found that global climate change would not lead to plant invasions in every conservation area, but it would provide the conditions for few invasive plant species to impact conservation areas in some regions. Greenhouse gas concentrations could aggravate the regional invasion of invasive plant species and make larger changes of ability of invasive plant species to invade conservation areas in low gas concentration scenario than high gas concentration scenario.

Aerobic co-metabolism strategy relying on methane-oxidizing bacteria is quite attractive to bioremediate TCE contaminated site because no toxic intermediates are produced. Methane monooxygenase (MMO)produced by these methanotrophs can transform TCE into unstable TCE epoxides to accelerate the TCE removal rate. To investigate the potential of applying TCE aerobic co-metabolism strategy in Taiwan, methanotrophic consortia from chloroethenes contaminated groundwater were enriched in this study. Their bacterial communities and MMO genes were analyzed. The selected enriched methanotrophic consortia were then used to evaluate the feasibility of TCE aerobic co-metabolism in batch experiments. The bacterial community diversities significantly declined and methane-oxidizing bacteria became dominant after acclimation. Methane was consumed by all methanotrophic consortia during acclimation and, at the same time, the functional genes mxaF, mmoX and pmoA were successfully amplified from all consortia, except for gene mmoX of consortium C, after enrichment.

However, little is known about how the soil microbial communities associated with paddy soil CH4 emissions respond to biochar aging after biochar amendment. In this study, we examined the effects of biochar on CH4 emissions, soil properties, and abundance/community composition of methanogens and methanotrophs in a double rice cropping system from 2012 to 2016. Straw-derived biochar was applied once in 2012 at 24 and 48 t ha−1. Biochar application decreased the annual CH4 emissions by 20–51%. Biochar increased the abundances of both methanogens and methanotrophs, with a larger increase of methanotrophs than methanogens in the first year, mainly caused by the increases in soil dissolved organic carbon, NH4 +-N, and porosity. Biochar suppressed the abundance of methanogens and had little effect on the methanotrophs in the following three years, probably due to the increased soil porosity. Eventually, the ratios of abundance of methanogens to methanotrophs decreased by 11–31% in each of the four years and were positively correlated to CH4 emissions. Biochar addition increased the relative abundances of Methanocella and Methanospirillum and reduced those of Methanoregula and Methanosaeta for methanogens, while it increased the proportion of the basophilic methanotrophs Methylomicrobium and decreased that of Methylocaldum in the growing season 2014. Our results demonstrate that biochar aging greatly alters the responses of abundances and community compositions of soil methanogens and methanotrophs to biochar addition. The reduction of CH4 emissions owing to biochar in the long run was probably mainly due to the lesser suppression of abundance and activity of methanotrophs compared with methanogens. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biochar; CH4; Methanogen; Methanotroph; Paddy soil","Organic carbon; Porosity; Soils; Bio chars; Community composition; Dissolved organic carbon; Methanotrophs; Paddy soils; Relative abundance; Rice cropping systems; Soil microbial community; Methanogens; agricultural emission; biochar; double cropping; methane; methanogenic bacterium; methanotrophy; microbial activity; paddy field; reduction; rice; soil amendment; Methanosaeta; Methanospirillum; Methylocaldum; Methylomicrobium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066072537

Gliding arc plasma reformer at atmospheric pressure has been developed for converting n-heptane to hydrogen. The system has been evaluated by H2 yield and energy yield via continuous n-heptane oxidative reforming at room temperature. Effects of some process parameters (discharge gap, input power, residence time, and O/C) have been studied on the reaction performance. The maximum H2 yield and energy yield are 50.1% and 94.5 L (kW h)−1. To investigate the role of inert gas (N2, Ar) in the plasma oxidative reforming system, the performance of C7H16/air, C7H16/N2/O2/Ar and C7H16/O2/Ar have been investigated. The results show that N2 (B3Πg) and Ar∗ can accelerate the formation of active oxygen species (such as O+, O (1D) and O). The presence of active oxygen species promotes the progress of the oxidative reforming reaction. What's more, N2 (B3Πg) is also conducive to the direct conversion of n-heptane.

The complexity of the global shipping system makes predicting volumes and patterns of long-term future international maritime trade a challenging task which is best explored by building scenarios rather than ‘precise’ forecasts. We present four contrasting scenarios of international maritime trade out to 2050, available in high resolution in terms of the dimensions studied (regions, countries, commodities, decades), which are consistent with high and low levels of global CO2 mitigation and associated climate impacts. The scenarios project trade increasing to between two and four times the 2010 value by 2050. Scenarios characterised by low temperature increases and material intensity lead to the lower bound trade increase with high trade growth in bioenergy commodities. Unfettered production growth across countries, high temperature increases and material intensity lead to a quadrupling of trade across energy, containerised, dry and wet commodities. The estimated range is lower than those in existing scenarios and forecasts in which globalisation is assumed to continue apace. The scenarios which project the highest growth presupposes both limited decarbonisation (in contrast to the Paris Agreement) and continued growth in expanding markets. The scenarios therefore become a valuable policy and decision-making tool to address technological and operational change required of the shipping sector, if it is to deliver mitigation in line with the Paris Agreement. © 2019",,"adaptive management; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate effect; global climate; maritime trade; shipping; trade-off",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065923255

However, recently in the Oya area, local government has tackled with the revitalization of the area utilizing abundant underground water of the Oya-stone quarry, which was once a facility of Oya-stone industry. For example, the place in which groundwater is accumulated in the quarry is utilized for underground lake cruise. Also, attention has been recently paid to the fact that the average water temperature of the quarry groundwater is about 7 degrees lower than that of ordinal groundwater, and business projects utilizing the quarry groundwater as a heat source for heat exchange system have recently been promoted by local government. As well as those approaches for revitalization, local government of Utsunomiya city has been tackling with reuse of empty houses. Therefore, this study explores the possibility of region revitalization utilizing regional resources in the Oya area, evaluating proposed empty house utilization that makes use of the quarry groundwater as a heat source of heat exchange system from the viewpoint of environmental burden. In this study, we investigated buildings in the Oya area, and made a building information database. Assuming a case where a empty house is renovated and utilized as a restaurant that is short in Oya area, Eight buildings with different insulation performance and air conditioning method were modeled using the building information database. We evaluated the lifecycle CO2 emissions of those building models when utilized. As a result, it is estimated that about 70% of CO2 emissions can be reduced by improving insulation performance and air conditioning system and by utilizing quarry groundwater as heat source of heat exchange system. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air conditioning; Building materials; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Electric circuit breakers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Heat exchangers; Houses; Life cycle; Quarries; Sustainable development; Agricultural land; Environmental burdens; Heat exchange systems; Information database; Insulation performance; Local government; Regional resources; Water temperatures; Heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071879825

These changes in the amount of O2 are large enough to have led to changes in atmospheric mass, which may alter the radiative budget of the atmosphere, leading to this mechanism being invoked to explain discrepancies between climate model simulations and proxy reconstructions of past climates. Here, we present the first fully 3-D numerical model simulations to investigate the climate impacts of changes in O2 under different climate states using the coupled atmosphere-ocean Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model version 3 (HadGEM3-AO) and Hadley Centre Coupled Model version 3 (HadCM3-BL) models.We show that simulations with an increase in O2 content result in increased global-mean surface air temperature under conditions of a pre-industrial Holocene climate state, in agreement with idealised 1-D and 2-D modelling studies. We demonstrate the mechanism behind the warming is complex and involves a trade-off between a number of factors. Increasing atmospheric O2 leads to a reduction in incident shortwave radiation at the Earth's surface due to Rayleigh scattering, a cooling effect. However, there is a competing warming effect due to an increase in the pressure broadening of greenhouse gas absorption lines and dynamical feedbacks, which alter the meridional heat transport of the ocean, warming polar regions and cooling tropical regions. Case studies from past climates are investigated using HadCM3-BL and show that, in the warmest climate states in the Maastrichtian (72.1-66.0 Ma), increasing oxygen may lead to a temperature decrease, as the equilibrium climate sensitivity is lower. For the Asselian (298.9-295.0 Ma), increasing oxygen content leads to a warmer global-mean surface temperature and reduced carbon storage on land, suggesting that high oxygen content may have been a contributing factor in preventing a ""Snowball Earth"" during this period of the early Permian. These climate model simulations reconcile the surface temperature response to oxygen content changes across the hierarchy of model complexity and highlight the broad range of Earth system feedbacks that need to be accounted for when considering the climate response to changes in atmospheric oxygen content. © 2019 Author(s).

The addition of petroleum resins into the treated solution depresses the crystallization of hydrocarbons and favours the reduction of structural-mechanical characteristics of the system. The transition of the excited state of systems after the removal of the ultrasonic load to an equilibrium state occurs in time, and the nature of the change in the rheological characteristics and microstructure of paraffin crystals depends on the composition of the dispersion medium.

A device for air heating of the soil in protected ground conditions, designed to increase yield and reduce the energy intensity of vegetable growing in the protected ground, is developed by the fellow workers of the FSBEI of Higher Education Pskov State University. The device consists of assembled segments, combined in a system, and a special fan heater with a low temperature range. The proposed device allows to ensure an intensive development of the root system of vegetable crops; to hasten the planting time of seeds or seedlings, and, consequently, to increase a fruiting period; to prevent death of plants associated with frost and diseases, caused by temperature changes; and to reduce the cost of heating of the protected ground. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

We used natural 13C abundance to investigate the carbon-use process for the ring development in a temperate deciduous (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) and a Mediterranean evergreen (Quercus ilex L.) oak. The sapwood carbon reserves, phloem sucrose contents, stem respired CO2 efflux and their respective carbon isotope compositions (δ13C) were recorded over 1 year, in the native area of each species. The seasonal δ13C variation of the current year ring was determined in the total ring throughout the seasons, as well as in slices from the fully mature ring after the growth season (intra-ring pattern). Although the budburst dates of the two oaks were similar, the growth of Quercus ilex began 50 days later. Both species exhibited growth cessation during the hot and dry summer but only Q. ilex resumed in the autumn. In the deciduous oak, xylem starch storage showed clear variations during the radial growth. The intra-ring δ13C variations of the two species exhibited similar ranges, but contrasting patterns, with an early increase for Q. petraea. Comparison between δ13C of starch and total ring suggested that Q. petraea (but not Q. ilex) builds its rings using reserves during the first month of growth. Shifts in ring and soluble sugars δ13C suggested an interspecific difference in either the phloem unloading or the use of fresh assimilate inside the ring. A decrease in ring δ13C for both oaks between the end of the radial growth and the winter is attributed to a lignification of ring cell walls after stem increment. This study highlighted the differences in carbon-use during ring growth for evergreen and deciduous oaks, as well as the benefits of exploring the process using natural 13C abundance. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Range anxiety is an obstacle to the acceptance of electric vehicles caused by driver’s uncertainty regarding their vehicle’s state of charge and the energy required to reach their destination. Another one of the shortcomings of Electric Vehicle technologies is the high cost of batteries. Any enhancement in such points will make Electric Vehicles a well-built competitor for IC engines. The material cost for the Zebra battery is much lower compared with lithium batteries. In addition the cycle life better than 1000 cycles in zebra battery.

Hence, SOC stock is a key component for the supply of many ecosystem services (SOC-mediated ES), such as erosion protection, nutrient cycling, water regulation, and climate regulation. Land use changes from natural ecosystems into agricultural systems generally deplete SOC stocks. Therefore, agricultural production usually involves trade-off relations with SOC-mediated ES supply. This paper assessed the trade-offs between agricultural production and SOC-mediated ES supply in six sub-regions of Argentina: East Southern Pampa, West Southern Pampa, Flooding Pampa, Central Pampa, Rolling Pampa and Semiarid Chaco. In the Semiarid Chaco, overall SOC-mediated ES supply had the highest sensitivity to SOC changes, and the lowest sensitivity to natural cover removal. In East Southern Pampa, overall SOC-mediated ES supply had the lowest sensitivity to SOC changes and the highest to natural cover removal. The differences in sensitivity of overall SOC-mediated ES supply to the changes in SOC could be explained by soil texture, which is finer at East Southern Pampa. The differences in sensitivity of overall SOC-mediated ES supply to natural cover removal could be associated with the initial SOC stocks, which is lower in the Semiarid Chaco. The high sensitivity of SOC-mediated ES to SOC change and the low levels of SOC-mediated ES supply found in the Semiarid Chaco sub-region suggests that it is a highly fragile environment. The agricultural expansion over natural areas led to trade-offs between production and SOC-mediated ES supply. However, increasing crop yields would lead to win-win situations, by positive effects on agricultural production and SOC-mediated ES supply. Hence, agricultural production should be increased by increasing crop yields rather than expanding cropland and/or pasture over natural areas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Chaco Region; Deforestation; Land use change; Pampean Region; Soil organic matter; Sustainability","Crops; Deforestation; Economic and social effects; Land use; Organic carbon; Soils; Sustainable development; Textures; Agricultural expansion; Agricultural productions; Chaco regions; Erosion protections; Land-use change; Pampean Region; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic matters; Ecosystems; agricultural production; deforestation; ecosystem service; land use change; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil texture; sustainability; trade-off; Argentina; Chaco [Argentina]; Pampas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064198082

We assessed whether short-term exposure to gamma radiation emitted from ambient air particles [gamma particle activity (PRγ)] is associated with reduced pulmonary function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Objective: We hypothesize that the inhalation of gamma radiation emitted from ambient air particles may be associated with reduced pulmonary function in individuals with COPD. Methods: In 125 patients with COPD from Eastern Massachusetts who had up to 4 seasonal one-week assessments of particulate matter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), and sulfur followed by spirometry. The US EPA continuously monitors ambient gamma (γ) radiation including γ released from radionuclides attached to particulate matter that is recorded as 9 γ-energy spectra classes (i = 3–9) in counts per minute (CPMγ) in the Boston area (USA). We analyzed the associations between ambient and indoor PRγi (up to one week) and pre and post-bronchodilator (BD) forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and with forced vital capacity (FVC) using mixed-effects regression models. We estimated indoor PRγi using the ratio of the indoor-to-outdoor sulfur in PM2.5 as a proxy for infiltration of ambient radionuclide-associated particles. Results: Overall, exposures to ambient and indoor PRγi were associated with a similar decrease in pre- and post-BD FEV1 and FVC. For example, ambient PRγ3 exposure averaged from the day of pulmonary function testing through the previous 3 days [IQR of 55.1 counts per minute (CPMγ)] was associated with a decrease in pre-BD FEV1 of 21.0 ml (95%CI: −38.5 to −3.0 ml; p &lt; 0.01) and pre-BD FVC of 27.5 ml [95% confidence interval (CI): −50.7 to −5.0 ml; p &lt; 0.01] with similar effects adjusting for indoor and outdoor BC and PM2.5. Conclusion: Our results show that short-term ambient and indoor exposures to environmental gamma radiation associated with particulate matter are associated with reduced pre- and post-BD pulmonary function in patients with COPD. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ambient and indoor air pollution; Background gamma radiation; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Pulmonary function","americium 241; beta 2 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; black carbon; iodine 131; muscarinic receptor blocking agent; radium 226; radium 228; radon 220; radon 222; steroid; sulfur; theophylline; thorium 230; thorium 232; uranium 234; uranium 235; uranium 238; ambient air; black carbon; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; confidence interval; gamma radiation; indoor air; particulate matter; pollution exposure; regression analysis; aged; ambient air; Article; chronic obstructive lung disease; female; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; gamma radiation; human; lung function; major clinical study; male; particulate matter; priority journal; air pollutant; chronic obstructive lung disease; environmental exposure; Massachusetts; radiation exposure; Massachusetts; United States; Air Pollutants; Boston; Environmental Exposure; Gamma Rays; Humans; Male; Massachusetts; Particulate Matter; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Radiation Exposure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066069494

Theoretically, the size of a nCIE can be used to determine the mass of carbon released, provided that the carbon source is known or other environmental changes such as temperature or ocean pH can be constrained. A simple isotopic mass balance equation often serves as a first order estimate for the mass of carbon input, but this approach ignores the effects of negative carbon cycle-climate feedbacks. Here we show, using 432 earth system model simulations, that the mass of carbon release and associated environmental impacts for a nCIE of a given size and carbon source depend on the onset duration of that nCIE: the longer the nCIE onset duration, the greater the required carbon input in order to counterbalance the input of 13C-enriched carbon through carbonate compensation and weathering feedbacks. On timescales &gt;103 years, these feedbacks remove carbon from the atmosphere so that the relative rise in atmospheric CO2 decreases with the nCIE onset duration. Consequently, the impacts on global temperature, surface ocean pH and saturation state are reduced if the nCIE has a long onset duration. The framework provided here demonstrates how constraints on the total nCIE duration and relative shape - together determining the onset duration - affect the interpretation of sedimentary nCIEs. Finally, we evaluate selected well-studied nCIEs, including the Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (∼54 Ma), the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (∼56 Ma), and the Aptian Oceanic Anoxic Event (∼120 Ma), in the context of our model-based framework and show how modeled environmental changes can be used to narrow down the most likely carbon emissions scenarios. © 2019 The Author(s).

In fact, the new wave of hydropower plant construction is occurring mainly in tropical areas where an additional environmental impact must be considered: biogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to the degradation of biogenic carbon in reservoirs. Peru is planning to install up to 2000 MW in hydropower until 2021, but the input and output flows, as well as the environmental impacts that these generate, have not been explored. Hence, a set of three hydropower plants built in the past decade located in the Peruvian Andes were analyzed from a life cycle perspective. The main objective of the study is to generate detailed life cycle inventories for each of these three hydropower plants with the aim of obtaining specific information for current conditions in Peru. Methods: The life cycle assessment methodology was applied to compute the environmental impacts. Data collection was based mainly on primary data obtained directly from the hydropower companies, although biogenic emissions were modeled considering local net primary productivity conditions and other site-specific conditions. Although the calculation of GHG emissions related to hydropower plants was a priority, considering the important policy implications of decarbonizing the Peruvian electricity grid, other environmental categories, such as eutrophication or the depletion of abiotic resources, were also considered. The IPCC method was used to calculate GHG emissions, whereas a set of eight additional impact categories were computed using the ReCiPe 2016 method. Results and discussion: Results show that GHG emissions per unit of electricity generated were in the lower range of emissions observed in the literature, in all three cases below 3 g CO2eq/kWh. Biogenic emissions represented less than 5% of the total GHG emissions despite their location in a tropical nation, due to the arid conditions of the landscape in the Andean Highlands, as well as the mild temperatures that are present in the reservoirs. In terms of stratospheric ozone depletion, a GHG with ozone depletion properties, N2O, was the main source of impact. Conclusions: The results are intended to be of utility for an array of applications, including relevance in decision-making in the energy sector and policy-making at a national level, considering the implications in terms of meeting the nationally determined contributions to mitigate climate change in the frame of the Treaty of Paris. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biogenic emissions; Electricity; Industrial ecology; LCA; Peru; Run-of-river hydropower plants","nitrous oxide; Article; carbon footprint; energy resource; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; ozone depletion; Peru; policy; priority journal; run of river hydropower plant; stratosphere; uncertainty; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059148318

This model relates the aboveground biomass (AGB) with the trunk diameter, wood specific density and total height of the tree. Its performance was compared to the performance of selected models for tropical forests and urban trees. As expected, being locally derived, our model reduced the bias of both individual and plot level estimates. The AGB estimates compared to those retrieved from the LiDAR showed a deviation of < 3% at plot level and 36–57% at individual scale. We applied this model to trees of a neighbourhood, where our team has investigated the role of urban vegetation in offseting anthropogenic emissions, as an example of how it could assist Singapore's efforts to verify climate change mitigation measures. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Aboveground biomass; Allometric modelling; Terrestrial laser scanning; Urban carbon sequestration; Urban trees","aboveground biomass; allometry; carbon sequestration; climate change; laser method; lidar; tree; tropical forest; Singapore [Southeast Asia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070013124

The technological viability of this process, however, is contingent on finding affordable and efficient catalysts. Recently, carbon-based solid state catalyst materials containing small amounts of nitrogen and transition metals (MNC) have emerged as a selective and cost-efficient alternative to noble metal catalysts for the direct electrochemical reduction of CO2 into CO. In addition, other products have also been reported, including formic acid and methane. In this Perspective, we offer a focused discussion of recent advances in the field of MNC catalysts for the CO2RR. The different factors which control the catalytic performance of MNC toward the CO2RR are discussed in this Perspective. We focus on density functional theory-guided experimental studies aiming to elucidate key experimental parameters and molecular descriptors that control the activity and selectivity of this class of materials. We close addressing the remaining challenges and take a look forward into future studies.

The utilization of cheese-making wastes on bioconversions into bioethanol aimed to generate social economic and environmental benefits. Bioconversion of cheese-making wastes into bioethanol can be role as an alternative in wastes utilization through waste to product approach. The consideration of the three pillars such as social, economic and environmental benefit holistically and comprehensively can be implemented in solving environmental problems caused by the disposal of cheese-making wastes and in creating sustainability. Cheese-making wastes utilization to bioethanol has been done in KPBS (The Dairy Farmer Cooperatives of South Bandung). The environmental impacts determined by measuring BOD, COD and potential CO2 emission reduction. Questionnaires used to obtained community perception of three pillars plus community knowledge about cheese-making wastes bioconversions are taken to the selected respondents around KPBS by cluster random sampling with the cluster of KPBS Employee, KPBS member and affected communities. Results showed that BOD are decreased to 1920 ppm, the potential emissions of CO2 are reduced to 13.65% (422,219.67 kg CO2eq/year) and utilization of distillery wastes as organic fertilizer could reduce potential CO2 emissions of 62.42% (305,226.0 kgCO2eq/year), that resulting positives community perception towards the environmental, social and economic impacts that lead to sustainability, however lack of knowledge are still need to be improved as complement for the sustainability. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Bioconversion; Bioethanol; Carbon dioxide; Dairies; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Ethanol; Fertilizers; Surveys; Waste disposal; Waste utilization; CO2 emission reduction; Community perceptions; Distillery waste; Economic and environmental benefits; Environmental problems; Organic fertilizers; Random sampling; Social and economic impacts; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070981413

In a mid-term scenario, hybrid powertrain and Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) downsizing represent the present trend in vehicle technology to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Concerning downsizing concept, to maintain a reasonable power level in small engines, the application of turbocharging is mandatory for both Spark Ignition (SI) and Diesel engines. Following this aspect, the possibility to recover the residual energy of the exhaust gases is becoming more and more attractive, as demonstrated by several studies around the world. One method to recover exhaust gas energy from ICEs is the adoption of turbo-compounding technology to recover sensible energy left in the exhaust gas by-passed through the waste-gate valve. In the paper, an innovative option of advanced boosting system is investigated through a bladeless micro expander, promising attractive cost-competitiveness. The numerical activity was developed on the basis of experimental data measured on a waste-gated turbocharger for downsized SI automotive engines. To this aim, mass flow rate through the by-pass valve and the turbine impeller was measured for different waste-gate settings in steady-state conditions at the turbocharger test bench of the University of Genoa. The paper shows that significant electrical power can be harvested from the waste-gate gases, up to 94 % of compressor power, contributing to fuel consumption reduction. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.",,"Automotive industry; Carbon dioxide; Energy harvesting; Environmental Protection Agency; Exhaust gases; Fuels; Greenhouse gases; Recovery; Turbomachinery; Vehicle performance; Waste incineration; Compounding technology; Cost competitiveness; Fuel consumption reduction; In-vehicle technology; SI automotive engines; Steady-state condition; Technological solution; Waste-gated turbocharger; Automobile engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071881077

Besides it has a high calorific value, RDF has a more economical price than coal. RDF production is also able to solve the problem of MSW and reduce CO2 emissions. One of the cement industries in Indonesia has developed various alternative energy materials to reduce the use of coal, including rice husk, coconut fiber, and energy from MSW, which is processed into RDF. The purpose of this study is to investigate the RDF quality standard that is in accordance with the needs of the cement industry and evaluate the RDF production process. Quality Function Development (QFD) method is used to determine the parameters of RDF quality standards that are suitable for the cement industry. The results of the QFD analysis show that there are six main characteristics in the RDF quality standard based on importance response, including RDF 3-5 cm, particulate 80 mg/Nm3, humidity level ≤ 20%, mercury 5 mg/Nm3, calorific value ≥ 2500 kcal/kg and low ash content. While the evaluation of the production process shows the number of RDF rejects quite high. The priority of process improvement with root cause analysis shows that it is necessary to conduct pre-production treatment of RDF on MSW material by drying, reduce impurities content through the screening process, and ensure the design of blades on the shredder in order to achieve the targeted size. The contribution of this research is for the development of alternative fuels RDF in the cement industry, especially in determining quality standards and procedures for optimal RDF results. © 2019 IEEE.","QFD; Refused-derived Fuels; Standard Quality","Alternative fuels; Calorific value; Cement industry; Cements; Municipal solid waste; Refuse derived fuels; Alternative energy; High-calorific-value; Impurities contents; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Process Improvement; Production process; Quality function development; Root cause analysis; Quality control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073879822

Five target compounds (furmaronitrile, 3-pyridinecarbonitrile, 1,3-dicyanobenzene, 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole, and 7-azaindole) were selected as target compounds and their degradation kinetics were examined. Under optimal reaction conditions (H2O2 dosage 3.0 mM, Fe2+ dosage 0.3 mM, and initial pH 3.0), more than 85% of total organic carbon (TOC) was eliminated in 30 min when a 10-W UV lamp was employed, and the electrical energy per order of magnitude for TOC removal was as low as 2.96 kWh m−3. Furthermore, the target compounds and the toxicity were largely removed from the bio-treated effluent. Size exclusion chromatography with organic carbon detector analysis revealed that organic components with a wide range of molecular weights were greatly reduced after the UV/Fenton process. A simplified pseudo steady-state (SPSS) model was applied to predict the degradation of target compounds during the UV/Fenton process. The concentrations of generated hydroxyl radicals were estimated to be 3.06 × 10−12 M, 6.37 × 10−12 M, and 10.9 × 10−12 M under 5-, 10-, and 15-W UV lamps, respectively.

This improvement can be enhanced by distributed control due to its lighter computational load and higher reliability. Despite favourable impacts on traffic, little is known about the effects of such systems on near-road air quality. In this study, an End-To-End (E2E) dynamic distributed routing algorithm in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) was applied in downtown Toronto, to identify whether benefits to network throughput were associated with lower near-road NO2 concentrations. We observe significant reductions in the emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) with increased penetration of CAVs. Nonetheless, at times, the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) increased with higher CAVs. Besides, a higher frequency and severity of NO2 hot-spots were observed under a 100% CAV scenario. Impacts of the proposed system on electric energy consumption in a full electric vehicle network were also investigated, indicating that the addition of CAVs that are electric did not contribute to high energy savings.

This paper investigates the driving forces of changes in CO2 emissions from the passenger transport sectors in different cities, which is helpful for formulating effective carbon-reduction policies and strategies. The logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) method is used to decompose the CO2 emissions changes into five driving determinants: Urbanization level, motorization level, mode structure, energy intensity, and energy mix. First, the urban transport CO2 emissions between 1960 and 2001 from 46 global cities are calculated. Then, the multiplicative decomposition results for megacities (London, New York, Paris, and Tokyo) are compared with those of other cities. Moreover, additive decomposition analyses of the 4 megacities are conducted to explore the driving forces of changes in CO2 emissions from the passenger transport sectors in these megacities between 1960 and 2001. Based on the decomposition results, some effective carbon-reduction strategies can be formulated for developing cities experiencing rapid urbanization and motorization. The main suggestions are as follows: (i) Rational land use, such as transit-oriented development, is a feasible way to control the trip distance per capita; (ii) fuel economy policies and standards formulated when there are oil crisis are effective ways to suppress the increase of CO2 emissions, and these changes should not be abandoned when oil prices fall; and (iii) cities with high population densities should focus on the development of public and non-motorized transport. © 2019 by the authors.","CO2 emissions; LMDI; Megacity; Urban transport","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; empirical analysis; global perspective; megacity; pollution policy; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach; traffic emission; urban pollution; urban transport; urbanization; England; France; Honshu; Ile de France; Japan; Kanto; London [England]; New York [United States]; Paris; Tokyo [Kanto]; United Kingdom; United States; Ville de Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070753769

The work formulates the principles for the formation of the import substitution strategy when exploiting oil and gas fields on the Arctic shelf which encompass the problems of scientific justification, legal regulation, systemic character, adaptability, innovative development, efficiency, economy, maintenance and growth of product quality, the need for process informatization and active use of workforce as well as environmental safety. An exemplary algorithm for implementing the strategy of import substitution when exploiting hydrocarbons on the Arctic shelf is presented and its stages are considered. The proposed algorithm for implementing the strategy of import substitution when exploiting hydrocarbons on the Arctic shelf will increase the number of factors of the Russian Arctic development and is an important basis for involvement of industrial enterprises, exploration and research organizations to production of innovative goods and services. As a result it will serve as an incentive for industrial, infrastructural and socio-economic development of the Arctic territory. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Aromatic hydrocarbons; Competition; Environmental regulations; Gas industry; Industrial research; Laws and legislation; Oil field equipment; Petroleum prospecting; Petroleum reservoirs; Planning; Competitive advantage; Environmental safety; Imported technologies; Industrial enterprise; Innovative technology; Oil and gas fields; Research organization; Socio-economic development; Oil field development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071880569

The setting is a large mountain- valley system with a small aspect ratio, where topography and persistent temperature inversions impose strong restraints on ABL ventilation. In conjunction with the observed time rates of change this airborne budgeting technique enables us to deduce net photochemical ozone production rates and emission fluxes of NOx and CH4. Estimated NOx emissions from our principal flight domain averaged 216 (33) t d-1 over six flights in July and August, which is nearly double the California government's NOx inventory for the surrounding three-county region. We consider several possibilities for this discrepancy, including the influence of wildfires, the temporal bias of the airborne sampling, instrumental interferences, and the recent hypothesis presented by Almaraz et al. (2018) of localized high soil NO emissions from intensive agricultural application of nitrogen fertilizers in the region and find the latter to be the most likely explanation. The methane emission average was 438 Gg yr-1 (143), which also exceeds the emissions inventory for the region by almost a factor of 2. Measured ABL ozone during the six afternoon flights averaged 74 ppb (D 9:8 ppb). The average midafternoon ozone rise of 2.8 ppb h-1 was found to be comprised of-0:8 ppb h-1 due to horizontal advection of lower O3 levels upwind,-2:5 ppb h-1 from dry deposition loss,-0:5 ppb h-1 from dilution by entrainment mixing, and 6.9 ppb h-1 net in situ photochemical production. The O3 production rates exhibited a dependence on NO2 concentrations (r2 D 0:35) and no discernible dependence on methane concentrations (r2 0:02), which are correlated with many of the dominant volatile organic compounds in the region, suggesting that the ozone chemistry was predominantly NOx-limited on the flight days. Additionally, in order to determine the heterogeneity of the different scalars, autocorrelation lengths were calculated for potential temperature (18 km), water vapor (18 km), ozone (30 km), methane (27 km), and NOx (28 km). The spatially diffuse patterns of CH4 and NOx seem to imply a preponderance of broad areal sources rather than localized emissions from cities and/or highway traffic within the SJV. © Author(s) 2019.",,"atmospheric chemistry; boundary layer; concentration (composition); emission; methane; nitrogen oxides; ozone; photochemistry; California; San Joaquin Valley; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072034474

A notable majority of these emitters, however, exhibit spectral diffusion due to local, fluctuating electromagnetic fields. In this work, we demonstrate efficient anti-Stokes (AS) excitation of quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and show that the process results in the suppression of a specific mechanism responsible for spectral diffusion of the emitters. We also demonstrate an all-optical gating scheme that exploits Stokes and anti-Stokes excitation to manipulate spectral diffusion so as to switch and lock the emission energy of the photon source. In this scheme, reversible spectral jumps are deliberately enabled by pumping the emitter with high energy (Stokes) excitation; AS excitation is then used to lock the system into a fixed state characterized by a fixed emission energy.

The Mediterranean basin is a leading international tourist destination and one that is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Although these effects are largely known, in-depth studies of how they and the associated risks are perceived by key tourism stakeholders have not been performed. Design/methodology/approach: Interviews were held with 31 hotels, campsites and rural lodgings in the Muga River basin in north-east Catalonia, in which both owners and managers were asked about their perceptions of climate change, effects and countermeasures. Findings: Perceptions of climate change and its effects varied according to the type of establishment and location (coast, cities or inland). Significant differences were observed for perceptions of how responsibilities for implementing mitigation and adaptation measures to counter the effects of climate change, including water shortages, should be shared out between the main agents with an interest in guaranteeing the sustainability of tourism, namely, government bodies, tourist establishments and clients. The predominant opinion, however, was that the bulk of the responsibility should lie with government bodies. Practical implications: Only when those responsible for running tourist establishments are aware of the risks of climate change, it will be possible to design and implement effective short-, medium- and long-term strategies aimed at strengthening the resilience of the tourist industry. Originality/value: The originality of this study lies in its novel methodology and approach, which involved analyzing perceptions of climate change, including water shortages and its effects among owners and managers of different types of tourist accommodation establishments in distinct parts of the same area. © 2019, Maria Torres-Bagur, Anna Ribas Palom and Josep Vila-Subirós.","Climate change; Lodging industry; Mediterranean basin; Perception; Water resources","climate change; hospitality industry; Mediterranean environment; perception; questionnaire survey; rural area; sustainability; tourism; tourist destination; water availability; Catalonia; Gerona [Catalonia]; Gerona [Catalonia]; Muga River; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065905478

Yet continued expansion of fossil-fuel-burning energy infrastructure implies already ‘committed’ future CO2 emissions6–13. Here we use detailed datasets of existing fossil-fuel energy infrastructure in 2018 to estimate regional and sectoral patterns of committed CO2 emissions, the sensitivity of such emissions to assumed operating lifetimes and schedules, and the economic value of the associated infrastructure. We estimate that, if operated as historically, existing infrastructure will cumulatively emit about 658 gigatonnes of CO2 (with a range of 226 to 1,479 gigatonnes CO2, depending on the lifetimes and utilization rates assumed). More than half of these emissions are predicted to come from the electricity sector; infrastructure in China, the USA and the 28 member states of the European Union represents approximately 41 per cent, 9 per cent and 7 per cent of the total, respectively. If built, proposed power plants (planned, permitted or under construction) would emit roughly an extra 188 (range 37–427) gigatonnes CO2. Committed emissions from existing and proposed energy infrastructure (about 846 gigatonnes CO2) thus represent more than the entire carbon budget that remains if mean warming is to be limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius (°C) with a probability of 66 to 50 per cent (420–580 gigatonnes CO2)5, and perhaps two-thirds of the remaining carbon budget if mean warming is to be limited to less than 2 °C (1,170–1,500 gigatonnes CO2)5. The remaining carbon budget estimates are varied and nuanced14,15, and depend on the climate target and the availability of large-scale negative emissions16. Nevertheless, our estimates suggest that little or no new CO2-emitting infrastructure can be commissioned, and that existing infrastructure may need to be retired early (or be retrofitted with carbon capture and storage technology) in order to meet the Paris Agreement climate goals17. Given the asset value per tonne of committed emissions, we suggest that the most cost-effective premature infrastructure retirements will be in the electricity and industry sectors, if non-emitting alternatives are available and affordable4,18. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; natural gas; carbon footprint; China; climate; controlled study; electric power plant; European Union; greenhouse effect; industrialization; industry; Letter; priority journal; United States; urbanization; atmosphere; chemistry; economics; electricity; international cooperation; legislation and jurisprudence; motivation; prevention and control; temperature; Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Electricity; Fossil Fuels; Global Warming; Goals; International Cooperation; Natural Gas; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069950514

Urban communities take advantage of Information Technology (IT) and communications technologies in order to improve the control of environmental emissions and sound pollution. The aim is to mitigate health threatening risks and to raise awareness in relation to the effects of air pollution exposure. This paper investigates the key issues of a real-time pollution monitoring system, including the sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) communication protocols, and acquisition and transmission of data through communication channels, as well as data security and consistency. Security is a major focus in the proposed IoT solution. All other components of the system revolve around security. The bill of the materials and communications protocols necessary for the designing, development, and deployment of the IoT solution are part of this paper, as well as the security challenges. The paper’s proof of concept (PoC) addresses IoT security challenges within the communication channels between IoT gateways and the cloud infrastructure where data are transmitted to. The security implementations adhere to existing guidelines, best practices, and standards, ensuring a reliable and robust solution. In addition, the solution is able to interpret and analyze the collected data by using predictive analytics to create pollution maps. Those maps are used to implement real-time countermeasures, such as traffic diversion in a major city, to reduce concentrations of air pollutants by using existing data collected over a year. Once integrated with traffic management systems—cameras monitoring and traffic lights—this solution would reduce vehicle pollution by dynamically offering alternate routes or even enforcing re-routing when pollution thresholds are reached. © 2019 by the authors.

The thermal resistance and water vapor permeability of all the fabrics were measured and compared. It should be noted that the small dissimilarity in the thickness of the manufactured fabrics was due to the movement of the yarns through the thickness in the relaxing state of the fabrics. However, they were designed in a way to have the same thickness on the weaving loom. The results stated that the thermal resistance of asymmetric fabrics for both sets of fabrics (with and without silver) was different regarding which exterior face (face or back) was in contact with the hot plate (20°C). It should be noted that the fabric is not symmetric through its thickness due to the dissimilarity of weave pattern of the layers or the orientation of silver yarns. It affirms that the internal voids of each ply (which is correlated to the wave pattern) play a significant role in thermal resistance of the manufactured compound woven fabrics. As a result, the asymmetry of a compound woven fabric throughout the thickness makes it a potential fabric to be applied as double-face fabric for different climate conditions as the order of the layers changed the thermal resistance of the compound fabric due to the porosity of each ply. Furthermore, a reduction was observed in thermal resistance for the fabrics with silver presence (∼40%) while the other parameters remained unchanged (e.g. yarn density, fabric structure, and fabric porosity). The reason is correlated to the high conductivity of silver as conductive materials improve the heat transfer of the fabrics. Moreover, the influence of silver presence on water vapor permeability was not significant although the water vapor permeability was slightly increased for the fabrics having silver in their structures. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Conductive materials; Cotton; Heat transfer; Porosity; Water vapor; Climate condition; Fabric structures; High conductivity; Internal voids; Multi-filament; Water vapor permeability; Weave patterns; Woven fabrics; Weaving",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070629263

Cell apoptosis and necrosis are significant to maintain the cell population, and their abnormality can lead to severe diseases including cancer. During cell death, significant changes occur in the intracellular contents and physical properties, such as decrease of esterase activity, depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (?ψm), increase of caspase content, dissipation of membrane asymmetry, and loss of membrane integrity. To detect cell viability, the fluorescent probes have been developed by taking advantage of these biological parameters and using various fluorescence mechanisms. These fluorescent probes can serve as powerful tools to facilitate the research in biology and pathology.In this Account, the representative examples of the fluorescent probes for cell viability during the past decades have been summarized and classified into five types based on the biological changes. The basic principle, design strategy, fluorescence mechanisms, and molecular construction of these fluorescent probes have been discussed. Furthermore, the intrinsic characteristics and merits of these probes have been illustrated. Particularly, this Account describes our recent works for the design and synthesis of the fluorescent probes to detect cell viability in the dual-color and reversible modes. The dual-color and reversible fluorescent probes are highlighted owing to their unique benefits in accurate and dynamic detection of cell viability. In general, the dual-color fluorescent probes were constructed based on the loss of esterase activity during cell death. Excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process were exploited for the probe design. The construction of such dual-color probes were realized by the acetate of the phenyl group on fluorophores. Esterases in healthy cells hydrolyze the acetate and bring a spectral shift to the probes. Moreover, reversible fluorescent probes for cell viability were designed based on the depolarization of ?ψm, with relocalization properties dependent on ?ψm. The probes target mitochondria in healthy cells with high ?ψm, while they are relocalized into the nucleus in unhealthy cells with depolarized ?ψm. As ?ψm is reversibly changed according to the cell viability, these probes reversibly detect cell viability. The reversible and simultaneously dual-color fluorescent probes were developed based on the relocalization mode and aggregation-induced emission shift. The probes target mitochondria to form aggregates with deep-red emission, while they migrate into the nucleus to present in monomers with green fluorescence. In this manner, the probes enable dual-color and reversible detection of cell viability. Fluorescent probes for cell viability based on sensing the membrane integrity, caspase activity, and membrane symmetry are also presented. High-polarity and large-size fluorescent probes impermeable to the intact lipid bilayer selectively target apoptotic cells with a destructive plasma membrane. Fluorescent probes sensing caspases in a turn-on manner exclusively light up apoptotic cells with caspase expression. Membrane-impermeable probes with high affinity to phosphatidylserine (PS) specifically stain the plasma membrane of dead cells, since PS flip-flops to the outer leaflet of the membrane during cell death. In summary, this Account illustrates the basic principles, design strategies, characteristics, and advantages of the fluorescent probes for cell viability, and it highlights the dual-color and reversible probes, which can promote the development of fluorescent probes, apoptosis studies, drug discovery, and other relative areas. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"carboxylesterase; caspase; fluorescent dye; animal; apoptosis; cell membrane; cell survival; chemistry; fluorescence microscopy; human; metabolism; mitochondrial membrane potential; mitochondrion; physiology; procedures; tumor cell line; Animals; Apoptosis; Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases; Caspases; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Membrane; Cell Survival; Fluorescent Dyes; Humans; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Mitochondria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071707832

Yet there are indications that a growing number of households in Europe are struggling to achieve adequate levels of indoor cooling, with adverse consequences for their health, well-being and productivity. This situation is exacerbated by changing global weather patterns, with many countries facing increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme heatwaves. There is limited understanding of the ways in which households respond to extreme heat, and consequently how this might create greater demand for indoor space cooling and air conditioning, and the consequences for increased stress on power grids and conflicts with carbon reduction goals. Using custom-built survey data collected from 2337 households in Gdańsk (Poland), Prague (Czech Republic), Budapest (Hungary)and Skopje (North Macedonia), along with in-depth qualitative fieldwork with 55 households in the same cities, this paper presents novel evidence on the issue of summertime energy poverty and space cooling difficulties. We identify the driving forces of household vulnerability to excessive indoor heat, in terms of risk of exposure, adaptive capacity, and sensitivity, and explore the implications for addressing energy poverty. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air conditioning; Energy poverty; Energy vulnerability; Fuel poverty; Heatwaves; Indoor cooling; Overheating","Air conditioning; Cooling; Electric power transmission networks; Energy poverties; Energy vulnerability; Fuel poverty; Heatwaves; Overheating; Heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065527645

The National Center for Environmental Prediction's (NCEP's) T170/L42 AGCM model configured with a horizontal resolution of 75 × 75 km, with 42 vertical levels is used for the study. The SST-rainfall relationship is examined in the coupled Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) model, as CFSv2-predicted SST is used as input for the T170 model. The NCEP Global Forecast System-T170 (GFS-T170) simulations are carried out with boundary forcing of observed SST, CFSv2-predicted SST and the bias-corrected CFSv2 SST. An ensemble of seasonal runs was made using the initial conditions of May to September, and integrated up to September 30th. The significance of discontinuity in the initial conditions due to climate forecast system reanalysis (CFSR) is assessed based on the two-period approach of climatology for the two time scales of 1985–1998 and 1998–2009. CFSv2 predicted climatological summer monsoon rainfall with a significant dry bias over the three convection zones; Western Ghats, Central India and North-east India, and cold bias over the Indian ocean basin and central equatorial Pacific, with strong cold bias over a narrow region of equatorial Pacific. The model could capture 64% (16 out of 25) of the year’s rainfall anomaly signal. The skill of the model is improved in the recent period (1999–2009). The model could simulate the negative Nino 3 and excess rainfall and the La Nina event realistically for the year 1988. The model shows a large difference in Nino indices for the years 1987 and 1998, which led to the unrealistic rainfall simulation. The model has a low skill for indicating the relationship between the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR). The CFSv2 model could not capture the strong positive correlation of the IOD and strong negative correlation of Nino 3 with the ISMR for the period 1999–2009 realistically, suggesting improvement of SST simulation in the CFSv2 model. The T170 model forced with observed SST shows wet bias in peninsular India and dry bias over North-east India, whereas that of CFSv2-predicted SST simulated a wet bias in peninsular India and widespread dry bias in North and Central India. When the model was forced with bias-corrected CFSv2 SST, the dry bias improved in North and Central India, and the intensity of wet bias increased in peninsular India. The model could capture 56, 48 and 64% of the year’s rainfall anomaly signal (positive or negative) correctly in the same sign for being forced with observed SST, CFSv2-predicted SST, and bias-corrected CFSv2 SST, respectively. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","climatology; Indian summer monsoon rainfall; inter-annual variability; sea surface temperature","Atmospheric temperature; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate models; Climatology; Forecasting; Rain; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Atmospheric general circulation models; Global forecast systems; Indian summer monsoon rainfall; Interannual variability; National center for environmental predictions; Positive correlations; Sea surface temperature (SST); Summer monsoon rainfall; Oceanography; annual variation; atmospheric general circulation model; climatology; monsoon; rainfall; sea surface temperature; summer; weather forecasting; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070707602

GO's ability for in-plane and through-plane cationic transport together with its impermeability to molecular fuels projected them as inexpensive and sustainable membranes for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Nevertheless, the room-temperature proton transport in bulk GO is at least an order lower than that of the state of the art Nafion membrane, challenging the construction of a practical energy conversion device with the former. We show that the proton flux in GO along the H-bonded network projected outward of the carbon planes can be significantly amplified by thinning the 2D carbon layer stacking of carbon nanosheets in GO. The noticeably higher room-temperature fuel cell performance metrics of a thin-layer GO proton conductor compared to the commercial Nafion membrane with ∼410 mW/cm2 of peak power at ∼1300 mA/cm2 of peak current demonstrates distinct progress in the sustainable energy landscape.

Yet, we lack studies on the interacting effects of multiple global change factors on ecological communities – particularly long-term studies in field settings. Here, using a grassland field experiment in temperate North America, we report the interactive effects of four of the most common and pressing global change factors of the Anthropocene (elevated CO2, elevated nitrogen, warming, and summer drought)on soil microbial and free-living soil nematode communities, which together form an extensive share of terrestrial biodiversity. In addition, we measured microbial mass-specific soil enzyme activities related to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles. Our results showed that mass-specific soil enzyme activities and their stoichiometry were strongly affected by higher-order interactions among the global change factors. In particular, the three-way interaction among elevated CO2, reduced precipitation, and warming decreased the ratio of carbon-to phosphorus-acquiring enzymes as well as nitrogen-to phosphorus-acquiring enzymes in the soil, indicating a relative increase in the breakdown of organic phosphorus in the soil. We also found that the three-way interaction among elevated CO2, reduced precipitation, and warming altered the predominant decomposition pathway in the soil (towards a bacterial-dominated energy channel in future environments), indicated by the Channel Index of nematode communities. Further, the three-way interaction among nitrogen fertilization, reduced precipitation, and warming enhanced acid phosphatase (related to the P cycle). Nematode density increased at elevated nitrogen and ambient CO2 as well as at ambient nitrogen and elevated CO2, whereas it did not differ from controls at elevated nitrogen and elevated CO2. Changes in microbial biomass were mainly driven by the additive effects of elevated CO2 and temperature. Our results reveal various ways in which global change factors affect (both additively and interactively)soil biotic responses mainly via altering nutrient demands of soil microorganisms and changing soil community structure and energy channels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon cycle; Microbial biomass C; Nematodes; Nitrogen cycle; Phosphorus cycle; Soil enzymes","Additives; Biodiversity; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Phosphatases; Phosphorus; Carbon cycles; Microbial biomass c; Nematodes; Nitrogen cycles; Phosphorus cycles; Soil enzymes; Soils; Anthropocene; bacterium; biodiversity; biomass; carbon cycle; community composition; community structure; decomposition; ecosystem structure; global change; grassland; nematode; nitrogen cycle; phosphorus cycle; precipitation (chemistry); soil microorganism; North America; Bacteria (microorganisms); Nematoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065537775

To understand how plants adapt to such soils, we explored natural variation in tolerance to soil carbonate in small local populations (demes) of Arabidopsis thaliana growing on soils differing in carbonate content. Reciprocal field-based transplants on soils with elevated carbonate (+C) and without carbonate (−C) over several years revealed that demes native to (+C) soils showed higher fitness than those native to (−C) soils when both were grown together on carbonate-rich soil. This supports the role of soil carbonate as a driving factor for local adaptation. Analyses of contrasting demes revealed key mechanisms associated with these fitness differences. Under controlled conditions, plants from the tolerant deme A1(+C) native to (+C) soil were more resistant to both elevated carbonate and iron deficiency than plants from the sensitive T6(−C) deme native to (−C) soil. Resistance of A1(+C) to elevated carbonate was associated with higher root extrusion of both protons and coumarin-type phenolics. Tolerant A1(+C) also had better Ca-exclusion than sensitive T6(−C). We conclude that Arabidopsis demes are locally adapted in their native habitat to soils with moderately elevated carbonate. This adaptation is associated with both enhanced iron acquisition and calcium exclusion. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Arabidopsis thaliana; calcareous soil; calcium exclusion; coumarin; iron efficiency; local adaptation; proton extrusion","calcareous soil; calcium; carbonate; crop performance; ecophysiology; experimental study; fitness; herb; iron; local adaptation; soil carbon; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; calcium; carbonic acid; chlorophyll; coumarin; coumarin derivative; iron; phenol derivative; plant extract; adaptation; Arabidopsis; chemistry; growth, development and aging; metabolism; physiological stress; physiology; plant leaf; soil; Adaptation, Physiological; Arabidopsis; Calcium; Carbonates; Chlorophyll; Coumarins; Iron; Phenols; Plant Extracts; Plant Leaves; Soil; Stress, Physiological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067450202

The possibility of using carbon dioxide as a working fluid absorbing heat from hot rocks with low permeability, considered since the beginning of the 21st century, is currently in the testing phase. In Poland, which lies outside the areas of contemporary volcanism, five prospective regions for the production of energy from enhanced geothermal systems were determined. Artificial reservoirs can be located both in sedimentary rocks (North-Western and Central Poland)and in igneous and metamorphic rocks (Western, South-Western and Southern Poland). Large emitters of carbon dioxide (emissions above 0.1 Mt per year in the mentioned prospective regions for the production of energy from enhanced geothermal systems (EGS)were determined. In the case of the five areas considered, there are 52 emitters of carbon dioxide (71 installations). The total emissions from the installations in 2016 amounted to 119.55 Mt of carbon dioxide, including emissions from fuel combustion installations, accounting for 106.46 Mt. Smaller amounts of around 1.5–3.0 Mt of CO2 were emitted by metallurgical plants, coking plants, chemical plants and oil refineries. Gas emitted from certain technological processes (e.g. the production of ammonia or hydrogen)contains high concentrations of carbon dioxide and can be used for EGS without carbon capture from the gas stream, which significantly reduces the costs of the entire project. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide; Emission; Enhanced geothermal system; Poland","Ammonia; Chemical plants; Fuels; Geothermal fields; Hot working; Igneous rocks; Metamorphic rocks; Neutron emission; Petroleum prospecting; Sedimentary rocks; Anthropogenic emissions; Artificial reservoirs; Enhanced geothermal systems; Geological storage; Low permeability; Metallurgical plants; Poland; Technological process; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065841801

China aims to peak carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2030 and cut its greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 60–65% from 2005 levels by 2030. The pledge is eagerly awaited as China aims to develop a low carbon economy through switching to alternatives to fossil fuels and being technologically energy-efficient. The power industry is the most important industrial sector while the biggest bottleneck for CO2 emission control in China. This paper develops a technologies-based bottom-up CO2 mitigation model to assess emission reduction potential of different technologies in the thermal power industry up to 2030. Using 2010 as the reference year, two macro-economic scenarios and four technological scenarios have been set to describe future policy measures for the period of 2015–2030. CO2 emission trends, reduction potentials and cost curves are demonstrated under different scenarios. The results show that the electric power industry can reach its CO2 emission peak by 2030 in the middle policy control scenario under macro-economic slow growth. Emissions would peak at 4.6 billion tonnes CO2-eq for the least cost scenario, which is 1.78 billion tones CO2-eq less than peak the BAU scenario in 2030. This is equivalent to the total CO2 emissions from 300 MW to 1000 MW coal-fired power plants with 5000 h in 30 provinces and municipalities of China in 2013. This research shows that the top four negative cost-beneficial technology options, 630℃ or 700℃ USC, small hydroelectricity, and nuclear power pressurized water reactor II and III, are the most preferable to be promoted to meet the CO2 emissions peak target in 2020 and 2030. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cost-benefit analysis; Electric power industry; Emission peaks; Mitigation potential","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Coal; Cost benefit analysis; Electric industry; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Nuclear fuels; Pressurized water reactors; Renewable energy resources; Carbon dioxide emissions; Coal-fired power plant; Electric power industries; Emission peaks; Emission reduction potentials; Gross domestic products; Mitigation potential; Reduction potential; Industrial economics; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; bottom-up approach; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; coal-fired power plant; cost-benefit analysis; electrical power; emission control; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; Article; carbon footprint; China; climate change; cost benefit analysis; economic development; electric power plant; environmental impact assessment; geothermal energy; gross national product; hydropower; nuclear energy; policy; technology; trend study; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064912411

Ex-situ biomethanisation, where gaseous substrates are fed to pure or mixed cultures of hydrogenotrophic methanogens, offers higher VMP but requires an additional reactor and supply of essential nutrients. This work combined the two approaches in a novel hybrid application achieving simultaneous in-situ and ex-situ biomethanisation within an organically-loaded anaerobic digester receiving supplementary biogas. Conventional stirred-tank digesters were first acclimated to H2 addition, increasing biogas methane content from 50% to 95% and VMP from 0.86 to 1.51 L L−1 day−1 at a moderate loading rate of 3 g organic chemical oxygen demand per L per day (g CODorg L−1 day−1). Externally-produced biogas was then added to demonstrate simultaneous biomethanisation of endogenous and imported CO2. This further increased VMP to 2.76 L L−1 day−1 without affecting organic substrate degradation. In-situ CO2 reduction can alter digester pH by reducing bicarbonate buffering: the combined process operated stably at around pH 8.0 with 3–5% CO2 in the headspace. Microbial community analysis indicated the process was mediated by bacterial syntrophic acetate oxidation and highly enriched hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea (up to 97% of the archaeal population). This approach presents the opportunity to retrofit a single digester for H2 injection to convert and upgrade biogas from several others, minimising capital and operating costs by utilising both existing infrastructure and waste-derived feedstock nutrients for simultaneous biogas upgrading and power-to-methane. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas upgrading; CO2 biomethanisation; Hydrogenotrophic methanogens; Power-to-gas","Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Chemical oxygen demand; Degradation; Indium compounds; Methane; Methanogens; Nutrients; Operating costs; Organic chemicals; Substrates; Biogas upgrading; Capital and operating costs; CO2 biomethanisation; Essential nutrients; Hydrogenotrophic methanogens; Methanogenic archaea; Microbial community analysis; Syntrophic acetate oxidations; Anaerobic digestion; anaerobic digestion; bioactivity; carbon dioxide; chemical reaction; methane; methanogenic bacterium; power generation; substrate; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064519648

The NOx abatement capacity of TiO2-coated granules used in roofing products was evaluated for commercial product development. A laboratory test chamber and ancillary setup were built following conditions prescribed by ISO Standard 22197-1. It was validated by exposing reference P25-coated aluminum plates to a 3 L min−1 air flow enriched in 1 ppm NO under UVA irradiation (360 nm, 11.5 W m−2). We characterized prototype granule-surfaced asphalt shingles and loose granules prepared with different TiO2 loadings and post-treatment formulations. Tests performed at surface temperatures of 25 and 60 °C showed that NOx abatement was more effective at the higher temperature. Preliminary tests explored the use of 1 ppm NO2 and of 1 ppm and 0.3 ppm NO/NO2 mixtures. Specimens were aged in a laboratory accelerated weathering apparatus, and by exposure to the outdoor environment over periods that included dry and rainy seasons. Laboratory aging led to higher NO removal and NO2 formation rates, and the same catalyst activation was observed after field exposure with frequent precipitation. However, exposure during the dry season reduced the performance. This inactivation was mitigated by cleaning the surface of field-exposed specimens. Doubling the TiO2 loading led to a 50–150% increase in NO removal and NOx deposition rates. Application of different post-treatment coatings decreased NO removal rates (21–35%) and NOx deposition rates (26–74%) with respect to untreated granules. The mass balance of nitrogenated species was assessed by extracting granules after UV exposure in a 1 ppm NO-enriched atmosphere. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aging; Asphalt roofing shingle; Nitrate; NOx; Titanium dioxide; Weathering","Aging of materials; Aluminum coatings; Asphalt; Building materials; Deposition rates; Irradiation; ISO Standards; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Roofs; Stripping (removal); Titanium dioxide; Weathering; Accelerated weathering; Building surface; Catalyst activation; Outdoor environment; Roofing products; Roofing shingles; Surface temperatures; Urban air pollution; Granulation; aging; atmospheric pollution; efficiency measurement; experimental study; mass balance; nitrate; nitrogen oxides; photolysis; pollution control; roof; temperature effect; titanium; weathering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066960027

Seeking more sustainable materials to reducing the carbon impact onto our environment has put bamboo on the map as an alternative building material, especially in the regions such as China, Southern Asia, and South America, where the bamboo is abundant. The application of a composite bolted connection using laminated bamboo and steel plates in a laminated bamboo silo structure necessitates a detailed investigation of its behavior. An experimental program was designed and employed to perform a set of specimen tests on both single-bolted and multiple-bolted connections using laminated bamboo and steel plates. The impacts of the edge distance, bolt size, and thickness of laminated bamboo strips were observed for single-bolted connections. Meanwhile, the test results for multiple-bolted connections revealed that the spacing influenced the capacity in a similar manner as the edge distance on single-bolted connections and the stagger configuration of the bolts improved the capacity of the multiple-bolted connection. The observed failure modes of the connections specimens were the longitudinal splitting, shear out, and combined longitudinal splitting and bamboo crushing. In addition, the material properties of the laminated bamboo used in this study were carefully measured and recorded to provide a first-hand database on the parameters of the constitutive relations and Hill's failure criterion of such material. The measured material parameters were employed in the detailed finite element models of these connections and their numerical solutions were compared with the test results. © 2019 Institution of Structural Engineers","Bamboo; Bolted connection; Computational model; Laminated bamboo; Mechanical properties",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064613619

Here we use an ensemble of simulations from the Swedish Regional Climate Model (RCM) RCA4, driven by eight General Circulation Models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), for the 1.5∘C and 2∘C global warming levels (GWLs), and under the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. RCA4 captures reasonably well the observed patterns of CB rainfall seasonality, but shows dry biases independent of seasons and large scale driving atmospheric conditions. While simulations mimic observed peaks in transition seasons (March–May and September–November), the rain-belt is misplaced southward (northward) in December–February (June–August), reducing the latitudinal extent of rainfall. Moreover, ERA-Interim reanalysis driven RCM simulation and RCM–GCM combinations show similar results, indicating the dominance of systematic biases. Modelled dry biases are associated with dry upper-tropospheric layers, resulting from a western outflow stronger than the eastern inflow and related to the northern component of African Easterly Jet. From the analysis of the climate change signal, we found that regional scale responses to anthropogenic forcings vary across GWLs and seasons. Changes of rainfall and moisture divergence are correlated, with values higher in March–May than in September–November, and larger for global warming of 2.0∘C than at 1.5∘C. There is an increase of zonal moisture divergence fluxes in upper atmospheric layers (>700hPa) under RCP8.5 compared to RCP4.5. Moreover, it is found that additional warming of 0.5∘C will change the hydrological cycle and water availability in the CB, with potential to cause challenges to water resource management, agriculture, hydro-power generation, sanitation and ecosystems. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CMIP5; Congo Basin rainfall biases; Global warming levels; Moisture convergence; RCA4; RCPs","climate modeling; climate prediction; convergence; ensemble forecasting; general circulation model; global warming; hydrological cycle; rainfall; regional climate; temporal variation; water availability; Congo Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064271200

The cross sections of the measured evaporation residues are compared with the theoretical predictions of statistical model code PACE4, which takes into account only the complete fusion (CF) reaction cross section. It is observed that residues populated via xn and pxn channels are in good agreement with the PACE4 predictions, implying that these residues are populated via CF process. However, in the case of α-emission channels a significant enhancement from the PACE4 predictions is observed even after the deduction of precursor contribution, which is accredited to ICF process. The projectile break-up probability is found to increase with increment in the incident projectile energy. Further, the dependence of incomplete fusion dynamics on entrance channel parameters like mass asymmetry, Coulomb effect (ZPZT), and projectile Qα value is systematically studied. The present results reveal that a single entrance channel parameter does not oversee the ICF reaction dynamics but have varying contributions depending upon the projectile-target combination. Moreover, the effect of projectile break-up on complete fusion cross section at energies above the Coulomb barrier is also studied. The suppression in fusion cross section is observed when compared with the universal fusion function. © 2019 American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072128678

Ensembles of three selected general circulation models (GCMs) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) were used for projected future analysis. During the 1950s, annual average temperature is expected to increase by 2.5 °C under RCP 8.5. Similarly, during the 1970s, it is even anticipated to rise by 3.6 °C under RCP 8.5. The rate of temperature rise is higher in the non-monsoon period than in monsoon period. During the 1970s, annual precipitation is projected to increase by 8.1% under RCP 8.5. Even though the precipitation is anticipated to increase in the future in annual scale, winter seasons are estimated to be drier by more than 15%. This study shows significant increments of tropical (Am and Aw) and arid (BSk) climate types and reductions of temperate (Cwa and Cwb) and polar (ET and EF). Noticeably, the reduction of the areal coverage of polar frost (EF) is considerably high. In general, about 50% of the country’s area is covered by the temperate climate (Cwa and Cwb) in baseline scenario and it is expected to reduce to 45% under RCP 4.5 and 42.5% under RCP 8.5 during the 1950s, and 42% under RCP 4.5 and 39% under RCP 8.5 during the 1970s. Importantly, the degree of climate boundary shifts is quite higher under RCP 8.5 than RCP 4.5, and likewise, the degree is higher during the 1970s than the 1950s. We believe this study to facilitate the identification of regions in which impacts of climate change are notable for crop production, soil management, and disaster risk reduction, requiring a more detailed assessment of adaptation measures. The assessment of climate boundary shifting can serve as valuable information for stakeholders of many disciplines like water, climate, transport, energy, environment, disaster, development, agriculture, and tourism. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate classification; Köppen–Geiger (KG); Nepal; Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP); WorldClim","Agronomy; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Cultivation; Disasters; Risk assessment; Annual precipitation; Classification scheme; Climate change scenarios; Disaster risk reductions; General circulation model; Nepal; Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP); WorldClim; Climate change; classification; climate change; climate effect; ensemble forecasting; general circulation model; high temperature; monsoon; precipitation (climatology); Article; climate; climate boundary shift; climate change; concentration (parameter); controlled study; Nepal; precipitation; representative concentration pathway 4.5; representative concentration pathway 8.5; summer; temperature; temperature measurement; winter; agriculture; chemistry; crop production; drought; environmental monitoring; procedures; season; soil; theoretical model; Nepal; Agriculture; Climate Change; Crop Production; Droughts; Environmental Monitoring; Models, Theoretical; Nepal; Seasons; Soil; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069924299

Along with the critique, visions and strategies for alternative systems need also be brought onto the agenda. The aim of this paper is to present the qualitative content of scenarios that explore sustainability strategies for the Swedish society when economic growth is not seen as an end in itself, and instead the objective is other values/targets that society might wish to achieve. Multi-target backcasting scenarios are developed that illustrate future states in which four sustainability targets (climate, land use, participation, and resource security) are to be attained. The focus of these four scenarios is: 1) a Collaborative economy, 2) Local self-sufficiency, 3) Automation for quality of life, and 4) Circular economy in the welfare state. In the paper, we also present the process of the development of the scenarios, and feedback from stakeholders. Although the focus is on Sweden, the process and scenarios may also be relevant for other similar countries. The scenarios are discussed in terms of their relevance and their purpose, the fulfilment of the sustainability targets, and the multi-target approach. © 2019 The Authors","Backcasting; Beyond growth; Multi-target; Scenarios; Sustainability targets","economic growth; future prospect; Gross Domestic Product; quality of life; stakeholder; strategic approach; sustainability; targeting; welfare economics; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066049333

It also identifies current knowledge gaps in in vivo methane emissions research.: The Australian beef industry is a major contributor to the economy with an estimated annual revenue generation of over seven billion dollars. The tropical state of Queensland accounted for 48% of Australian beef and veal production in 2018. As the third biggest beef exporter in the world, Australia supplies 3% of the world’s beef exports and its agricultural sector accounts for an estimated 13.2% of its total greenhouse gas emissions. About 71% of total agricultural emissions are in the form of methane and nitrous oxide. In this review, an overview of the carbon footprint of the beef cattle production system in northern Australia is presented, with emphasis on the mitigation of greenhouse gases. The review also focuses on the tropical legume, Desmanthus, one of the more promising nutritional supplements for methane abatement and improvement of animal growth performance. Among the review’s findings is the need to select environmentally well-adapted and vigorous tropical legumes containing tannins that can persistently survive under the harsh northern Australian conditions for driving animal performance, improving meat quality and reducing methane emissions. The paper argues that the use of appropriate legumes such as Desmanthus, is a natural and preferred alternative to the use of chemicals for the abatement of methane emanating from tropical beef cattle production systems. It also highlights current gaps in knowledge and new research opportunities for in vivostudies on the impact of Desmanthus on methane emissions of supplemented tropical beef cattle. © 2019 by the authors.

Limited research, however, has been carried out in arid or desert zones covered with sparse vegetation, despite the fact that these cover wide areas of the earth and play a significant role in global carbon cycles. In this study, the Otindag Sandy Land and its surroundings (OSLAIS) in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China was selected as the study area. The study introduces a useful technique for making high spatial coverage SOCD estimates for drylands by utilizing GF-1 WFV optical satellite images and a time series of MODIS satellite remote sensing datasets, and using these to optimize parameters for simulation models in conjunction with other technical procedures that are described. The results showed that the resulting model's accuracy was 77.87%, R2 = 0.8627, and so the SOCD estimates modelled by soil basal respiration (SBR) could be used for SOCD estimation and for analyzing the spatial distribution patterns across the OSLAIS. The average SOCD was 1.22 kgC/m2 for the whole of the OSLAIS, and it had a heterogenous distribution pattern. The SOCD was closely related to the way the land was used in each area, and the average SOCD for the main land use types were: forest land = 2.88 kgC/m2, farmland = 1.63 kgC/m2, shrub land = 1.41 kgC/m2, and grassland = 1.08 kgC/m2. In conclusion, we believe that the proposed method, based on high-resolution GF-1 WFV data and optimized estimation models constructed by integrating climate and vegetation characteristic data, can effectively describe the spatial distribution patterns of SOC and SOCD in the OSLAIS area, in depth and in detail, especially for the areas where the SOCD values are high. We expect this research to provide useful technical support and scientific reference data for land management and for land degradation/desertification assessments, for the study area monitored, as well as across the whole dryland area of China. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Human activities influence; Improved Van't Hoff model; Otindag Sandy Land and its surroundings; Soil Organic Carbon Density (SOCD); Spatiotemporal distribution","agricultural land; desert soil; grassland; human activity; land management; MODIS; sandy soil; satellite imagery; soil carbon; soil organic matter; spatial variation; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal variation; China; Nei Monggol; Otindag",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063995878

Progresses in biology have contributed to better understand the complex and successive mechanisms of development of this pathology, whose diagnosis is based on a lymph node biopsy. However, the prognosis of the patients is heterogeneous and several indexes have been proposed to identify groups of patients with a similar life expectancy, in order to guide the therapeutic choices. The treatment has been modified in the last 20 years by the emergence of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies which constitute, alone or in combination, of the cornerstone of therapeutic management. After staging using, in particular, 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, the therapeutic strategy will be adapted for each patient, ranging from simple watchful waiting to a combination of chemotherapy and anti-CD20 antibodies. Relapses (which often require a new lymph node biopsy to eliminate a possible histological transformation into an aggressive lymphoma with poorer prognosis) remain common but are still accessible to effective therapeutic interventions. Thanks to these advances, the median life expectancy of patients with follicular lymphoma now exceeds 15 years. © 2019",,"antineoplastic agent; CD20 antibody; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; drug choice; follicular lymphoma; human; life expectancy; lymph node biopsy; monotherapy; pathophysiology; positron emission tomography; practice guideline; Short Survey; biopsy; differential diagnosis; experimental therapy; follicular lymphoma; immunophenotyping; immunotherapy; molecular diagnosis; pathology; personalized medicine; procedures; prognosis; survival rate; tumor recurrence; Biopsy; Diagnosis, Differential; Humans; Immunophenotyping; Immunotherapy; Life Expectancy; Lymphoma, Follicular; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Precision Medicine; Prognosis; Survival Rate; Therapies, Investigational",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070861127

Promoting low-carbon travel mode is critical to alleviate this issue. As a new travel mode, online ride-hailing (such as Didi Chuxing and Uber), is becoming increasingly popular in cities around the world. However, there is still no comparative analysis on fuel consumption and emissions: does online ride-hailing have a distinct fuel consumption and emissions pattern with traditional taxis? In this study, we use one month global positioning system dataset and orders dataset, averagely covering around 7 thousand taxis with 0.3 million trips and 23 thousand Didi Chuxing Express vehicles with 0.1 million trips per day in Chengdu, China to answer this question. Empirical results show that taxi trips associate with longer idle distance and shorter delivery distance than Didi trips. Didi trips’ average idle velocity is apparently smaller than their delivery velocity. Online ride-hailing mode is concluded to contribute to these difference: after dropping off previous passengers, Didi drivers usually park their cars until being dispatched new orders and then drive directly to pick up passengers rather than search circuitously. Fuel consumption and carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbon emissions per passenger-on kilometer of taxi trips are found to be about 1.36, 1.45, 1.36 and 1.44 times that of Didi trips, respectively. Additionally, only taxi drivers with good performance have the ability to reduce fuel consumption and emissions; while most Didi drivers can perform well on fuel consumption saving and emissions reduction. Finally, several feasible policies are suggested for improving and upgrading the traditional taxi business. Our study provides convincing evidence for understanding the advantage of online ride-hailing mode in reduction fuel consumption and emissions sourced from empty cruising, so as to support better traffic policy making and the promotion on low-carbon travel mode. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Fuel consumption and emissions; Online ride-hailing mode; Traditional taxis; Travel patterns","Carbon monoxide; Digital storage; Emission control; Fuels; Global positioning system; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Taxicabs; Comparative analysis; Emissions reduction; Hydrocarbon emission; Online ride-hailing mode; Traffic Policies; Transportation sector; Travel modes; Travel patterns; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065075216

However, due to the randomness and volatility from photovoltaic generation, the full exploitation of the advantages of building-integrated photovoltaics has become an important question for the utilities. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel and comprehensive (combined) water-energy supply system applied to the smart community with building-integrated photovoltaics and two-stage electric-hydraulic dispatching method. It was designed to minimize the electricity consumption cost and power fluctuation while meeting the water demand loads, followed by the iterative algorithm as well as linearized techniques to solve the optimisation model. The Shapley value method was introduced to ensure the fair revenue between the property company and owners. Simulation studies on a building-integrated-photovoltaics community and a 15-node water distribution system indicates that the annual operation cost of the water-electricity combined supply system was reduced by 29.6% while the external grid obtained a better prediction regarding the real-time exchange power. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model on peak shaving and valley filling and fluctuation smoothing. © 2019","Building-integrated photovoltaics; Electric-hydraulic combined dispatching; Iterative method; Shapley value method; Water distribution system","Buildings; Emission control; Energy conservation; Game theory; Historic preservation; Water distribution systems; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Dispatching methods; Electric-hydraulic combined dispatching; Electricity-consumption; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Fluctuation smoothing; Photovoltaic generation; Shapley value; Iterative methods; alternative energy; building; distribution system; electrical power; electricity supply; emission control; integrated approach; numerical method; photovoltaic system; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064435728

Until recently, the evidence for home mechanical ventilation (HMV) to treat patients with stable COPD had been lacking. This has subsequently been addressed by the application of higher levels of pressure support combined with targeted management of chronic respiratory failure, which demonstrated a reduction in all-cause mortality. Similarly, the previous trial of home oxygen therapy (HOT) and HMV delivered following an acute exacerbation failed to demonstrate an improvement in outcome. With the focus on patients with persistent hypercapnic respiratory failure in the recovery phase following a life-threatening exacerbation combined with targeted reduction in carbon dioxide, HOT and HMV (HOT-HMV) was shown to be clinically effective in reducing the time to readmission or death and cost effective in both the United Kingdom and United States healthcare systems. Future work will need to focus on promoting adherence to home ventilation and novel auto-titrating ventilator modes to facilitate and optimize the set-up of overnight ventilatory support in different target population such as COPD patients with obstructive sleep apnoea and COPD patients with episodic nocturnal hypoventilation. © 2019 Asian Pacific Society of Respirology","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; critical care; sleep; ventilation","carbon dioxide; air pressure; all cause mortality; chronic obstructive lung disease; chronic respiratory failure; clinical effectiveness; clinical outcome; cost effectiveness analysis; death; disease exacerbation; health care system; home care; home mechanical ventilation; home oxygen therapy; hospital readmission; human; hypercapnia; hypoventilation; life threat; noninvasive ventilation; palliative therapy; patient compliance; priority journal; respiratory acidosis; Review; sleep disordered breathing; United Kingdom; United States; artificial ventilation; chronic obstructive lung disease; oxygen therapy; pathophysiology; procedures; treatment outcome; Home Care Services; Humans; Oxygen Inhalation Therapy; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Respiration, Artificial; Treatment Outcome",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061200960

To avoid such competition, carbon mitigation methods using arid and semi-arid areas have been proposed, but to our knowledge there is no report of rates of sequestration based on long-term observations from actual experimentation. In this study (1999–2015), in an arid area near Leonora, Western Australia (annual rainfall: 220 mm year−1; pan evaporation: 3400 mm year−1), carbon sequestration was assessed in above and below ground biomass in Eucalyptus camaldulensis under ambient conditions and with active site amelioration (combination of water harvesting with large mounds and hardpan blasting). The carbon sequestration rate was estimated at 7.92 Mg-CO2-e ha−1 year−1 for a total carbon sink of 230 Mg-CO2-e ha−1. Carbon mitigation may thus be a viable option in arid regions, not only in Western Australia but globally, and can be enhanced with active site engineering. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Arid land afforestation; Carbon mitigation; Eco-hydrology; Eucalyptus camaldulensis; Hardpan blasting; Rain-dependent growth rate","Arid regions; Blasting; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Land use; Rain; Reforestation; Water conservation; Arid and semi-arid areas; Arid lands; Carbon mitigation; Eco-hydrology; Eucalyptus camaldulensis; Land-use competition; Large-scale afforestation; Long term observations; Carbon; afforestation; arid region; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; ecohydrology; estimation method; evergreen tree; experimental study; global warming; growth rate; implementation process; land use change; mitigation; rangeland; semiarid region; Australia; Leonora; Western Australia; Eucalyptus camaldulensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064935576

Simulations of potentially habitable planets orbiting K and G-class stars also suggest that many will become tidally-locked or become pseudo-synchronous rotators in a similar time frame where certain criteria are fulfilled. Simple models suggest that such planets will experience climatic regions organized in broadly concentric bands around the sub-stellar point, where irradiation is maximal. Here, we develop some of the quantitative, as well as the qualitative impacts of such climate on the evolutionary potential of life on such worlds, incorporating the effects of topography and ocean currents on potential biological diversity. By comparing atmospheric circulation models with terrestrial circulation and biological diversity, we are able to construct viable thought models of biological potential. While we await the generation of atmospheric circulation models that incorporate topography and varying subaerial landscape, these models can be used as a starting point to determine the overall evolutionary potential of such worlds.

This study proposes a framework for identifying the shallow geothermal energy potential of new individual and district heating (DH)systems. The model accounts for thermal interference between neighbouring wells and borehole heat exchangers, where the main criteria for analysis are ground temperature, thermal conductivity, heat flow, and heat capacity. The paper presents a cost-effective area method for the identification of potential new DH areas, while considering the cost competitiveness of the heat supplied. Economic potential is determined based on the cost-effectiveness of the competing technologies, separately for urban and rural areas. The results show that although 54% of technical DH potential in Slovenia remains untapped, the future of shallow geothermal energy systems lies predominantly in individual systems, which have proven to be the most cost efficient solution on locations with favourable geological or hydro-geological conditions. Where possible, shallow geothermal energy can contribute from 2% to 25% of energy for heat production in analysed existing fossil fuel based DH systems, thus making shallow geothermal energy suitable for supplying base load power in an economical manner. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Economic heating potential; GIS; Heat density; Shallow geothermal energy; Spatial constraints","Climate change; Cost effectiveness; District heating; Economic analysis; Fossil fuels; Geographic information systems; Geology; Specific heat; Thermal conductivity; Borehole heat exchangers; Climate change mitigation; Competing technologies; District heating system; Geothermal energy systems; Heat density; Shallow geothermal energies; Spatial constraints; Geothermal energy; assessment method; cost analysis; economic conditions; fossil fuel; geothermal energy; GIS; heat production; heating; rural area; spatial analysis; urban area; Slovenia; Calluna vulgaris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066089779

Many large cities have committed to mitigation by becoming member of a municipal climate network, such as the C40 or the Compact of Mayors. However, there is no consistent assessment of whether membership of such networks translates into measurable outcomes. To fill this gap, we propose the use of novel outcome variables, combining financial data with geospatial information. As a starting point, this paper compares utility-scale investment in photovoltaics (PV) within the administrative boundaries of large global cities, combining the Bloomberg New Energy Finance database with information from Google Maps. We analyse 512 global cities with a population of above 1 million, and consider the impact of 5 networks and 2 reporting platforms. The results suggest that membership of the C40 network has a positive effect on utility-scale solar PV investment, while no such evidence is found for any of the other networks or reporting platforms under study. Based on our findings, we recommend that municipal climate networks increase their efforts to trigger city regulation that is conducive to solar PV investment. More generally, measuring early indicators, such as low-carbon investment, can help municipal climate networks in their role as ‘commitment brokers’ for climate action on the ever-more important city level. Key policy insights Cities have considerable policy space to foster utility-scale solar PV investment within their administrative boundaries. While some large global cities exhibited significant growth in utility-scale solar PV, many others with good solar potential did not have a single project by the end of 2016. Outside of China (where city boundaries often include rural areas), Tokyo tops the list with utility-scale solar PV projects by far, followed by San Diego and Rome. Membership of the C40 network appears to make a positive difference to PV investment, unlike other networks or reporting platforms. Outcome measures like low-carbon investment can be used more generally to assess the climate action performance of cities. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate clubs; Mega cities; transnational municipal networks; urban energy systems; urban sustainability","environmental policy; investment; megacity; multinational enterprise; photovoltaic system; solar power; sustainability; utility sector; California; China; Italy; Lazio; Roma [Lazio]; Rome; San Diego; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063996490

Due to its global transport, mercury contamination is found in regions of the Earth that are remote from major emissions areas, including the Polar regions. Global anthropogenic emission inventories identify important sectors and industries responsible for emissions at a national level; however, to be useful for air transport modelling, more precise information on the locations of emission is required. This paper describes the methodology applied, and the results of work that was conducted to geospatially distribute anthropogenic mercury emissions as part of the global anthropogenic mercury emissions inventory for 2015 prepared by AMAP/UNEP for the Global Mercury Assessment (GMA) 2018 (UN Environment, 2019). This work includes the identification and use of emission point sources as well as distributing diffuse emissions for 21 emission (industry) sectors. The basic approach involves assigning emission estimates to geo-located point sources, using reported emissions information where available, and otherwise assigning a modelled emission to the point. Emissions which cannot be assigned to point sources are distributed using sector-specific proxies. Mercury speciation highly depends on industry processes and air pollution control technology. Different Hg speciation ratios are therefore applied per sector and country technology level. The resulting global emission datasets include total mercury (HgT), gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0), divalent mercury (Hg2+) and particulate mercury (HgP) in kg per year per raster cell (kg/a). The spatial resolution is flexible and the vertical resolution of the data is based on a set of predefined height classes. The resolution of the GMA2018 emission data is 0.25° × 0.25° with three (physical emission) height classes (0–50, 50–150 and &gt; 150m). A comparison with the EMEP European mercury emission was made based on spatial correlation between the two datasets. Suggested improvements for future work include the further development of proxy data and the implementation of a more structured reporting of emissions by countries. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Diffuse-emissions; Emissions; Geospatial-distribution; Mercury; Point-sources","Geographical distribution; Health risks; Mercury (metal); Mercury compounds; Particulate emissions; Air pollution control technology; Anthropogenic mercury emissions; Development and applications; Diffuse emission; Gaseous elemental mercury; Geo-spatial; Global mercury emissions; Point sources; Air pollution control; mercury; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; emission; emission inventory; mercury (element); model; particulate matter; point source pollution; pollution control; spatial resolution; air pollution control; Article; comparative study; energy yield; environmental impact; geospatial distribution; grid cell; human; population; population density; population distribution; priority journal; satellite imagery; species differentiation; urban area; waste disposal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065558484

These challenges have prompted research on natural processes for wastewater treatment, such as constructed wetlands (CWs), providing low-energy treatment potential and storage capacity. As the performance of natural treatment processes may be limited by several factors (e.g. climatic conditions, space restrictions), considerable research concentrates on investigating their combination with engineered pre-or post-treatment processes to improve their performance and increase their treatment resilience. The aim of this paper is to assess and demonstrate the advantages of combined natural and engineered systems (cNES) over purely engineered treatment systems with regard to energy savings and reduced environmental impacts. The case of a cNES located in the island of Antiparos in Greece for the treatment and reuse of municipal effluents is investigated, focusing on the energy savings and the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the natural treatment process. The performance of the system, which involves CWs for the secondary treatment of effluents, was assessed using an integrated modelling and simulation environment (baseline scenario). An alternative scenario was also built, substituting the CWs with a conventional activated sludge (CAS) process for the secondary treatment of effluents to achieve the same effluent quality as in the baseline scenario. Energy consumption and generation of GHG emissions was assessed for both scenarios, and a comparison between the two systems was conducted, highlighting the significant energy savings and the reduced GHG emissions produced by the cNES: the CAS system consumed about 3,000 times more energy, producing about 50 times more total GHG emissions compared with CWs. The results of the current analysis demonstrated that cNES involving CWs can provide a competitive alternative to purely engineered systems for wastewater treatment and reuse in isolated insular communities and small municipalities, also contributing to water scarcity reduction. © 2019 Desalination Publications.

However, experimental measurements of CNT Field-Effect Transistors (CNFETs) often exhibit substantial off-state leakage current (IOFF), resulting in increased leakage power and potential incorrect logic functionality. In this work, we (1) provide insight into a key component of this off-state leakage current and experimentally demonstrate that it stems from gate-induced drain leakage commonly referred to as GIDL, (2) provide an experimentally calibrated model that closely matches our measured results, and (3) demonstrate a path for mitigating GIDL current by engineering CNFET geometries with asymmetric gates: local back-gate CNFETs whose gate overlaps the source but not the drain. We demonstrate experimentally that this approach can reduce off-state leakage current by &gt;60× at the same bias voltage (implemented across a wide range of scaled CNFETs with gate lengths ranging from &gt;2 μm to 180 nm). This reduced leakage current due to the asymmetric gates translates to additional energy-efficiency benefits for CNFETs. Thus, this work addresses a key challenge facing CNFET-based electronics (while simultaneously providing additional energy-efficiency benefits) and is applicable to a wide-range of emerging one-dimensional and two-dimensional nanomaterials. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Carbon nanotubes; Drain current; Energy efficiency; Leakage currents; Asymmetric gates; Calibrated model; Efficiency benefits; Gate induced drain leakages; Logic functionality; Measured results; Off-state leakage current; Silicon scaling; Carbon nanotube field effect transistors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070543879

Existing pheromone-based traffic management frameworks were developed to reduce urban congestion by fusing traffic lights control strategies and vehicle routing schemes. Despite a significant reduction in traffic congestions, the greener aspects of transportation were not well investigated. In view of this, a Pheromone-based Green Transportation System (PGTS) is proposed to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions and urban congestion in a three-step approach. First, traffic congestions are predicted based on the transport pheromone intensity of the target and adjacent upstream roads through an online epsilon-Support Vector Regression model. Second, a Coordinated Traffic Light Control (CTLC) strategy generates green wave scenario, dispersing heavy traffic on congested roads to the coordinated downstream paths. Third, a Cooperative Green Vehicle Routing (CGVR) takes a further leap by probabilistically rerouting upstream vehicles from entering the congested road, preventing the accumulation of vehicles that can lead to upstream congestion. Intuitively, the integration of CTLC and CGVR increases the chances that vehicles traversing multiple intersections with fewer frequencies of acceleration, effectively marking down fuel consumption. The proposed PGTS can be realized through a Pheromone-based Hierarchical Multi-Agent System (PHMAS). Based on Singapore traffic data, experimental results from a microscopic simulation SUMO show that the proposed PGTS outperforms other six approaches in reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 37.7%, fuel consumption by 37.6%, mean travel time by 47.5%, mean waiting time by 57.3%, and increasing number of arrived vehicles at designated destinations by 62.6%. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Coordinated traffic light control; Green vehicle routing; Heterogeneous vehicle; Multi-Agent; Pheromone","Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Multi agent systems; Regression analysis; Street traffic control; Travel time; Urban transportation; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Carbon dioxide emissions; Heterogeneous vehicles; Hierarchical multi-agent system; Microscopic simulation; Multi agent; Pheromone; Support vector regression models; Traffic light control; Traffic congestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065834735

However, the effect of repeated applications of wetting agents on soil microbial populations is unknown. This two-year field experiment investigated six wetting agents representing different chemistry effects on a creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) putting green with existing SWR. Four out of the six wetting agents improved soil volumetric water content in the second growing season, while others showed no effect. This result was negatively correlated to the development of LDS, and positively correlated to occurrence of an air-borne turf disease. Soil microbial populations, determined by soil phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, found that none of the treatments applied caused a shift in microbial populations between fungi and bacteria, or gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The stress indicators such as saturated to mono-unsaturated fatty acids were not affected by the wetting agents applied as well. However, the wetting agent that contains alkyl block polymers (ABP; Matador) with proven capability for removal of soil organic coatings showed inhibition of microbial populations at one evaluation timing. This result suggested a temporary restriction in soil carbon availability for soil microorganisms following repeated ABP application, which likely contributed to the elevated LDS development observed. Another wetting agent, a combined product of a nonionic surfactant plus acidifiers (NIS; pHAcid), which is designed to reduce inorganic carbonates while enhancing wetting, elevated all soil microbial populations tested at the end of the experiment, indicating a desirable improvement in soil health. However, repeated application of NIS did not reduce SWR at the conclusion of this experiment, which, in combination with a previous report, suggested a minimal disturbance of soil organic coatings of the hydrophobic sand. Overall, this experiment suggested that soil microbial populations can be affected by wetting agents which may further influence SWR, yet the actual effect on soil microorganisms varies depending on the chemistry of the wetting agents. © 2019 by the authors.","Localized dry spot; Phospholipid fatty acid analysis; Soil hydrophobicity; Soil microbial population; Soil surfactant","acidification; environmental disturbance; fatty acid; hydrophobicity; microbial community; phospholipid; sandy soil; soil carbon; soil water; surfactant; water content; wetting; Agrostis stolonifera; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Negibacteria; Posibacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071008760

The method is based on the combined use of dynamic models, probabilistic eco-screening risk assessments and observational data (EERO). Main advantage of the proposed approach in comparing with the already known methods lies in modeling the stressors effect on the ecosystem main components intra-annual functioning mode. This allows obtaining the ecological risk intra-annual variations, identifying the intra-year intervals of increased danger and calculating the corresponding acceptable probability of anthropogenic impact. Risk simulation examples in regard to the temperate latitude regions (Northern Caspian) highly productive ecosystems and to the Arctic area low productive ecosystems are provided. Results obtained brought to nontrivial conclusions on the ecosystems vulnerability and on the necessity to prioritize ecological risk calculation followed by assessment of the allowable exposure probability. In the environmental and economic aspect, the use of EERO would help to minimize economic expenses in the development of shelf resources. Calculation of the intra-annual ecological risk variations and the corresponding calculation of the anthropogenic impact allowable probability would make it possible to vary expenses on the ecological protection measures. The volume of such measures would be determined by increasing or decreasing requirements to the acceptable anthropogenic load calculated in accordance with the model. The paper substantiates the primacy nature of determining the acceptable ecological risk value and further the acceptable intensity of anthropogenic impact that opens a possibility to receive answers to questions on the basic acceptability of accidents of a certain scale.

Oleifera Metzg) into gray forest soil at the end of the summer period significantly activates the processes of mineralization. The total CO2 emission from the soil surface in the variants with green manure increases by 1.3-1.6 times as compared with pure fallow. Compensation of gaseous carbon losses due to newly introduced organic matter is possible only at high yields of oilseed radish (3-5 tons of dry matter per ha) and hydrothermal conditions unfavourable for its mineralization. Under favourable conditions for the mineralization of fresh organic matter, a negative carbon balance is formed, but its value remains less deficient than in the variants of pure fallow.

In this work, we put into context what the industrial-scale production of chemicals from ambient CO2 using CO2 electrolysis means in terms of future required operating conditions and the device and catalyst scales that will be needed for the technology to assume its role in our global energy system. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.The use of CO2, water, and renewable electricity as direct feedstocks for the synthesis of chemicals and fuels is a seemingly appealing means of transitioning away from a reliance on fossil fuels. Electrochemical CO2 reduction in particular has been championed as a technology aiding in the energy transition. Despite continuous technical improvements, however, the consideration of CO2 electrolyzers within a chemical process remains largely unaddressed. Given the need to capture CO2 prior to electrochemical conversion, upconvert most CO2 reduction products, and operate on renewable electricity, it is essential that we start thinking about CO2 electrolyzers as part of a larger system, rather than as an independent technology. In other words, what is the endgame for CO2 electrolyzers? To initiate these discussions within the CO2 reduction community, we considered the use of CO2 electrolyzers as one technology in the “air-to-barrel” production of 10,000 tons of methanol/day. Looking at the role of the CO2 electrolyzers in the process, we highlight the distribution of energy resources required, the potential for process integration, and the importance of increasing current densities even further. A key conclusion finds that a six order-of-magnitude gap exists between current catalyst areas and industry-sized applications, emphasizing the need to begin research on scaling CO2 catalysts and electrolyzers immediately if they are to contribute to the upcoming energy transition. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.A successful transition of our global energy system will require changes to our society and industry. One of these changes is the production of electricity from renewable energy sources, which can be directly used today and in our increasingly electrified future infrastructure. The generated green electricity is also foreseen to be essential in “Power-to-X” technologies, where ambient molecules such as H2O, CO2, and N2 are converted into dense-energy carriers. Here, we provide an example of the combined technologies needed to make Power-to-X into an industry capable of influencing the global energy system (~TW). Using CO2 electrolyzers as a central technology in the production of green methanol (MeOH), we discuss the integration of direct CO2 air capture with CO2 and H2O electrolyzers and a traditional MeOH synthesis step. The resulting analysis provides tangible scales for CO2 electrolyzers at an early research stage and perspectives on a future industry powered by dilute solar energy resources. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","CO2 electrolyzers; methanol synthesis; renewable energy; scaling novel energy technologies","Catalysts; Electric power generation; Electrolysis; Electrolytic cells; Fossil fuels; Industrial chemicals; Methanol; Reduction; Solar energy; Electrochemical conversion; Electrolyzers; Energy technologies; Industrial-scale production; Methanol synthesis; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Carbon dioxide; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; catalyst; electrokinesis; methanol; technology",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070705401

Here, we adapted the traceraided ecohydrological model, EcH2O-iso, for cold regions with the explicit conceptualization of dynamic soil freeze- thaw processes. We tested the model at the data-rich Krycklan site in northern Sweden with multi-criterion calibration using discharge, stream isotopes and soil moisture in three nested catchments. We utilized the model's incorporation of ecohydrological partitioning to evaluate the effect of soil frost on evaporation and transpiration water ages, and thereby the age of source waters. The simulation of stream discharge, isotopes, and soil moisture variability captured the seasonal dynamics at all three stream sites and both soil sites, with notable reductions in discharge and soil moisture during the winter months due to the development of the frost front. Stream isotope simulations reproduced the response to the isotopically depleted pulse of spring snowmelt. The soil frost dynamics adequately captured the spatial differences in the freezing front throughout the winter period, despite no direct calibration of soil frost to measured soil temperature. The simulated soil frost indicated a maximum freeze depth of 0.25m below forest vegetation. Water ages of evaporation and transpiration reflect the influence of snowmelt inputs, with a high proclivity of old water (pre-winter storage) at the beginning of the growing season and a mix of snowmelt and precipitation (young water) toward the end of the summer. Soil frost had an early season influence of the transpiration water ages, with water pre-dating the snowpack mainly sustaining vegetation at the start of the growing season. Given the long-Term expected change in the energy balance of northern climates, the approach presented provides a framework for quantifying the interactions of ecohydrological fluxes and waters stored in the soil and understanding how these may be impacted in future. © Author(s) 2019.",,"Calibration; Catchments; Digital storage; Dynamics; Freezing; Isotopes; Runoff; Snow melting systems; Soil mechanics; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Thawing; Transpiration; Vegetation; Direct calibration; Eco-hydrological models; Forest vegetation; Freeze-thaw cycles; Freeze-thaw process; Moisture variability; Seasonal dynamics; Spatial differences; Rivers; calibration; catchment; ecohydrology; energy balance; evaporation; freeze-thaw cycle; snowmelt; snowpack; soil moisture; water storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070618694

A source apportionment study of the carbonaceous aerosol in Naples (Italy) is presented here, in order to improve this understanding in a vulnerable urban area. The aim of this study is quantifying directly fossil and non-fossil contributions to carbonaceous aerosol, by means of radiocarbon measurements. This is the first time that such an approach is implemented in this area. Fine particles with diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5) were collected daily on top of a building in the city center, from November 2016 until January 2017. The carbonaceous aerosol was separated into organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC), by a two-step thermal desorption method. Subsequent radiocarbon analysis enabled the partitioning of the major sources of carbonaceous aerosol into fossil and non-fossil ones by applying radiocarbon isotopic mass balance. The PM2.5 concentration was on average 29 ± 3 μg/m3 (mean ± standard error; n = 18), with a maximum of 68.6 ± 0.7 μg/m3 on a day when air masses back-trajectories suggest a local origin and stagnant airflow conditions in the region. The carbonaceous component accounts for roughly half of the PM2.5 mass. Fossil fuel emissions are a minor source of OC (23%), but the dominant source of EC (66%), which is directly emitted during combustion processes. However, overall only 30% of the total carbon is of fossil origin, accounting for 14% of PM2.5 mass. Surprisingly, a comparable contribution is due to primary biomass burning carbon, which accounts in total for 15% of PM2.5 mass. Traffic pollution, the main cause of fossil fuel emissions in urban areas, is a significant, but not the predominant source of carbonaceous particle concentration. These findings support the conclusion of a predominant contribution from non-fossil sources to the carbon in airborne particulate matter, which policy makers should take into account when planning mitigation strategies to improve urban air quality. © 2019 by the authors.","14C; EC; OC; PM2.5; Source apportionment; Urban air quality","Aerosols; Air quality; Combustion; Decision making; Organic carbon; Particles (particulate matter); Urban planning; Air masses back trajectories; Airborne particulate matters; Atmospheric particulate matter; Carbonaceous components; PM2.5; Source apportionment; Urban air quality; ^14C; Fossil fuels; air quality; biomass; carbon isotope; combustion; elemental carbon; organic carbon; particulate matter; source apportionment; urban atmosphere; Campania [Italy]; Italy; Naples; Napoli [Campania]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070743066

Molecular catalysts set benchmarks in catalyst investigation and design, but their incorporation into solid-state materials, and optimization of the electrochemical operating conditions, is still needed. For example, rhenium(I) diimine catalysts show almost quantitative selectivity for the conversion of CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO) in acetonitrile (MeCN), but the modification of diimine backbones can be challenging if the goal is to incorporate such molecules into materials. Presented here is a rhenium(I) complex with a 2-(2′-quinolyl)benzimidazole (QuBIm-H) ligand, where N-alkylation with a pyrene derivative allows access to a catalyst that can be adsorbed onto electrodes for aqueous CO2 reduction chemistry. The rhenium(I) catalysts are inactive for homogeneous CO2 reduction in MeCN. However, when adsorbed on edge-plane graphite, the same complexes show good activity for heterogeneous aqueous CO2 reduction, with 90% selectivity for CO.

Many small-scale biomass-based gasifier-engine systems are installed in the villages in order to provide an uninterrupted and cheap supply of electricity for various kinds of everyday requirements. In the present work, an optimized downdraft biomass gasifier is used to produce the producer gas from three different biomass materials viz. Sugarcane bagasse, cotton stalks and wood chips. These biomass materials are used in two different combinations viz. 1:1 ratio of sugarcane bagasse & wood chips; 1:1 ratio of cotton stalks and wood chips. The composition of gas produced from both the samples shows that the cotton stalks and wood chips generate a gas with higher calorific value as compared to the one produced using sugarcane bagasse and wood chips. These gases are used to run a dual fuel CI engine. The comparative investigation of various parameters, i.e. performance, emission and noise characteristics of a modified dual fuel engine is done, by running the engine on pilot fuel mode as well as on dual fuel mode using two different samples of producer gas. The maximum diesel replacement of ∼54% is observed with a ∼5% loss in brake thermal efficiency in the case when cotton stalks and wood chips are used as raw materials. The NOx emissions were reduced by ∼70% with a slight increase of ∼3 dB in the noise levels of the engine. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Biomass gasification; Dual fuel engine; Economic analysis; Emission characteristics; Noise characteristics; Performance characteristics","Bagasse; Biomass; Cotton; Economic analysis; Fuels; Gases; Rural areas; Wood products; Biomass Gasification; Brake thermal efficiency; Dual fuel ci engines; Emission characteristics; Noise characteristic; Performance characteristics; Rural electrification; Sugar-cane bagasse; Dual fuel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072119910

Surface micro-structuring has been carried out using a typical laser fluence of 0.9 J cm-2 and varying number of incident laser pulses in the range of 3000 to 9000. Laser treated samples have been characterized in terms of surface morphology, chemical phase and field emission behavior. Nanosecond laser irradiation resulted in formation of self assembled surface μ-protrusions in the laser treated region. Peak height of the generated μ-protrusions and average roughness of the laser treated region increased with increasing number of irradiating laser pulses. Laser treated specimens have shown enhanced field emission in comparison to pristine Ta specimen.

Particularly, chemical reactions and phase transitions in the complex oxide OCM catalyst NaWMn/SiO2 are studied using the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy combined with local elemental analysis. It was found that during oxygen desorption crystalline Na2WO4 and Mn2O3 phases disappear, and newly-formed compounds solidify in the form of crystalline MnWO4 and the glue-like matter. The latter contains sodium and most likely Mn2+ ions. Its localization on the grain boundaries of the SiO2 (α-cristobalite) bulbs and morphology indicate that this matter is amorphous and has a high adhesion to the silica surface. After re-oxidation, the phase composition of the sample restores, although the size and location of the restored Na2WO4 and Mn2O3 particles evidence for their formation from the glue-like matter or its molten precursor.

However, the translation of policy into effective actions that transform territories faces barriers, and is proving to be a true challenge. Through the findings of 2 years of field research (ABSTRACT-colurba project), based on the study of ten French local authorities, this paper discusses the main barriers that decision-makers are confronted with, and the drivers by which they may succeed or which could trigger more efficient actions at the local level. Once again, this study confirms that barriers are mainly reported at the resource, governance, and awareness levels. Thus, the reduction of subsidies from national government, the priority given to economic criteria and the lack of awareness of climate issues are among the main barriers. Potential and successful drivers are mainly reported at the organisational level. Indeed, the necessity to reorganise the way local public institutions are working to implement climate policy is highlighted as an important lever to overcome certain obstacles. We conclude that research on barriers and drivers to climate change adaptation is essential to better understand why efforts are so slow to take into consideration the obvious acceleration of the manifestations of climate change. But we also recommend focusing on the human factors involved into the decision-making processes, at the collective (organisational) as well as the individual (perception) level, to better relate the findings to stakeholders and to find ways to integrate them into action-research projects in order to accelerate an urgent transformation of urban systems into sustainable systems. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Decision making; Adaptation to climate changes; Climate change adaptation; Decision making process; Economic criteria; National governments; Organisational level; Public institution; Sustainable systems; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069661157

In the past, this did not include the role of soils in providing a sink for carbon. As of 2014, the European Commission legislative proposed to integrate greenhouse gas emissions and removals from LULUCF in the 2030 climate and energy framework, allowing for the contribution of carbon sinks in national inventories. To calculate the potential of these sinks it is essential to firstly understand what stocks exist at a national scale and identify the so-called ‘carbon hotspots’ in the landscape to reduce the potential leaks in the system. This is further enhanced by identifying soils which provide the potential for further sequestration of carbon, due to their soil texture and aggregate composition. Moreover, deeper soil horizons may have a high capacity to sequester significant amounts of SOC as the turnover time and chemical recalcitrance of soil organic matter (SOM)increases with depth (Lorenz and Lal, 2005). This study highlights the need to dig deeper and assess soil carbon stocks below the standard 30 cm depth, applied in many calculations and models, in order to derive sufficiently accurate estimations of soil organic carbon (SOC)stocks and the total quantity of stable SOC at depth. Using Ireland as a case study, SOC stock maps are produced with the objective of identifying and securing existing information for SOC and to show the spatial distribution and geographical variation of SOC stock at different depths. Using empirical data from a national soil survey, SOC measurements from the surface 30 cm, 50 cm and 1 m were compared across all soil types. The results indicate a large variation between soils when comparing the SOC of the first 30 cm only, while the proportion of total SOC stock contained within 0–50 cm was more consistent within subgroups of soil types, and accounts for 90% of the carbon found to 1 m. Luvisols and Stagnosols have been previously identified as soils capable of sequestering larger stores of SOC in their subsoils. These soil types were spatially mapped and the stock converted to CO2 emission equivalents. On average, up to 40 t ha−1 of stable SOC is contained at a depth below 30 cm. At national level, this adds up to 69 Mt of SOC. This research provides a spatially targeted approach that combines efforts to reduce CO2 emissions from carbon hotspots while also augmenting the sequestration of stable carbon at depth in soils with clay illuviation and wetness (stagnic)diagnostic horizons. © 2019 The Authors","Agricultural soils; Soil carbon mapping; Soil organic carbon stocks","carbon; ground water; organic carbon; soil organic matter; Article; bulk density; climate change; controlled study; Ireland; priority journal; soil; soil texture; turnover rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065815582

The XCO2 data belonging to orbiting carbon observatory-2 (OCO-2) and eight environmental variables data consist of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), net primary productivity (NPP), land surface temperature (LST), leaf area index (LAI), air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and national land cover map were modeled by multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The values of R2 and RMSE indices show the good performance of the multi-layer perceptron model for monthly models. Based on sensitivity analysis results, land cover and wind direction had the most important role in the spatial distribution of XCO2. Also, the results revealed that the maximum values of XCO2 observed in the east, south east, and desert areas in central of Iran due to the lack of vegetation cover, lack of local wind current, and high temperature. The western, northwestern and northern regions of Iran have the minimum amounts of XCO2 because of existing valuable ecosystem such as Hyrcanian and Zagrous forests, rangeland, air currents, and low temperature. The findings of this study indicated that the manageable factors such as land cover and vegetation cover play very important roles in the spatial distribution of CO2 and finding carbon dioxide source and sink at national scale.

Battery electric vehicles (BEVs)are well positioned in the electric vehicle market. This article presents a cradle-to-grave assessment of energy consumption, CO2 emissions and emissions of VOC, CO, NOx, primary PM2.5 and PM10 for current (2015)and future (2020 and 2030)LDPVs in Hebei Province, China. The analysis addressed both the fuel life cycle and vehicle life cycle for conventional gasoline and battery electric LDPVs. A scenario analysis was carried out to evaluate the reduction potentials of different future policies. The results showed that the promotion of BEVs could effectively mitigate per-kilometer petroleum use by 98% and fossil fuel use by 25–50% relative to gasoline LDPVs. BEVs hold obvious advantages in CO2, VOCs, CO, NOx and PM2.5 emissions reduction, while the PM10 emissions of BEVs are higher than those of conventional internal combustion engine vehicles, mainly due to the high emission in the upstream industry process in electricity generation. The scenario analysis showed that the emissions of VOCs, CO, NOx, PM2.5 and PM10 will decrease by 56%, 70%, 27%, 24% and 17%, respectively, with the China Ⅵ oil standard coming into force in 2030 instead of 2020. The results stress that more stringent emission controls, higher BEV penetration, and cleaner electricity should be jointly applied to ensure a successful electrification future in China. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Battery electric vehicle; China; Energy and environment; Gasoline vehicle; Life-cycle assessment; Scenario analysis","Artificial life; Battery electric vehicles; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Electric utilities; Emission control; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Gasoline; Internal combustion engines; Nitrogen oxides; Secondary batteries; China; Energy and environment; Gasoline vehicle; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Scenario analysis; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065463014

These challenges are also known as the energy trilemma, which means the system planner cannot find a planning decision achieving the minimum cost, risk and emission simultaneously. This paper proposes a multi-objective planning model to find the Pareto optimal solutions, and trade-off decisions among the above conflicting objectives. The transition process includes the retirement of aging coal-fired units, building new renewable generation and transmission lines. Also, the carbon emission flow model is applied in the planning process to calculate carbon emissions from the demand side. A new risk index is designed considering probability and severity of the corrective control (CC) actions caused by both wind output forecast errors and outages of system components. A relatively new multi-objective natural aggregation algorithm (MONAA) is introduced and applied to find the optimal solution. The proposed model is verified on a modified IEEE 24-bus RTS system. © 2019 IEEE.","carbon emission flow; corrective control risk index; retirement planning; system expansion planning; urban electricity network transformation","Carbon; Economic and social effects; Expansion; Optimal systems; Pareto principle; Carbon emission flows; Electricity networks; Retirement planning; Risk indices; System expansion; Electric network parameters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079034830

The largest portion of this reduction will likely come from energy efficiency, but efficiency alone will not be sufficient. In this paper we look specifically at California and build the case for why energy efficiency with electrification of heating is the most likely path to achieve the large carbon emission reduction needed from this sector. We examine alternative decarbonization strategies, such as solar thermal, biogas, synthetic natural gas and electrification and show why electrification is the most promising path. We evaluate these options across the dimensions of scale, cost, and suitability. We find that, while electrification has the potential to serve all heating loads, the other low-carbon options may serve only 2-70% of loads. We also expect that electrification could reduce emissions from this sector at a cost 25-90+% less than other options. © 2019 by the authors.","Biogas; Decarbonization; Electrification; Heat pump; Hydrogen; Synthetic methane","Biogas; Carbon; Decarbonization; Electric utilities; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Heating; Hydrogen; Natural gas substitutes; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon reduction; Direct combustion; Electrification; Heat pumps; Solar thermal; Synthetic natural gas; Temperate climate; Energy efficiency; biogas; electrification; emission control; energy efficiency; fossil fuel; hydrogen; methane; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070760128

Channelization and signalization can significantly diminish negative impact of DLTs. In China, a total of 56 large and medium-sized cities, including 17 provincial capitals, have adopted vehicle restriction policies due to traffic congestion, vehicle energy conservation and emission reduction, which cause travel inconvenience for citizens. This paper mainly studies signalization and channelization selections at intersections based on an entropy method. Based on the commonly used three evaluation indexes, the number of vehicles, CO emissions and fuel consumption have been added. The entropy evaluation method (EEM) method is innovatively used to objectively calculate the weight of the six indexes, which carry out the optimal traffic volume combinations for intersections of present situation, channelization and signalization. A VISSIM simulation is also used to evaluate the operating status of three conditions. The results show that EEM could help enormously in choosing different methods at a certain intersection. With the EEM, six indexes decrease by 20–70% at most. © 2019 by the authors.

First, consumer-generated food waste is increasing monumentally since open dumping is still followed as a predominant practice, the negative environmental externalities associated with food waste disposal are growing beyond manageable proportions. Second, the dependency on conventional fuels like diesel to operate transit buses, which is one of the major causes for deteriorating urban air quality. A nexus established between food waste management and operation of transit buses can improve the sustainable performance of cities in developing nations. In this study, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) supported Social Cost-Benefit Analysis (SCBA) is performed by considering a hypothetical scenario of establishing a large food waste treating biomethanation plant in Mumbai, India. The food waste from the city is transported to a biomethanation plant where it is subjected to an anaerobic digestion (AD) process. The biogas produced as a byproduct is upgraded to compressed biomethane (CBM) and used as a vehicle fuel to operate transit buses within the city. The LCA results suggest that CBM buses can reduce greenhouse gas and particulate matter emissions by 60% compared to diesel or compressed natural gas (CNG) buses. Fossil depletion potential of CBM buses is 98% lower than diesel, suggesting CBM's importance in decoupling developing nations dependency on imported crude oil. The SCBA considers: (a) costs to stakeholders, i.e., fees for open dumping of food waste and cost of fuel for operating transit buses; and (b) social costs incurred by negative environmental externalities (obtained by monetizing LCA results) resulting from both, open dumping as well as fuel combustion. SCBA results indicate that the food waste-based CBM model can save 6.86 billion Indian rupees (USD 99.4 million) annually for Mumbai. The savings are made due to a reduction in stakeholder's costs (fuel) coupled with societal, i.e., environmental externality costs if entire transit bus fleet operates on CBM fuel instead of conventional fuel mix (33:67 diesel to CNG) currently used. Although the study is performed for Mumbai, the results will be replicable to any city of developing nations facing similar issues. © 2019 by the authors.","Compressed biomethane for transit buses; Food waste management in cities of developing nations; Life cycle assessment; Private and sustainable rate of returns; Social cost benefit analysis","anaerobic digestion; biogas; cost-benefit analysis; developing world; diesel engine; environmental economics; food web; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; methane; operations technology; India; Maharashtra; Mumbai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070478704

The current study has estimated vulnerability of mountain forests and the provision of forest services to Balakot local community in context of climate change. The study had mapped three integral ecosystem services as provisionary (fuel wood, timber, fresh water), regulatory (protection from natural hazards) and cultural (recreation) through the local community’s perception. Carbon stock assessment as a regulatory service of the forest was carried out in the standing trees and from the soil of five selected sites in Balakot. Results have shown that these forests provide myriad of services to their surrounding communities in the form of timber, firewood, climate regulation and recreation etc. In terms of change in delivery of ecosystem services, 66% respondents informed that fuel wood has declined, 82% were of the view that forest cover has been reduced and 83% were agreed that their local forest is important for peace and harmony. The total carbon stock assessment was found to be 243.79 t/ha with an average tree biomass of 207.41 t/ha and the soil carbon of 36.38 t/ha. The study concluded that these forests are playing a vital role for the livelihood of the surrounding community as well as contributing in the climate change impacts mitigation. Therefore, these forest needs to be managed sustainably for the continuity of numerous services to mankind. © 2019, Pakistan Botanical Society.

Managing natural resources in the Australian context is also a complex task because it involves a raft of stakeholders subjected to ongoing institutional changes and reductions in funding for programme implementation. This paper explores the use of scenario planning as a suitable tool to deal with the uncertainty and complexity inherent to natural resource management. Specifically, it reports on the development and application of explorative scenarios (multiple plausible futures) involving six natural resource management organisations and their communities of practice operating along the East Coast of Australia. Scenarios were developed based on two key drivers of change, namely: maturing approach to natural resource management; and community driven climate change action, to test the robustness and flexibility of a suite of existing strategies, policies and targets. Findings indicate that explorative scenarios were useful in the identification of strategies that may result in perverse or negative impacts under different futures; guide selection of different approaches in response to unexpected events; encourage a forward-looking approach rather than relying on past experiences only; create flexible, robust strategies that are better able to deal with shocks and surprises; provide participating policy owners with an opportunity to consider future contexts for their policies to play out in; and, ascertain a range of possible pathways to achieve a vision or goals depending on changed circumstances. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Collaborative planning; Ecosystem services; Environmental planning; Foresight; Uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068473403

Populations living in cities are likely to be particularly at risk, but the role of urban characteristics in modifying the direct effects of temperature on health is still unclear. In this contribution, we used a multi-country dataset to study effect modification of temperature-mortality relationships by a range of city-specific indicators. Methods: We collected ambient temperature and mortality daily time-series data for 340 cities in 22 countries, in periods between 1985 and 2014. Standardized measures of demographic, socio-economic, infrastructural and environmental indicators were derived from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Regional and Metropolitan Database. We used distributed lag non-linear and multivariate meta-regression models to estimate fractions of mortality attributable to heat and cold (AF%) in each city, and to evaluate the effect modification of each indicator across cities. Results: Heat- and cold-related deaths amounted to 0.54% (95% confidence interval: 0.49 to 0.58%) and 6.05% (5.59 to 6.36%) of total deaths, respectively. Several city indicators modify the effect of heat, with a higher mortality impact associated with increases in population density, fine particles (PM2.5), gross domestic product (GDP) and Gini index (a measure of income inequality), whereas higher levels of green spaces were linked with a decreased effect of heat. Conclusions: This represents the largest study to date assessing the effect modification of temperature-mortality relationships. Evidence from this study can inform public-health interventions and urban planning under various climate-change and urban-development scenarios. © 2019 The Author(s).","cities; climate; epidemiology; heat; mortality; Temperature","climate; data set; database; epidemiology; heating; mortality; OECD; temperature effect; urban planning; vulnerability; article; city planning; climate change; cold stress; controlled study; death; environmental temperature; gross national product; heat; mortality; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; population density; public health; time series analysis; adverse event; body temperature; city; cold; environment; epidemiology; heat; human; mortality; plant; risk factor; socioeconomics; Body Temperature; Built Environment; Cities; Cold Temperature; Environment; Hot Temperature; Humans; Mortality; Plants; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067299967

One such example is the design of car-reduced neighborhoods, although these are controversial issues in the hegemonic 'system' of automobility. Despite the reduction of emissions and frequent recognition as 'best practice examples', 'planning-critical' research questions the underlying objectives and narratives of such sustainable developments. Our study contributes to this research perspective by improving the understanding of narratives that emerge along with car-reduced housing developments. For this purpose, we analyze two car-reduced neighborhoods in the City of Darmstadt (Germany) by conducting interviews with different actors involved in the planning and implementation processes. Our investigation reveals that the development of car-reduced neighborhoods (i) is consciously embedded in the context of sustainability, (ii) is characterized by power relations, (iii) follows normative indicators, and (iv) does not always correspond to lived realities. Altogether, the traced narratives of car-reduced neighborhoods are embedded in the overarching debate on sustainability, while at the same time revealing the dependence of society on the automobile. Thus, the hegemonic 'system' of automobility-although it is beginning to crack-continues to exist. © 2019 by the authors.","Automobile society; Car-reduced neighborhood; Darmstadt; Inter- and transdisciplinary research; Narratives; Sustainable city; Sustainable development; Urban and transport planning","academic research; automobile; interdisciplinary approach; neighborhood; sustainable development; transport process; urban planning; Darmstadt; Germany; Hesse",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070778504

Here, we address the hypothesis that genetic variation in foliar condensed tannins along a Populus hybridization gradient influences soil ammonia oxidizers, a group of autotrophic microorganisms that perform the first step of nitrification and are not dependent on carbon derived from plant photosynthesis. Evidence that genetically based plant traits influence the abundance and activity of autotrophic soil microbes would greatly expand the concept of extended plant phenotypes. We found that increasing foliar condensed tannin concentration reduced rates of soil nitrification potential by ~75%, reduced the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea by ~66%, but had no effect on ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Other indices that often drive nitrification rates, including soil total nitrogen, foliar nitrogen, and soil pH, were not significant predictors of either the activity or the abundance of ammonia oxidizers, suggesting genetic variation in foliar condensed tannins may be the dominant regulating factor. These results demonstrate the condensed tannin phenotypes of two different tree species and their naturally occurring hybrids have extended effects on a key ecosystem process and provide evidence for indirect genetic linkages among autotrophs across at least two domains of life. © 2019 The Authors.","ammonia oxidizers; Archaea; autotrophic soil microorganisms; bacteria; community ecosystem phenotypes; condensed tannins; nitrification",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071776519

Little is known about the effects of combined global change stressors on phytoplankton communities, and particularly how these are mediated by distinct community properties such as productivity, grazing pressure and size distribution. Here, we tested for the effects of warming and eutrophication on phytoplankton net growth rate and C:N:P stoichiometry in two phytoplankton cell size fractions (<30 µm and >30 µm) in the presence and absence of grazing in microcosm experiments. Because effects may also depend on lake productivity, we used phytoplankton communities from three Dutch lakes spanning a trophic gradient. We measured the response of each community to multifactorial combinations of temperature, nutrient, and grazing treatments and found that nutrients elevated net growth rates and reduced carbon:nutrient ratios of all three phytoplankton communities. Warming effects on growth and stoichiometry depended on nutrient supply and lake productivity, with enhanced growth in the most productive community dominated by cyanobacteria, and strongest stoichiometric responses in the most oligotrophic community at ambient nutrient levels. Grazing effects were also most evident in the most oligotrophic community, with reduced net growth rates and phytoplankton C:P stoichiometry that suggests consumer-driven nutrient recycling. Our experiments indicate that stoichiometric responses to warming and interactions with nutrient addition and grazing are not universal but depend on lake productivity and cell size distribution. © 2019 The Authors.

Chan School of Public Health, Harvard University, Boston, MA, United States","More than three billion people rely on seafood for nutrition. However, fish are the predominant source of human exposure to methylmercury (MeHg), a potent neurotoxic substance. In the United States, 82% of population-wide exposure to MeHg is from the consumption of marine seafood and almost 40% is from fresh and canned tuna alone1. Around 80% of the inorganic mercury (Hg) that is emitted to the atmosphere from natural and human sources is deposited in the ocean2, where some is converted by microorganisms to MeHg. In predatory fish, environmental MeHg concentrations are amplified by a million times or more. Human exposure to MeHg has been associated with long-term neurocognitive deficits in children that persist into adulthood, with global costs to society that exceed US$20 billion3. The first global treaty on reductions in anthropogenic Hg emissions (the Minamata Convention on Mercury) entered into force in 2017. However, effects of ongoing changes in marine ecosystems on bioaccumulation of MeHg in marine predators that are frequently consumed by humans (for example, tuna, cod and swordfish) have not been considered when setting global policy targets. Here we use more than 30 years of data and ecosystem modelling to show that MeHg concentrations in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) increased by up to 23% between the 1970s and 2000s as a result of dietary shifts initiated by overfishing. Our model also predicts an estimated 56% increase in tissue MeHg concentrations in Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) due to increases in seawater temperature between a low point in 1969 and recent peak levels—which is consistent with 2017 observations. This estimated increase in tissue MeHg exceeds the modelled 22% reduction that was achieved in the late 1990s and 2000s as a result of decreased seawater MeHg concentrations. The recently reported plateau in global anthropogenic Hg emissions4 suggests that ocean warming and fisheries management programmes will be major drivers of future MeHg concentrations in marine predators. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"dissolved organic carbon; methylmercury; organic carbon; sea water; unclassified drug; Atlantic cod; bioaccumulation; climate change; concentration (parameter); controlled study; energy expenditure; fishing; food web; Gulf of Maine; human; Letter; nonhuman; overfishing; population research; priority journal; seawater temperature; Thunnus thynnus; tuna; water temperature; Gadus morhua; Scombridae; Thunnus thynnus; Xiphias gladius",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070270623

As such, its emissions of greenhouse and ozone-depleting gases are of global significance. However, unlike neighbouring China, the Indian sub-continent is very poorly monitored by atmospheric measurement networks. India's halocarbon emissions, here defined as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and chlorocarbons, are not well-known. Previous measurements from the region have been obtained at observatories many hundreds of kilometres from source regions, or at high altitudes, limiting their value for the estimation of regional emission rates. Given the projected rapid growth in demand for refrigerants and solvents in India, emission estimates of these halocarbons are urgently needed to provide a benchmark against which future changes can be evaluated. In this study, we report atmosphericmeasurement-derived halocarbon emissions from India. With the exception of dichloromethane, these top-down estimates are the first for India's halocarbons. Air samples were collected at low altitude during an aircraft campaign in June and July 2016, and emissions were derived from measurements of these samples using an inverse modelling framework. These results were evaluated to assess India's progress in phasing out ozone-depleting substances under the Montreal Protocol. India's combined CFC emissions are estimated to be 54 (27-86) Tg CO2 eq: yr-1 (5th and 95th confidence intervals are shown in parentheses). HCFC-22 emissions of 7.8 (6.0-9.9) Gg yr-1 are of similar magnitude to emissions of HFC-134a (8.2 (6.1-10.7) Gg yr-1). We estimate India's HFC-23 emissions to be 1.2 (0.9-1.5) Gg yr-1, and our results are consistent with resumed venting of HFC- 23 by HCFC-22 manufacturers following the discontinuation of funding for abatement under the Clean Development Mechanism. We report small emissions of HFC-32 and HFC- 143a and provide evidence to suggest that HFC-32 emissions were primarily due to fugitive emissions during manufacturing processes. A lack of significant correlation among HFC species and the small emissions derived for HFC-32 and HFC-143a indicate that in 2016, India's use of refrigerant blends R-410A, R-404A and R-507A was limited, despite extensive consumption elsewhere in the world. We also estimate emissions of the regulated chlorocarbons carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform from northern and central India to be 2.3 (1.5-3.4) and 0.07 (0.04-0.10) Gg yr-1 respectively. While the Montreal Protocol has been successful in reducing emissions of many ozone-depleting substances, growth in the global emission rates of the unregulated very short-lived substances poses an ongoing threat to the recovery of the ozone layer. Emissions of dichloromethane are found to be 96.5 (77.8-115.6) Gg yr-1, and our estimate suggests a 5-fold increase in emissions since the last estimate derived from atmospheric data in 2008. We estimate perchloroethene emissions from India and chloroform emissions from northern-central India to be 2.9 (2.5-3.3) and 32.2 (28.3-37.1) Gg yr-1 respectively. Given the rapid growth of India's economy and the likely increase in demand for halocarbons such as HFCs, the implementation of long-term atmospheric monitoring in the region is urgently required. Our results provide a benchmark against which future changes to India's halocarbon emissions may be evaluated. © 2019 Author(s).",,"air sampling; atmospheric chemistry; concentration (composition); emission control; greenhouse gas; halocarbon; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070318954

The provision of public transit, and specifically urban rail transit, is widely seen as a useful tool for reducing urban transportation GHG emissions. More research, however, is needed to understand the net impact of new metro rail infrastructure on urban emissions and guide efforts to maximise the GHG savings through rail investments. This paper examines the net GHG emissions of the Jubilee line extension (JLE) in London, UK. The GHG emissions associated with construction, operation, ridership and changes in urban density associated with the provision of the new metro rail infrastructure are assessed. These components are then combined and compared to calculate the net GHG impact across the study period, which extends from opening in 1999 through 2011. The capital GHG emissions from construction of the JLE are calculated as 530 kilotonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). The initial mode shift from other rail lines and long-term mode change from automobiles result in yearly GHG savings from riders on the JLE. A quasi-experimental analysis of land-use change near the JLE finds no calculable GHG saving from increased residential density. The GHG payback period is calculated between 13 and 19 years. © 2020 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.","environment; sustainability; transport planning","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Investments; Land use; Light rail transit; Railroad transportation; Urban transportation; Experimental analysis; Land-use change; Rail infrastructure; Residential density; Total emissions; Transportation sector; Urban emissions; Urban rail transit; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084203808

Residential wood combustion is the largest domestic source of fine particles, and there is increasing political interest in finding feasible measures to reduce those emissions. In this paper, we present the PM2.5 emissions from residential wood combustion in Finland, as well as the resulting concentrations. We used population-weighed concentrations in a 250 × 250 m grid as population exposure estimates, with which we calculated the disease burden of the emissions. Compared to a projected baseline scenario, we studied the effect of chosen reduction measures in several abatement scenarios. In 2015, the resulting annual average concentrations were between 0.5 and 2 µg/m3 in the proximity of most cities, and disease burden attributable to residential wood combustion was estimated to be 3400 disability-adjusted life years (DALY) and 200 deaths. Disease burden decreased by 8% in the 2030 baseline scenario and by an additional 63% in the maximum feasible reduction scenario. Informational campaigns and improvement of the sauna stove stock were assessed to be the most feasible abatement measures to be implemented in national air quality policies. © 2019 by the authors.

For this purpose, historical weekly rainfall data for a period ranging from 30 to 55 years of 110 rain-gauge stations and normal weekly PET were employed. The assured weekly rainfall at different probability levels, viz. 25, 50, and 75%, was computed employing incomplete gamma distribution technique. The study revealed that at 50% probability (i.e., 50 out of 100 years), the sowing window of rainfed crops with MAI ≥ 0.33 ranged from 19 to 24 SMW (standard meteorological week) over different districts in Zone I (North west alluvial plains), 18 to 23 SMW in Zone II (North east alluvial plains), 23–24 SMW in Zone IIIA (Part of South Bihar alluvial plains), and 24–25 SMW in Zone IIIB (Part of South Bihar alluvial plains). The districts under Zone II recorded the earliest sowing week for starting sowing of rainfed crops, and the most delayed start of sowing was recorded in the districts under Zone IIIB at all probability levels. Kishanganj District recorded the highest duration of water availability followed by West Chamaparan District at all MAI and probability levels. In terms of longer length of water availability and higher values of MAI, Zone II appeared to be the most potential agroclimatic zone followed by Zone I and Zone IIIA.

The latter are specific regions of the parameter space of the plume flow, defined by the CO2-to-brine relative mobility and the buoyancy parameter (injection pressure to buoyancy pressure scale ratio). In addition to the known asymptotic self-similar solutions for low buoyancy, we introduce two novel ones for the high buoyancy regimes via power series solutions of asymptotic self-similarity equations. The explicit results for the peak value of pressure on the cap, which arises in the vicinity of the well, are derived and discussed for all flow regimes. The analytical results derived in this work are applied for the purpose of cap integrity considerations in six test cases of CO2 geological storage from the PCOR partnership, most of which correspond to high buoyancy conditions. The validity of the self-similar solutions (late time asymptotics) is verified with CFD numerical simulations performed with the software Ansys-Fluent. The result is that the self-similar solutions and the associated pressure estimations are valid in typical injection durations of interest, even for early times. © 2019 by the authors.","Caprock stability; CO2 sequestration; Flow regimes; Gravity segregation; Multiphase flow; Porous media; Pressure build-up; Saline aquifer; Self-similar; VOF method","Aquifers; Buoyancy; Carbon dioxide; Multiphase flow; Porous materials; Caprock; CO2 sequestration; Flow regimes; Gravity segregation; Pressure build up; Saline aquifers; Self-similar; VOF method; Computational fluid dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071701786

The study showed that changes in rainfall pattern may have the most profound effect on gonad maturation and breeding of Mystus tengara and Mystus cavasius followed by the effect of increased water temperature due to rising air temperature. Indication of region-specific adaptation was noticed in reproductive phenology of Eutropiichthys vacha based on local trends of warming climate. The other habitat parameters, such as dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, nitrate, and phosphate, were correlated with gonad maturity and spawning. Climatic variability may bring region-specific changes in breeding phenology of fish species in the Ganga River. Under a warming climate, changes in precipitation pattern manifested into riverine flow pulse may be the key driver in dictating breeding phenology. Our study indicates E. vacha as a climate sensitive species that may be selected as a target species for climate change impact studies. © 2019, ISB.","Breeding; Climate change; E. vacha; M. cavasius; M. tengara; Modeling; River Ganga","animal; breeding; catfish; climate change; ecosystem; river; season; temperature; Animals; Breeding; Catfishes; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Rivers; Seasons; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067316410

However, the direction and extent to which these dynamics are affected by combined changes in climate and biodiversity are not well understood. We used a field experiment in a Mediterranean shrubland ranging from one to four shrub species with partial rain exclusion (− 12%) to test how lower precipitation interacts with shrub species diversity to influence C and N release during decomposition. We also distinguished between first-year (0–12 months) and second-year decomposition (12–24 months) to test the hypothesis of stronger diversity effects at the beginning of the decomposition process. Litter C and N release increased with litter species richness during the first year, but not during the second year of decomposition. However, these richness effects were weak and less consistent than litter composition effects, which persisted over time and became even stronger for C release after 2 years of decomposition. Partial rain exclusion reduced N release by 17% only during the first year and had no effect on C release in either year. Community-weighted mean (CWM) traits and functional dissimilarity (FD) of litter traits contributed both to explain litter species composition effects. These litter trait effects were not altered by partial rain exclusion, but were more important after 2 years than after 1 year of decomposition. Our findings suggest increasing trait legacy effects with ongoing decomposition. More generally, our data showed that changes in the diversity of dominant shrub species had stronger effects on C and N release during litter decomposition than a moderate reduction in precipitation. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","biodiversity–ecosystem functioning; community-weighted means; decomposition stage; functional trait dissimilarity; garrigue; litter functional traits; rainfall exclusion","biodiversity; decomposition analysis; ecosystem function; litter; rainfall; regression analysis; shrub; shrubland; species diversity; species richness; temporal variation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056455113

Temperate forests cover ∼16.5% of the Mexican landscape, and are a priority ecosystem for global conservation due to their high rate of endemism and species diversity. These forests also provide valuable ecosystem services, including the storage of organic carbon. Mexican temperate forests have lost more than half of their original cover, with ongoing forest degradation, resulting in CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Most studies and carbon inventories only consider organic carbon stored in the aboveground biomass, and do not consider the organic carbon stored within soils of temperate forests. As a result, the emissions of CO2 due to deforestation are underestimated, and the value of temperate forests is underappreciated. To address this shortcoming, (1) we examine the extent and factors determining soil organic carbon stocks; (2) we estimate soil organic carbon stocks of Mexican temperate forests, the CO2 emissions caused by deforestation and avoided emissions from conservation and (3) we discuss the causes of loss of soil OC and management strategies to mitigate this loss. We propose that including the soil organic carbon stock-component is a priority for national projects targeting reducing emissions from deforestation. Also, urgent studies on the impacts of forest degradation in stocks of soil organic carbon are needed. Management strategies for conservation and rehabilitation of Mexican temperate forests must consider social and economic aspects of the local communities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 emissions; Conifer-broadleaf forests; Forest degradation; Montane biome","Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Soil conservation; Soils; Above ground biomass; Broadleaf forest; Carbon dioxide emissions; CO2 emissions; Forest degradation; Management strategies; Montane biome; Soil organic Carbon stocks; Organic carbon; biome; broad-leaved forest; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; coniferous forest; conservation management; deforestation; ecosystem service; endemism; forest ecosystem; habitat fragmentation; mountain environment; organic compound; prioritization; soil carbon; species diversity; temperate forest; Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; Conservation; Deforestation; Degradation; Ecosystems; Forests; Soil; Mexico [North America]; Coniferophyta",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065717690

Syngas application from gasification on the internal combustion engine has problems with tar content. one method for reducing tar content is by means of a multi-stage air inlet in the reduction zone to initiate heterogeneous oxidation reactions. In this study a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic model was used to simulate gasification reactions. The simulation was carried out using a one-phase model with k epsilon turbulence model, P1 radiation model, devolatilization model using kobayashi model, MSW fuel modeled as a discrete phase that moves in the continuous phase, and the reactions that occur are volumetric and particle surface reaction in which the interaction of turbulence-chemistry using finite-rate/eddy-dissipation. The ratio of air used is 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% between oxidation and reduction. Based on the simulation results, there is an increase in syngas composition, especially CO because there is a heterogeneous oxidation reaction between carbon in the reduction zone with oxygen which also triggers a rise in temperature in the oxidation zone. CO2 concentration decreases due to an increase in the rate of boudouard reaction. but when the amount of air continues to increase there is a decrease in temperature in the oxidation zone because the amount of air for the oxidation reaction decreases, the simulation results obtained can be used to optimize the downdraft gasifier by adding air input to the reduction zone. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Pollen and charcoal analysis of a 5-meter sediment core provides a record of vegetation change, fire history and climate spanning 12,700 cal BP to the present day. This study focusses on tree-grass vegetation dynamics, eucalypt to non-eucalypt plant interactions, and climate–fire–human relationships in an area where few long-term savanna records exist. The dataset suggests wetlands experienced alternating episodes of ephemeral waterlogging and seasonal inundation due to post-glacial monsoon variability up until permanent inundation from approximately 6000 cal BP. The surrounding catchment transformed from a terminal Pleistocene–early Holocene wooded-savanna to a later Holocene open forest. This increase in woody cover was a prominent site feature, primarily driven by climate–moisture availability. In turn, the extent of fire and fire impact, is a function of climate–vegetation feedbacks. Such interplay between fire history, climate change and vegetation pattern was also influenced by more intense human management of the area, in the last 4000 years of the record. It is proposed Girraween may have become a much-socialized and managed human landscape in this late Holocene phase.

Many opportunities exist to enhance the sustainability of historic waterworks still in operation in order to help mediate climate change effects. This must include mitigating climate change impacts on sources of potable water, such as by implementing strategies for water-efficient landscape design, while considering possible uses of the visible elements of the system, such as water treatment plants, to draw attention to this engineering heritage's continued and critical role. The R.C. Harris filtration plant is the main water treatment plant for the Greater Toronto Area in Canada, drawing water from Lake Ontario. This iconic 'Palace of Purification' has been in continuous use since 1941 and was declared a National Historic Civil Engineering Site in 1992. In 2013, it was still producing nearly 40% of Toronto's tap water. Examination of this plant serves to illustrate the interconnection of a system's historic design and its water source's watershed as heritage, to discuss expected impacts of climate change and explain not only some of the possibilities for mitigation, but also eventual necessary and challenging adaptations to changing treatment needs. © 2019 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.","climate change; reclamation & renovation; rehabilitation; water supply","Lakes; Patient rehabilitation; Plants (botany); Potable water; Water filtration; Water supply; Water supply systems; Water treatment; Water treatment plants; Changing climate; Climate change impact; Engineering Heritage; Filtration plants; Greater Toronto Area; Landscape design; Toronto , Canada; Urban water supply system; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071113851

The first objective of the collaborative, 2-day workshop was to present and discuss in a workshop format the salient climate change science for the RGNF landscape, in terms of projections, impacts, and vulnerabilities. The second objective was to facilitate a planning process that would stimulate ideas regarding aspects of current and proposed management that may need modification in light of stressors related to climate change. We used an adaptation decisionmaking framework to structure the workshop. All parties deemed the workshop a success, leading to lessons learned and minimum conditions for replicating similar efforts to effectively meet the 2012 planning rule criteria. As other forests consider undertaking similar collaborative science-management workshops to integrate climate change adaptation into their plan revisions, we recommend: (1) that the workshop take place early in the plan revision process, (2) that there be commitment from the national forest leadership and support for staff to complete a comprehensive look at management actions for climate change adaptation, and (3) that there be clear agreement on expectations of workshop participants—for scientists in their role of providing scientific information and for managers in their role of incorporating that information into the planning process. © 2019, USDA Forest Service.

Unfortunately, there is a lack of research in this area within developing countries, which are becoming increasingly urbanised and where mechanical air conditioning demands are rising. Many of these countries are adopting thermal comfort standards such as the ASHRAE Standard 55, the EN 15251, and the ISO 7730 to regulate the use of air-conditioning; even when these standards have been widely criticised for their inadequacy within geographical regions different to the ones that they were designed for. Research suggests the need to confirm these models through further post-occupancy studies and fieldwork. Deficiencies in data collection and methodologies are thought to require particular attention to develop algorithms that can predict thermal comfort levels accurately. Comprehensive strategies considering interrelated psychological, physiological and social factors are needed. This manuscript highlights gaps of research, specifically within tropical developing countries, through the analysis of Colombia as a case study. It emphasises the importance of standardised fieldwork data and gives examples of alternative collection systems. This aims to contribute to the understanding of occupant's adaptive behaviours and their impact on the mitigation of climate change. © 2019 by the authors.","Comfort assessment; Energy use; Mechanical ventilation; Thermal comfort; Thermal comfort data collection; Tropical developing countries","algorithm; assessment method; developing world; energy use; environmental modeling; environmental quality; methodology; standardization; ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070405088

Over the last decade, stringent energy codes have enabled the introduction of new HVAC technologies to reduce operational CO2e emissions. However, life cycle carbon emissions of buildings are odivided into operational carbon (OC) and embodied carbon (EC). Operational carbon are the CO2e emissions generated from the burning of fossil fuels used to heat, cool and power the building space during its service life, while EC encompasses the CO2e emissions equivalent to producing, procuring, installing, mantaining, repairing and disposing of the materials and components that make up the building. Over the last decade, broad efforts have improved the understanding of the role that HVAC system selection play in overall OC, nevertheless, EC of HVAC has remained unexamined This paper aims to identify typical HVAC systems used in office building design in Washington State and explore the effects of current practice on total energy use, operational and embodied CO2e. The study sample is composed of twenty office buildings in Washington State registered under the LEED v3 2009 version, from which 15 have obtained LEED certification in the last two years. The projects are registered under the New Construction (NC), Core and Shell (CS), Existing Buildings and Operation and Maintenance (EB:OM) and Commercial Interiors (CI) products and comply with the requirements established in the ASHRAE 90.1-2007 energy standard. The results show that typical HVAC system selection is often a combination of different technologies for ventilation, heating and cooling, and that in general: smaller buildings tend to incorporate high efficiency packaged units while medium and large size buildings typically rely on High Performance Variable Air Volume (HPVAV) systems or hydronic systems such as chilled beams and water source heat pumps (WSHP). The results also indicate that data available through the LEED v3 2009 documentation system on embodied carbon of the mechanical systems is limited and that simplified methods to assess embodied carbon of HVAC are needed in order to integrate EC into whole life assessment of Mechanical Systems. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air conditioning; Architectural design; Carbon; Climate change; Cooling systems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental design; Fossil fuels; Life cycle; Mechanics; Office buildings; Sustainable development; Ventilation; Documentation systems; Heating and cooling; Mechanical systems; New constructions; Operation and maintenance; Operational energy; Performance variables; Water source heat pump; HVAC",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071853792

Very few studies have explored the specific demand characteristics of apartments, which house a growing proportion of the global urban population. We present a study of apartment electricity loads, using a dataset containing a year of half-hourly electricity data for 6,000 Australian households, to examine the relationship between dwelling type, demographic characteristics and load profile. The focus on apartments, combined with the size of the data set, and the representative seasonal load profiles obtained through clustering full annual profiles, is unique in the literature. We find that median per-occupant household electricity use is 21% lower for apartments than for houses and that, on average, apartments have lower load factor and higher daily load variability, and show greater diversity in their daily peak times, resulting in a lower coincidence factor for aggregations of apartment loads. Using cluster analysis and classification, we also show the impact of dwelling type on the shape of household electricity load profiles. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Apartments; Cluster analysis; Load aggregation; Load profiles; Low-carbon cities; Residential electricity demand","Architectural design; Carbon; Cluster analysis; Electric power utilization; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Apartments; Load aggregation; Load profiles; Low-carbon cities; Residential Electricity demands; Apartment houses; carbon emission; cluster analysis; demand analysis; electricity generation; emission control; energy efficiency; energy planning; residential energy; urban population; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066134227

Women are very vulnerable to climate change. But until now gender considerations are still not explicitly stated in various climate change policies. In the marine and fisheries sector, extreme climate change makes many fishermen unable to go to sea and fish declines. The unequal division of gender roles causes the level of vulnerability to climate change to differ between women and men. This study aims to analyze the vulnerability and gender roles of fishing communities due to climate change in West Sumatra. A positivistic-deductive research approach.

Thus, to understand how climate change may affect the global carbon cycle, we must also be able to understand and model its effects on dryland vegetation. Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) are an important tool for modeling ecosystem dynamics, but they often struggle to reproduce seasonal patterns of plant productivity. Because the phenological niche of many plant species is linked to both total productivity and competitive interactions with other plants, errors in how process-based models represent phenology hinder our ability to predict climate change impacts. This may be particularly problematic in dryland ecosystems where many species have developed a complex phenology in response to seasonal variability in both moisture and temperature. Here, we examine how uncertainty in key parameters as well as the structure of existing phenology routines affect the ability of a DGVM to match seasonal patterns of leaf area index (LAI) and gross primary productivity (GPP) across a temperature and precipitation gradient. First, we optimized model parameters using a combination of site-level eddy covariance data and remotely-sensed LAI data. Second, we modified the model to include a semi-deciduous phenology type and added flexibility to the representation of grass phenology. While optimizing parameters reduced model bias, the largest gains in model performance were associated with the development of our new representation of phenology. This modified model was able to better capture seasonal patterns of both leaf area index (R2 = 0.75) and gross primary productivity (R2 = 0.84), though its ability to estimate total annual GPP depended on using eddy covariance data for optimization. The new model also resulted in a more realistic outcome of modeled competition between grass and shrubs. These findings demonstrate the importance of improving how DGVMs represent phenology in order to accurately forecast climate change impacts in dryland ecosystems. © 2019","Ecosystem model; Eddy covariance; LPJ-GUESS; Parameter optimization; Phenology; Sagebrush","carbon flux; climate change; dryland farming; ecological modeling; ecosystem dynamics; ecosystem modeling; eddy covariance; grass; leaf area index; optimization; phenology; precipitation (climatology); satellite data; seasonal variation; shrub; terrestrial ecosystem; Artemisia tridentata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064906404

Methods: In our study, vegetation index (VI) data obtained from TM image and CS derived from field-based surveys were amalgamated to develop a regression model to predict spatio-temporal patterns of CS. VI correction model was established by normalizing previous imagery (1984, 1995, and 2005) to 2014 image data. Results: NDVI is better than other VIs for predicting urban forest CS. Both UF area and its CS increased gradually from 1984 to 2014, especially in outer rings of the city. CS showed a definite decreasing trend from outer rings to downtown. Due to urban greening policies, landscape patches of UF or CS recently became larger and more aggregated. The CS by UF class distribution was skewed toward low values in all the years, but the skew gradually decreased over time. It was estimated that the average annual increase of CS by UF could offset 3.9% of the average annual increase in urban carbon emissions. Conclusions: Our study proposes that spatio-temporal changes in UF patterns dramatically affected the amount of CS and carbon capture. The increase in UF coverage and quality would mitigate more urban carbon emissions, especially in outer rings. © 2019 The Authors","Carbon storage; Urban forest (UF); Urban greening; Urbanization","Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Regression analysis; Above-ground carbons; Carbon storage; Spatio-temporal changes; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Spatiotemporal patterns; Urban forests; Urban greening; Urbanization; Forestry; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; emission control; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; urban forestry; urbanization; vegetation index; Article; carbon footprint; carbon storage; China; city planning; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; environmental temperature; forest management; geographic distribution; global positioning system; landscape; policy; priority journal; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; urbanization; vegetation; chemistry; China; city; forest; metabolism; urbanization; China; carbon; carbon dioxide; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Cities; Forests; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066279755

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) devices are often the backbone of such intelligent solutions, since they can enable an easy and intuitive bidirectional communication between energy systems and users and, at the same time, are able to suggest energy saving procedures. These energy saving procedures are mainly suggested when energy hungry behaviors are registered. Particularly, authors of this paper have assumed setting indoor set point temperatures, adjusting ventilation airflow rates and opening windows as energy hungry behaviors to tackle by means of ICT-driven intelligent solutions. Two different localities, namely Helsinki and Milan, have been considered as representative of cold and mild European climate conditions. Results report that adopting ICT-driven intelligent solutions for setting heating setback and indoor set point temperatures and for controlling the mechanical ventilation according to actual people’s presence and CO2 levels ensures consistent reductions of energy demand, especially in Helsinki, where mechanical ventilation is adopted. Moreover, if mechanical ventilation does not work properly or is missing, benefits in reducing energy demand can be even achieved by adopting ICT-driven intelligent solutions for advising building users when windows should be opened or closed according to sensed CO2 levels. This is relevant especially in Milan. The adoption of intelligent HVAC–window controls, which enable to turn off the HVAC when windows are opened, does not ensure a significant effect in Helsinki. Instead, this solution is promising in Milan, especially when heating systems with low thermal masses are installed. © 2018, The Author(s).","Applied ICT solutions; Energy hungry behaviors; Energy saving scenarios; HVAC control; Opening windows","Carbon dioxide; Energy conservation; Energy management; Thermostats; Ventilation; Bi-directional communication; Energy hungry behaviors; HVAC control; Information and Communication Technologies; Intelligent solutions; Mechanical ventilation; Residential building; Set-point temperatures; Air conditioning; climate conditions; energy efficiency; heating; information and communication technology; technology adoption; ventilation; Finland; Helsinki; Italy; Lombardy; Milan [Milano]; Milano [Lombardy]; Varsinais-Suomi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057564268

Between temperature and humidity affect each other for the breeding of Aedes aegypti, climate conditions (temperature and humidity) will support the increase in mosquito population density and subsequently have an impact on the transmission and spread of dengue hemorrhagic fever. Temperature between 20° C - 30° C with a humidity range of 60% - 90% is the optimum moisture for growth and development of the Aedes aegypti mosquito4. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of climate conditions on the transmission and spread of dengue hemorrhagic fever in South Sulawesi Province. This type of research is cross-sectional by measuring all variables at the same time. The research sites were Makassar City, Barru Regency and Tana Toraja Regency.

The research assesses the supply chain, from agricultural (from nursery to dismantling) to the processing phase in firms located in the Apulia region. Results show a global warming potential over a fixed period corresponding to 100 years equal to 0.584 kg CO2eq, primarily deriving from agricultural management (0.442 kg CO2eq) and secondly from fruit processing (0.068 kg CO2eq). In the orchard phase, the main impacts derived from electricity consumed to pump groundwater used for irrigation and fertigation activities (15.84% of the total), transportation of manure (6.42% of the total), ploughing activity (4.83% of the total) and production of nitrogen fertilisers (4.28% of the total). Cherries processing in the collecting centre showed impacts from electricity consumption (5.57% of the total) and from waste deriving from damaged or non-conforming cherries (4.74% of the total). The PET clamshell production phase had an impact deriving principally from the use of PET granulate (0.0743 kg CO2eq). The study highlighted that manure administration and pruning activities contribute to decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis showed that substitution of electricity-mix deriving from the Italian national grid with a photovoltaic plant lowered GHG emissions by 19%.

The Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2), which is used for subseasonal-to-seasonal forecast of weather and climate, also suffers from large overestimation of surface albedo, particularly over the snow region. In order to improve the snow albedo biases, performances of three snow albedo schemes: the existing ‘maximum snow albedo’ (MSA) scheme of land surface model Noah, temperature dependent scheme of Roeckner et al. (The atmospheric general circulation model ECHAM5—part 1. Technical Report 349, Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, 2003) (RK03) and prognostic albedo scheme of Dutra et al. (J Hydrometeor 11:899–916, 2010) (DU10) are evaluated in offline mode. While offline Noah performs better with MSA scheme as compared to RK03 and DU10 in simulating climatological mean albedo, DU10 scheme shows a better skill in simulating monthly albedo and also captures the interannual variability with high fidelity. Therefore, MSA and DU10 schemes are also evaluated in coupled model along with the existing albedo scheme of Briegleb (J Geophys Res 97:7603–7612, 1992) (BR92) in CFSv2. The performance of MSA scheme is found to be better in simulating surface albedo, snow water equivalent and 2 m air temperature as compared to those using DU10 and BR92 schemes. Furthermore, the improved albedo have positive impact in the simulation of Indian summer monsoon rainfall, that reduces the dry bias over the Indian subcontinent, and cold bias in sea surface temperature and improves rainfall teleconnection. Thus, among four schemes (MSA, RK03, DU10 and BR92) evaluated here, MSA appears to be the most suitable snow albedo scheme for CFSv2. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"albedo; atmospheric general circulation model; climate modeling; climate prediction; complexity; land surface; rainfall; sea surface temperature; snow; snow water equivalent; teleconnection; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061097575

Studying the factors and mechanisms responsible for this storing capacity is essential to understand seagrass carbon sink function. Therefore, in this study, we identified the sources of organic carbon (Corg) in seagrass sediments and the implication to Corg stocks from four islands in the Spermonde Islands that located at different zones. We used the Bayesian stable isotope mixing model to estimate the proportional contribution of different sources to sediment carbon. Seagrass meadows that located in adjacent to high anthropogenic activities (deforestation and aquacultures) with direct exposure to wave actions, such as on the Bauluang Island, accumulated organic carbon that derived from multiple sources, where phytoplankton contributed the highest, while on the other three islands that are relatively protected from wave actions, the highest contribution (~ 75%) was from autochthonous production (seagrass-derived). Sediment Corg stocks vary spatially, ranging from 11.9 to 32.1 Mg C ha−1 (based on the obtained depth of 20–55 cm), or 40.5 to 83.5 Mg C ha−1 if extrapolated to 1 m depth. The variability of sediment properties and Corg stocks in this study is not solely determined by the geographical differences (inshore, nearshore and offshore islands), but also influenced by other local factors such as hydrodynamics that control the distribution of carbon sources, anthropogenic pressures and species composition. These factors should be taken into account when developing coastal management strategies, as efforts are being undertaken to include coastal ecosystems (including seagrass ecosystems) on the National Green House Gasses Reduction Strategy. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Corg stocks; Carbon sources; Seagrass; Spermonde Islands; Stable isotope","carbon sink; organic carbon; seagrass; sediment chemistry; stable isotope; Greater Sunda Islands; South Sulawesi; Spermonde Archipelago; Sulawesi; Sunda Isles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073691894

While at berth, the use of shore-side electricity as an alternative technique to generate electricity to ships can greatly reduce emissions and improve air quality. The container terminals of Djibouti accommodate a significant number of ship calls, but there is a lack of emissions mitigation measures. The purpose of this study is to identify the most critical barriers that hinder the deployment of shore power supply in the container terminals of Djibouti. To achieve this aim, this study consults professional experts and experienced managers working in the maritime industry. The data collection is based on a survey questionnaire collected in the form of linguistic preferences to handle fuzziness of human perceptions. The collected linguistic preferences are later converted into quantitative data and analyzed using fuzzy cognitive map approach. The results reveal that power requirement, investment cost and electricity cost are the key barriers that currently influence the implementation of the shore power technology in Djibouti. The findings of the study have great implications and are hoped to assist decision makers and port authority in prioritizing the different barriers according to their importance, in an effort to accelerate the introduction and the development of green port strategies.

The aim of the article is to analyze the forecasts of carbon dioxide (EUA) prices for the years 2019-2030 and to apply the results of this forecast in regional power system planning. The data employed in this paper come from many sources, including empirical data of the selected analytical companies, such as Thomson Reuters among others. The current low prices for carbon dioxide emission rights do not encourage the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, in particular carbon dioxide, and do not have a significant impact on the penetration of renewables. This paper presents the results of two scenarios (for 2021 and 2030) developed after the analysis of the EUA price impact on penetration of renewable energy sources in West-Pomeranian region assuming different electricity production and the EUA price forecasts. The results of two regional energy development scenarios run for 2021 and 2030 indicate changes in the structure of renewables inWest-Pomeranian region. The results also show that the increase of EUA price has a significant impact on the increase of costs for power production and increase of unit cost of the installed 1GWh. In addition, the forecasted EUA price in 2030 is 3% lower as compared with 2021, which has its impact on the increased share of electricity produced by co-firing biomass with other fossil-from 42% to 68% in the electricity generation structure of West-Pomeranian region. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon dioxide; Emissions Trading System (EU ETS); European Allowance (EUA); Regional power system planning; Renewable energy sources","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Electric power generation; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power system planning; Emission control; Forecasting; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Natural resources; Carbon dioxide emission rights; Electricity generation; Electricity production; Emissions trading system; Energy development; European Allowance (EUA); Regional power systems; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073702071

For control households, it was necessary to develop a compensation strategy that would be comparable across four settings and would address concerns about differential loss to follow-up, fairness and potential effects on household economics. Each site developed slightly different, contextually appropriate compensation packages by combining a set of uniform principles with local community input. In Guatemala, control compensation consists of coupons equivalent to the LPG stove's value that can be redeemed for the participant's choice of household items, which could include an LPG stove. In Peru, control households receive several small items during the trial, plus the intervention stove and 1 month of fuel at the trial's conclusion. Rwandan participants are given small items during the trial and a choice of a solar kit, LPG stove and four fuel refills, or cash equivalent at the end.

In recent years, the scheme has also become a starting point for the development of higher-level products, as the LCZ classes can help provide a generalized understanding of urban structures and land uses. LCZ mapping can therefore theoretically aid in fostering a better understanding of spatio-temporal dynamics of cities on a global scale. However, reliable LCZ maps are not yet available globally. As a first step toward automatic LCZ mapping, this work focuses on LCZ-derived land cover classification, using multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 images. We propose a recurrent residual network (Re-ResNet) architecture that is capable of learning a joint spectral-spatial-temporal feature representation within a unitized framework. To this end, a residual convolutional neural network (ResNet) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) are combined into one end-to-end architecture. The ResNet is able to learn rich spectral-spatial feature representations from single-seasonal imagery, while the RNN can effectively analyze temporal dependencies of multi-seasonal imagery. Cross validations were carried out on a diverse dataset covering seven distinct European cities, and a quantitative analysis of the experimental results revealed that the combined use of the multi-temporal information and Re-ResNet results in an improvement of approximately 7 percent points in overall accuracy. The proposed framework has the potential to produce consistent-quality urban land cover and LCZ maps on a large scale, to support scientific progress in fields such as urban geography and urban climatology. © 2019 The Author(s)","Land cover; Local climate zones (LCZs); Long short-term memory (LSTM); Multi-seasonal; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Residual convolutional neural network (ResNet); Sentinel-2","Climatology; Convolution; Image classification; Land use; Mapping; Network architecture; Convolutional neural network; Land cover; Local climate; Multi-seasonal; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Sentinel-2; Long short-term memory; accuracy assessment; algorithm; artificial neural network; heat island; image classification; land classification; land cover; land use; quantitative analysis; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis; urban climate; urban geography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067229502

The full exploitation of thermal storage performance of PCM envelope depends on the suitability of the outdoor climate conditions. There is one key question should be solved: How to quantitatively describe the effects of local climate characteristics on the thermal storage performance of PCM envelope? Thus, in the present study, the thermal storage performance of PCM wallboard is investigated under different climate conditions in reduced-scale experiments with artificially controlled conditions. The typical meteorological year in 10 cities in Northern and Western China are determined to extract the experimental conditions. Based on the degree hours concept, evaluation indices are developed to quantitatively analyze the climate characteristics, including the accumulative temperature during a whole day and the accumulated temperature difference between the outdoor air temperature and phase change temperature. The combined effect of the range of variation in the temperature and the accumulated temperature are obtained base on the indices. Reductions in the accumulated temperature of over 88% are observed under the climate conditions in Xi'an and Kashi. However, the reduction is only 36.8% under the condition in Xining. Finally, with nonlinear regression analysis. The relationship between the thermal storage effect of PCM wallboard and the accumulated temperature difference is determined by nonlinear regression analysis. The results provide a reference to assess the suitability and appropriate thermal design for PCM envelope in different climate conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Artificially controlled condition; Climate characteristics; Phase change material; Reduced-scale experiments; Thermal performance","Building materials; Heat storage; Phase change materials; Regression analysis; Storage (materials); Walls (structural partitions); Climate characteristics; Controlled conditions; Indoor thermal environments; Non-linear regression analysis; Reduced scale; Thermal Performance; Thermal storage performance; Typical meteorological year; Climate change; climate conditions; experimental study; regression analysis; temperature anomaly; temperature effect; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066973868

Understanding the driving forces of CO2 emissions is necessary for future energy planning and policy formulation. This paper examines the driving factors behind the increase in CO2 emissions in Malaysia with special focus on the manufacturing, electricity and transportation sectors. The paper extends the Kaya identity by incorporating energy mix, investment efficiency, capital-labor substitution, population-to-employment, urbanization rates, and per capita CO2, along with the standard variables including economic activity, economic structure, and energy intensity. The paper also evaluates if any macroeconomic instability (economic crisis) in the country has led to reduction in emission rates. The study utilizes the latest country data, covering the period 2002–2016. The result shows that, while economic activity is always associated with CO2 emissions, more efficient energy use would help restrain the rise in emission rates without hampering economic growth regardless of economic structure. Emission reduction targets in Malaysia should be reinforced with an appropriate economic restructuring that restrains the economic structure effect. Due to the extensive energy use in the transportation and electricity generation, future emission control should focus more on these sectors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Capital-labor substitution; Emission decomposition in Malaysia; Energy efficiency improvement; Investment efficiency; Technological innovation; Urban population effects","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Investments; Social aspects; Energy efficiency improvements; Investment efficiency; Malaysia; Technological innovation; Urban population; Economic and social effects; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic activity; economic conditions; economic development; economic growth; economic structure; efficiency measurement; emission control; energy efficiency; energy planning; environmental economics; innovation; urbanization; Malaysia; Torreya nucifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066444594

WUDAPT method used in this research based on the concept of LCZ framework by utilizing Landsat 8 imagery. LCZ classification of the whole area is determined using random forest classifier algorithm by SAGA GIS. The results of this study indicate that there are 12 LCZs in YUA, consisting of 6 types of LCZ based on building type and 6 LCZs based on land cover type. The highest increase of LST are in LCZ 3 and LCZ 5. Consequently, there's a change in diurnal temperature from low to medium. Therefore, the thermal comfort aspect define by four components of LCZ is important in YUA urban planning strategy. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

However, there are increasing concerns that ongoing selective logging practices have led to decreased forest product supply, increased forest degradation, and contributed to forest based carbon emissions. Taking cases of natural forest harvesting practices from the Tarai region of Nepal and Queensland Australia, this study assesses forest product recovery and associated carbon emissions along the timber production chain. Field measurements and product flow analysis of 127 commercially harvested trees up to the exit gate of sawmills and interaction with sawmill owners and forest managers reveal that: (1) Queensland selective logging has less volume recovery (52.8%) compared to Nepal (94.5%) leaving significant utilizable volume in the forest, (2) Stump volume represents 5.5% of total timber volume in Nepal and 3.9% in Queensland with an average stump height of 43.3 cm and 40.1 cm in Nepal and Queensland respectively, (3) Average sawn timber output from the harvested logs is 36.3% in Queensland against 61% in Nepal, (4) Nepal and Queensland leave 0.186 Mg C m-3 and 0.718 Mg C m-3 on the forest floor respectively, (5) Each harvested tree damages an average of five plant species in Nepal and four in Queensland predominantly seedlings in both sites, and (6) Overall logging related total emissions in Queensland are more than double (1.099 Mg C m-3) those in Nepal (0.488 Mg C m-3). We compared these results with past studies and speculated on possible reasons for and potential implications of these results for sustainable forest management and reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. © 2019 by the authors.","Harvesting damage; Natural forest degradation; REDD+; Selective logging; Sustainable forest management; Timber utilization","Carbon; Deforestation; Harvesting; Plants (botany); Recovery; Sawing; Sawmills; Seed; Timber; Wood products; Field measurement; Forest degradation; Natural forests; REDD; Reducing emissions; Selective harvesting; Selective logging; Sustainable forest management; Logging (forestry); carbon emission; environmental degradation; forest management; forest product; harvesting; selective logging; sustainability; Carbon; Deforestation; Harvesting; Recovery; Sawing; Australia; Nepal; Queensland; Tarai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071141028

While some solutions have been widely studied – e.g., green surface accessibility – some others, such as taxi-out procedures, have received less attention. However, taxi-out procedures, which are part of the Landing and Take-Off (LTO) cycle, generate a remarkable amount of the whole airport environmental impact, especially carbon emissions. The goal of this paper is to propose an element-by-element approach that could help stakeholders to adopt targeted solutions. Particularly, the airport activity contributing to the airport carbon impact is split into elementary segments in order to compute the environmental effects produced by each elementary source of pollution. The advantage of this approach is the identification of targeted actions on specific segments, which generates more positive effects for the several involved stakeholders. While the study focuses on taxi-out procedures, the proposed approach is general and can be applied widely to simulate other airport activities that contribute to the airport carbon impacts. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Airport; Carbon emissions; Elementary segments; Strategies; Taxi-out","airport; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; environmental impact; pollutant source; stakeholder; strategic approach; taxi transport; transportation policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065023753

A constructed database of the ca. 2,100 cited experiments and simulations in the five ARs was analyzed with respect to impacts on yields via crop type, region, and whether adaptation was included. Quantitative data on impacts and adaptation in livestock farming have been extremely scarce in the ARs. The main conclusions from impact and adaptation are that crop yields will decline, but that responses have large statistical variation. Mitigation assessments in the ARs have used both bottom-up and top-down methods but need better to link emissions and their mitigation with food production and security. Relevant policy options have become broader in later ARs and included more of the social and nonproduction aspects of food security. Our overall conclusion is that agriculture and food security, which are two of the most central, critical, and imminent issues in climate change, have been dealt with an unfocussed and inconsistent manner between the IPCC five ARs. This is partly a result of not only agriculture spanning two IPCC working groups but also the very strong focus on projections from computer crop simulation modeling. For the future, we suggest a need to examine interactions between themes such as crop resource use efficiencies and to include all production and nonproduction aspects of food security in future roles for integrated assessment models. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adaptation; climate change; food security; impact; IPCC; mitigation; policy","agricultural production; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; environmental policy; food security; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; mitigation; shifting cultivation; agriculture; animal; case report; catering service; climate change; crop; human; livestock; Agriculture; Animals; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Food Supply; Humans; Livestock",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067701036

Integrating higher shares of renewable heat is indispensable in reaching the climate goal and CO2 emission reduction targets. The study analyses the technical and economic aspects of integrating various technologies such as solar thermal, biomass boilers, waste incineration plant and heat pumps into the existing DH network, with the main focus on large-scale heat pumps. The approach consists of two main steps. First, we forecast future heat demand and the potential to extend the DH system by simulating the evolution and energy consumption of the city's building stock. Second, we use a supply dispatch model with hourly resolution to calculate alternative scenarios and sensitivities for the supply mix with a focus on heat pumps. Our results show that, under the current regulatory and economic framework, large-scale heat pumps are not cost competitive with the existing coal-fired CHP units. However, redesigning the regulatory framework and optimising heat pump design and operation could achieve cost parity.

On Earth, eruptions can impact global and regional climate, and threaten populations living in their shadow, through a combination of ash, gas and lava. Ash emissions are a very typical manifestation of basaltic activity; however, despite their frequency of occurrence, a systematic investigation of basaltic ash sources is currently incomplete. Here, we revise four cases of ash emissions at Mount Etna linked with the most common style of eruptive activity at this volcano: lava fountains (4–5 September 2007), continuous Strombolian activity transitioning to pulsing lava fountaining (24 November 2006), isolated Strombolian explosions (8 April 2010), and continuous to pulsing ash explosions (last phase of 2001 eruption). By combining observations on the eruptive style, deposit features and ash characteristics, we propose three mechanisms of ash generation based on variations in the magma mass flow rate. We then present an analysis of magma residence time within the conduit for both cylindrical and dike geometry, and find that the proportion of tachylite magma residing in the conduit is very small compared to sideromelane, in agreement with observations of ash componentry for lava fountain episodes at Mount Etna. The results of this study are relevant to classify ash emission sources and improve hazard mitigation strategies at basaltic volcanoes where the explosive activity is similar to Mount Etna. © Copyright © 2019 Polacci, Andronico, de’ Michieli Vitturi, Taddeucci and Cristaldi.","ash generation mechanisms; basaltic volcanism; conduit magma residence time; Mount Etna; sideromelane and tachylite","Earth (planet); Fountains; Hydraulic structures; Volcanoes; Basaltic volcanism; Generation mechanism; Mount Etna; Residence time; sideromelane and tachylite; Basalt; basalt; flow velocity; hazard assessment; lava flow; volcanic ash; volcanic eruption; volcanism; Catania [Sicily]; Italy; Sicily",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072725694

For efficient targeting of measures leading to SOC sequestration, it is necessary to know the actual SOC content (%) and a realistic target SOC content (in contrast to the saturation content, which may not be easily achievable) under local biophysical and socioeconomic conditions. We developed a new method for the practical assessment of achievable SOC sequestration concerning soil texture based on a non-linear boundary plane approach, also applicable for mapping of SOC sequestration hotspots. The method was tested at two spatial scales (a 125 km2 catchment and a 4 km2 sub-area of that catchment) in a region in Western Kenya characterized by smallholder farming. Moreover, we assessed the associated benefits of increasing the SOC content from a crop production perspective and found significant correlations between SOC and other soil properties (pH, cation exchange capacity, and various plant-available macro- and micronutrients). This indicates a possible improvement in soil fertility when the SOC content is raised to the modeled target levels, which should be attainable without major changes in land use or agricultural systems. © 2019 by the authors.","Hotspot; SOC sequestration; Soil organic carbon; Soil texture; Western Kenya","carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; climate change; global change; mitigation; soil carbon; soil fertility; soil improvement; soil organic matter; soil texture; spatial analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070445759

This study aims at assessing the development of climate change mitigation and adaptation planning in Italian cities. To this end, we analysed the availability of Local Climate Plans (LCPs) in 76 cities, which are included in the Eurostat Urban Audit (UA-2015) database. In a further step, we analysed the content of the urban climate change mitigation and adaptation plans available in a smaller sample of 32 Italian cities of 2007 Eurostat Urban Audit database (UA-3), looking at the single actions undertaken for addressing mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Results show the almost total absence of comprehensive and stand-alone urban climate change adaptation plans in Italy (except for two cities, Ancona and Bologna), whereas we found that in 61 out of 76 cities municipal civil protection plans are the instruments that deal with local emergencies associated to extreme weather events. On the other hand, 56 out of 76 urban climate change mitigation plans (i.e. Sustainable Energy Action Plans) are being developed in the framework of the Covenant of Mayors, which is a transnational network of local governments created by the European Union (EU) in 2012. The results obtained on the mitigation side point out that, in absence of a national law that imposes Italian cities to develop LCPs, transnational networks are an effective boost to voluntary commitment to reach EU climate and energy objectives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"adaptive management; climate change; environmental planning; European Union; local government; mitigation; urban climate; urban planning; Italy; Leptospira",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056693230

One strand of literature demonstrates that compact cities of sufficient density result in lower GHG emissions in the transport and the buildings sectors compared to sprawled cities. Another strand of literature, however, reveals that compactness hinders climate adaptation by amplifying the urban heat island (UHI) effect. As a result, mitigation and adaptation objectives of cities appear to contradict each other. Here, we develop a geometrical optimization framework and model of a three-dimensional city that minimizes this conflict. It makes use of the observation that low-carbon efficient transport can be realized via linear public transport axes, and that GHG emissions and UHI effects scale differently with varying geometric properties, thus enabling design that reflects both the economics and the climate of cities. We find that star-shaped cities, in contrast to radially symmetric cities, are well suited to alleviate the problematic trade-off. We also demonstrate that urban design considerations depend on transport fuel prices. The results are of particular importance for city planners of rapidly urbanizing cities in Asia and Africa who still have the potential to shape urban layout. © 2019 The Author(s).

METHOD: The authors used repeated-measures data from a longitudinal study of 3,756 students at 49 U.S. medical schools that were collected from 2010 to 2014. They conducted generalized linear mixed models to estimate whether manifestations of racism in school curricula/policies, school culture/climate, or student attitudes/behaviors predicted first- to fourth-year changes in students' intentions to practice in underserved communities or primarily with minority populations. Analyses were stratified by students' practice intentions (no/undecided/yes) at matriculation. RESULTS: Students' more negative explicit racial attitudes were associated with decreased intention to practice with underserved or minority populations at graduation. Service learning experiences and a curriculum focused on improving minority health were associated with increased intention to practice in underserved communities. A curriculum focused on minority health/disparities, students' perceived skill at developing relationships with minority patients, the proportion of minority students at the school, and the perception of a tense interracial environment were all associated with increased intention to care for minority patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that racism manifested at multiple levels in medical schools was associated with graduating students' decisions to provide care in high-need communities.

This publication presents a method to display relevant measures of any three adaptation relevant parameters (or optionally their projected future changes) at once on a map by allocating them to multiple transparency levels of the three primary colors of additive color mixing (red, green, and blue). The overlay of information allows the combined assessment of the regional exposures. The method is demonstrated by two examples based on an ensemble of regional climate projections analyzed for 1.5 °C, 2 °C, and 3 °C global warming periods. The first example shows the increasing number of people at risk for summer climate extremes under 1.5 °C, 2 °C, and 3 °C global warming by combining projected increases in tropical nights and summer intense precipitation days with today’s population density. Under 3 °C global warming, many heavily populated areas across Europe are affected by both heat stress and summer precipitation extremes, whereas under 1.5 °C global warming, heat stress regions are restricted to southern Europe and the large settlements along the Eastern Mediterranean coast. A second example combines daily mean and minimum and maximum summer temperatures and highlights the regional expansion and the increasing robustness of projected mean summer warming with rising global warming levels, as well as the regional day to night differences of the warming signal. © 2019, The Author(s).","Climate adaptation; Combined climate change indices; Combined climate impact assessment; EURO-CORDEX; Europe; Global warming targets; Regional climate change; Visualization method",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066798683

There is increasing interest in the ability to represent mountain glaciers in climate models, to enable either one-way forced or fully-coupled simulations of glacier response to climate change. However, mountain glaciers are generally subgrid features (areas of less than 10 km2) occupying high elevations in complex mountain terrain, and it is important to examine whether RCM-derived meteorological fields in mountain regions are accurate enough to model glacier mass balance. We use downscaled RCM data to force a glacier model at five different sites in western North America, where long-term glacier mass balance observations allow us to evaluate different glacier modelling and climate downscaling strategies. The model runs on a pre-processed, gridded database of 100-m resolution topographic characteristics. Our reference glacier simulations use this high resolution grid to explicitly simulate glacier surface and energy balance, but this is computationally demanding. We test different mosaic approaches for subgrid characterization of the glaciers, where glaciers in an RCM grid cell are distributed over different terrain classes, similar to hydrological response units. The subgrid mosaic approach drastically increases computational efficiency without affecting mass balance simulations for the five glaciers by more than a few percent. Elevation distribution within a grid cell is the most important element of the subgrid terrain characterization; subgrid elevation bands need to be resolved to 200 m or less in order to keep seasonal mass balance biases lower than 2%. Good simulations of glacier mass balance can be achieved with glacier-specific tuning, with correlation coefficients of ~ 0.8 between modelled and measured annual glacier mass balances over the period 1995–2014. However, there are large and regionally-variable biases in the modelled meteorological fields, and we cannot achieve good results without local bias correction. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Glacier mass balance model; Mosaic approach; RCM; Subgrid modelling","climate change; climate modeling; computer simulation; glacier mass balance; glaciology; mountain region; regional climate; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061833297

Shifting passengers from private vehicles to high capacity public transit has been identified as critical to relieve congestion and decarbonize transport, and switching to cleaner bus technologies can provide additional benefits in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions while reducing noise and air pollution. The uptake of clean bus technologies in Latin America and the Caribbean is slower than in China, Europe, and the U.S.A. This paper focuses on deepening understanding of the financial barriers to adopting clean bus technologies by developing a cost-effectiveness analysis that (i) assesses the marginal cost of reducing an additional ton of CO2 when switching from diesel buses to clean bus options and (ii) identifies the main drivers that determine this cost. The methodology has been applied to Santiago, the capital city of Chile, and results show that, given the current context, compressed natural gas is not a cost-efficient option for this city, while both hybrid electric and electric buses are already a cost-efficient option to mitigate climate change. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2019.",,"Air cleaners; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Compressed natural gas; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Traffic congestion; Cost effectiveness analysis; Cost-efficient; Emissions reduction; Latin America and the Caribbean; Marginal costs; Private vehicles; Reducing noise; Transport sectors; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064696490

This region is also a climate change ‘hot spot’ where the ocean is warming rapidly, with the potential to be exacerbated by marine heatwaves and coastal acidification. In this study, the impact of near-future (~2050) elevated temperature and pCO2 on O. angasi was determined and considered in context with concerns for the long-term sustainability of oyster reef restoration efforts. Oysters were exposed to ambient and elevated pCO2 concentrations (mean ± SE: 408 ± 19.8 and 1070 ± 53.4 μatm) and ambient and elevated temperatures (22.78 ± 0.17 and 25.73 ± 0.21°C) for 10 wk in outdoor flow-through mesocosms. Shell growth, condition index, standard metabolic rate (SMR), extracellular pH and survival were measured. Elevated temperature caused high mortality (36%) and decreased the condition of oysters (33%). Elevated pCO2 increased SMR almost 4-fold and lowered the extracellular pH of O. angasi by a mean 0.29 pH units. In combination, elevated pCO2 and temperature ameliorated effects on SMR and survivorship of oysters. O. angasi appears to be living near the limits of its thermal tolerance. Restoration projects will need to account for the temperature sensitivity of this species and its changing habitat to ‘climate proof’ long-term restoration efforts. © Inter-Research 2019 ·","Aquaculture; Climate change; Flat oysters; Ocean acidification; Ocean warming; Ostrea angasi; Physiology; Reef restoration","aquaculture; bivalve; carbon dioxide; climate change; ecosystem service; mortality; ocean acidification; restoration ecology; survivorship; Ostrea angasi; Ostreidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071955924

This is especially so for countries like Nepal, where climate vulnerability and women participation in agriculture is high, accompanied by gender gaps in access to information, technologies, markets, and labor burden. To do this, it becomes necessary to address the inter-related issues of gender, agriculture, and climate change instead of looking at them in isolation. This study, therefore, highlights policy gaps to suggest a set of recommendations for improving gender responsiveness at policy level in Nepal. It presents the gender gaps that women face in agriculture, based on data collected from five districts of the country. Subsequently, using the concept of gender-agriculture-climate change nexus, it analyses 20 government policies and related documents of Nepal based on a set of five indicators. The policy analysis elucidates the level of gender integration in agriculture and climate change policies in the country. Eleven of the 15 agriculture related documents acknowledge the need to focus on women farmers, with nine of them also defining provisions for women-related issues in agriculture. Two of the five climate change policies merely acknowledge gender issues related to climate change. However, only two of the 20 policy documents recognize the need to address gender, climate change, and agricultural issues in coherence. Accordingly, the paper proposes a framework highlighting key points to make policy process and implementation plans in the agriculture sector more gender responsive in Nepal, focusing on the development and promotion of gender responsive Climate-Smart Agriculture technologies and practices. It suggests measures to increase access of assets and services to women farmers, improve their capacity to participate in decision making across levels, and promote transformative changes at both local and policy level. © Copyright © 2019 Paudyal, Chanana, Khatri-Chhetri, Sherpa, Kadariya and Aggarwal.","climate change adaptation; climate-smart agriculture; gender; Nepal; policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077606862

The situation of local and regional governance is crucial in the implementation of community objectives. A multi-year research project was implemented in East Hungary by the University of Debrecen and Eszterházy University. It focuses on the relevance of local communities in the formation of adequate responses to the fore-mentioned challenges. A broad range of primary data collections (questionnaires and interviews) were implemented in two rural counties of the country. The first objective was to elicit existing plans concerning RES and EE at the municipality level and to measure the rate of public participation in the elaboration of them. Secondly, the scopes of the implemented projects were examined in the target area. According to the results, local leaders seem to be committed to environmental issues, but communities rarely possess energy/climate-change plans and projects. The main motivators of project implementation are financial. Because of poor financial conditions, only EU co-financed projects are realized. As subsidies come through the national government, political factors are crucial. From a governance point of view, national and county levels are decisive, and local specialties are not taken into consideration. © 2019 by the author.","Climate governance; Energy poverty; Municipalities; Participatory development; Renewable energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071312844

They play essential roles in transforming nutrients, degrading contaminants and recycling organic matter. Here, we propose a previously unrecognised fundamental microbial process that influences aquifer bioremediation dynamics and that applies to all microbial communities. In contrast to previous models, our proposed Piggyback-the-Persistent (PtP) mechanism occurs when viruses become more dominated by those exhibiting temperate rather than lytic lifestyles driven by persistent chemicals (in our case chlorinated-hydrocarbon pollutants) that provide long-term carbon sources and that refocus the aquifer carbon cycle, thus altering the microbial community. In this ultra-oligotrophic system, the virus:microbial ratio (VMR) ranges from below the detection limit of 0.0001 to 0.6, well below the common aquatic range of 3-10. Shortest-average-path network analysis revealed VMR and trichlorethene (TCE) as nodes through which ecosystem information and biomass most efficiently pass. Novel network rearrangement revealed a hierarchy of Kill-the-Winner (KtW), Piggyback-the-Winner (PtW) and PtP nodes. We propose that KtW, PtW and PtP occur simultaneously as competing strategies, with their relative importance depending on conditions at a particular time and location with unusual nutrient sources, such as TCE, appearing to contribute to a shift in this balance between viral mechanisms. © 2019 FEMS.","bacteria; microbial ecology; pollution microbiology; viruses","aquifer; bacterium; biomass; bioremediation; detection method; microbial community; microbial ecology; microbiology; recycling; virus; ground water; hydrocarbon; trichloroethylene; bacterium; biomass; bioremediation; drug effect; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; metabolism; microbiology; viral phenomena and functions; virology; virus; virus load; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biomass; Ecosystem; Groundwater; Hydrocarbons; Trichloroethylene; Viral Load; Virus Physiological Phenomena; Viruses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070787221

To reach a maximum contribution to well-being in cities, the urban regulating ecosystem services (URES) must match with the demands in terms of space and time. If we understand the matches or mismatches between the current urban dwellers’ desired quality conditions (demand) and the supply of URES by urban forests (UF) in the cities, this will facilitate integrating the concepts of ecosystem services in urban planning and management, but such an assessment has suffered from major knowledge limitations. Since it is complex and problematic to identify the direct demands for URES and the spatiotemporal patterns therein, improving the demand indicators can help to determine the actual requirements. In this paper, a methodological approach based on indicators is presented and demonstrated for two important URES: air quality improvement and global climate change mitigation provided by urban trees and shrubs. Four air quality standards and greenhouse gas reduction targets were used and compared to supplies of the URES in Tabriz, Iran. Our results show that the mean contribution of the URES supply to air quality standards and greenhouse gas reduction targets is modest. Hence, in Tabriz, there is a strong mismatch between demand and supply. Mismatches at the city scale will have to be reduced by both a reduction in pollutant emissions and an increased provisioning of URES supply through urban greenery. The presented assessment approach and the results for Tabriz make it explicit how different the demands and supplies of the two studied URES are, and we expect similar mismatches in many other cities. Therefore, our approach, relatively simple but still realistic and easy-to-apply, can raise awareness about, and the utility of, the ecosystem services concepts for urban planning and policymaking. © 2019 Amini Parsa et al.

Anthropogenic climate change has reduced winter chill accumulation, increased the probability of winters with low chill accumulation, and increased the likelihood of winters with insufficient chill for commonly grown peach cultivars in the southeastern United States. Climate projections show a continuation of reduced chill accumulation and increased probability of winters with insufficient chill accumulation for cultivars with high chill requirements, with approximately 40% of years by mid-century having insufficient chill in Georgia. The results highlight the importance of inter-annual variability in agro-climate risk assessments and suggest that adaptive measures may be necessary in order to maintain current peach production practices in the region in the coming decades. © 2019 by the author.","Chill accumulation; Climate change; Georgia; Peaches; Perennial crops; South Carolina",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071330779

This study increased CO2 concentration in a closed glass greenhouse, with the daily mean temperature and CO2 concentration respectively being 4.61 °C and 93.63 ppm higher than the outside temperature (ambient conditions, control). The seeds of S. capitata were sown in control and treatment environments in March 2013 while seedlings were transplanted into individual pots in May 2013. To research phenological changes, the first day of the flowering and ripening of the plants transplanted in 2013 and first day of leafing in 2014 were observed. The growth and physiological responses of mature leaves were also studied in 2013. Results: There was no difference in the first day of flowering, but the first day of ripening was earlier in the treatment group than the control group. There was no difference in the number of rosette leaves between the two groups, but leaf area was wider in the treatment group than the control group. Transpiration rate and stomatal conductance were higher in the treatment group than the control group, chlorophyll content decreased, and photosynthetic rate and water use efficiency were the same for both groups. As a result of simple regression analysis among the transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, photosynthetic rate, and water use efficiency, stomatal conductance increased when transpiration rate increased. Stomatal conductance increased with photosynthetic rate in the control unlike in the treatment group. The photosynthetic rate and water use efficiency increased with transpiration rate in the control group unlike in the treatment group. Furthermore, water use efficiency increased as photosynthetic rate increased in both groups. Conclusion: Due to high CO2 concentration, the photosynthetic rate was no longer controlled by the stomata, which appeared to suppress the excessive production of photosynthetic products by reducing chlorophyll content. It is believed that the phenological responses of S. capitata under climate change conditions will advance and that stable growth will be difficult in regions lacking moisture due to the high transpiration rate. © 2019 The Author(s).","Caryophyllaceae; CO2 concentration; Ecophysiology; Global warming; Perennial herb",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070483096

This dust poses concerns, especially for nearby communities, because of its detrimental impact on respiratory health. To address these concerns, this study examined the effectiveness of commercially available polymers, known for their biocompatible and environmentally friendly features, to prevent dust generation from upstream-type TSFs in active mining operations. It focused on two areas in TSFs: the tailings beach and slope/dike surfaces. Two types of polymers—polyethylene glycol and poloxamer—were selected, and their effectiveness was evaluated in a series of phased laboratory and field tests. The lab tests investigated the moisture-retention capacity of the tailings after treatment with the polymer solutions as well as the ability of these solutions to reduce dust emissions. Polymers were applied to a tailings bed surface in the lab and dust was generated from this surface using a wind tunnel. PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were measured using laser-diffraction dust sensors, and the polymers were found to have reduced dust emissions up to 95%. Small-scale wind-blowing tests were conducted in the field (specifically, in a controlled environment at a TSF) to evaluate polymer effectiveness on the tailings beach and slope/dike areas. The tests revealed that the AP could efficiently suppress approximately 80% of PM10 and PM2.5 dust emissions at both types of areas.

Multiple official and research-grade retrievals provide a means for cross validation across sensors and algorithms, but produces substantial variation across products due to differences in instrument characteristics and retrieval algorithm. The lack of a consistent, calibrated SIF data set hampers scientific interpretation of planetary photosynthesis. NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) offers small sampling footprints, high data acquisition, and repeating spatially resolved targets at bioclimatically diverse locations, providing a unique benchmark for spaceborne sensors traceable to ground data. We leverage overlap between the longer running Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument version 2 (GOME-2) SIF time series, and more recent state-of-the-art OCO-2 and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) data, in a first attempt to reconcile inconsistencies in the long-term record. After screening and correcting for key instrument differences (time of day, wavelength, Sun-sensor geometry, cloud effects, footprint area), we find that Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument version 2 and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument perform exceedingly well in capturing spatial, seasonal, and interannual variability across OCO-2 targets. However, Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument version 2 retrieval methods differ by up to a factor of 2 in signal-to-noise and magnitude. Magnitude differences are largely attributed to retrieval window choice, with wider windows producing higher magnitudes. The assumed SIF spectral shape has negligible effect. Substantial research is needed to understand remaining sensitivities to atmospheric absorption and reflectance. We conclude that OCO-2 and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument have opened up the possibility to produce a multidecadal SIF record with well-characterized uncertainty and error quantification for overlapping instruments, enabling back-calibration of previous instruments and production of a consistent, research-grade, harmonized time series. ©2019.

Methods: Retrospective analysis was used to compare the patient travel expenditure and environmental impact associated with telemedicine encounters versus hypothetical in-person traditional consultations for all outpatient virtual care encounters with vascular surgery patients from October 2015 to October 2017. The primary outcomes measured were travel distance saved, travel time saved, travel costs saved, reduction in fuel consumption, and reduction in environmental pollutant emission. Results: Over a two-year period, 146 outpatient telemedicine encounters were conducted among 87 unique patients (61 females, 26 males; mean age, 60 ± 13 years). The average one-way distance saved by the utilization of telemedicine services was 15.6 ± 6.3 miles, with an average roundtrip savings of 31.2 miles. The average one-way travel time saved was 19.5 ± 9.2 minutes, with an average roundtrip savings of 39 minutes. By using telemedicine services, these vascular surgery patients saved an average of $4.26 in gas and parking costs at each telemedicine encounter. The total reduction in passenger vehicle emission of environmental pollutants, including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitric oxides, and volatile organic compounds was 1632 kg, 42,867 g, 3160 g, and 4715 g, respectively, with a total of 194 gallons of gas saved from driving. Conclusions: Utilization of telemedicine services reduces the travel distance, time, and costs for vascular surgery patients.

The purpose of this work is to address the sensitivity and surface coating ability of carbon dots with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer. The photoluminescence study shows the shift in emission wavelength of carbon dots in water and polymer individually for different excitation wavelengths (320-480 nm). The shifted peaks have higher intensities for higher excitation wavelengths, which are desirable for real world optical applications. This study gives a simple and novel approach to tune the fluorescence spectrum over the entire UV region just by varying the concentration of carbon dots in the polymer base. Detailed characterization revealed that the increase in the intensity of emission peaks can be obtained by using a polymer base system and changing the concentration of carbon dots. This new approach significantly opens a new window for multiapproach sensing methods. The irradiance studies of carbon dots with PDMS resulted in a decrease in absorption. This explains the photodegradation and photophysical properties of the material. The wettability property of the sample by using contact angle studies reveals its significance in coating industries such as nanoengineering, adhesives, casting, and injection molding.

Their relative role in regulating the diurnal variations of summer rainfall over North China and their change under different monsoon conditions are studied using a 19-yr archive of satellite rainfall and reanalysis data. It is shown that both a strong MPS and BLO can increase nocturnal rainfall in the North China plains but exhibit evident regional differences. The MPS-induced nocturnal rainfall is relatively confined to the plains adjacent to mountains from late night to morning, due to the upward branch of the nighttime MPS. In contrast, the BLO-induced nocturnal rainfall strengthens from early evening and is more extensive in early morning over the open plains further east. The contrasting effect in the evening is related to the convergent (divergent) easterly anomaly in the plains under the BLO (MPS). The BLO also induces the relatively strong enhancement of moisture convergence and high humidity by the southerly anomaly at late night. On strong monsoon days, the nocturnal rainfall amount associated with the MPS and BLO increases considerably in the plains. Both regional forcings become effective in regulating the rainfall diurnal cycle with enhanced moisture convergence under monsoon conditions. Their induced diurnal amplitudes of moisture convergence can be comparable to the daily mean by monsoon flow. The regional forcings thus couple with monsoon flow to strengthen rainfall in the plains, particularly from late night to morning. The results highlight that a combination of regional and large-scale forcings can strongly regulate the warm-season climate. © 2019, Institute of Atmospheric Physics/Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","diurnal cycle; nocturnal rainfall; regional climate; regional forcings; summer monsoon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068768673

Therefore, we should be able to discover the thermality of the Rindler horizon just by probing the structure of the propagator, expressed in the Rindler coordinates. We show that the thermal nature of the Rindler horizon is indeed contained - though hidden - in the standard, inertial, Feynman propagator. The probability P(E) for a particle to propagate between two events with energy E can be related to the temporal Fourier transform of the propagator. A strikingly simple computation reveals that (i) P(E) is equal to P(-E) if the propagation is between two events in the same Rindler wedge, while (ii) they are related by a Boltzmann factor with temperature T=g/2π if the two events are separated by a horizon. A more detailed computation reveals that the propagator itself can be expressed as a sum of two terms, governing absorption and emission, weighted correctly by the factors (1+nν) and nν, where nν is a Planck distribution at the temperature T=g/2π. In fact, one can discover the Rindler vacuum and the alternative (Rindler) quantization just by probing the structure of the inertial propagator. These results can be extended to local Rindler horizons around any event in a curved spacetime.

In recent decades, this resource has experienced a qualitative and quantitative degradation under the effect of global warming, especially in zones under arid and semi-arid climate as the case of Morocco. A better understanding of the relationship between climate change and its impacts on the availability of water resources involves a climatological analysis (rainfall and temperature), a piezometric, hydrogeochemical, and isotopic approach. In this investigation, the area taken as an example is the Essaouira Basin. Trend analysis of rainfall and temperature series shows that rainfall and temperature show a downward trend of 12% and an upward trend of 0.9 (for the period 1950–2015) to 1.5 °C (for the period 1988–2004), respectively. The piezometric study shows a downward trend following the shortening of recharge periods and recurrent drought. The hydrogeochemical approach indicates a deterioration of groundwater quality with an increase in salinity. This degradation is due to the marine intrusion and to the decrease of the recharge rate of aquifers caused by the decrease of precipitations under the climate change effect.

This neglects the understanding of GHG emissions embodied in trade. As a solution, consumption-based accounting (CBA) that reveals the lifecycle emissions, including transboundary flows, is gaining support as a complementary information tool. CBA is particularly relevant in cities that tend to outsource a large part of their production-based emissions to their hinterlands. While CBA has so far been used relatively little in practical policymaking, it has been used widely by scientists. Methods and design: The purpose of this systematic review, which covers more than 100 studies, is to reflect the policy implications of consumption-based carbon footprint (CBCF) studies at different spatial scales. The review was conducted by reading through the discussion sections of the reviewed studies and systematically collecting the given policy suggestions for different spatial scales. We used both numerical and qualitative methods to organize and interpret the findings of the review. Review results and discussion: The motivation for the review was to investigate whether the unique consumption perspective of CBA leads to similarly unique policy features. We found that various carbon pricing policies are the most widely supported policy instrument in the relevant literature. However, overall, there is a shortage of discussion on policy instruments, since the policy discussions focus on policy outcomes, such as behavioral change or technological solutions. In addition, some policy recommendations are conflicting. Particularly, urban density and compact city policies are supported by some studies and questioned by others. To clarify the issue, we examined how the results regarding the relationship between urban development and the CBCF vary. The review provides a concise starting point for policymakers and future research by summarizing the timely policy implications. © 2019 The Author(s).

The results indicate few cases worldwide and suggest cotton as the main experimented specie, generally cultivated with two other ones. They were identify three methods applied in cotton crops: (1) crop rotation, (2) agroecological intercropping and (3) agroforestry. Results also demonstrates different production challenges, concerning machinery development to mixture crops, ideal species groups, economic viability and process scalability. Forest management methods that can sustain good mixes of tree species need to be designed, promoting rich agrobiodiversity landscapes. Thus, defining, measuring and rewarding good farming practices are the main possible drivers to motivate farmers to change to new approaches towards sustainability in textile fiber production. Further investigation is demanded to evaluate different species possibilities and cropping maintenance, as well as addressing public policies and coordinating stakeholders interests. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Agrobiodiversity; Agroforestry; Natural fibers; Sustainability; Textiles","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Cotton; Crops; Economics; Food supply; Forestry; Machinery; Plants (botany); Public policy; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Textile fibers; Textiles; Climate change adaptation; Economic viability; Machinery development; Management method; Production challenges; Research methodologies; Sustainable textiles; Systematic literature review; Natural fibers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095846181

The study therefore examined the effects of climate change and adaptation strategies among crop farmers in South West, Nigeria. Random sampling technique was used to select 60 respondents in the study area. Data were collected through well-structured interview schedules, key informant interview and focus group discussion. The results of the study indicated that 63.3% of the respondents were males and 36.7% of them were females. About 46.7% were between the age brackets of 31–40 years with a mean age of 36 years, 70% of the respondents were literate having more than 6 years of formal education. The majority (90%) of the respondents were married with a mean household size of seven persons. It was revealed that farming constituted the major primary livelihood activity among respondents with about 70% practicing it as their primary occupation. The majority (93%) of the respondents attested that they were aware of climate change while only 7% were not aware. Findings showed that respondents were very much affected by drought and longer period of dry season, humidity and excessive dryness, high wind intensity. The study showed that the respondents were aware that land/bush clearing, improper application of agrochemicals, fuelwood usage, overgrazing and rivers drying up can contribute to climate change. Furthermore, findings showed that respondents have adopted several mitigating and adaptation measures against climate change ranging from planting of shades and shelters, increased water conservation methods, planting of different crops on the same farmland, increasing their farm size observing certain agroforestry practices and choosing different planting dates. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate; Coping; Crop","agrochemical; agroforestry; alternative agriculture; climate effect; drought; dry season; farm size; food security; fuelwood; livelihood; overgrazing; water planning; Nigeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049060670

Species are adapted to their environments and interact with their environments by having pertinent functional traits. We aim to improve global ecometric models using functional traits for estimating palaeoclimate and apply models to Pleistocene fauna for palaeoclimate interpretation. Location: Global at present day, Pleistocene of Europe for fossil data analysis. Taxa: Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Proboscidea and Primates. Methods: We quantify functional traits of large mammal communities and develop statistical models linking trait distributions to local climate at present day. We apply these models to the fossil record, survey functional traits, and quantitatively estimate climates of the past. This approach to analysing functional relationships between faunal communities and their environments is called ecometrics. Results and main conclusions: Here, we present new global ecometric models for estimating mean annual and minimum temperature from dental traits of present day mammalian communities. We also present refined models for predicting net primary productivity. Using dental ecometric models, we produce palaeoclimate estimates for 50 Pleistocene fossil localities in Europe and show that the estimates are consistent with trends derived from other proxies, especially for minimum temperatures, which we hypothesize to be ecologically limiting. Our new temperature models allow us to trace the distribution of freezing and non-freezing ecosystems in the recent past, opening new perspectives on the evolution of cold-adaptive biota as the Pleistocene cooling progressed. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Alexander von Humboldt; dental traits; ecometrics; palaeoclimate; palaeotemperature; plant-eating mammals; predictive modelling","biodiversity; community composition; estimation method; fossil record; mammal; net primary production; paleoclimate; paleotemperature; Pleistocene; Europe; Artiodactyla; Humboldtia; Mammalia; Perissodactyla; Primates; Proboscidea (mammal); Proboscidea (plant)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066028806

Africa has a good potential for micro hydroelectric power generation. However, only a small proportion of this potential has been harnessed. As a result, most rural areas in Africa have limited access to electric power. Unfortunately, those rural communities privileged to be connected to the grid also have unreliable and expensive grid power. To meet their energy needs, some of the communities have installed and operate Pico or Micro Hydro Power Plants (MHPPs) based on the Build-Own-Operate (BOO) model. In any power generation plant, a speed governor is required for regulating the frequency of supply under varying load conditions. However, this is the single most expensive component in a MHPP and most of the community owned plants can hardly afford it and thus, have no means of continuously regulating frequency. An Electronic Load Controller (ELC) is a device used to control the sharing of constant generator output power between the consumer and dummy loads and hence, maintain the frequency of a MHPP constant. This replaces the expensive and complex speed governor. In this paper, the design and implementation of an ELC is presented. Magnetostrictive Amorphous Wire (MAW) is used as a frequency sensor. An amplifier and a signal conditioning circuit were designed to convert the analog signal from the MAW to a digital signal that is fed to microcontroller. In addition, optimal Proportional-Integral (PI) gains are determined to serve as reference gains to the microcontroller so as to generate a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal to control the firing angle of the switching circuit of the ELC. The laboratory experimental test results obtained clearly show the effectiveness of the ELC to dump excess power to the damper load when the consumer load changes, and maintain the supply frequency between 49.5 and 50.5 Hz. Also, from the results, it was observed that the MAW sensor was able to measure the frequency effectively with high accuracy when compared to the frequency measurement from the tachometer. This is a key finding of the suitability of MAW sensor application in ELC for MHPPs. The designed controller is cheaper and yet able to control the frequency very effectively when compared to other ELCs and speed governors that are currently on the market. © 2019 The Authors","ELC; MAW; MHPP; Optimized PI gains; Zero crossing detector","Data storage equipment; Electric frequency control; Governors; Greenhouse gases; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Microcontrollers; Pulse width modulation; Signal conditioning circuits; Two term control systems; Voltage control; Design and implementations; Electronic load controller; Electronic load controllers (ELC); MHPP; Microhydro power plants; Optimized PI gains; Power generation plants; Zero-crossing detectors; Controllers; alternative energy; design method; energy market; hydroelectric power plant; optimization; power generation; renewable resource; rural area; Africa",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066128969

Inventory accounting guidelines provide the best practices to help EI compilers across different countries and regions make comparable, national emission estimates regardless of differences in data availability. However, there are a variety of sources of error and uncertainty that originate beyond what the inventory guidelines can define. Spatially explicit EIs, which are a key product for atmospheric modeling applications, are often developed for research purposes and there are no specific guidelines to achieve spatial emission estimates. The errors and uncertainties associated with the spatial estimates are unique to the approaches employed and are often difficult to assess. This study compares the global, high-resolution (1 km), fossil fuel, carbon dioxide (CO2), gridded EI Open-source Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO2 (ODIAC) with the multi-resolution, spatially explicit bottom-up EI geoinformation technologies, spatio-temporal approaches, and full carbon account for improving the accuracy of GHG inventories (GESAPU) over the domain of Poland. By taking full advantage of the data granularity that bottom-up EI offers, this study characterized the potential biases in spatial disaggregation by emission sector (point and non-point emissions) across different scales (national, subnational/regional, and urban policy-relevant scales) and identified the root causes. While two EIs are in agreement in total and sectoral emissions (2.2% for the total emissions), the emission spatial patterns showed large differences (10~100% relative differences at 1 km) especially at the urban-rural transitioning areas (90–100%). We however found that the agreement of emissions over urban areas is surprisingly good compared with the estimates previously reported for US cities. This paper also discusses the use of spatially explicit EIs for climate mitigation applications beyond the common use in atmospheric modeling. We conclude with a discussion of current and future challenges of EIs in support of successful implementation of GHG emission monitoring and mitigation activity under the Paris Climate Agreement from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21). We highlight the importance of capacity building for EI development and coordinated research efforts of EI, atmospheric observations, and modeling to overcome the challenges. © 2019, The Author(s).","Carbon cycle; Carbon dioxide; Climate mitigation; Emission inventory; Greenhouse gas emission; Monitoring; Paris Agreement; Remote sensing; Reporting and verification; Uncertainty analysis","atmospheric modeling; capacity building; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission inventory; error analysis; greenhouse gas; international agreement; pollution control; remote sensing; uncertainty analysis; Poland [Central Europe]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066915383

One reason is that traditional (culturally-grounded) autonomous community coping capacity has been overlooked, many external agencies viewing all such communities as both homogenous and helpless. A community's autonomous coping capacity can be proxied by peripherality, a measure of the degree to which a particular community in archipelagic (island) countries engages with core agendas. In order to gauge the depth, breadth and efficacy of autonomous coping capacity, three indices of community peripherality were developed from research within thirteen communities in (peripheral-biased) Bua Province in Fiji. Index 1 concerns geography (travel time/cost to town), Index 2 concerns population and employment (community size, age distribution, employment), and Index 3 concerns tradition and global awareness (mobile phones per capita, traditional/western healthcare preferences, inherent coping capacity, diet, water and energy security). Mapping of Indices 1-3 allows the nature of community peripherality in Bua to be captured using a readily-reproducible tool for rapid assessment in similar contexts. It is demonstrated that an understanding of peripherality (as a proxy for autonomous community coping capacity) can inform the design of future interventions for climate-change adaptation. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Community; Coping; Coping; Developing countries; Index; Islands; Peripherality; Population; Tradition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071163837

Here, we demonstrate that eliminating differences in model aerosol or radiative forcing fields results in close agreement in simulated globally averaged temperature and precipitation responses in the studied GCMs. However, it does not erase the differences in regional responses. We carry out experiments of equilibrium climate response to modern-day anthropogenic aerosols using an identical representation of anthropogenic aerosol optical properties and the first indirect effect of aerosols, MACv2-SP (a simple plume implementation of the second version of the Max Planck Institute Aerosol CLimatology), in two independent climate models (NorESM, Norwegian Earth System Model, and ECHAM6). We find consistent global average temperature responses of -0.48 (±0.02) and -0.50 (±0.03)K and precipitation responses of -1.69 (±0.04)% and -1.79 (±0.05)% in NorESM1 and ECHAM6, respectively, compared to modern-day equilibrium climate without anthropogenic aerosols. However, significant differences remain between the two GCMs' regional temperature responses around the Arctic circle and the Equator and precipitation responses in the tropics. The scatter in the simulated globally averaged responses is small in magnitude when compared against literature data from modern GCMs using model intrinsic aerosols but same aerosol emissions -(0.5-1.1)K and -(1.5-3.1)% for temperature and precipitation, respectively). The Pearson correlation of regional temperature (precipitation) response in these literature model experiments with intrinsic aerosols is 0.79 (0.34). The corresponding correlation coefficient for NorESM1 and ECHAM6 runs with identical aerosols is 0.78 (0.41). The lack of improvement in correlation coefficients between models with identical aerosols and models with intrinsic aerosols implies that the spatial distribution of regional climate responses is not improved via homogenizing the aerosol descriptions in the models. Rather, differences in the atmospheric dynamic and snow/sea ice cover responses dominate the differences in regional climate responses. Hence, even if we would have perfect aerosol descriptions inside the global climate models, uncertainty arising from the differences in circulation responses between the models would likely still result in a significant uncertainty in regional climate responses. © Author(s) 2019.",,"aerosol property; atmospheric general circulation model; climate effect; climate modeling; optical property; radiative forcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070536403

We structure the empirical analysis along three dimensions: (i) dynamics of knowledge creation; (ii) institutionalization of the science-policy interface; and (iii) pathways of influence of expertise on policy development.

Moreover, the transition is likely to take significant time, with disruptive technologies emerging in the meantime; therefore, a purely technical solution is unlikely to be viable in the long run. Hence, it would be helpful to complement the supportive, albeit high-level artefacts developed by various global organisations with strategic plans satisfying and abiding by principles that maximise the chances of success. Importantly, such strategic planning must follow a method that is transferable between geographical regions and their local maturity levels in respect to energy triangle viewpoints. This paper describes challenges and highlights of planning such a strategy, including guiding principles for the solution architecture and dynamic business models describing the possible structure and relations between an energy transition programme and its projects. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

In this study, we analyzed rumen and fecal samples from five high residual feed intake (RFI) Holstein cows, five low RFI Holstein cows, five high RFI Jersey cows and five low RFI Jersey cows, fed either a high-concentrate diet (expected to reduce methane emission) or a high-forage diet. Bacterial communities from both the rumen and feces were profiled using Illumina sequencing on the 16S rRNA gene. Rumen archaeal communities were profiled using Terminal-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) targeting the mcrA gene. The rumen methanogen community was influenced by breed but not by diet or RFI. The rumen bacterial community was influenced by breed and diet but not by RFI. The fecal bacterial community was influenced by individual animal variation and, to a lesser extent, by breed and diet but not by RFI. Only the bacterial community correlated with methane production. Community differences seen in the rumen were reduced or absent in feces, except in the case of animal-to-animal variation, where differences were more pronounced. The two cattle breeds had different levels of response to the dietary intervention; therefore, it may be appropriate to individually tailor methane reduction strategies to each cattle breed. © 2019 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected using a household survey from 270 pastoralists and focus group discussions. The multivariate probit model was used in the analysis. Findings: The results revealed that pastoralists using of IF only more likely to be non-farm enterprises and livestock sales as adaptation strategies. Pastoralists using both SF and IF were more likely to practise livestock migration. Research limitations/implications: Other factors found to be important included land ownership, land tenure, gender, education level, non-farm and productive assets, climate-related risks and agricultural extension access. Practical implications: Increasing the number of weather stations in pastoral areas would increase the predictive accuracy of scientific climate information, which results in better adaptive capacity of pastoralists. Active participation of pastoral households in national meteorological dissemination processes should be explored. Social implications: A two-prong approach that supports both mobile and sedentary pastoralism should be adopted in rangeland development policies. Originality/value: This study has shown the relevance of IFs in climate change adaptation methods of pastoralists. It has also shown that IFs compliment SFs in climate change adaptation in pastoralism. © 2019, Michael Nkuba, Raban Chanda, Gagoitseope Mmopelwa, Edward Kato and Margaret Najjingo Mangheni, David Lesolle.","Climate change adaptation; Climate information; Indigenous forecasts; Indigenous knowledge; Pastoralists; Scientific forecasts; Uganda","adaptive management; agricultural intensification; climate change; climate effect; forecasting method; household survey; indigenous knowledge; landownership; livestock farming; multivariate analysis; pastoralism; Uganda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070420299

A growing focus on these emission sources has led to the development in the United States of GHG offset protocols that could enable payment to farmers for reducing fertilizer use or implementing other nitrogen management strategies. Despite the development of several protocols, the current regional scope is narrow, adoption by farmers is low, and policy implementation of protocols has a significant time lag. Here we utilize existing research and policy structures to propose an ‘umbrella’ approach for nitrogen management GHG emissions protocols that has the potential to streamline the policy implementation and acceptance of such protocols. We suggest that the umbrella protocol could set forth standard definitions common across multiple protocol options, and then modules could be further developed as scientific evidence advances. Modules could be developed for specific crops, regions, and practices. We identify a policy process that could facilitate this development in concert with emerging scientific research and conclude by acknowledging potential benefits and limitations of the approach. Key policy insights Agricultural greenhouse gas market options are growing, but are still underutilized Streamlining protocol development through an umbrella process could enable quicker development of protocols across new crops, regions, and practices Effective protocol development must not compromise best available science and should follow a rigorous pathway to ensure appropriate implementation. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The results show that this strategy can achieve 5 h with air temperatures over 16.4 °C (from 12:30–17:30) in a comfortable thermal environment without the consumption of fossil energy, while in the evening, the thermal environment indicators in the major living space remain stable with low heat loss, indicating that an appropriate heat source from local bioenergy can achieve indoor thermal comfort.

The use of the alternative fuels represents a viable solution to reduce the pollutant emissions and to replace fossil fuels. Thus, a viable solution is the use of the animal fats in mixture with the diesel fuel at the diesel engines. A D2156 MTN8 diesel engine was firstly fuelled with diesel fuel and then with different blends of diesel fuel-animal fats (5% and 10% animal fats content). In the paper are presented some results of the experimental investigations of engine fuelled with preheated animal fats. The raw animal fats effects on the combustion process and on the pollutant emissions at different engine loads and 1450 rev/min engine speed are showed. The engine cycle variability increases at the animal fats content increase. The cycle variability for maximum pressure, maximum pressure angle and indicated mean effective pressure is analysed. The cycle variability coefficients values don't exceed the recommended values of the standard diesel engine. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.",,"Alternative fuels; Animals; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Pollution; Proven reserves; Regional planning; Combustion pro-cess; Experimental investigations; Indicated mean effective pressure; Maximum pressure; Pollutant emission; Recommended values; Renewable resource; Viable solutions; Fossil fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071950247

In this study we develop a radiocarbon-based (14C) approach for source apportionment of more volatile OC (mvOC) and apply to ambient aerosol samples collected in winter in six Chinese megacities. mvOC is isolated by desorbing organic carbon from the filter samples in helium (He) at 200 °C in a custom-made aerosol combustion system for 14C analysis. Evaluation of this new isolation method shows that the isolated mvOC amount agrees very well with the OC1 fraction (also desorbed at 200 °C in He) measured by a thermal-optical analyzer using the EUSAAR_2 protocol. The mvOC, OC and elemental carbon (EC) of 13 combined PM 2.5 samples in six Chinese cities are analyzed for 14C to investigate their sources and formation mechanisms. The relative contribution of fossil sources to mvOC is 59±11 %, consistently larger than the contribution to OC (48±16 %) and smaller than that to EC (73±9 %), despite large differences in fossil contributions in different cities. The average difference in the fossil fractions between mvOC and OC is 13 % (range of 7 %-25 %), similar to that between mvOC and EC (13 %, with a range 4 %-25 %). Secondary OC (SOC) concentrations and sources are modeled based on the 14C-apportioned OC and EC and compared with concentrations and sources of mvOC. SOC concentrations (15.4±9.0 μg m-3) are consistently higher than those of mvOC (3.3±2.2 μg m-3), indicating that only a fraction of SOC is accounted for by the more volatile carbon fraction desorbed at 200 °C. The fossil fraction in SOC is 43 % (10 %-70 %), lower than that in mvOC (59 %, with a range of 45 %-78 %). Correlation between mvOC and SOC from nonfossil sources (mvOCnf vs. SOCnf) and from fossil sources (mvOCfossil vs. SOCfossil) is examined to further explore sources and formation processes of mvOC and SOC. © 2019 BMJ Publishing Group.

In E63H23, the amount of low clouds, the liquid and ice water path, and cloud radiative effects are more realistic than in previous model versions. E63H23 has a more physically based aerosol activation scheme, improvements in the cloud cover scheme, changes in the detrainment of convective clouds, changes in the sticking efficiency for the accretion of ice crystals by snow, consistent ice crystal shapes throughout the model, and changes in mixed-phase freezing; an inconsistency in ice crystal number concentration (ICNC) in cirrus clouds was also removed. Common biases in ECHAM and in E63H23 (and in previous ECHAM-HAM versions) are a cloud amount in stratocumulus regions that is too low and deep convective clouds over the Atlantic and Pacific oceans that form too close to the continents (while tropical land precipitation is underestimated). There are indications that ICNCs are overestimated in E63H23. Since clouds are important for effective radiative forcing due to aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions (ERFariCaci) and equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), differences in ERFariCaci and ECS between the model versions were also analyzed. ERFariCaci is weaker in E63H23 (-1:0 W m-2) than in E61H22 (-1:2 W m-2) (or E55H20;-1:1 W m-2). This is caused by the weaker shortwave ERFariCaci (a new aerosol activation scheme and sea salt emission parameterization in E63H23, more realistic simulation of cloud water) overcompensating for the weaker longwave ERFariCaci (removal of an inconsistency in ICNC in cirrus clouds in E61H22). The decrease in ECS in E63H23 (2.5 K) compared to E61H22 (2.8 K) is due to changes in the entrainment rate for shallow convection (affecting the cloud amount feedback) and a stronger cloud phase feedback. Experiments with minimum cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNCmin) of 40 cm-3 or 10 cm-3 show that a higher value of CDNCmin reduces ERFariCaci as well as ECS in E63H23. © 2019 The Author(s).",,"aerosol; atmospheric modeling; cirrus; climate modeling; cloud; cloud cover; cloud droplet; convective cloud; global change; global climate; ice crystal; longwave radiation; radiative forcing; sensitivity analysis; stratocumulus; Atlantic Ocean; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071235195

From 2013 to 2017, a total number of 282 stripe rust progress curves were characterized at the plot scale in Kermanshah province, Iran, according to a number of agro-ecological traits. Disease incidence and severity varied by cultivar, planting date, sampling time and year. Area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) on a severity rating basis was ranked according to the Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA. H-test comparisons among cultivars showed greater mean AUDPC values for cvs. Sivand, Bahar and Chamran II, while cv. Pishgam had a lowest AUDPC value. Mean AUDPC value for early disease onset was greater than that for late disease onset. Greater AUDPC corresponded to smaller resistance index ranging from 0 to 70. Highest and lowest AUDPC occurred in spring 2016 and 2015, respectively. From principal component analysis, three principal factors accounting for 84% of the total variance evidenced dependence of stripe rust development on air temperature and moisture, disease-onset and maturity date, resistance index, and planting date. From regression analysis, the number of days with minimum temperatures within the range of 5–12 °C and RH above 60%, disease-onset and maturity date, resistance index, and planting date accounted for 62% of variations in AUDPC values. The present findings emphasize careful selection of cultivar resistance, maturity and planting dates, along with climatic descriptors, to improve accuracy of disease prediction models, durability of cultivar resistance to stripe rust, and sustainability of disease management programs. © 2019, Koninklijke Nederlandse Planteziektenkundige Vereniging.","Cereals; Multivariate analysis; Weather; Yellow rust","air temperature; cereal; climate conditions; cultivar; disease severity; genome; multivariate analysis; rust disease; sowing date; Iran; Kermanshah; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064848340

Under future warming conditions, we will require adaptions such as changing the timing of flower festivals to account for changes in the flowering phenology. In this study, we evaluated the coincidence between the flowering phenology of cherry blossoms and the associated festival periods in two Japanese cities under past, recent, and future climate conditions. We examined the situation in Shinhidaka, where the flower festival period changes every year, and Takayama, where the festival period is fixed to coincide with a shrine’s annual spring festival. Currently, the average dates of beginning of flowering (more than four or five flowers open in an index tree; ~BBCH60) and full bloom (equal to or more than 80% of flowers open in an index tree; after BBCH65) in Shinhidaka (day of year (DOY) 126 and 130) are later than the long national holiday of Golden Week (DOY 119 to 125). The respective dates in Takayama (DOY 106 and 111, respectively) are later than the local a festival period (DOY 104 and 105). Under a scenario of 1.0 to 2.0 °C warming, the full blooming dates in Shinhidaka will coincide with Golden Week, whereas under 1.0 to 1.5 °C warming, the full blooming dates in Takayama will coincide with the spring festival period. Thus, moderate warming may increase the value of cherry blossoms to the tourism industry. Under more than 3.5 °C warming in Shinhidaka and 2.5 °C warming in Takayama, however, cherry blossoms will have already dropped by Golden Week and the spring festival period, respectively, suggesting that greater warming may decrease the value of this tourism resource. © 2019, ISB.","Cherry; Cultural ecosystem service; Flower festival; Global warming; Japan","climate change; ecosystem; flower; Japan; leisure; season; tree; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Flowers; Holidays; Japan; Seasons; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065034696

The primary aim of the simulation was to determine the minimum methane concentration for self-sustaining operation, both in terms of maintaining the oxidation process at high temperature and to generate sufficient power to operate the plant. For a ventilation air flow rate of 20 m3/s (equivalent to a single abatement module), the minimum methane concentration was found to be 0.46 vol% at a reactor temperature of 650 °C and ambient pressure. The Rankine cycle operated with a steam pressure of 7.0 bar and steam flow rate of 0.4 kg/s. At the minimum methane concentration the process was self-sustained with zero net power being produced. The cooling produced at 0.46 vol% was 680 kWR using an indirect-fired absorption chiller while 780 kWR was produced via a direct-fired absorption chiller. Assuming a total ventilation air flow rate of 300 m3/s, fifteen 20 m3/s modules would be required, producing a total of up to 11,700 kWR of cooling. The net power produced was zero between reactor temperatures of 500 and 700 °C at the investigated steam pressures (2.0–7.0 bar). Excess net power was produced at reactor temperatures greater than 700 °C due to the restriction of the inlet VAM temperature to 600 °C (to prevent auto-ignition of the methane upstream of the reactor). At low reactor temperatures the steam flow rate decreased with both reactor temperature and steam pressure but remained constant at reactor temperatures of 750 and 800 °C. The methane abatement plant would be able to operate without an external power supply through the utilisation of the process heat. The plant would produce adequate cooling for a typical gassy underground coal mine in Australia. Such mines are located in the Bowen Basin of Queensland; a region characterised by high virgin rock temperatures with cooling requirements of up to 7000 kWR. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Absorption refrigeration; Aspen Plus; Heat recovery; Steam turbine; Ventilation air methane","Absorption refrigeration; Air; Coal mines; Computer software; Cooling systems; Flow rate; Fluidized beds; Methanation; Methane; Rankine cycle; Refrigerators; Steam; Steam turbines; Ventilation; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; ASPEN PLUS; Direct-fired absorption chiller; External power supplies; Methane concentrations; Reactor temperatures; Sustaining operations; Underground coal mine; Ventilation air methane; Absorption cooling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063222326

The Oku-Nikko area has a cool climate peculiar to the mountains in the area of Nikko city at an altitude of about 1270m to about 2500m, the average temperature in August is about 19 ° C, about 8 ° C lower than the center of the city, and It has gained a high reputation as a summer resort for a very long time. On the other hand, as the population declines due to young people moving out of the area and natural declines, the depopulation of the area has progressed and the tourism industry is the subject of the local industry, but the aging of facilities and manpower shortage due to depopulation etc. As the tourism industry declined, the number of buildings no longer used increased, the number of empty buildings increased in Oku-Nikko.

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 284 households mainly using a structured questionnaire. The Heckman probit selection model was used to first identify the underlying socio-economic factors that affect households’ recognition of climate change in the past 10 years, and the second model the factors that influence adaptation to the climate change phenomenon. Findings: The majority of farmers (85 percent) perceived that climate change, characterized by rising temperatures and variability in rainfall patterns, has been occurring in the past ten years. As a response, farmers adapted using methods such as manuring and staggering of planting dates. Indigenous knowledge systems and non-governmental organizations increased the likelihood farmers’ recognition of climate change (p<0.05). The probability of adopting multiple adaptation strategies was influenced by household head’s education level, land tenure and access to public extension services. Practical implications: Integrative extension methods that take into account socio-cultural values could be helpful in building resilience as farmers are better able to understand the climate change construct. There is a need to guarantee land tenure rights in resettlement areas to stimulate investment on farms. Originality/value: This study showed that there is a link between farmers’ prior knowledge of climate change and the number of adaptive investments. The analysis proposed an educational and extension approach that is embedded in the socio-cultural and traditional setting of farmers. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptation; Climate change; Perceptions; Resilience; Smallholder farmers; Zimbabwe","adaptive management; climate change; farmers knowledge; land tenure; perception; smallholder; socioeconomic impact; Zimbabwe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063578066

As a result, financing climate change remains a major nightmare for LG actors across diverse nested territorial containers. It certainly requires the embracing of a multifaceted approach – the use of system thinking where local governments’ resource husbandry is optimised to support external aid and central government transfer. A multifaceted approach brings onboard blended resources, diverse stakeholders, diverse resource mobilisation skills and schemes, and accountability measures. Also, given projected increases in future climate-induced public expenditure, albeit with uncertainties, reliance on a single resource mobilisation approach will be a recipe for inefficiency. This article argues that developmental aid and central government’s transfer remains inadequate to meet the increasing demand for adaptation cost at the local level in Ghana. In the face of the unequivocal impact of climate change risk, we contend that local resource husbandry must be optimised through different innovations to complement other major sources of financing. Our contention resonates with the school of thought that argues local level resources are more resilient to politicisation, are stable, and are predictable compared to international aid and central government transfer. Through qualitative in-depth interviews, empirical data has been drawn from local governments in Ghana to justify our claims. © The Author(s) 2018.","adaptation; Climate change; donor; financing; inter-governmental transfer; local government","adaptive management; autonomy; climate change; community resource management; dependency; environmental economics; financial services; international aid; local government; political discourse; stakeholder; state role; Ghana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059321477

Exhaust emissions of two and four wheel vehicles were characterised over three urban routes in Naples. On-board measurement of CO, NOx, CO2 and fuel consumption of the car was made with a Portable Emissions Measurement System (PEMS); exhaust emissions of NOx and fuel consumption of the scooter were measured in the laboratory, reproducing speed profiles acquired on the road on a chassis-dynamometer. In both cases, vehicle spatial position was acquired by Global Positioning System (GPS) at a frequency of 10 Hz. Real vehicle speed and acceleration together with road gradient were used to evaluate the specific power of the vehicle (VSP) and the results were modelled so as to correlate emissions with driving activities. Specific emissions and fuel consumption were also analysed as a function of road gradient. The most critical results for the car concerned NOx emissions which greatly exceeded the type-approval limit, and real driving of the scooter involved a significant increase in fuel consumption.

While AD of FW at psychrophilic temperature has been rarely reported, this may be a more economical procedure for municipal solid waste (MSW) management by reducing the organic fraction content and the corresponding environmental impact from its disposal. Methods: FW and inoculum have been characterized and AD of FW assays have been run for 12 weeks in accordance with VDI 4630. The effect of FW to inoculum ratio (FWIR) has been assessed in batch assays and the organic load rate (OLR) has been tested in semi-continuous operation mode. In addition, soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) evolution has been periodically measured during all tests. Results: Results showed an important reduction of specific methane yield (SMY) (up to 65%) when FWIR is increased (from 0.5 to 1.5) in batch tests while SCOD removal remains quite constant (approx. 90%). On the other hand, during semi-continuous operation SMY and SCOD removal have been highly reduced (up to approx. 70 and 73%) when OLR is increased (from 1 to 3 g_VS L−1 d−1). Conclusions: Despite the low SMY, the AD of FW at psychrophilic temperature is a feasible solution, especially at low organic loads. Therefore, it may be used in decentralized strategies for improving the MSW management. This operation mode reduces installation costs and reactor operation complexity at the same time decreases the SCOD of municipal waste stream. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Biogas; Food waste; Low temperature; Methane; Organic load rate; Substrate to inoculum rate","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Chemical oxygen demand; Methane; Temperature; Waste disposal; Food waste; Installation costs; Low temperatures; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Organic load rates; Organic loading rates; Semicontinuous operation; Soluble chemical oxygen demands; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041550640

However, water availability in some regions has decreased due to climate change trends and variability, necessitating innovative strategies and adaptation in water allocation to avoid conflicts among users in a hydrological system. This paper presents a resilience analysis and a conceptual hydrological modeling approach to evaluate the resilience capacity of a new water allocation rule in the Laja Lake basin in southern Chile. Resilience assessments included absorptive and adaptive capacities with four system states: resilient, susceptible, resistant, and vulnerable. A modeling approach was used considering the climate variability uncertainty and climate change trends of the Laja system. Characterization of adaptive and absorptive capacities showed that the Laja Lake basin moved from resistant to vulnerable. Hydrological modeling analyses showed that after a new water allocation agreement, the Laja Lake system is moving from vulnerable to susceptible, since the new rule has more adaptive alternatives to face climate variability. The new rule diminishes the possibilities of conflicts among users, ensuring the fulfillment of water needs for uses such as farming and ecosystem services such as landscaping, and allows for increased water allocation for energy in wet hydrological years. © 2019 by the authors.","Basin resilience; Hydrological modeling; Water allocation","Ecosystems; Hydrology; Lakes; Population statistics; Uncertainty analysis; Water management; Absorptive capacity; Basin resilience; Climate variability; Climate variability and change; Hydrological modeling; Hydrological system; Innovative strategies; Water allocations; Climate change; adaptive management; basin management; climate variation; hydrological modeling; resource allocation; water management; USE Lago Laja",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071017488

Current models of the CCM postulate that a series of ion transporters bring HCO3 − from outside the cell to the thylakoid lumen, where the carbonic anhydrase 3 (CAH3) dehydrates accumulated HCO3 − to CO2, raising the CO2 concentration for Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). Previously, HCO3 − transporters have been identified at both the plasma membrane and the chloroplast envelope, but the transporter thought to be on the thylakoid membrane has not been identified. Three paralogous genes (BST1, BST2, and BST3) belonging to the bestrophin family have been found to be up-regulated in low CO2 conditions, and their expression is controlled by CIA5, a transcription factor that controls many CCM genes. YFP fusions demonstrate that all 3 proteins are located on the thylakoid membrane, and interactome studies indicate that they might associate with chloroplast CCM components. A single mutant defective in BST3 has near-normal growth on low CO2, indicating that the 3 bestrophin-like proteins may have redundant functions. Therefore, an RNA interference (RNAi) approach was adopted to reduce the expression of all 3 genes at once. RNAi mutants with reduced expression of BST1–3 were unable to grow at low CO2 concentrations, exhibited a reduced affinity to inorganic carbon (Ci) compared with the wild-type cells, and showed reduced Ci uptake. We propose that these bestrophin-like proteins are essential components of the CCM that deliver HCO3 − accumulated in the chloroplast stroma to CAH3 inside the thylakoid lumen. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

In contrast, recent emissions from northwestern Europe and Australia are estimated to be small (span classCombining double low line inline-formula % each). We suggest that emissions from China, India, andspan idCombining double low line page10336 Russia are likely related to production of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Teflon ) and other fluoropolymers and fluorochemicals that are based on the pyrolysis of hydrochlorofluorocarbon HCFC-22 (span classCombining double low line inline-formula) in which span classCombining double low line inline-formula classCombining double low line inline-formula is a known by-product. The semiconductor sector, where span classCombining double low line inline-formula span classCombining double low line inline-formula is used, is estimated to be a small source, at least in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and Europe. Without an obvious correlation with population density, incineration of waste-containing fluoropolymers is probably a minor source, and we find no evidence of emissions from electrolytic production of aluminum in Australia. While many possible emissive uses of span classCombining double low line inline-formula span classCombining double low line inline-formula are known and though we cannot categorically exclude unknown sources, the start of significant emissions may well be related to the advent of commercial PTFE production in 1947. Process controls or abatement to reduce the span classCombining double low line inline-formula span classCombining double low line inline-formula by-product were probably not in place in the early decades, explaining the increase in emissions in the 1960s and 1970s. With the advent of by-product reporting requirements to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in the 1990s, concern about climate change and product stewardship, abatement, and perhaps the collection of span classCombining double low line inline-formula span classCombining double low line inline-formula by-product for use in the semiconductor industry where it can be easily abated, it is conceivable that emissions in developed countries were stabilized and then reduced, explaining the observed emission reduction in the 1980s and 1990s.

Without emission reduction requirements, it is plausible that global emissions today are dominated by China and other developing countries.

To strengthen this representation, we develop a method for modeling the economic competition between different advanced technologies in multi-region multi-sector dynamic energy-economic models based on a markup approach, which represents the measure of the cost of a technology relative to the price received for electricity generation. The markup includes capital costs, fixed and variable operating and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs, fuel costs, and transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) costs. For intermittent technologies, it also includes a backup requirement to make these technologies effectively dispatchable. For carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, it also includes the costs of CO2 capture, transportation and storage. We provide a standardized markup calculation for generation technologies for different regions of the world, including USA, China, India, EU, Japan and others. Then we analyze the sensitivity of the calculation to critical inputs, including capital costs, fuel costs, carbon prices and capacity factors. We provide a detailed calculation of the relative costs of the following technologies: new pulverized coal, new pulverized coal with CCS, natural gas combined cycle, natural gas with CCS, biomass-fueled plant, biomass with CCS, advanced nuclear, wind (for small and medium penetration levels), solar, wind with backup (for large penetration levels), co-firing of coal and biomass combined with CCS, and advanced CCS on natural gas.

The parts feature large, thin-walled hollow spaces and additional functional elements. This is realized by using two consecutive gas injections and a mold with two cavities of different sizes. The first gas injection creates a hollow space within the part. In a second larger cavity the hollow space is inflated further by a second gas injection. The aim of the current research project is to manufacture hybrid structures consisting of GITBlow structures and continuous fiber-reinforced thermoplastic sheets. The new approach is to join the parts with the molten sheet material during the final phase of inflation in order to strengthen the parts locally. The parts produced with this process are characterized by their low weight, large volume and high compressive strength. To achieve the highest possible bond strength between the two components, it is necessary to maximize the temperature of the GITBlow part within the joining area. In a case study with Polycarbonate (Covesto Makolon OD 2015) and Styrene-Butadiene copolymer (Styrolution Styrolux 656C) the influence of the melt temperature and various process times on these factors can be shown. For PC a maximum temperature in the joining area of 165°C can be achieved while still maintaining optimal part quality (SBC: 120°C). Further investigations show that heat transfer within the part is of major importance for the final temperature distribution. With this knowledge an optimization of the process concerning the production of hybrid structures can be achieved. © 2019 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Public measures aiming at decreasing air pollution are often designed without targeting an explicit health benefit. Our objective was to investigate the health and economic benefits and the social inequalities in exposure resulting from several scenarios of reduction of PM2.5 exposure, in order to support decisions about urban policies. Material and methods: In the French conurbations of Grenoble and Lyon (0.4 and 1.4 million inhabitants, respectively), PM2.5 yearly average exposure was estimated on a 10-m grid by coupling a PM2.5 dispersion model to population density. Changes in death cases, life expectancy, lung cancer and term low birth weight incident cases as well as associated health economic costs were estimated for ten PM2.5 reduction scenarios differing in terms of amplitude of reduction and spatial extent. Changes in social differences in PM2.5 exposure were also assessed. Results: During the 2015–2017 period, PM2.5 average exposure was 13.9 μg/m3 in Grenoble and 15.3 μg/m3 in Lyon conurbations. Exposure to PM2.5 led to an estimated 145 (95% Confidence Interval, CI, 90–199)and 531 (95% CI, 330–729)premature deaths, 16 (95% CI, 8–24)and 65 (95% CI, 30–96)incident lung cancers, and 49 (95% CI, 19–76)and 193 (95% CI, 76–295)term low birth weight cases each year in Grenoble and Lyon conurbations, respectively, compared to a situation without PM2.5 anthropogenic sources, i.e. a PM2.5 concentration of 4.9 μg/m3. The associated costs amounted to 495 (Grenoble)and 1767 (Lyon)M€/year for the intangible costs related to all-cause non-accidental mortality and 27 and 105 M€ for the tangible and intangible costs induced by lung cancer. A PM2.5 exposure reduction down to the WHO air quality guideline (10 μg/m3)would reduce anthropogenic PM2.5-attributable mortality by half while decreases by 2.9 μg/m3 (Grenoble)and 3.3 μg/m3 (Lyon)were required to reduce it by a third. Scenarios focusing only on the most exposed areas had little overall impact. Scenarios seeking to reach a homogeneous exposure in the whole study area were the most efficient in alleviating social inequalities in exposure. Conclusions: Reduction scenarios targeting only air pollution hotspots had little expected impact on population health. We provided estimates of the PM2.5 change required to reduce PM2.5-attributable mortality by one third or more. Our approach can help targeting air pollution reduction scenarios expected to entail significant benefits, and it could easily be transposed to other urban areas. © 2019","Dispersion model; Economic costs; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Health impact assessment; Lung cancer; Social deprivation","Air quality; Biological organs; Costs; Diseases; Dispersions; Particles (particulate matter); Population statistics; Dispersion modeling; Economic costs; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Health impact assessment; Lung Cancer; Social deprivation; Economic and social effects; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; cancer; economic impact; environmental justice; health impact; particulate matter; respiratory disease; air pollution; Article; cost; environmental monitoring; forestry; geographic distribution; health economics; health impact assessment; life expectancy; low birth weight; morbidity; particulate matter; population density; priority journal; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; chemistry; economics; human; prevention and control; social justice; toxicity; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Humans; Life Expectancy; Particulate Matter; Population Density; Social Justice",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066247057

The data utilized in the calculations to model the municipal solid waste landfilling scenarios make extensive use of site-specific data from the landfills. The assessment of different scenarios showed that reduction of landfilled organic waste can lead to significant reduction in the potential environmental loads with respect to global warming when compared with the current MSW landfilling. Conventional landfilling with gas collection for electricity generation showed a better performance than the flaring scenario. Landfill gas collection and power generation resulted in a reduction in GHG emissions of up to 78% relative to the methane flaring scenario.

This study analyzes the supply-side drivers of the increasing trend up until 2005 as well as the factors across US states that enabled significant reductions in the following decade. Using index decomposition analysis, we show that the two main factors driving the CO2 decrease were natural gas substituting for coal and petroleum, and large increases in renewable energy generation (primarily wind) - which were responsible for 60% and 30% of the decline respectively since 2005. Both effects were concentrated in states where low natural gas prices or a combination of federal tax credits, state energy policies, decreasing costs of renewables, and advantageous wind conditions drove significant reductions of CO2 emissions - resulting in the overall national emissions decline. © 2019 The Author(s).

Herein, the life-cycle energy production and emissions reduction of sludge treatment from a typical pulp and paper mill were investigated, in which alternative uses of biogas for industrial or household application, in different regions of the world, were assessed. The three scenarios considered for different end-uses of biogas are: (A) biogas for vehicle fuel in the transportation sector in Sweden, (B) biogas for heat and electricity in the power sector in Brazil, and (C) biogas for cooking in households in China. The results of Environmental Life-Cycle Assessment (E-LCA) show that for all these three scenarios, the use of biogas and pyrolysis gas contributes most to emissions mitigation, while the dewatering and drying processes carried out on the sludge, contribute the most to the environmental emissions. Addition of biochar to the soil, contributes significantly to a reduction in global warming by sequestering carbon in the soil. Compared to scenarios B and C, Scenario A, in which biogas substitutes gasoline in transportation, and heat from combusted pyrolysis gases is used for district heating in Sweden, demonstrates the highest environmental performance for all the evaluated impact categories. © Author(s) 2019.",,"anoxic conditions; biochar; biogas; life cycle analysis; mitigation; pyrolysis; sludge; wastewater treatment; Brazil; China; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071642706

The increasing support from government and demands for environmental friendly means of transportation are accelerating the use of battery electric vehicles. However, it is indispensable to have accurate and complete information about their behaviour in different traffic situations and road conditions. For the experimental analysis carried out in this study, three different electric vehicles from the Edinburgh College leasing program were equipped and tracked to obtain over 50 GPS and energy consumption data for short distance journeys in the Edinburgh area and long-range tests between Edinburgh and Bristol (UK). The results showed that the vehicles' energy intensities were significantly affected by the driving cycle pattern, with a noticeable diminution due to low temperatures. It was found that the real available range of the electric vehicle in some situations could be 17% lower than the predicted mileage shown in the dashboard of the vehicle. The difference from the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) values was even higher.

Calcifying organisms that live in the waters off the WAP respond to temporal and spatial variations in ocean temperature and chemistry. These marine calcifiers are potentially threatened by regional climate change with waters already naturally close to carbonate undersaturation. Future projections of carbonate production in the Southern Ocean are challenging due to the lack of historical data collection and complex, decadal climate variability. Here we present a 6-yearlong record of the shell fluxes, morphology and stable isotope variability of the polar planktic foraminifera Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sensu stricto) from near Palmer Station, Antarctica. This species is fundamental to Southern Ocean planktic carbonate production as it is one of the very few planktic foraminifer species adapted to the marine polar environments We use these new data to obtain insights into its ecology and to derive a robust assessment of the response of this polar species to environmental change. Morphology and stable isotope composition reveal the presence of different growth stages within this tightly defined species. Inter- and intra-annual variability of foraminiferal flux and size is evident and driven by a combination of environmental forcing parameters, most importantly food availability, temperature and sea ice duration and extent. Foraminiferal growth occurs throughout the austral year and is influenced by environmental change, a large portion of which is driven by the Southern Annular Mode and El Ni o-Southern Oscillation. A distinct seasonal production is observed, with the highest shell fluxes during the warmest and most productive months of the year. The sensitivity of calcifying foraminifera to environmental variability in this region, from weeks to decades, has implications both for their response to future climatic change and for their use as palaeoclimate indicators. A longer ice-free season could increase carbonate production in this region at least while carbonate saturation is still high enough to allow for thick tests to grow. © 2019 BMJ Publishing Group.

The most promising way is in maximal usage of renewable sources of energy such as geothermal energy, which was in the year 2010 only 1 GWh at the Slovak republic. The paper refers to the detailed analyzation of the opened natural healing water system in the historical spa town Piešťany as one of the most perspective sources of the renewable energy in the Slovak republic primary used for healing procedures. Analysis is based on experimental measurement and numerical simulation of graphite block heat exchanger Korobon which was constructed in the year 1965 and resists highly mineralized water. The main function of this heat exchanger is to cool down the hot natural healing water with average temperature 60 °C to the 37 °C. The biggest impact is in the designing of new heat exchanger with the same quality properties as current one in accordance with the innovation of obsolete energy management at historical spa town.

PtG utilizes surplus renewable electricity to generate hydrogen from Solid-Oxide-Cell, and the hydrogen is then combined with CO2 in the Sabatier process to produce the methane. The transportation of methane is mature and energy-efficient within the existing natural gas pipeline or town gas network. Additionally, it is ideal to make use of the reverse function of SOC, the Solid-Oxide-Fuel-Cell, to generate electricity when the grid is weak in power. This study estimated the cost of building a hypothetical 100-MW PtG power plant with energy storage and power generation capabilities.

For irregular breathing, when an imaging dataset describing the actual motion is not available, a different approach for dose estimation is needed. To this aim, we validate a method for the estimation of physical dose variations in gated carbon ion treatments, providing also a demonstration of the feasibility of physical dose metrics to assess the method performance. Finally, we describe a sample use case, in which this method is used to assess plan robustness with respect to undetected irregular tumor motion. Methods: The method entails the definition of a patient- and beam-specific water equivalent depth (WED) space, the simulation of motion as a translation equal to tumor displacement, and the reconstruction of the altered dose. We validated the approach using four-dimensional computed tomographies (4DCTs) and clinical plans in 12 patients, treated with respiratory gated carbon ion beams at the National Centre for Oncological Hadrontherapy (Pavia, Italy). Using the end-exhale CT and dose distribution as a reference, the physical dose delivered at the end-inhale tumor position was estimated and compared to the ground-truth dose recalculation on the end-inhale CT. Biologically effective and physical dose variations between the plan and the recalculation were compared as well. As a use case, we evaluated dose changes caused by simulated irregular tumor motion, that is, linear and nonlinear baseline shifts and/or amplitude variations with hysteresis. Results: The ratio between biologically effective and physical equivalent uniform dose (EUD) variations due to end-exhale to end-inhale motion was less than one for 96% of investigated structures. In the validation study, we found a median error corresponding to a 14% EUD overestimation for the tumor and 4% EUD underestimation for a subgroup of organs at risk, together with a high EUD variation due to motion [median 352% EUD variation between end-exhale and end-inhale doses in the planning tumor volume (PTV)]. Considering relevant dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics, the median difference between estimated and ground truth doses was ≤ 4%. Gamma analysis between estimated and recalculated dose distributions resulted in a pass rate > 80% for 83% of the target volumes. For the two patients selected for the sample use case, a patient-specific assessment of the method performance was performed on the 4DCT and it was possible to relate EUD variations of both tumor and organs at risk to the simulated target motion. Conclusions: The physical dose distribution was found to be more sensitive to motion with respect to the biologically effective one, suggesting the suitability of the physical dose metrics for the WED-space method validation. We showed that the method can compensate for intra-fractional tumor motion with proper accuracy in the selected patient group, although its use is recommended when limited deformations are expected. In conclusion, the WED-space method can provide simulations of dose alteration due to irregular breathing when imaging data are lacking, and, once integrated with relative biological effectiveness (RBE) modeling, it would be useful in evaluating the robustness of carbon ion treatment plans. © 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine","carbon ion; moving targets","Bioinformatics; Carbon; Computerized tomography; Ion beams; Ions; Patient monitoring; Risk assessment; Tumors; Amplitude variations; Conventional treatments; Dose-volume histograms; Equivalent uniform dose; Four-dimensional computed tomography; Moving targets; Planning tumor volume; Relative biological effectiveness; Patient treatment; Article; cancer radiotherapy; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; dose volume histogram; dosimetry; exhalation; four dimensional computed tomography; gamma radiation; gross tumor volume; human; human tissue; inhalation; ion therapy; liver tumor; lung parenchyma; organs at risk; pancreas tumor; paraspinal muscle; planning target volume; radiation dose distribution; radiotherapy dosage; respiratory gated imaging; retroperitoneal tumor; spine tumor; tumor volume; validation study; biological model; movement (physiology); neoplasm; pathophysiology; radiation dose; radiotherapy dosage; relative biologic effectiveness; Heavy Ion Radiotherapy; Models, Biological; Movement; Neoplasms; Radiation Dosage; Radiotherapy Dosage; Relative Biological Effectiveness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068688009

However, these benefits are not always realized. A major hurdle to the beneficial use of biochar is our limited knowledge regarding the mechanisms directing its effects on soil systems. This project aimed to eliminate some of this uncertainty by examining the biological responses (plant productivity, greenhouse gas production, soil microbial community structure) of a suite of soils (10) to the addition of biochars produced by different processes (pyrolysis, gasification, burning) from a range of feedstocks (corn stalks, hardwood, grass). Results indicated that these three responses were not significantly impacted by the addition of pyrolysis biochars from different feedstocks at 1 and 5% (w/w) addition levels. On the other hand, both an open-air burned corn stalk (5%) and raw corn stalks (1 and 5%) additions did alter the measured soil functionality. For example, the 5% burnt corn stalks addition reduced total above ground plant biomass (∼30%), increased observed N2O production by an order of magnitude, and altered soil bacterial community structure. The bacterial groups that increased in relative abundance in the burnt corn stalks-amended soils included families associated with cellulose decomposition (Chitinophagaceae), plant pathogens (Xanthomonadaceae), and biochar/charcoal-amended media (Gemmatimonadetes). In contrast, the abundance of these bacterial groups was not impacted by the pyrolysis biochars. Therefore, this research suggests that pyrolysis biochar represents a stabilized form of carbon that is resistant to microbial mineralization and has negligible effects on soil biological responses. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural soils; Biochar; Corn; Microorganisms; Nitrous oxide","Bacteria; Feedstocks; Greenhouse gases; Hardwoods; Microorganisms; Nitrogen oxides; Productivity; Pyrolysis; Agricultural soils; Bio chars; Corn; Greenhouse gas production; Microbial mineralization; Nitrous oxide; Soil bacterial community; Soil microbial community structure; Soils; nitrogen; RNA 16S; agricultural soil; biochar; cellulose; decomposition; germination; greenhouse gas; maize; microbial community; nitrous oxide; pyrolysis; seedling establishment; Article; biomass; combustion; crop; Gemmatimonadetes (class); germination; greenhouse gas; maize; microbial community; mineralization; nonhuman; plant growth; productivity; pyrolysis; soil microflora; Xanthomonadaceae; Bacteria; Greenhouse Gases; Hardwoods; Microorganisms; Nitrogen Oxides; Productivity; Bacteria (microorganisms); Gemmatimonadetes; Xanthomonadaceae; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064955646

The carbon tax starts at $5 per ton of carbon dioxide in 2018 and rises to $30 per ton in 2030; these rates are translated into taxes on the different energy types covered, depending on their carbon contents. Different scenarios examine the impacts with revenue recycling through a uniform sales tax reduction, reduction of labor income tax, reduction of business income tax, direct transfer back to households, and use by the government to reduce debt. Because petroleum fuels and kerosene are a relatively small part of the Ethiopian economy, the carbon tax has small impacts on overall economic activity and greenhouse gas emissions. In proportional terms, however, the impact on greenhouse gas emissions from these energy sources is notable, depending on the recycling scenario. The assumed carbon tax trajectory also can raise significant revenue-up to $800 million per year by 2030. The impacts on the poor through increased cost of living are not that large, since the share of the poor in total use of the taxed energy types is small. In terms of induced income effects through employment changes, urban households tend to experience more impacts than rural households, but the results also depend on the household skill level and the revenue recycling scenario. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon tax; CGE model; Distributional impacts; Ethiopia","carbon dioxide; computable general equilibrium analysis; developing world; economic activity; economic analysis; emission; greenhouse gas; macroeconomics; policy analysis; pollution tax",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070706007

Quantitative analysis shows that the campaign can accelerate residential energy transition significantly, and if the planned target can be achieved, more than 60% of households are projected to remove solid fuels by 2021, compared with fewer than 20% without the campaign. Emissions of major air pollutants will be reduced substantially. With 60% substitution realized, emission of primary PM2.5 and contribution to ambient PM2.5 concentration in 2021 are projected to be 30% and 41% of those without the campaign. With 60% substitution, average indoor PM2.5 concentrations in living rooms in winter are projected to be reduced from 209 (190 to 230) μg/m3 to 125 (99 to 150) μg/m3. The population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations can be reduced from 140 μg/m3 in 2014 to 78 μg/m3 or 61 μg/m3 in 2021 given that 60% or 100% substitution can be accomplished. Although the original focus of the campaign was to address ambient air quality, exposure reduction comes more from improved indoor air quality because ∼90% of daily exposure of the rural population is attributable to indoor air pollution.

This situation negatively affects the health and well-being of Chileans. This paper uses a non-traditional valuation method, based on life satisfaction perception, to estimate citizens’ willingness to pay (WTP) for the reduction of air pollution in Chilean cities. We consider the annual average of PM10 and PM2.5 for 70 municipalities, including the main urban areas. An objective measure of air pollution is linked to a subjective measure of life satisfaction by using the main survey of households in Chile for cross-sectional socioeconomic data. According to our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind in Latin American and, in the case of PM2.5 reductions, one of the first cases at the world level. We found that our estimation of WTP for reducing PM10 and PM2.5 emissions are significantly lower in Chilean cities than in most of the results found in the literature in other countries. However, when comparing this paper results to the ones from other Chilean studies, perspectives vary, e.g., our estimation of WTP for reducing MP10 is higher than one obtained when using the damage function approach but comparable to another obtained with the hedonic prices approach. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Air pollution; Chile; Life satisfaction; Non-market valuation; Particulate matter","air quality; atmospheric pollution; life satisfaction; particulate matter; perception; pollution control; urban pollution; valuation; willingness to pay; Chile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063213874

Changes in rainfall regimes are multifactorial phenomena difficult to model. Rainfall is the main natural way of restoring the reservoir levels of hydroelectric power plants. The reduction in rainfall levels may increase in the coming years, resulting in a probable change of the energy matrix configuration of the state of Minas Gerais (MG). This could reduce the share of renewable sources increasing dependence on the importance of energy from fossil fuels, which are the immediate primary sources of energy available. Prior examinations have portrayed the depletion of hydroelectricity in Brazil, or its macro-regions, however this work tries to supply a more focused look at the effects on the electricity and social sectors of the state of Minas Gerais. The study developed in this paper aims to investigate the hydrological potential alteration impacts and consequences on the energy matrix of the state, the greenhouse gas emissions and the social reflexes of these changes due to scenarios motivated by climate change. The investigation intends to show the importance of the water-energy-emissions nexus for energy planning and decision-making, in order to evaluate the best options for dealing with adverse and potentially destabilizing conditions.

In this work, new parallel hybrid Genetic Algorithm-Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (P-GA-PSO) is developed to solve both sizing and energy management problems for micro-grids. The studied micro-grid is composed of four different renewable energy technologies and energy storage system. The objectives of both optimization problems are to satisfy typical load demand, to minimize energy production cost, to maximize renewable energy integration, to avoid energy losses and overload. P-GA-PSO performances are evaluated and compared with the ordinary optimization methods based on: 1) a set of benchmark functions, 2) various scenarios used to solve the proposed micro-grid optimization problems. Obtained results demonstrated that P-GA-PSO outperforms ordinary optimization algorithms in terms of convergence time and solution quality. Moreover, the proposed micro-grid is very promising in terms of load demand satisfaction, cost and pollutant emissions reduction.

Debates of uncertainty in climate change have emerged as a ‘super wicked’ problem for scientists and policy makers alike. The article draws on ongoing research in different socio-ecological and cultural settings in India (Kutch, the Sundarbans and Mumbai) and introduces the heuristic of the ‘above’, ‘middle’ and ‘below’ to explore how climate change and uncertainty are understood and experienced by diverse actors. Responses from ‘above’ (especially by planners and policy makers) tend to be directed towards controlling uncertainty through top-down, techno-managerial solutions whereas scientists tend to rely on quantitative assessments and models based on probabilistic scenarios. These may have little to do with the experiences and lived realities of local people, especially in the global South, who are often at the frontline of climate change. Also at the local level, climate-related uncertainties seldom stand alone, rather they closely interact with other socio-economic drivers of change that create new uncertainties and vulnerabilities, especially for poor and powerless people constraining their adaptation choices. This article demonstrates deep differences in ways different actors understand and experience climate change and uncertainty. It argues that diverse knowledge and approaches need to be deployed to understand and embrace climate related uncertainties in order to facilitate socially just adaptation. © 2019, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Climate change from ‘above’ and ‘below’; India; Science policy; Uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067993830

One of the assertions made by the so-called sceptics against the scientific consensus on climate change is that because the science is so uncertain, there is no basis for taking action. The response of the climate change science community has been to develop in-depth analyses of uncertainty of increasing sophistication and complexity. In most areas of policy making, the normal situation is characterised by complexity, ambiguity and uncertainty. Therefore, dealing with uncertainty is not an unusual state of affairs for policy makers. However, the overemphasis given to uncertainty in the climate science discourse by scientists working in the field has been self-defeating as it has led to confusion among the intended recipients of the policy relevant scientific knowledge and allowed room for scepticism to grow. Climate change scientists should instead communicate and engage with policy makers (and the public) on those things that we know with confidence. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Science communication; Science policy; Uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064832248

Higher and fluctuating temperatures and changes in rainfall caused by climate change and extreme weather events have reduced crop production. A better understanding of the local dimensions of vulnerability is therefore essential to develop appropriate adaptation measures that can alleviate these adverse impacts. Purpose and methods: The main purpose of this study was to identify the determinants of Aman rice farmers' choice of adaptation strategies to climate change and weather in Khulna district, Bangladesh. About 100 farm households susceptible to salinity intrusion, extreme temperatures and drought were surveyed, and these data were supplemented by major climate data of the district for 65 years (1948-2013). A binary logistic regression was then utilized to estimate the factors that influence households' choice of adaptation strategies. Results and Conclusions: About 97% of farmers perceived that the climate had changed over the past 30 years while only 3% did not. Further, 97% believed that rainfall had decreased and reduced rice production, yet the data show this not to be the case with a significant increase in rainfall observed in the area in the study period. About 89% of farmers have undertaken some form(s) of adaptation and they were further asked about their main adaptation type. Family size, annual income, farmer-to-farmer extension and access to subsidies have a positive and significant impact on rice farmers' adaptation strategies to climate and weather change effects. Farm size and credit access had a negative and significant impact on adaptation. Four variables: age, education, household assets and occupation were not statistically significant in explaining adaption strategies. The chief adaptation strategies of farmers are cultivation of salinity-tolerant rice, rice variety switching, replanting of rice, changing planting dates, conversion of rice paddy to fish production and use of different crop varieties in alternate years. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","adaptation; Bangladesh; Climate change; extreme weather events; rice farming",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068152467

The American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD) was adopted to predict the atmospheric dispersion of particulate matter (PM) emissions around the source. The PM estimates at two experimental points (M1 and M2) around the source were compared with the observations. The model simulations suggested that the PM was mostly dispersed by the dominant southwesterly wind such that the plume moved towards the northeast with variations in their spatial distributions across the seasons. Under low wind speeds and humid conditions, there was accumulation of the pollutants within the periphery of the point source. The simulated pollutant concentrations compared fairly well with the observations for both fine PM, i.e., PM2.5 (mean error = − 6441 µg m−3, kappa coefficient, κ = 0.31 at M1 and mean error = − 16,608 µg m−3, κ = 0.41 at M2) and the coarse, i.e., PM2.5–10 (mean error = − 5506 µg m−3, κ = 0.27 at M1 and mean error = − 4174 µg m−3, κ = 0.36 at M2). A hypothetical increase in stack height enhanced effective plume rise which resulted in a decrease in atmospheric pollutant concentration.

Data were collected from households, experts and community leaders on institutional frontiers of local public local institution. The study used mixed methods to analyse the data. The findings indicated that despite the presence of institutional set ups, most of the national policy provisions had not been implemented at local levels due to various reasons. Further, even the implemented policies had limited success because of lack of participation in policy making processes, absence of policy implementation guidelines and limited institutional capacity. The study also revealed very weak coordination among institutions working on climate change adaptation. As the result, climate adaptation policy implementation lack continuity, monitoring and evaluation system, and failed to yield transformative changes to the farmers. Therefore, there is an urgent need to participate, capacitate, and synergize local institutions, and establish policy monitoring and evaluation system so that national policy provisions can yield intended results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change adaptation; Deconstructing; Drought-prone districts; Local public institutions; Sidama","agricultural worker; article; climate change; coordination; drought; Ethiopia; household; human; leadership; management; monitoring; practice guideline",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065702832

Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) systems, which branch off from BESs, are able to convert CO2 into valuable organic chemicals and fuels. This study demonstrates that CO2 reduction in MES systems can be enhanced by enriching the inoculum and improving CO2 availability to the biofilm. The proposed system is proven to be a repetitive, efficient, and selective way of consuming CO2 for the production of acetic acid, showing cathodic efficiencies of over 55% and CO2 conversions of over 80%. Continuous recirculation of the gas headspace through the catholyte allowed for a 44% improvement in performance, achieving CO2 fixation rates of 171 mL CO2 L−1·d−1, a maximum daily acetate production rate of 261 mg HAc·L−1·d−1, and a maximum acetate titer of 1957 mg·L−1. High-throughput sequencing revealed that CO2 reduction was mainly driven by a mixed-culture biocathode, in which Sporomusa and Clostridium, both bioelectrochemical acetogenic bacteria, were identified together with other species such as Desulfovibrio, Pseudomonas, Arcobacter, Acinetobacter or Sulfurospirillum, which are usually found in cathodic biofilms.

The ITD accounts for the unresolved spatial variability of sea ice thickness within each model grid cell. While there is a general consensus on the added physical realism brought by the ITD, how to discretize it remains an open question. Here, we use the ocean-sea ice general circulation model, Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) version 3.6 and Louvain-la-Neuve sea Ice Model (LIM) version 3 (NEMO3.6-LIM3), forced by atmospheric reanalyses to test how the ITD discretization (number of ice thickness categories, positions of the category boundaries) impacts the simulated mean Arctic and Antarctic sea ice states. We find that winter ice volumes in both hemispheres increase with the number of categories and attribute that increase to a net enhancement of basal ice growth rates. The range of simulated mean winter volumes in the various experiments amounts to ∼ 30% and ∼ 10% of the reference values (run with five categories) in the Arctic and Antarctic, respectively. This suggests that the way the ITD is discretized has a significant influence on the model mean state, all other things being equal. We also find that the existence of a thick category with lower bounds at ∼ 4 and ∼ 2m for the Arctic and Antarctic, respectively, is a prerequisite for allowing the storage of deformed ice and therefore for fostering thermodynamic growth in thinner categories. Our analysis finally suggests that increasing the resolution of the ITD without changing the lower limit of the upper category results in small but not negligible variations of ice volume and extent. Our study proposes for the first time a bi-polar process-based explanation of the origin of mean sea ice state changes when the ITD discretization is modified. The sensitivity experiments conducted in this study, based on one model, emphasize that the choice of category positions, especially of thickest categories, has a primary influence on the simulated mean sea ice states while the number of categories and resolution have only a secondary influence. It is also found that the current default discretization of the NEMO3.6-LIM3 model is sufficient for large-scale present-day climate applications. In all cases, the role of the ITD discretization on the simulated mean sea ice state has to be appreciated relative to other influences (parameter uncertainty, forcing uncertainty, internal climate variability). © Author(s) 2019.",,"basal ice; ice thickness; ice-ocean interaction; model; oceanic general circulation model; sea ice; spatial variation; thermodynamics; Arctic and Antarctic; Belgium; Louvain la Neuve; Walloon Brabant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071655269

The following research provides key information about the real energy consumption and CO2 emissions of one of the most relevant container terminals in the Mediterranean area, located in Valencia, Spain. The results show that yard terminal tractors and rubber tyred gantry cranes (RTGs) are the main emission sources, accounting for 68.1% of the terminal's total CO2 emissions. After identifying the equipment responsible for the environmental problem, two solutions aimed at improving the energy efficiency of the terminal have been studied: the retrofitting of RTGs cranes and the replacement of terminal tractors powered by fuel for a new liquefied natural gas tractor, which contributed to a large reduction of CO2 emissions.

Catalytic hydrogenolysis assisted by isopropanol (IPA) is used to convert the lignin recovered after ionic liquid (IL) pretreatment, saccharification, and fermentation. This process was compared to a biorefinery using lignin for energy generation and simulated in SuperPro Designer. Spatial analysis was performed to determine biorefinery locations and capacities in a Mexican state with potential for lignocellulosic biomass, including corn stover, sorghum stubble, and Jatropha fruit shells. Relative to the base case, diverting 50% of lignin to phenolics decreased the ethanol cost of production significantly due to the high market value of the co-products. The minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) for this case was $2.02 gal−1. The resulting cradle-to-gate GHG footprint of bioethanol was 21 g CO2-eq MJ−1, a 78% reduction with respect to gasoline when system expansion is used for allocation. Using market value-based allocation resulted in 82% GHG reduction. Analysis of scenarios showed that a biorefinery processing 3000 t day−1 biomass and diverting 80% of lignin to phenolics can potentially yield an MESP lower than $1.5 gal−1. To achieve this, research should target a reduction in IL input by 30% and IPA input by 40%, together with more energy-efficient separation processes. The reduction in IL and IPA can be achieved by decreasing their loading rates and increasing recycling. Sensitivity analysis showed that, for biomass prices higher than $45 t−1, biorefinery capacities must exceed 5000 t d−1 biomass input. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","bioethanol; eugenol; GHG analysis; lignin valorization; techno-economic analysis","Bioconversion; Bioethanol; Biomass; Chemical analysis; Chemical industry; Commerce; Energy efficiency; Ethanol; Finance; Greenhouse gases; Ionic liquids; Lignin; Refining; Saccharification; Sensitivity analysis; Catalytic hydrogenolysis; Cost of productions; eugenol; GHG analysis; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Lignocellulosic biomass; Separation process; Techno-Economic analysis; Economic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063624049

Recently, vertical farming systems have emerged as a potential solution for urban farming. However, although there is an increasing body of literature reviewing the potential of urban and vertical farming systems, only a limited number of studies have reviewed the sustainability of these systems. The aim of this article was to understand the environmental impacts of vertical hydroponic farming in urban environments applied to a case study vertical hydroponic farm in Stockholm, Sweden. This was carried out by evaluating environmental performance using a life cycle perspective to assess the environmental impacts and comparing to potential scenarios for improvement options. The results suggest that important aspects for the vertical hydroponic system include the growing medium, pots, electricity demand, the transportation of raw materials and product deliveries. By replacing plastic pots with paper pots, large reductions in GHG emissions, acidification impacts, and abiotic resource depletion are possible. Replacing conventional gardening soil as the growing medium with coir also leads to large environmental impact reductions. However, in order to further reduce the impacts from the system, more resource-efficient steps will be needed to improve impacts from electricity demand, and there is potential to develop more symbiotic exchanges to employ urban wastes and by-products. © 2019 by the authors.","Growing medium; Hydroponics; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Plant factory; Sustainable production; Urban farming","acidification; environmental impact assessment; food production; greenhouse gas; hydroponics; life cycle analysis; literature review; resource depletion; sustainability; urban agriculture; Stockholm [Sweden]; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070464685

We compare results from a purely insolation-driven model with a complementary set of observations made by ROSINA, VIRTIS, MIRO, and OSIRIS within the same period. The observations include - for the first time - inverted MIRO measurements of gas density, temperature and bulk velocity to constrain the model. The comparisons show that, as in November 2014 (Marschall et al., 2016), insolation-driven activity does not provide an adequate fit to the data. Both VIRTIS and MIRO observations indicate that emissions from the Hatmehit and Imhotep regions of the nucleus are strongly depleted in total gas, H 2 O, and dust emissions in this case. The MIRO inversion provides a challenging constraint to the models as a consequence of the terminator orbit and nucleus pointing of the spacecraft. Nonetheless a consistent picture with a dominance of outgassing from the Hapi region, even at equinox, is clearly evident. An inhomogeneous model consistent with models proposed for the November 2014 time-frame was constructed and provides a better fit to the data. As far as we are aware this is the first time comae data from four Rosetta instruments have been used to constrain within one self-contained model the emission distribution at the nucleus surface and study the dynamics of the gas and dust outflow. © 2019","67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko; Coma; Comets; Dust; Dynamics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063365289

Therefore, this study aims to develop and suggest a model which allows the evaluation of the level of effects of the design parameters which should be considered at the scale of urban textures, on the energy and economic performance of buildings to design sustainable, energy efficient built environments. Energy and economic performances of a reference building modeled in different urban texture alternatives were evaluated. In the first stage, the evaluations regarding energy consumption were performed through DesignBuilder simulation program. In the second stage, for the assessment of economic performance of the alternatives life cycle cost (LCC) analyses were performed integrated to the energy performance analyses. Consequently, the urban texture alternative which achieved the optimum result in terms of energy and cost efficiency was determined for Istanbul representing temperate-humid climatic region where an ongoing mass urban renewal has already been changing the existing urban textures. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

The aim of this research was to study the setback of carrying out the Brazilian Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) on sustainability indicators, focusing at production in the economic, productive, natural and social conditions of beef cattle breeding systems in the Amazonian biome in the northern part of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Researchers conducted the experiment in the town of Alta Floresta between August 2012 and August 2014 in six cattle ranching lands. They carried out diagnoses in the properties, and, afterwards, applied an application to the producers, focusing on their supervisory skills, their technological knowledge status and their strength for choosing some technologies in sanitary and reproductive management, feeding systems, types of supplements and water sources provided to the animals and to the facilities. The team collected the technical and commercial data between 2013 and 2014. In addition, they carried out a complementary examination to test enteric methane emissions. Based on the results, the following GAP made it possible to reach better indicators than those found in pastures that tried none GAP. Complementarily, methane emissions per kg of live weight were lower in intensified areas. Intensification generated better economic indicators, with gross margin differences of US$ 318.89. The results in the intensified areas, when compared to the one in the conventional systems, presented a 16% increase in productive weight in live weight.ha−1, with a 2.05% increase in investment return rates and US$ 142.94 in net present value. The GAP has provided economic, social and environmental gains, such as an increase of almost 5% in investment return rates, generating higher production, continuing employment in farms with historical negative gross margins and reducing the methane emissions per kg of live weight in the dry season by 54%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Amazon; Brazil; GAP; Livestock","agricultural intensification; agricultural practice; biome; cattle; livestock farming; management practice; ranching; sustainability; tropical environment; Alta Floresta; Amazonia; Brazil; Mato Grosso; Animalia; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064918925

Nevertheless, a large fraction (50%) of particles below the current lower regulated size (23 nm) was recently reported. Moreover, large differences between laboratory and PN Portable Emission Measurement Systems (PN-PEMS) have been observed. In order to better understand such differences, the physical properties of the exhaust aerosol from two Euro VI technology diesel heavy-duty engines were studied. It was found that urea injection leads to formation of nonvolatile particles. The produced particles covered a wide size range spanning from below 10 nm to above 100 nm. As such, they contribute to the regulated PN emissions, with measured concentrations corresponding to as high as 2 × 1011 #/kWh over a World Harmonized Transient Cycle (WHTC). However, a large fraction of them was undetected owing to their small particle size. Low-cutoff size (10 nm) Condensation Particle Counters (CPCs) (which are under discussion to be included in the regulations) measured up to twice as high concentrations. Considering the large particle losses in the sampling systems at this size range, the true concentrations can be two times higher from what the low-cutoff CPCs reported. When the temperature of the SCR system exceeded a threshold of 300 °C, the produced particles were found to be positively charged, increasing the average exhaust aerosol charge up to +3 elementary charges per particle. Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) measurements of non-neutralized samples revealed that even the smallest of them can carry more than one positive charge. The findings of this study can explain the differences reported between PEMS and laboratory systems and especially those based on diffusion charging. They also provide insight for a refinement of technical requirements prescribed in the European PEMS regulation to more accurately quantify the PN emissions from such technologies. © 2019, © 2019 European Union.

Developing strategies to reduce both annual and 24 h average PM2.5 requires that the conditions that produce the magnitude of these metrics are understood. This paper presents a standard and replicable set of statistics that link the magnitude of annual and daily PM2.5 metrics to variation in i)hourly PM2.5 concentrations, ii)geographic regions traversed by air mass back trajectories, and iii)the ‘urban increment’ and ‘regional contribution’ to urban PM2.5 concentrations. These statistics are calculated between 2009 and 2018 at monitoring sites across Paris and the Île-de-France region, France, where there is a national objective to achieve the WHO annual PM2.5 guideline, and where short-term PM2.5 episodes still occur. The aim is to investigate changes in the conditions producing annual average, and 24 h PM2.5 concentrations exceeding 25 μg m−3, and how these long- and short-term metrics could be reduced further. The statistics indicate that reductions between 2009 and 2018 in both annual PM2.5 concentrations (PM2.5AA, −0.79 μg m−3 y−1 averaged across 3 urban background sites (33% average 2009–2018 reduction))and the number of days with 24 h PM2.5 concentrations above 25 μg m−3 (D24h25, -6 days y−1 (62% average 2009–2018 reduction)), were driven by reductions in local emissions in Paris and the Île-de-France region. For example, reduction in PM2.5AA and D24h25 were greater at urban traffic sites, and between 2009 and 2018 the highest hourly PM2.5 concentrations occurred less frequently during rush hour periods, while the lowest hourly PM2.5 concentrations occurred more frequently during the day. In addition, when relatively moderate and high hourly PM2.5 concentrations were measured, air mass back trajectories spent more time (during the 4 preceding days)over European geographic regions, compared to the ocean indicating an increased relative contribution from regional transport to these hourly PM2.5 concentrations. Consequently, there is now a greater difference in the contribution of different hourly PM2.5 concentrations to annual and 24 h PM2.5 compared with 2009, with relatively high hourly PM2.5 concentrations having a larger contribution to D24h25, and moderate hourly PM2.5 concentrations having a larger contribution to PM2.5AA. Strategies to reduce PM2.5 concentrations in Paris should consider how mitigation measures will affect different ranges of hourly PM2.5 concentrations to understand the (potentially differing)effect on long- and short-term PM2.5 impact metrics. Comparison of hourly PM2.5 concentrations at urban sites and upwind rural sites showed regional contributions to PM2.5AA of approximately 50% and 70% at urban traffic and urban background sites, respectively. The largest regional contributions were also estimated for the highest hourly PM2.5 concentrations, compared to moderate hourly PM2.5 concentrations. Regional emission reductions could therefore make a substantial contribution to achieving the WHO air quality guidelines in Paris. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Air quality monitoring; Chemical climatology; Fine particulate matter; Paris; Trends","Air pollution; Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Emission control; Particles (particulate matter); Air mass back trajectories; Air quality monitoring; Developing strategy; Fine particulate matter; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Paris; Relative contribution; Trends; Urban growth; air quality; annual variation; atmospheric pollution; climatology; concentration (composition); diurnal variation; emission control; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; trend analysis; urban pollution; air pollution; air quality; article; climate; clinical article; driver; France; human; monitoring; particulate matter; practice guideline; sea; statistics; France; Ile de France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065451840

The status as sentinels of two plant communities are reviewed. Alpine treeline ecotones and alpine vegetation have been observed to respond to climate change in recent decades. The treeline has moved upslope and alpine communities have had some species increase and others decrease. The response for both, however, has been inconsistent if taken as a whole. Problematic factors for this response are outlined for both: abiotic and biotic interactions partially decouple the plant communities from climate.

The index-based assessment of vulnerability to climate change and variability is typically used to identify administrative-level regions of high vulnerability using various socioeconomic and biophysical datasets. One method that combines both approaches at the community level consists of collecting highly resolved socio-economic data and using the livelihood vulnerability index (LVI) to assess population vulnerability to increased climate variability and shocks. We use this mixed-methods approach in mapping climate vulnerability of ten drought-prone villages in the central-east mid-hill region of Nepal. We integrate data from over 900 household surveys and national-level databases and identify spatial patterns in the different components of climate vulnerability. We assess to what extent climatic extremes or people's socioeconomic capacity contribute to vulnerability and may shape development needs at the sub-district scale. We find that the majority of our study area falls in the high vulnerability category with significant spatial variation. In some villages, there are different vulnerability classes in different wards, indicating that even within the lowest administrative units, there is a significant spatial variation in the level of vulnerability. Livelihood strategies, water availability, and topographic components played the most important role in determining overall vulnerability and we measure strong interconnections among different components. The interconnectedness nature of different vulnerability components is creating a self-reinforcing downward spiral of vulnerability that traps local communities in a state of heightened vulnerability. We conclude that adaptation strategies in highly vulnerable regions should include careful consideration of different livelihoods and environmental components, their fine-scale spatial variations, and interconnections. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Biophysical; climate change; development needs; resilience; socioeconomic","adaptive management; assessment method; biopesticide; climate change; drought; index method; mapping method; socioeconomic conditions; spatial variation; strategic approach; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053562171

In order to understand the nutritional values of 'Nainaiqingcai' mustard, the contents of main nutrients among different edible parts (leaves, petioles, and bolting stem) in 'Nainaiqingcai' mustard under the alpine cold climate were investigated. The results showed that significant differences were found among different edible parts. The levels of chlorophyll, carotenoids, ascorbic acid, soluble soilds, and soluble proteins were followed as the trends of leaves > petioles > bolting stem.Whereas the sugar components showed different distributions, and the lowest content of sugar was detected in leaves. Moreover, significant negatively correlation were found between sugar and the other nutrients. Most of the extremely significant positive correlations were found between sugar components, and the correlation coefficient is high (except for the correlation between fructose and sucrose). The highest correlation coefficient was between chlorophyll and carotenoids, up to 1.000.

This paper investigates the causes underlying this warm bias, with a focus on the effect of horizontal resolution in the atmospheric component of coupled models, by using Community Earth System Model (CESM) as an example. By breaking down the energy budget of the upper ocean, we conclude that surface net heat flux and Ekman upwelling process exert a considerable influence (over 80%) on upper ocean temperature of EBUS in CESM. Besides, the problem of underestimation of stratocumulus cloud is not present near the coast, and hence not responsible for this warm bias in CESM. On the contrary, downward shortwave radiation bias is overcompensated by longwave radiation and latent flux bias on the open ocean. Therefore, the insufficient ocean dynamic upwelling is the dominantly cause for SST warm bias. Finer horizontal resolution atmosphere component of CESM enables better representation of low-level coastal jet structure, with stronger and closer alongshore wind stress and curl leading to realistic representation of upwelling process and horizontal water mass transportation. Furthermore, low-level coastal jet is shown to be sensitive to coastal mountain topography, especially in South East Pacific region, through both thermodynamic and dynamic atmospheric processes and oceanic response. This article provides further proof of improving coupled climate models in reducing the SST biases in EBUS regions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Coastal upwelling; Sea-surface temperature; Topography; Wind stress","Atmospheric temperature; Budget control; Climate models; Heat flux; Mass transportation; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Topography; Wind stress; Atmosphere components; Atmospheric components; Coastal upwelling; Coupled climate model; Eastern boundary current; Horizontal resolution; Sea surface temperature (SST); Short-wave radiation; Oceanography; boundary current; climate modeling; Ekman transport; energy budget; heat flux; sea surface temperature; shortwave radiation; stratocumulus; topography; upper ocean; upwelling; water mass; wind stress; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Southeast)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068860153

On this basis, panel regression models are built to identify drivers of the measured efficiency evolution in China's mining sector. Our empirical results reveal that: (i) unified inputs-outputs efficiency in China's mining sector exhibits an essentially descending trend on the whole and the regional disparity is not as pronounced as other industries; (ii) state ownership stake exerts a negative effect, whereas private ownership stake exerts a positive influence on the unified input-output efficiency; (iii) government regulation did not impel mining industry toward a more efficient mode of operating but hindered efficiency enhancement, and this is especially distinct in private-owned enterprises; (iv) regional economic development and R&D could be conducive to the improvement of unified input-output efficiency while energy price did not effectively motivate input conservation.

In order to understand the detailed characteristics of organic compounds (≥C6) at a molecular level on nonhaze and haze days, we determined more than 300 organic compounds in the PM2:5 from an urban area of Beijing collected in November-December 2016 using two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC×GC-ToF-MS). The identified organic compounds have been classified into groups, and quantitative methods were used to calculate their concentrations. Primary emission sources make significant contributions to the atmospheric organic compounds, and six groups (including nalkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons-PAHs, levoglucosan, branched alkanes, n-alkenes and alkyl-benzenes) account for 66% of total identified organic compound mass. In addition, PAHs and oxygenated PAHs (O-PAHs) were abundant amongst the atmospheric organic compounds on both haze and non-haze days. The most abundant hydrocarbon groups were observed with a carbon atom range of C19-C28. In addition, the total concentration of unidentified compounds present in the chromatogram was estimated in the present study. The total identified compounds account for approximately 47% of total organic compounds (≥C6) in the chromatogram on both the non-haze and haze days. The total mass concentrations of organic compounds (≥C6) in the chromatogram were 4.0 and 7.4 μgm-3 on the non-haze and haze days, respectively, accounting for 26.4% and 18.5% of organic matter, respectively, on those days estimated from the total organic carbon concentration. Ratios of individual compound concentrations between haze and non-haze days do not give a clear indication of the degree of oxidation, but the overall distribution of organic compounds in the chromatogram provides strong evidence that the organic aerosol is less GC volatile and hence more highly oxidized on haze days. © Author(s) 2019.",,"aerosol composition; concentration (composition); haze; liquid chromatography; megacity; organic compound; particulate matter; winter; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071544951

The analyses show that a least-cost strategy would massively employ renewable energy, particularly in the power sector. Through strong coupling across energy sectors and countries, electricity would play a central role in the decarbonization of the main energy sectors. In particular power-to-heat conversion, where heat storage appears important in addition to existing hydropower. Technical and regulatory barriers in front of increased sector coupling and flexibility were identified, and policy measures are proposed to overcome these. In addition to a high carbon price, dynamic tariffs and taxation of electricity would be important to allow market signals for flexibility to reach end-users. A stronger power transmission connection from the Nordics to the mainland-Europe and the United Kingdom would be beneficial for the emission reductions and renewable energy use. The transition pathway analysis points out socio-technical issues such as social acceptance of large-scale new infrastructures (e.g., wind, cables).

Existing BCW schemes for PM2.5 have large deficiencies that influence its simulation in 3D chemical transport models (CTMs). In this study, a 7-year dataset with high temporal resolution (in minutes)sampled from a pristine rural site is used to calculate the BCW coefficient during the rain events. The data used for the BCW coefficient calculation cover a wide range of rain intensity from 2 mm h−1 to 60 mm h−1. The BCW coefficient linearly correlates with the rain intensity, with a correlation coefficient of 0.82. The coefficient has a magnitude of 10−5 to 10−4 s−1 when the rain intensity ranges from 1 to 40 mm h−1. After implementing the updated BCW scheme into the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx)model, the performance of PM2.5 simulation improves for the two months of heavy rain. Apart from the CAMx model, our scheme can be easily implemented into other 3D CTMs to improve PM2.5 simulation during rainy days. The BCW effect can clean around 10–40% of the PM2.5 over our study region, which can help to reduce the PM2.5 exposure level for residents, and the health burdens caused by this pollutant can thus be reduced. Rainmaking is a potential way to decrease PM2.5 concentration, but it cannot be the key method to reduce the PM2.5 level to the standard during episodic cases (e.g., &gt;200 μg/m3). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality model; Below-cloud washout; Empirical scheme; PM2.5","Air quality; Infiltration; Air quality modeling; Below-cloud; Chemical transport models; Comprehensive air quality model with extensions; Correlation coefficient; Empirical scheme; High temporal resolution; PM2.5; Rain; air quality; concentration (composition); empirical analysis; particulate matter; three-dimensional modeling; air quality; article; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; environmental monitoring; human; particle size; particulate matter; procedures; theoretical model; rain; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Rain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065388398

However, knowledge about field autotrophic bacteria under different tillage systems is limited. In this field study, the effects of 6 years of tillage on autotrophic bacteria were evaluated by high-throughput sequencing of the ribulose 1,5–bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO)gene (cbbL). The results showed that tillage systems had strong influence on the abundance, composition, and activity of cbbL-carrying bacteria. Conventional tillage had more abundant cbbL and 16S rRNA genes as well as higher RubisCO activity, when compared with no tillage. The cbbL sequences were mainly affiliated with Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, which accounted for &gt;96% of the identified community. The predominant cbbL-carrying bacteria in conventional tillage with straw returning were Proteobacteria (94.3%)at the phylum level and Variovorax paradoxus (42.9%)at the species level; in contrast, those in no tillage with straw removal included Actinobacteria (31.5%)at the phylum level and Thermomonospora curvata (29.1%)at the species level. The copy numbers of cbbL correlated positively with dissolved organic carbon and negatively with soil bulk density. Mantel tests confirmed that cbbL-carrying bacterial composition was significantly affected by soil bulk density and also by microbial biomass carbon. Straw returning enhanced the abundance of cbbL-carrying bacteria and had unique species such as Acidiphilium multivorum, which was not detected in treatments with straw removal. These results suggest that the potential for CO2 mitigation by tillage depends on soil conditions and is much more variable and complex than previously considered. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","Abundance; Autotrophic bacteria; CO2 fixation activity; Diversity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065894600

Our results indicate that China's energy security improved over the last five decades from resource availability, resource affordability, economic efficiency, and environmental impacts perspectives. After quality adjusting of the energy it consumes, China was not yet the largest energy consumer in the world before 2016, with the emergy of its primary energy consumption increased to 99.68% that of the U.S. in 2015. The emissions of CH4 had the largest environmental impact, followed by SO2 and N2O, while the CO2 emissions is one order of magnitude lower. Speeding up the development and utilization of domestic coal bed methane (CBM) as an energy source will improve the quality and diversity of China's primary energy mix, as well as reduce CH4 emissions. China benefited from its energy imports, which accounted for about 5% of GDP over the past two decades. Increasing the fraction and diversity of coal imports can further improve the benefit ratio of energy imports to China. The emergy indices proposed here are general and can be applied to evaluate the energy security of other national systems. © 2019","Economic efficiency; Energy affordability; Energy availability; Energy security; Environmental impacts","Coal bed methane; Coal deposits; Decision making; Energy security; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Methane; Natural gas wells; Development and utilizations; Economic efficiency; Energy affordability; Energy availability; Energy consumer; Primary energy consumption; Primary energy mix; Resource availability; Energy efficiency; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emergy; energy; energy efficiency; energy use; environmental impact; Gross Domestic Product; index method; security; China; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066994385

The pursuit of this demanding assignment calls for innovative solutions in conceiving the building envelope and its energy systems. Recently, among the most effective tools for improving the energy and environmental performances of buildings, the technical interventions regarding the roofs are gaining a rising attention. Indeed, covers of buildings are responsible of a relevant part of their energy losses and, on the other hand, could contribute to increasing the UHI effect. In the paper, a simple methodology that compares the energy and environmental benefits of cool and green coverages with traditional ones is presented. The capability of limiting the UHI effect of these solutions is also analysed. The methodology is applied to four cities of the Sicilian Island, characterized by different building density and different microclimates. This in-field application shows the feasibility of the method to be used in different urban contexts, as a useful contribution to the design of new buildings or to the re-design of the existing ones. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

However, biodiversity and ecosystem processes are commonly monitored independently and on spatiotemporal scales inadequate to inform decision-making. The high Andean ecosystems of Colombia, extending from high Andean forests and páramos to glacier ice caps, form dynamic landscapes because of the interaction of climate and land use change in a complex socioeconomic and political context, including new demographic dynamics and policies associated with the peace process and strict regulations for economic activities in the páramos. Moreover, they are part of a global biodiversity hotspot and provide key ecosystem services, including substantial carbon accumulation and water regulation and provision for large rural and urban populations. There is substantial experience in environmental monitoring of Colombia's high mountain ecosystems, including programs addressing biodiversity, carbon stocks, hydrology, glaciers, and land use dynamics. However, a conceptual and institutional framework for integrating these diverse initiatives is required. Here, we present a proposal to promote integrated monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem services in high mountain ecosystems in Colombia as a contribution to consolidating a national ecosystem monitoring program. We describe the methodology used to design this integrated strategy based on an extensive process of consultation with monitoring experts in the region. Then, we review the state of the art of environmental monitoring in the Colombian High Andes. Based on the experience accumulated, we propose a multiscale conceptual framework for analyzing drivers of change and response variables from the local to the national scale, emphasizing the importance of monitoring along altitudinal, land use, and ecosystem restoration gradients. Finally, we describe the expected outcomes and possible institutional arrangements for the strategy, as well as some key next steps for promoting its implementation. © 2020 Llambí et al.","Adaptive management; Andean forests; carbon; climate change; environmental policy; land use change; páramo; water","biodiversity; conceptual framework; ecosystem service; environmental monitoring; glacier; global change; institutional framework; land use change; peace process; Andes; Colombia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084232054

Plant species diversity enhances soil organic carbon and soil infiltration capacity via multiple plant–soil feedback mechanisms in long-term natural restoration grasslands. Plant species diversity increases community productivity, resulting in increasing soil carbon storage, which improves soil infiltration capacity by influencing soil aggregate stability and porosity. The present study indicates that plant species diversity is conducive to increasing atmospheric CO2 sequestration and reducing the risk of soil erosion.

In the current study, in situ rhizobox experiments (including rhizosphere and inner and outer bulk soil) were conducted in an estuarine tidal marsh. Our results showed that a higher abundance of total bacteria, Geobacter, dsrA and mcrA and lower α-diversity were observed in the rhizosphere relative to the bulk soil. Rhizosphere effects shifted the partition of terminal metabolic pathways from sulfate reduction in the bulk soil to the co-dominance of microbial Fe(III) and sulfate reduction in the rhizosphere. Although the rhizosphere effect promoted the rates of three terminal metabolic pathways, it showed greater preference towards microbial Fe(III) reduction in the tidal marsh soils.

This study applies the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC), Gini index and elasticity coefficient methods to conduct an investigation of industrial and domestic water use and pollution management in Shandong. The results show that industrial water pollution generally displayed a coordinated relationship with socio-economic development, while an uncoordinated relationship occurred between domestic water pollution and socio-economic development. Meanwhile, the Gini index between domestic water use and population in 2017 (0.101) was superior to that of 2003 (0.165), and the Gini index of industrial water use and second industry output in 2017 (0.273) was better than that of 2003 (0.292), indicating that the allocation and equity of domestic and industrial water use in Shandong kept to a good development trend. Additionally, the industrial effect is better than the domestic effect in terms of the control of wastewater emissions and the governance of typical pollutants in wastewater. Accordingly, domestic water pollution has gradually become one of the major sources of water pollution, and the allocation of industrial and domestic water use has room to improve further in Shandong. Conjunctive use of the aforementioned three methods provides an approach to investigate the integrated management of water use and water pollution control from multiple angles. © 2019 by the authors.","Elasticity coefficient; Environmental Kuznets curve; Gini index; Socio-economic development; Water pollution; Water use","Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Elasticity; Industrial economics; Industrial emissions; Oil spills; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water management; Water pollution; Elasticity coefficients; Environmental Kuznets curves; Gini Index; Socio-economic development; Water use; Water pollution control; elasticity; index method; industrial technology; Kuznets curve; pollution control; resource allocation; security; socioeconomic conditions; water management; water planning; water pollution; water use; China; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070565317

Based on correlation and stepwise multiple regression analyses, the effects of seven soil factors on organic carbon and their sensitivities to change were studied using path and sensitivity analyses. The results revealed differences in the interconnections and intensities of soil factors on organic carbon. Soil porosity, field capacity, and ammonium nitrogen levels were the main factors affecting organic carbon in the ecosystem. Soil porosity had a strong direct effect on organic carbon content and a strong indirect effect through field capacity. Field capacity and ammonium nitrogen levels mainly affected organic carbon directly. Field capacity, soil porosity, and ammonium nitrogen content, as well as bulk density, β-glucosidase activity, and invertase activity, were sensitive factors. Polyphenol oxidase activity was insensitive.

However, challenges still exist in the pursuit of facile fabrication technique for simultaneously realizing high capacitive performance and excellent mechanical stability. Here, two novel types of core-sheathed hybrid electrodes with carbon nanotube fiber (CNF) as the core and three-dimensional (3D) porous carbon nanotubes/polypyrrole (CNTs/PPy) or reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as the sheath were hierarchically constructed through one-pot electrochemical deposition. An all-solid-state asymmetric fiber-shaped supercapacitor was assembled by wrapping the gel electrolyte coated negative CNF/rGO electrode along the positive CNF/CNTs/PPy electrode. Thanks to the combination of abundant 3D pore structure and synergistic effect of different components in the fiber electrodes, the resulted supercapacitors exhibited a broadened potential window of 1.6 V, a high areal specific capacitance of 58.82 mF cm−2 and a high areal energy density of 20.91 μW h cm−2. It should be noted that 98.6% of the initial capacitance of the supercapacitor device can still be maintained after experiencing 200 reciprocating bending cycles, demonstrating outstanding mechanical stability. Moreover, the supercapacitor exhibited excellent cyclic performance, which was testified by 90% capacity retention after 10000 times of galvanostatic charge-discharge process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Asymmetric; Carbon nanotube; Fiber supercapacitor; Graphene; Polypyrrole","Capacitance; Electric discharges; Electrochemical deposition; Electrochemical electrodes; Fibers; Flexible electronics; Graphene; Mechanical stability; Polypyrroles; Pore structure; Reduction; Solid electrolytes; Supercapacitor; Yarn; Asymmetric; Asymmetric supercapacitor; Carbon nanotube fibers; Galvanostatic charge discharges; Reduced graphene oxides; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); Specific capacitance; Threedimensional (3-d); Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066100067

An ICCCP-EWN model is formulated for planning energy-water nexus system of Xiamen that is heavily relies on fossil fuels (e.g., coal is a main energy source). A set of probability and credibility levels related to energy-water availabilities, energy-water demands, and pollutant-emission mitigations are examined. Results discover that uncertainties have significant effects on the system planning strategies. System cost, heat generation, imported energy, and water supply would decrease with the raised probability level and increase with the raised credibility level.

These have ranged from quantitative measures and qualitative reflections, as well as ones that aimed to provide more nuanced definitions. These studies have, however, typically focused on single jurisdictions or across national borders, with very few examining the issue across different climatic and policy contexts within the same nation. This paper aims to address this gap by focussing on differences in climate conditions, local policies and quality of the housing stock across Australia and reflects on how these factors each played a role, to varying degrees, in the prevalence of energy poverty amongst lower-income households across eight metropolitan and regional settings conducted as part of a recent study in Australia. Through a review of focus group, interview and workshop data, it especially highlights the more qualitative impacts of energy poverty, and how each of these factors come to influence the extent to which lower-income households experience energy poverty and the support they were able to access. Additional to the need for more contextualised measures of energy poverty, this paper calls for localised responses to alleviate the negative outcomes reflected by our participants in regard to both energy and housing policies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Australia; Energy policy; Energy poverty; Housing policy; Qualitative outcomes; Welfare assistance","Buildings; Energy management; Energy policy; Australia; Energy poverties; Housing policy; Qualitative outcomes; Welfare assistance; Housing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066049239

Observations of N2O fluxes and direct emission factors (EFds) remain limited in the non-monsoon zone in China. In this study, year-round measurements of yields, meteorological and soil environmental factors, and N2O fluxes were conducted in highland barley (HB, with the application of synthetic fertilizers) and oilseed rape (OR, with the mixed application of air-dried sheep manure and synthetic fertilizers) cropping systems with typical extensive management in the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau. The cumulative N2O emissions during the freeze-thaw period (0.10 and 0.31 kg N ha−1) and annual scale (0.35 and 0.70 kg N ha−1 yr−1 in the HB and OR fields, respectively) were in the low range of globally reported freeze-thaw emissions from seasonally frozen croplands. The annual EFds were 0.19% ± 0.11% and 0.04% ± 0.14% in the HB and OR fields, respectively, which were much lower than the national average and IPCC default values. The extensive management (low fertilization rates, aboveground plant nitrogen removal, and rain-fed agriculture) and alpine climate led to low emissions and EFds in the croplands of the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau. Although the annual N2O emissions and EFds were relatively low, extensive management still needs to be optimized to maintain the sustainability of agricultural production on the plateau because of the extremely low nitrogen use efficiencies (crop recovery efficiency of applied nitrogen: 0.2 kg N kg−1 N) and negative nitrogen surpluses (–58.7 and –8.0 kg N ha−1 yr−1 in the HB and OR fields, respectively). To reduce the uncertainty in the estimates of global and national emission inventories, more studies should be conducted in the non-monsoon zone owing to the peculiarity of management strategy and climate, and the dramatic expansion of cropland area. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Highland barley; Nitrogen surplus; Nitrogen use efficiency; Oilseed rape; Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau; Soil freeze-thaw","agricultural land; agricultural production; alpine environment; barley; canola; emission inventory; freeze-thaw cycle; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; nutrient use efficiency; upland region; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Brassica napus; Hordeum; Ovis aries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064428416

The Henry's law constant was obtained using a jacketed stirred glass reactor, and the equilibrium CO2 solubility was investigated using a bubbling absorption reactor. Additionally, the mass transfer performance was measured and evaluated experimentally in a packed column with DX-Type structured packing in terms of KGav, KG, and av. These experiments were conducted under the MEA/DMEA concentration of 6 kmol·m-3 with ratio of 5:1. The dynamic changes of solubility, species concentration, and absorption heat of solution were analyzed under different CO2 loadings. The experimental results showed that the relationship of successive absorption without synergistic effect from the perspective of equilibrium state for the MEA/DMEA solution and the blended MEA/DMEA solution can reduce the CO2 absorption heat compared to that of MEA solution.

This paper focuses on carbon emission reduction in urban distribution, taking perishable foods as the object. It carries out optimization analysis of urban distribution routes to explore the impact of low carbon policy on urban distribution routes planning. On the basis of analysis of the cost components and corresponding constraints of urban distribution, two optimization models of urban distribution routes with and without carbon emissions cost are constructed. Fuel quantity related to cost and carbon emissions in the model is calculated based on traffic speed, vehicle fuel quantity and passable time period of distribution. Then an improved algorithm which combines genetic algorithm and tabu search algorithm is designed to solve models. Moreover, an analysis of the influence of carbon tax price is also carried out. It is concluded that in the process of urban distribution based on the actual network information, path optimization considering the low carbon factor can effectively reduce the distribution process of CO2, and reduce the total cost of the enterprise and society, thus achieving greater social benefits at a lower cost. In addition, the government can encourage low-carbon distribution by rationally adjusting the price of carbon tax to achieve a higher social benefit. © 2019 by the authors.","Cost; Low carbon; Perishable foods; Route optimization; Urban distribution","carbon emission; cost analysis; emission control; environmental economics; genetic algorithm; optimization; pollution tax; traffic congestion; urban transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070694831

Similar to many developing countries, Malaysia has faced severe problems in waste management due to its rapid economic growth and urbanisation. The municipal solid waste (MSW)production rate in Malaysia had increased significantly in a recent year, ranging from 0.8 to 1.25 kg/person∙d. The wastes generated contain a high amount of organic portion with high moisture content. Improper MSW management practice or delayed in waste collection and transportation can lead to severe health issues. This paper presents a case study in Johor Bahru, Malaysia (FOLO Farm), in which a composting prototype is used as the waste management technology to recycle the food and vegetable wastes. The greenhouse gases (GHG)mitigation and economic feasibility of the integrated composting and organic farming in this study are reported. This study showed a reduction of 27% of GHG by diverting the food and vegetable wastes from open dumping to the composting plant. Higher reduction rate (∼44%)can be achieved with better planning of waste collection route and applying the mitigation strategies during the composting process. By adapting the membership concept, this project not only ensures the economic feasibility of running a composting plant but also secures a channel for the growth of vegetable distribution. This study provides an insight into the feasibility and desirability to implement a pilot-scale composting for organic waste management to achieve the low carbon and self-sustain community. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Composting; Cost and benefit analysis; Food and vegetable waste; GHG mitigation","composting; cost-benefit analysis; developing world; economic conditions; economic growth; environmental economics; feasibility study; food waste; integrated approach; management practice; municipal solid waste; organic farming; strategic approach; sustainable development; urbanization; waste; waste management; Article; carbon footprint; community composting plant; composting; cost benefit analysis; dumping; feasibility study; food waste; greenhouse gas; Malaysia; municipal solid waste; organic farming; organic waste; vegetable waste; waste management; organic farming; waste disposal; waste management; Johor; Johor Bahru; Malaysia; West Malaysia; Composting; Feasibility Studies; Malaysia; Organic Agriculture; Refuse Disposal; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067538647

Among the various controls of HVAC systems, chiller sequencing control is of great importance for multi-chiller plant to keep cooling reliability, system stability and energy efficiency. However, conventional chiller sequencing control usually lacks consideration of system stability and the accessional cost caused by the sequencing actions. Especially, those short-time or unnecessary sequencing actions become the main reason for operators to shut down automatic control. To enhance the reliability of chiller sequencing control, a hybrid predictive control is developed. This control is developed based on a typical sequencing control strategy and use an autoregressive with exogenous (ARX) prediction model to double check the necessity of sequencing commands so as to reduce the unexpected sequencing actions. Case studies were carried out on a secondary school in subtropical city. Results showed that the switch number and economical operation cost can be reduced more than 20% and 6.72%, respectively.

As the largest carbon emitter in the world, China is facing a serious situation of carbon emission reduction. This paper uses the IPCC (The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) method to calculate the carbon emissions of energy consumption in China from 1996 to 2016, and uses it as a dependent variable to analyze the influencing factors. In this paper, five factors, total population, per capita GDP (Gross Domestic Product), urbanization level, primary energy consumption structure, technology level, and industrial structure are selected as the influencing factors of carbon emissions. Based on the expanded STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology) model, the influencing degree of different factors on carbon emissions of energy consumption is analyzed. The results show that the order of impact on carbon emissions from high to low is total population, per capita GDP, technology level, industrial structure, primary energy consumption structure, and urbanization level. On the basis of the above research, the carbon emissions of China0s energy consumption in the future are predicted under eight different scenarios. The results show that, when the population and economy keep a low growth rate, while improving the technology level can effectively control carbon emissions from energy consumption, China0s carbon emissions from energy consumption will reach 302.82 million tons in 2020. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon emission; Energy consumption; Factor analysis; IPCC method; Trend forecast","Carbon; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Factor analysis; Growth rate; Population statistics; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon emissions; Gross domestic products; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; International community; IPCC method; Primary energy consumption; Trend forecast; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070560024

Results show that deposition speed is equal to oxidation speed at the temperature of 330°C, reaching balance state. With increasing of temperature, oxidation speed was improved significantly and with increasing of space velocity, oxidation rate decreased.

This study investigated effects of exposure to PM2.5, O3, and pollen on asthma control status among pediatric patients with asthma. Methods: A total of 229 dyads of pediatric patients with asthma and their parents were followed for 15 months. The Asthma Control and Communication Instrument was used to measure asthma control, which was reported weekly by parents during a 26-week period. PM2.5 and O3 data were collected from the US Environmental Protection Agency Air Quality System. Pollen data were obtained from Intercontinental Marketing Services Health. Mean air pollutant and pollen exposures within 7 days before the reporting of asthma control were used to estimate weekly exposures for each participant. Linear mixed-effects models were performed to test associations of PM2.5, O3, and pollen exposure with asthma control status. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of findings by different exposure monitoring days per week and distances between monitoring sites and participants’ residences. Results: Elevated PM2.5 concentration and pollen severity were associated with poorer asthma control status (P &lt;.05), yet elevated O3 concentration was marginally associated with better asthma control (P &lt;.1). Conclusions: Poorer asthma control status was associated with elevated PM2.5 and pollen severity.

Firstly, the architecture of self-doped carbon nanofoam (A-CS650)is fabricated utilizing naturally rich cotton stalk through a facile procedure, which demonstrates exceptional performance contributed by synergistic features of large surface area, hierarchical porosity and rich defects. A-CS650 presents gravimetric and volumetric capacitances up to 282 F g−1 and 234 F cm−3 at 0.5 A g−1, and a high-rate capacitance retention of 72.7% at a large rate of 100 A g−1. With increasing the mass loading to 20 mg cm−2, A-CS650 still retains good performance. Especially, by using unique CMC-Na/Na2SO4 gel electrolyte, 1.8 V A-CS650//A-CS650 quasi-solid-state supercapacitor, for the first time, is constructed, which displays an outstanding energy density of 22.6 Wh kg−1, greatly exceeding the value in PVA/KOH electrolyte (7.3 Wh kg−1).

As a well-documented metal-free semiconductor, polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) has been widely used and intensively investigated for photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction, owing to its physicochemical stability, visible-light response, and facile synthesis. However, PCN as a photocatalyst still suffers from the fast recombination of electron-hole pairs and poor water redox reaction kinetics, greatly restricting its activity for artificial photosynthesis. Among the various modification approaches developed so far, decorating PCN with metals in different existences of nanoparticles, single atoms and molecular complexes, has been evidently very effective to overcome these limitations to improve photocatalytic performances. In this Review article, a systematic introduction to the state-of-the-art metal/PCN photocatalyst systems is given, with metals in versatility of nanoparticles, single atoms, and molecular complexes. Then, the recent processes of the metal/PCN photocatalyst systems in the applications of artificial photosynthesis, e.g., water splitting and CO2 reduction, are reviewed. Finally, the remaining challenges and opportunities for the development of high efficiency metal/PCN photocatalyst systems are presented and prospected. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Here, a multi-isotope approach is developed to distinguish C, N and S sources and the associated geochemical processes in a coastal aquifer system of the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China. The PRD is characterized as a typical multilayer groundwater system with a reducing environment in the confined aquifers and an oxidizing environment in the unconfined aquifer. For the groundwater samples from the unconfined aquifer, the δ15N values showed that the ammonium and nitrate originated from manure and sewage, the δ13C-DIC indicated that dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) was mainly derived from soil CO2 and weathering of carbonate rocks, and the δ34S and δ18O signals of sulfate suggested that SO4 2− originated from the dissolution of continental evaporate. The oxidizing environment and the positive relationship between δ15N-NO3 − and δ18O-NO3 − suggested that nitrification and denitrification were the key factors influencing the transformation of nitrogen in the unconfined aquifer. No obvious correlation between C, N and S content and isotopic composition suggested C-N-S was loosely coupled in this aquifer. For the groundwater samples in the confined aquifers, the δD-H2O and δ18O-H2O signals suggested that partially confined groundwater samples were affected by seawater intrusion. In the non-seawater intrusion region (NSI zone), the C, N and S content combined with C, N and S isotopic composition indicated that ammonium was derived from the mineralization of organic matter, sulfate mainly originated from rock weathering, and DIC mainly originated from carbonate mineral dissolution and the CO2 produced by organic matter mineralization. Extremely high CH4 concentrations suggested the existence of methanogenesis, while the molar ratio of CH4/(CH4 + (1 + α) × CO2) indicated that both acetate fermentation and CO2 reduction were ubiquitous. CO2 reduction had a stronger isotopic fractionation effect on the δ13C-DIC values, thus, the relatively high δ13C-DIC values were observed. The electron acceptor was the key factor for organic matter mineralization, and CO2 acted as the main electron acceptor in the NSI Zone. Accordingly, acetate fermentation and CO2 reduction became the key factors driving ammonium release in the NSI zone. In the seawater intrusion region (SI zone), ammonium was derived from the mineralization of organic matter, sulfate was derived from the mixing of fresh water and seawater, and DIC was derived from carbonate mineral dissolution, seawater and the CO2 produced by organic matter mineralization. The δ34S-SO4 2− showed a positive correlation with δ18O-SO4 2− and a negative correlation with SO4 2−, suggesting the existence of bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR). High CH4 concentrations also suggested the existence of methanogenesis. The CH4/(CH4 + (1 + α) × CO2) ratios indicated that CO2 reduction existed in more than half of the confined groundwater samples in the SI zone. C-N-S was highly coupled in this region because both BSR and methanogenesis can increase the DIC content, while BSR enriches lighter carbon isotopes and methanogenesis enriches heavier carbon isotopes; thus, a wide range of δ13C-DIC values was found in SI zone. Sulfate or both sulfate and CO2 were the electron acceptors. Accordingly, acetate fermentation, sulfur reduction and CO2 reduction worked together to promote ammonium release for the groundwater samples in the SI Zone. However, the exhaustion of sulfate will make CO2 reduction the key factor for organic matter mineralization in the future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","C-N-S cycling; Coastal aquifer; Multi-isotope; Organic matter; Redox process","Aquifers; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbonate minerals; Carbonation; Decay (organic); Dissolution; Fermentation; Fertilizers; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Isotopes; Mineralogy; Molar concentration; Molar ratio; Nitrogen; Organic compounds; Salt water intrusion; Seawater; Sewage; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; Weathering; Bacterial sulfate reduction; Coastal aquifers; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Isotopic fractionations; Nitrification and denitrification; Organic matter decomposition; Organic matter mineralization; Redox process; Hydrochemistry; carbon cycle; carbon isotope; coastal aquifer; geochemistry; isotopic analysis; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen isotope; organic matter; redox conditions; sulfur cycle; sulfur isotope; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067261943

The BVG released by commercial 18650 LIBs with Lix(Ni0.80Co0.15Al0.05)O2 (NCA) and LixFePO4 (LFP) cathodes during external heating abuse was used to study its flammability characteristics at diferent state of charge (SOC). Flammability characteristics included the upper flammability limit (UFL), lower flammability limit (LFL), flammability range (RF), flammability hazard index (HF), LIB fire safety threshold (SOCF), and diluent ratio threshold (DRF). Effects of external carbon dioxide (CO2) on the flammability characteristics of the BVG were also studied. The results show that the UFL and LFL curves of the BVG form a peninsula shape for both types of batteries as the SOC decreases, with RF being essentially unchanged first and then decreased dramatically. For the LFP battery, the LFL of the BVG is higher, and the RF is lower, resulting in obviously lower HF than those of the NCA battery at the same SOC. Using CO2 dilution can significantly reduce the BVG flammability and extend the SOCF. At the same SOC, the DRF is obviously lower for LFP LIBs than the NCA type. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Battery vent gas; Flammability characteristics; Lithium-ion batteries; Thermal runaway","Aluminum compounds; Carbon dioxide; Charging (batteries); Flammability; Ions; Iron compounds; Lithium compounds; Nickel compounds; Vents; External heating; Flammability characteristics; Flammability hazards; Lower flammability limits; State of charge; Thermal runaways; Upper flammability limits; Vent gas; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065905952

However, their yield is far from the clinical requirement up to now. In this study, the production of hirudin variant 3 (HV3) was successfully realized by cultivating the recombinant Pichia pastoris GS115/pPIC9K-hv3 under the regulation of the promoter of AOX1 encoding alcohol oxidase (AOX). The antithrombin activity in the fermentation broth reached the maximum value of 5000 ATU/mL. To explore an effective strategy for improving HV3 production in the future, we investigated the influence of methanol assimilation on the general gene expression in this recombinant by transcriptomic study. The results showed that methanol was partially oxidized into CO2, and the rest was converted into glycerone-P which subsequently entered into central carbon metabolism, energy metabolism, and amino acid biosynthesis. However, the later metabolic processes were almost all down-regulated. Therefore, we propose that the up-regulated central carbon metabolism, energy, and amino acid metabolism should be beneficial for methanol assimilation, which would accordingly improve the production of HV3. © 2019 by the authors.

Reducing carbon intensity is an inevitable choice for tackling climate change and promoting sustainable development. China has made some emission reduction commitments in the international community to promote the decoupling of China's economic development from carbon emissions. The realization of the industrial structure from the ""single-wheel drive"" of the manufacturing to the ""two-wheel drive"" economic development model of the service industry and the manufacturing has become a key measure to achieve China's economic intensive development. According to resource misallocation situation in different regions, this paper explored the impact of the collaborative agglomeration between producer services and manufacturing (hereinafter referred to as industrial co-agglomeration) on carbon intensity. The research results show that the carbon intensity is decreasing year by year, and the degree of intensification of China's economic growth continues to increase. Moreover, the effect of industrial co-agglomeration to promote carbon emission reduction is significantly limited by the degree of misallocated resources, and there is a double threshold effect. Specifically, in areas where resource allocation is reasonable, industrial co-agglomeration can produce significant agglomeration effects and promote carbon intensity reduction. Once the degree of misallocated resources exceeds a threshold level, the agglomeration effect will turn into a crowding effect, resulting in an inability to reduce carbon intensity. We comprehensively analyzed the driving factors for reducing carbon intensity and proposed policy pathways for achieving China's carbon intensity target. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon intensity; China; Industrial co-agglomeration; Resource misallocation; Threshold model","agglomeration; carbon emission; climate change; economic development; economic growth; emission control; environmental economics; industrial structure; manufacturing; model; resource allocation; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070361941

The manufacturer considers carbon emission reduction and has fairness concern behavior. The retailer provides sales service in the traditional channel and considers fairness concern behavior. The objective of this paper is to analyze the effects of different parameter values on the price stability and utility of the supply chain system emphatically using 2D bifurcation diagram, parameter plot basin, the basins of attraction, chaos attractor and sensitivity to the initial value, etc. The results find that the retailer’s fairness concern behavior shrinks the stability of the supply chain system more than that of the manufacturer’s fairness concern behavior. The system stability region decreases with the increase of carbon emission reduction level and the retailer’s fairness concern. The customers’ preference for the direct channel decreases the stable range of the direct channel, while it enlarges the stable range of the traditional channel. The supply chain system enters into chaos through flip bifurcation with the increase of price adjustment speed. In a stable state, the manufacture improving customer’s preference for the direct channel and the retailer choosing the appropriate fairness concern level can achieve the maximum utility separately. In a chaotic state, the average utilities of the manufacturer and retailer all decline, while that of the retailer declines even more. By selecting appropriate control parameter, the low-carbon dual-channel supply chain system can return to a stable state from chaos again.

The dynamics of soil water content (θ) in the top surface layer, regulated by local climate, predominates the surface energy exchange and ET behavior. In this study, we proposed a novel ET-θ relation using a physically based wet patch radius coupling the near surface turbulent transfer and soil water availability. The model is tested against the dataset from eddy covariance (EC) sites in the AmeriFlux network. The results show that ET rate is supply-driven under low soil moisture conditions since the plant controls the transpiration rate to conserve water due to water stress. While in energylimited condition, increasing soil moisture will not promote ET rate as it is bounded by the lower atmospheric demand. The proposed method is practically designed to calculate ET using variables readily measured by standard EC towers such as soil moisture and meteorological measurements. The method can also potentially be extended to predict the spatial and physical patterns of ecosystem services under different hydroclimatic conditions. © IWA Publishing 2019.","Ameriflux towers; Evapotranspiration; Land-atmosphere interactions; Soil moisture; Vegetated surfaces; Wet patches","Ecosystems; Evapotranspiration; Soil conservation; AmeriFlux; Hydroclimatic conditions; Hydrological cycles; Land atmosphere interaction; Meteorological measurements; Moisture conditions; Soil water availability; Wet patches; Soil moisture; data set; ecosystem service; eddy covariance; evapotranspiration; hydrological cycle; soil moisture; surface energy; transpiration; water content",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069673011

However, limited literature discusses the role of the CCER scheme. To explore to what extent will the CCER scheme save cost for China's carbon trading system, this paper establishes a two-level decision sub-game led by the national government and compares the cost-saving effect before and after introducing the CCER scheme. The empirical results from China confirm the cost-saving effect of the CCER scheme while achieving the homogeneity and equivalence of carbon emission quotas and CCER quotas are the prerequisite for the minimum national aggregate costs. The equilibrium CCER trading price is linked to three factors, including the offset rate of CCER quotas, the total carbon emission quotas and the reciprocal of the declaration cost coefficient. Depending on the actual situation in China, the ceiling offset rate of CCER quotas should not exceed 6%. Even so, the national government still needs to clarify the potential provinces and direction of CCER projects to ensure that the actual offset rate could be as close as possible to the optimal value. These findings can provide guidance for policy makers in the design of the national carbon trading system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Abatement costs; Chinese certified emission reduction scheme; Declaration costs; Emissions trading scheme; Offset rate","carbon; abatement cost; carbon emission; cost analysis; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; Article; carbon footprint; carbon sink; China; Chinese; comparative study; cost control; developing country; government; hydropower; renewable energy; wind power; certification; commercial phenomena; cost; China; Carbon; Certification; China; Commerce; Costs and Cost Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065740899

This study focuses on these three metropolitan regions and tries to estimate and analyze the structure and influencing factors of CO2 emissions from transport sector, including passenger and freight transport, simultaneously covering road, rail, and water transport. The results suggest that in the period of 2000–2013, the CO2 emissions from transport sector increased from 27.8 to 198.8 Mt in JJJ, from 29.7 to 163.5 Mt in YRD, and from 13.1 to 74.0 Mt in PRD. Comparatively speaking, JJJ had the highest CO2 emission intensity of freight and urban passenger transport as well as highest transport CO2 emissions per capita and per unit GDP, while PRD had the highest transport CO2 emissions per hectare. The main challenge of reducing CO2 emissions from transport sector in these regions stemmed from freight transport and road transport. Based on decomposition analysis, economic welfare was the most important driving force of the CO2 emissions growth in all three regions, followed by transport type mix, transport dependence and modal energy intensities. In the future, low-carbon transport strategies about controlling the growth of transport demand, adjusting the transport modal structure and improving the modal energy efficiency and fuel emission efficiency are needed in all three regions, and each region should have slightly different focus. The JJJ region needs to emphasize adjusting transport modal structure, the YRD region needs to emphasize improving modal energy efficiency, and the PRD region needs to focus more on controlling the growth of transport dependence. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","China; CO2 emissions; Decomposition; Estimation; Metropolitan region; Transport","Carbon dioxide; Decomposition; Energy efficiency; Estimation; Modal analysis; Roads and streets; Urban transportation; China; CO2 emissions; Decomposition analysis; Low carbon transport; Metropolitan regions; Passenger transport; Reducing co2 emissions; Transport; Freight transportation; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; estimation method; metropolitan area; traffic emission; urban transport; China; Guangdong; Jingjinji; Yangtze Delta; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031910946

However, the SOA formation process from OS-related precursors remains poorly understood. In this work, a newly developed oxidation flow reactor (OFR), the Environment and Climate Change Canada OFR (ECCC-OFR), was characterized and used to study the yields and composition of SOA formed from OH oxidation of α-pinene, selected alkanes, and the vapors evolved from five OS-related samples (OS ore, naphtha, tailings pond water, bitumen, and dilbit). The derived SOA yields from α-pinene and selected alkanes using the ECCC-OFR were in good agreement with those of traditional smog chamber experiments but significantly higher than those of other OFR studies under similar conditions. The results also suggest that gas-phase reactions leading to fragmentation (i.e., C-C bond cleavage) have a relatively small impact on the SOA yields in the ECCC-OFR at high photochemical ages, in contrast to other previously reported OFR results. Translating the impact of fragmentation reactions in the ECCC-OFR to ambient atmospheric conditions reduces its impact on SOA formation even further. These results highlight the importance of careful evaluation of OFR data, particularly when using such data to provide empirical factors for the fragmentation process in models. Application of the ECCC-OFR to OS-related precursor mixtures demonstrated that the SOA yields from OS ore and bitumen vapors (maximum of α 0:6-0.7) are significantly higher than those from the vapors from solvent use (naphtha), effluent from OS processing (tailings pond water), and from the solvent diluted bitumen (dilbit; maximum of α 0:2-0.3), likely due to the volatility of each precursor mixture. A comparison of the yields and elemental ratios (H=C and O=C) of the SOA from the OS-related precursors to those of linear and cyclic alkane precursors of similar carbon numbers suggests that cyclic alkanes play an important role in the SOA formation in the OS. The analysis further indicates that the majority of the SOA formed downwind of OS facilities is derived from open-pit mining operations (i.e., OS ore evaporative emissions) rather than from higher-volatility precursors from solvent use during processing and/or tailings management. The current results have implications for improving the regional modeling of SOA from OS sources, for the potential mitigation of OS precursor emissions responsible for observed SOA downwind of OS operations, and for the understanding of petrochemical-and alkane-derived SOA in general. © 2019 Author(s).",,"aerosol; alkane; bioreactor; bitumen; fragmentation; hydroxide; oil sand; oxidation; Alberta; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073889093

Spanning China's 11th-13th Five-Year Plans (2006–2020), chemical oxygen demand and ammonia nitrogen emissions have been the key pollutants that require monitoring for waste water pollution management. To fit well into one of the focus areas under China's government policy direction, the main objectives of this study are to measure input- and output-based technological progress and their determinants for 30 provinces and regions in China from 1999 to 2015. A green-biased technological progress model based on the directional distance function is adopted in this study. The results reveal that sustainable growth in total factor productivity was primarily due to green-biased technological progress. Most provinces and regions in China overused water resources for industrial production, as demonstrated by the high water consumption over the study period, while output-biased technological progress exacerbated the discharge of water pollutants before the implementation of China's 11th Five-Year Plan (2006–2010). Technological progress in the eastern region was more likely to promote industrial growth, while progress in the central and western regions was likely to promote increased pollutant emissions. Furthermore, industrial research and development investment, governance of waste water treatment investment, the educational level of the labour force, and water prices contributed significantly to biased technological progress in China over the study period. Overall, this study has important policy implications and can provide guidance for emissions reductions to promote cleaner production and optimise resource allocation in China's industrial sector. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biased technological progress; Directional distance function; Green total factor productivity growth","Ammonia; Chemical oxygen demand; Economics; Industrial emissions; Industrial research; Industrial waste treatment; Investments; Pollution control; Productivity; Public policy; Research and development management; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Directional distance function; Emissions reduction; Environmentally-friendly technology; Industrial production; Policy implications; Research and development; Technological progress; Total factor productivity; Industrial water treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065890214

Since the 1980s, climate has been warming on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) at a rate higher than North Hemisphere average. Anthropogenic activities, including grazing, farming, and urbanization, are also influencing the alpine ecosystem on the TP. Especially, an ensemble of large engineering projects, such as power transported from west to east by State Grid, has been in operation on the TP. While studies disentangling effects of climate and anthropogenic activities interference are still lacking for the forest ecosystems on the TP. The overarching objectives of this study were to separate effects of natural climates and human interferences on forest ecosystem dynamics on the TP. Methods: We compared vegetation activities of two typical natural reserves (Gongbu natural reserve, GNR, and Yarlung zangbo river grand canyon natural reserve, YNR) and their surroundings in southeastern Tibet (outside of the natural reserves, ONR) using long-term satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset. Linear regression and partial correlation analyses were constructed for the relationship between vegetation activity and climates to evaluate the distinct climate effects on the two natural reserves. Important Findings: The two natural reserves were established at different time, which were related to anthropogenic activities impact durations. The results showed that the annual mean NDVI fluctuated between 0.5 and 0.6 in the relatively longer reserved YNR, which was remarkably higher than those in other regions (with NDVI lower than 0.45). The vegetation vigor in the YNR showed neither a significant temporal trend nor significant relationship with climate. Nevertheless, vegetation vigor exhibited a significant increasing trend during the last three decades (0.012/decade) at the GNR. The inter-decadal analysis turned out positive relationships between vegetation vigor and annual temperature since late 1990s until early 2000s when the GNR was officially established. This study underlined the importance of considering human interference duration when assessing the relationships between vegetation dynamics and climates. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

However, few studies have been conducted on HRG in mixed urban water provision schemes under tropical climatic conditions. Thus, this study evaluates and compares the environmental and economic impacts of a centralised mains water system (MWS) against a decentralised RWH, GWR and HRG at a domestic and commercial building using life-cycle assessment (LCA) and life-cycle cost (LCC) analysis under tropical climatic conditions. A functional unit (FU) of 1 m3 of non-potable toilet flushing and irrigation water for a project lifespan of 50 years was used. Results indicate that CML 2001 and TRACI 2.1 methods produce similar results. LCA and LCC indicate that the optimal systems are the commercial HRG and domestic RWH. The commercial HRG has the highest mains water savings (55.3%), lowest environmental impact scores for seven categories, and is the second fastest system to become financially attractive at USD5.20/m3. Similarly, the domestic RWH has the second highest mains water savings (95.3%), lowest environmental impact scores relative to a MWS for seven impact categories, and is the first system to become financially attractive at USD2.00/m3. Sensitivity analysis revealed that global warming, water stress index, and eutrophication are most sensitive to a ∓20% variation in GW and RW energy intensity values at commercial and domestic buildings, respectively. The financial viability of decentralised RWH, GWR, and HRG systems increase with increasing discount rate and mains water tariff, as well as decreasing electricity tariff and installation factor. Financial incentives and subsidy schemes from the Malaysian government may promote uptake of decentralised water systems for mixed urban water provision, as none of the systems were financially attractive otherwise at a discount rate of 6% for 50 years. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cost analysis; Decentralised system; Environmental impact; Urban water; Water recycling and reuse","Cost accounting; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Global warming; Housing; Irrigation; Life cycle; Office buildings; Potable water; Rain; Sensitivity analysis; Tropics; Wastewater reclamation; Water conservation; Waterworks; Cost analysis; Decentralised systems; Environmental and economic impacts; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle cost analysis; Malaysian governments; Urban waters; Water stress indices; Water recycling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065651321

In accordance with the Low Carbon Green Growth strategy where the rise of social awareness for energy savings is imminent, various scenarios were considered including CHP-DH (excluding waste heat recovery) versus SHP and CHP-DH (including waste heat recovery) versus SHP. To analyze the satisfaction on energy efficiency of each heating system, nationwide average field data were acquired via a survey with the help of the Korea District Heating Corporation (KDHC), and a comprehensive model for measuring sustainable value related to energy consumption, including economic (ECON), non-economic (NECON), and environmental (ENV) values were presented based on customer satisfaction (SAT). As a result of the structural equation model (SEM) and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, variations of energy efficiencies of each heat and power delivery system are rather distinctive among different scenarios due to the performance characteristics of each system in the field. The energy savings of CHP-DH systems owned by KDHC, based on nationwide average performance, was found to be higher than the SHP system by 3.25% to 18.1%. While the effect of NECON and ENV on SAT was not significant in SHP, it was significant in CHP-DH. Based on these results, rational decisions can be made to lead the government and energy consumers to maximize energy efficiency, especially in South Korea, where the energy market heavily relies on foreign countries. © 2019 by the authors.","Combined heat and power; Consumer sustainability; District heating; Energy efficiency; Heating system; Separate heat and power","combined heat and power; demand analysis; energy efficiency; energy market; environmental values; fuel consumption; heating; least squares method; performance assessment; scenario analysis; sustainability; South Korea; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070452055

Climate resilient road infrastructure in rural areas is critical for improving quality of live. For this reason, a geospatial risk and vulnerability assessment method was developed as a tool for determining where access roads, and the communities they serve, are most at risk to the effects of a changing climate. This is intended to help guide, through prioritisation, the identification of high-risk areas where appropriate climate adaptation measures would be most effective in reducing the impacts of climate variability and change. The research methodology relies on using GIS processes and spatial data to calculate a composite climate risk index, the combined output of a hazard exposure index as well as a road criticality index. The analysis methodology was applied to Mozambique, where large parts of the country were found to be at very high risk to change in terms of rural accessibility given the countries high and recurrent exposure to extreme floods. Downscaled climate simulations for a 2050 future under a low mitigation scenario indicated that pronounced increases in rainfall and cyclone activity are plausible in northern Mozambique, whilst the southern region may become hotter and drier. Prioritisation is thus crucial for more effective and efficient asset management. The methodology was found to be an efficient and effective way of identifying high-risk regions in terms of community access and the physical impact of climate on road infrastructure. © 2019",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067960034

Objectives: To study the relationships between low birth weight (LBW, <2500 g), residential greenness, and the potential influence of air pollution in these relationships (interaction and mediation) in California, over the period 2001–2008. Methods: Residential greenness around maternal homes was characterized using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Complementary indicators of air pollution exposure reflected its main components. Birth weight and maternal characteristics were obtained from birth certificate records. In this case-cohort study, associations between greenness and LBW were investigated using multi-level Poisson regression with random effect at the hospital level. We investigated potential interaction of greenness and air pollutants on both additive and multiplicative scales. Mediation analyses were conducted to estimate the potential contribution of local variations in air pollutant concentrations associated with greenness on LBW risk. Results: In total 72,632 LBW cases were included. A reduction of LBW risk was associated with an increase in NDVI (adjusted risk ratio per inter-quartile range in NDVI: 0.963; 95% confidence interval: 0.947; 0.978). We observed no interaction between NDVI and air pollution on LBW risk. The estimated mediating effect of fine particulate matter in the impact of greenness on LBW was 12%. Conclusion: This large study confirms that residential greenness is associated with a reduced risk of LBW and suggests that greenness might benefit to LBW partly through a local reduction in air pollution. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; Birth weight; Greenness; Interaction; Mediation","atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); greenspace; health risk; NDVI; particulate matter; pollution exposure; adolescent; adult; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; birth certificate; birth weight; California; cohort analysis; female; human; infant; low birth weight; major clinical study; middle aged; particulate matter; priority journal; young adult; adverse event; newborn; California; United States; Air Pollution; California; Cohort Studies; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065707099

Using exploratory research design and longitudinal observations, this research investigates how urban stakeholders and policy entrepreneurs negotiate institutional architecture and pathways for sustaining climate change adaptation and resilience implementation. This paper introduces hybrid institutionalism as a framework to understand how city administrators, local policy makers, and policy advocates navigate complex institutional landscapes that are characterised by volatility and uncertainties. Grounded in the experience from a recent experiment in Indonesia, this research suggests that institutionalisation of adaptation and resilience agenda involves different forms of institutionalisation and institutionalism through time. Future continuity of adaptation to climate change action depends on the dynamic nature of the institutionalism that leads to uncertainty in mainstreaming risk reduction. However, this research found that pathway-dependency theory emerges as a better predictor for institutionalising climate change adaptation and resilience in Indonesia. © 2019 by the author.","ACCCRN; Climate change adaptation; Hybrid institutionalism; Institutionalising adaptation; Mainstreaming resilience; Urban resilience and adaptation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071325053

This study investigated the factors influencing the choice of a particular adaptation strategy by cassava and yam farmers in Kwara State, Nigeria. Primary data used for the study were obtained using a multi stage sampling technique. A structured questionnaire was administered to a sample of 150 randomly selected cassava and yam farmers in 12 villages in the study area. Descriptive statistics, a logit model, and the STATA computer program were used to analyze the data. The results showed that farmers have adopted diverse strategies such as changing planting dates, planting early maturing varieties and drought-tolerant varieties to deal with the impact of climate change. The results of the binary logit analysis showed that age of household head, household size, level of formal education, farm size, amount of rainfall, length of rainy season, awareness of climate change, member of farmers association, access to weather information, access to credit facilities, and number of strategies used, influenced the choice of at least two adaptation strategies. The study, therefore, recommended that government policies should be geared toward creating revenue-generating channels, strengthening the institutions that provide access to farm credit, making improved seed readily available, and providing extension services. © 2019 Kasetsart University.","Adaptation strategies; Cassava farmers; Climate change; Logit regression; Yam farmers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073281795

We study climate change effects on the triple bottom line of ecological productivity, fishers’ incomes, and fish consumption for an artisanal open-access fishery. We develop and apply an empirical, stochastic bio-economic model for the Senegalese artisanal purse seine fishery on small pelagic fish and compare the simulated fishery’s development using four climate projections and two policy scenarios. We find that economic processes of adaptation may amplify the effects of climate variations. The regions’ catch potential increases with climate change, induced by stock distribution changes. However, this outcome escalates over-fishing, whose effects outpace the incipiently favorable climate change effects under three of the four climate projections. Without policy action, the fishery is estimated to collapse in 2030–2035 on average over 1000 runs. We propose an easily implementable and overall welfare-increasing intervention: reduction of fuel subsidies. If fuel subsidies were abolished, ecological sustainability as well as the fishery’s welfare contribution would increase regardless of the climate projection. © 2019 Lancker et al.

This leads to high cooling requirements in cities, while also presenting the opportunity to reuse such waste heat in order to provide low-carbon heating for buildings and processes. Among the many potential energy sources that could be exploited in urban areas, underground railway tunnels are particularly attractive, as the operation of the trains produce considerable amounts of heat throughout the year. This paper reviews how secondary energy sources in urban areas can be integrated into heating and cooling networks, with emphasis on underground rail tunnels. This involves investigating potential urban waste heat sources and the existing state-of-the-art technologies that could be applied to efficiently recover this secondary energy, as well as analyzing how district heating and cooling networks have been a key mechanism to allow for a smooth transition from current fossil fuel based to future low-carbon energy sources. © 2019 by the authors.","District energy; Heat networks; Heat pumps; London Underground; Low-carbon heating; Railway tunnels; Waste heat recovery",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070917392

Reforestation is an important tool for sequestering carbon, so we sought to determine how replanted native trees responded to weather, soil conditions and planting characteristics. We measured girth growth of 13 tree species in 19 native mixed-species plantings and one remnant in south-eastern Australia, bimonthly from 2011 to 2016; replantings ranged between 6 and 46 years at the commencement of measurements. Band dendrometers (flexible bands that record changes in girth) were used to measure growth, with 34 measurements per tree taken over 5 years. We used outcomes from models with several plausible weather future scenarios (Dry, Wet, Wet-to-Dry and Average) for 25 and 50 years for tree girth, and 25 years for carbon accumulation, into the future. Woody species richness enhanced girth growth of all tree species. Higher maximum temperatures and reduced rainfall, which generally are predicted for the region over coming decades, retarded growth of nine tree species. Planting tree density had no discernible association with growth for the range of planting densities used. The most and least carbon were sequestered in Wet and Dry projections, respectively. Three Acacia spp. (N-fixers) grew slowest and would sequester least carbon, while four species of Eucalyptus grew fastest. These measurements of growth provide critical information for land managers to guide choice in replanting strategies for carbon storage. © 2019 Ecological Society of Australia","band dendrometers; carbon sequestration; climate change; reforestation; revegetation","carbon sequestration; climate change; greenhouse gas; growth; native species; reforestation; revegetation; species richness; tree; Acacia; Eucalyptus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064519705

The simulations utilize open-source software tools for estimation of second-by-second energy and/or fuel consumption in more than 65 thousand real-world recorded trips in the California household travel survey (CHTS) data set. Statistical distributions of the equivalent well-to-wheels (W2W) GHG emissions corresponding to CHTS trips are generated for three baseline public-domain plug-in vehicle models of: (i) parallel-drive plug-in hybrid, (ii) serial-drive plug-in hybrid, and (iii) pure electric vehicle. In addition to the baseline models, several derived vehicle models are created by upsizing of the battery and powertrain via an iterative procedure to attain the new all-electric range (AER). The emissions model also considers days when a pure electric vehicle cannot meet the travel demand by assuming that the driving on those days is done on a conventional vehicle. For each of the considered powertrain architectures, optimizing the AER for minimum GHG emissions becomes a trade-off between reducing the gasoline driven miles and maintaining reasonably sized (lightweight) powertrain components. As such, the equivalent GHG emissions of a vehicle are shown to have diminishing returns in terms of AER, and the optimum AER depends on both the carbon content in the electric grid, as well as the charging behavior. Within considered modeling assumptions and several vehicle usage conditions, the optimum AER is estimated to be between 30 and 60 miles for PHEVs, and between 120 and 200 miles for BEVs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","California household travel survey; Electric vehicle range; Greenhouse gas reduction; Plug-in vehicles","Computer aided software engineering; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Economics; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Motor transportation; Open source software; Open systems; Powertrains; Surveys; Vehicle-to-grid; Greenhouse gas reductions; Household travel surveys; Model and simulation; Plug-in vehicles; Powertrain components; Pure electric vehicles; Real-world drivings; Statistical distribution; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; carbon emission; computer simulation; electric vehicle; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; household survey; optimization; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066457825

According to the latest ranking published by the World Health Organization (WHO), there are 36 Polish urban centres among 50 European cities with the highest concentration of PM2.5 particulate matter. In order to improve the situation, corrective and preventive actions can be taken. The first of these mainly include the shift towards more ecological fuels and increasing the biologically active area. The second group includes, among others optimizing existing planning documents. From the point of view of the location of buildings, in particular industrial plants, the most favourable are the highest areas, where the dust generated as a result of fuel combustion can be dispersed much faster. Unfortunately, the applicable provisions of Polish law do not impose an obligation to include terrain elevation in spatial planning. The growing problem of smog has stimulated the analysis of planning documents for selected Polish cities from the list published by the WHO taking DTM into consideration. First of all, on the basis of DTM, three zones (unfavourable, advantageous and very favourable) were determined for each of the test areas from the point of view of the location of buildings. Then an index was established, which was called the Elevation Planning Potential that allows to determine whether and to what extent there are possibilities to make beneficial changes from the point of view of air quality in planning documents taking into account the terrain shape. It takes into consideration both information from DTM and data determined on the basis of urban planning documents covering the existing development and land-use as well as planned spatial development directions. The solutions developed can significantly improve the air quality in cities by optimizing the location of new buildings.

These threats may cause substantial shifts in species diversity and abundance and considerably affect the carbon and water balance of ecosystems. The synergistic effects between those two threats, however, can be complex and are poorly understood. Here, we experimentally investigated the effects of nitrogen addition and extreme drought (separately and in combination) on a seminatural temperate grassland, located in Freiburg (South Germany). To study the grassland response, we combined eddy-covariance techniques with open gas exchange systems. Open gas exchange chambers were connected to an infrared gas analyzer and water isotope spectrometer, which allowed the partitioning of net ecosystem exchange and evapotranspiration. Vegetation parameters were described by species richness, species abundance, and leaf area index. Our results suggest that grassland communities, strongly weakened in their stress response by nitrogen loading, can substantially lose their carbon sink function during drought. While nitrogen addition caused a significant loss in forb species (−25%), precipitation reduction promoted a strong dominance of grass species at season start. Consequently, the grass-dominated and species-poor community suffered from a strong above-ground dieback during the dry summer months, likely caused by lower water use efficiency and weaker drought adaptations of the species community. Over the growing season (April-September), the carbon sequestration of the studied grassland was reduced by more than 60% as a consequence of nitrogen addition. Nitrogen addition in combination with precipitation reduction decreased carbon sequestration by 73%. Eutrophication can severely threaten the resilient functioning of grasslands, in particular when drought periods will increase as predicted by future climate scenarios. Our findings emphasize the importance of preserving high diversity of grasslands to strengthen their resistance against extreme events such as droughts. © Copyright © 2019 Kübert, Götz, Kuester, Piayda, Werner, Rothfuss and Dubbert.","ecosystem fluxes; extreme drought; grassland; nitrogen loading; partitioning; stress response; synergistic effects; water use efficiency",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072740444

The thickness of θ′ phase is chosen to be constant of 2.2 nm and the diameter is varied in range from 3 to 10 nm. It is shown that first interactions of dislocation with θ′ phase occur according to the mechanism of Orowan loop formation around the obstacle. In this case, the cross-slip processes, the formation of dislocation jogs in adjacent slip plane and the emission of vacancies upon the return of a segment to the initial slip plane are possible. During these interactions, the material of θ′ phase is subjected to high shear stresses up to 3 GPa in a layer of 2 nm thickness. Such a high stress leads to a θ′ phase cutting on the third or fourth overcoming of the obstacle by dislocation. A study is carried out of the dependence of the average stress in the system on the size of inclusion and the distance between inclusions. It is shown that an increase in the diameter of inclusion causes an increase in the average stresses in the system in proportion close to the square root of the diameter of the inclusion. Increasing the distance between inclusions causes the inversely proportional reduction of the average stress. The conducted investigation of the strain rate sensitivity showed that in the case of high shear rates, the average stresses in the system continuously increase that does not allow applying the time averaging procedure to them. The described effect is also registered in the case of pure aluminum. The existence of two regions on the temperature dependence of the average stresses in the system on the strain rate in the case of θ′ phase, previously described by Yanilkin et al. (2014) for the Guinier-Prestone zones, is confirmed. In the case of high strain rates, heating of the system leads to a decrease in the dislocation velocity, while at low strain rates the dislocation velocity increases with increasing temperature at a fixed shear rate. An interesting result obtained with long-term molecular-dynamics simulations when the tracing time is up to 2 ns, there is a tendency to reduce the average stress in the system through time. This result can be explained by destruction of the structure and form of θ' phase. The law of motion of a dislocation in the approximation of the constancy of θ′ phase properties is proposed to describe the response of the system to shear deformation. The model contains a dislocation mass, phonon friction, and takes into account the effect of the inclusion of θ' phase through an increase in the elastic energy of a dislocation during the formation of the Orowan loop around an obstacle. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.","Aluminum; Continuum modeling; Dislocation; Molecular-dynamics simulation; θ′ phase","Aluminum; Continuum mechanics; Dislocations (crystals); Edge dislocations; Molecular dynamics; Shear deformation; Shear flow; Shear stress; Temperature distribution; Adjacent slip planes; Atomistic simulations; Continuum Modeling; Dislocation velocities; Increasing temperatures; Molecular dynamics simulations; Strain rate sensitivity; Temperature dependence; Strain rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062177876

Models of the atmospheric balance of CH4 are considered, key emission sources are estimated, and possibilities of forecasting of methane atmospheric concentrations using satellite observations are demonstrated. Partial refinement of the modeling approaches to assessment of emissions components is proposed based on the results of local observations. Models variables, which can be controlled using satellite tools, were determined. Key trends of methane atmospheric concentrations over Ukraine during the observation period have been determined on the base of analysis of SCIAMACHY/Envisat and AIRS & AMSU/Aqua satellites data in the context of observed climate changes. Basic spatial and temporal parameters of the distributions were assessed. Maps of the distributions are prepared and demonstrated. Calculated distributions have been coupled interpreted with data on the distribution of MODIS-generated vegetation and water spectral indices in the framework of constructed models of methane balance.

Due to the changes in climatic conditions, there is an increase not only in the consumption of heating energy but also cooling energy. Certain passive measures to be taken primarily for the building envelope are necessary in order to reduce energy consumption. Applying a phase-change material on the surface of a building envelope is one of the new approaches for controlling heat transfer through the building envelope during the cooling period. It is known that phase-change materials, which are also considered as modern versions of thermal mass concept, can reduce the of a building's heating and cooling energy consumption. In this study, a unit with 10m to 10m dimension with one external facade in a 3 storey building was evaluated in two cities, Istanbul and Diyarbakır, in temperate-humid and hot dry climatic regions. In order to reduce heating and cooling loads, a phase-change material was applied on the surface of the building envelope. The thickness of the phase-change material on the applied surface was increased at every step, and different building envelope alternatives were created. Heating and cooling energy consumptions were calculated for different orientations of the external facade. When calculated values are evaluated comparatively, it is seen that as the thickness of the phase-change material increases, the energy loads occurred in the unit decrease gradually. Equally, the performance of the phase-change materials varies depending on the orientation. Therefore, it is possible to determine the optimum thickness and orientation combination of the phase-change material application on a building envelope and reduce heating and cooling energy consumptions. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

Under the influence of anthropogenic factors including man-made (industry, energy, transport) and economic activities (construction, utilities, recreational load) in the environment, a number of environmental problems arise and develop, aggravated by unfavourable weather conditions for dispersion of harmful impurities in the air, which is especially important for Krasnoyarsk city. Biological monitoring is necessary to assess the environmental consequences of human impact, to ensure the necessary level of environmental quality and the environmental safety of the urban environment. Recently, researchers have been analysing the degree of impact of environmental factors through developmental sustainability (fluctuating asymmetry). This paper shows an assessment of the stability of the development of tree plantations growing in the zone of influence of an aluminium plant and heat and power engineering enterprises. For the study the most common tree species were selected, which are widely used for landscaping cities: apple berry, wild cherry, balsam poplar, elm squat. The representativeness of the data obtained is confirmed by appropriate statistical processing. Morphometric indicators of the lamina (j3, j4, j5) of apple and berry apple trees sensitive to negative environmental factors, intensified under the influence of emissions from an aluminum plant, are revealed. An identical response of indicator species belonging to the same family was found. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

However, previous studies using computable general equilibrium (CGE) models have analyzed climate policies without considering company size. This may have led to inaccurate results because the impacts of climate policy would differ depending on the coverage of regulated companies. Accordingly, this study examines the environmental and economic impacts of greenhouse gas emission reduction policies, assuming policy results vary by firm size, as covered by the Korean emission trading system. To this end, a CGE model with a separate social accounting matrix based on company size is used to compare three scenarios that reflect different types of carbon pricing methods. The results show that greenhouse gases will be reduced to a lower extent and utility will decrease more if mitigation policies are only imposed to large companies. Key policy insights Carbon pricing policies should consider the different impacts on companies of different sizes and industry sectors. Without considering the different sizes of companies covered by an ETS, the expected carbon price and its economic impact will be underestimated. Small and medium-sized companies will face more negative impacts than large companies in some industry sectors under an ETS, even if the mitigation burden is only faced by large companies. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Carbon tax; climate policy; computable general equilibrium; greenhouse gas emissions; SMEs","carbon emission; computable general equilibrium analysis; economic impact; emission control; emissions trading; environmental impact; firm size; greenhouse gas; pollution policy; pollution tax; small and medium-sized enterprise; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064618343

In this situation, energy saving and emission reduction of transportation industry is imperative. This paper studies the evaluation of the low carbon development level of urban transportation system. Based on the research of domestic and foreign literatures and the characteristics of Qingdao, the urban low-carbon traffic evaluation index system is constructed, including transportation infrastructure, transportation services, resources and environment, and transportation policies and regulations. There are 16 evaluation indicators. The entropy weight method is used to determine the weight value of the evaluation index, and then the gray correlation model is used for evaluation. Taking Qingdao as an example, the empirical analysis shows that in recent years, the low-carbon traffic level in Qingdao is constantly changing. At the same time, the correlation degree of each index is analyzed to find out the crux that hinders the development of low-carbon urban transportation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Petroleum prospecting; Comprehensive evaluation; Energy saving and emission reductions; Evaluation index system; Transportation industry; Transportation infrastructures; Transportation policies; Transportation services; Urban transportation systems; Urban transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071425115

However, it is unclear how cross acclimation may contribute to the combined effects of freezing and drought on plants at the community or ecosystem levels, given that cross acclimation can vary among species. We used intact plant-soil mesocosms from an old field to examine how spring freezing influences summer drought tolerance, assessed via the responses of major functional groups (graminoids, legumes and non-leguminous forbs)and total plant productivity. We applied 15N tracer to the mesocosms in either spring or summer, to assess effects on early/late season nitrogen retention. Freezing and drought affected both aboveground production and 15N retention significantly, but their effects were additive, which was inconsistent with cross acclimation. The aboveground biomass responses differed from this trend at the functional group level, with an apparent cross acclimation effect for legumes, multiplicative effects of freezing and drought for non-leguminous forbs, and no significant freezing or drought effects for graminoids. These results suggest that despite variation in cross acclimation among functional groups, possible competitive and compensatory interactions can dilute cross acclimation effects at the ecosystem level. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cross acclimation; Drought; Ecosystem; Freezing; Functional groups; Global change ecology; Nitrogen; Plant-climate interactions","aboveground biomass; aboveground production; acclimation; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; drought; freezing; functional group; global change; legume; mesocosm; nitrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065243158

Methane fluxes from rice soils are mediated by both methanogens and methanotrophs, while subject to fertilization regimes. A field experiment was conducted to investigate the response of CH4 emissions, with a close link to methanogenic and methanotrophic communities, to different fertilization strategies over two consecutive rice growing seasons in a paddy field. Four fertilized treatments were established consisting of chemical phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) fertilizer (PK), chemical nitrogen (N) PK fertilizer (NPK), chemical NPK combined with organic manure (NPKM), and organic manure alone (M). Results showed that, relative to chemical PK treatment without N fertilizer input, the application of chemical NPK fertilizer, manure, and their combination significantly increased seasonal mean CH4 emissions by 67.4, 20.4 and 101.2%, respectively. Methane fluxes were significantly and positively (r2 = 0.75) related to mcrA gene copy numbers and the ratio of mcrA/pmoA, while negatively (r2 = 0.40) related to pmoA gene copy numbers, which was mainly regulated by the dynamics of water irrigation regime. The abundance of mcrA and pmoA had trade-off relationship over the rice growing season. In comparison with PK fertilization, N fertilized treatments did not alter the seasonal trend of CH4 fluxes, but enhanced the source strength of CH4 emissions through increased mcrA abundances rather than reduced pmoA-dominated methanotrophic CH4 oxidation in rice paddies. In contrast, N fertilization showed no effect on pmoA abundance and associated methanotrophic community in rice paddies. Results highlight that, given the fertilizer-driven balance between methanogenic and methanotrophic communities, fertilization options with either chemical or organic N input stimulated CH4 emissions mainly through improving soil C substrate and methanogenic activities, especially under the combination of chemical and organic N fertilization in rice paddies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CH4; Long-term fertilization; Methanogen; Methanotroph; Rice paddies","Atmospheric chemistry; Economic and social effects; Genes; Global warming; Manures; Methane; Methanogens; Atmospheric methanes; Irrigation regimes; Long-term fertilization; Methane emissions; Methanogenic activity; Methanotrophs; Rice paddy; Trade-off relationship; Nitrogen fertilizers; emission; fertilizer application; global warming; growing season; methane; methanogenic bacterium; microbial activity; microbial community; paddy field",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064277255

This leads not only to a more comfortable climate during summer but also to a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from the vehicles themselves and to a reduction in the need for air conditioning (AC) and associated emissions. The current study examines to what extent a range of different mobility concepts, can lead to a reduction in urban heat island intensity and carbon dioxide emissions in the city of Beijing, China. For this purpose, the impact that electric vehicles fuelled with the average energy mix, hydrogen vehicles (HyVs) fuelled with hydrogen from electrolysis from the regular energy mix, HyVs fuelled with hydrogen produced through wind power, energy efficient CVs, EVs fuelled with wind power and energy efficient metro light railway (metro) travel have on summer heat island intensity (SHII) and CO2-emissions is analysed. The lowest SHII mitigation effect was found for a replacement of CVs with fuel efficient diesel cars while hydrogen cars that are fuelled with hydrogen generated from the average electricity mix even leads to higher SHII and higher CO2 emissions. The largest SHII mitigation effect was found for a scenario where conventional vehicles are replaced with energy efficient metro travel. The CO2 saving potential is highest for EVs which are powered with electricity generated from wind turbines, closely followed by HyVs that are fuelled with hydrogen generated from electrolysis of water using wind electricity.

The relevance of these omissions has not yet been comprehensively quantified in the literature. This paper aims to close this knowledge gap. Methods: The parameterized inventory models that underlie all publicly available grid mix datasets in the GaBi databases were configured to create 26 eGRID subregional LCIs based on data from EPA’s eGRID2014 database and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s FERC-714 report on power trade for the same reference year. Results were calculated regarding climate change, acidification, eutrophication, particulate matter, smog formation, and blue water consumption per kilowatt hour of electricity and compared for direct plant emissions only, the cradle-to-gate production mix (including scope 3), and the cradle-to-gate consumption mix (including scope 3 and power imports). Results and discussion: Results showed that the scope 3 burdens represent the most significant data gap if not accounted for. Specifically, the GWP results show median increases of around + 18% for GWP100 and of + 30% for GWP20 when scope 3 GHG emissions are added to the direct plant emissions. Other impact categories showed even larger increases when compared to direct plant emissions, with a maximum increase of + 573% in eutrophication potential for the subregion CAMX. While the median deviations of the consumption mixes compared to the production mixes are moderate, individual subregions show significant increases in environmental burdens for selected metrics. However, power trade seems less of an issue for the impact category of climate change as only the CAMX subregion shows an increase larger than 10% when power trade is accounted for. Conclusions: A cradle-to-gate production mix can be a suitable proxy of the environmental burdens of electricity consumed in many subregions, but it can also lead to significant errors for others depending on the environmental metric(s) one is trying to assess. Power plant emissions by themselves (scope 2) that exclude both scope 3 emissions and power trade cannot be recommended for use in any kind of carbon accounting or other environmental analysis because they suffer from severe data gaps and may skew the comparison of the environmental burdens associated with power consumption in the different subregions significantly. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon accounting; Electricity consumption; Life cycle inventory; Power trade; Scope 3 emissions","acidification; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; electricity; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; eutrophication; life cycle assessment; particulate matter; priority journal; smog; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057577927

Reducing the mass of on-highway passenger vehicles by 10% can result in vehicle fuel economy improvements of as much as 6-8% if the powertrain is downsized to maintain equivalent performance. Some of the materials being investigated and implemented to reduce passenger vehicle mass include advanced high-strength steel, aluminum, magnesium, and polymer composites. Additionally, multimaterial structures that allow for optimal combinations of lightweight materials to achieve maximum weight reduction with lowest cost and best structural performance have recently become of particular interest. However, assembling multimaterial structures can be challenging due to differences in melting temperature and coefficient of thermal expansion of different materials, as well as formation of intermetallic compounds and galvanic corrosion potential. Joining technologies for lightweight multimaterial structures must address these challenges to be successful.

This model setup cannot address rapid adjustments by clouds, but current evidence suggests their contribution to be small when compared to the instantaneous radiative forcing. Global maps are presented to detail the regional and seasonal variability associated with (annual) global averages. Radiative effects caused by the aerosol presence (direct effects) and by aerosol modified clouds (indirect effects) are examined. Direct effects are determined for total aerosol, anthropogenic aerosol and extracted individual aerosol components. Indirect effects cover the impact of reduced cloud drop sizes by anthropogenic aerosol. Present-day global annual radiative effects for anthropogenic aerosol yield (1) a climate cooling of -1:0Wm-2 at the top of the atmosphere (TOA); (2) a surface net-flux reduction of -2:1Wm-2; and, by difference; (3) an atmospheric effect of C1.1Wm-2. This atmospheric solar heating is almost entirely a direct effect. On a global basis, indirect effects (-0:65Wm-2) dominate direct effects (-0:35Wm-2) for the present-day climate response at the TOA, whereas the present-day surface radiative budget is more strongly reduced by direct effects (-1:45Wm-2) than by indirect effects (-0:65Wm-2). Natural aerosols are on average less absorbing and larger in size. However, their stronger solar TOA cooling efficiency is offset by a non-negligible infrared (IR) greenhouse warming efficiency. In the sum the global average annual direct forcing efficiencies (per unit AOD) for natural and anthropogenic aerosol are similar: -12Wm-2 per unit AOD for all-sky conditions and -24Wm-2 per unit AOD for clearsky conditions. The present-day direct TOA impact by all soot (BC) is C0:55Wm-2, when globally and annually averaged. Between C0:25 and C0:45Wm-2 of that can be attributed to anthropogenic sources, depending on assumptions for the preindustrial BC reference state. Similarly, the preindustrial fine-mode reference uncertainty has a strong influence not just on the direct effect but even more on the indirect effect. Present-day aerosol TOA forcing is estimated to stay within the -0:7 to -1:6Wm-2 range (with the best estimate at -1:0Wm-2). Calculations with scaled temporal changes to anthropogenic AOD from global modeling indicate that the global annual aerosol forcing has not changed much over the last decades, despite strong shifts in regional maxima for anthropogenic AOD. These regional shifts explain most solar insolation (brightening or dimming) trends that have been observed by ground-based radiation data. © Author(s) 2019.",,"aerosol property; cooling; heating; mapping; radiative forcing; radiative transfer; seasonal variation; top of atmosphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071636614

To optimize their utilization into optoelectronic devices, fundamental understanding of the optical behaviors is necessary. To reveal the comprehensive structure–property relationship, CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3) perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) of three different sizes are prepared by controlling the precipitation temperature. Photoluminescence (PL) blinking, a key process that governs the emission efficiency of the PQD materials, is investigated in detail by the time-resolved spectroscopic measurements of individual dots. The nature of the generated species in the course of blinking events is identified, and the mechanism governing the PL blinking is studied as a function of PQD sizes. Further, the practical applicability of MAPbBr3 PQDs is assessed by studying the multiexciton dynamics under high photoexcitation intensity under which most of the display devices work.

The most significant impact of ventilation occurs during use, because of the indoor air quality. According to the 2014 IPCC report, observed atmospheric CO2 levels increased at a rate of 1.9–2.1 ppm per year. This study measured CO2 levels in a building in an urban area in Shanghai, China, and analyzed existing ventilation performance and energy simulation in relation to the impact of increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. As long as the atmospheric CO2 level increased, the outdoor airflow rate had to increase also to maintain an acceptable indoor CO2 level. The ventilation rate was also considered in relation to the surrounding environment. In Shanghai, the average value of CO2 concentrations on an auto road was 550 ± 20 ppm and the average value on a pedestrian road was 435 ± 15 ppm. A building that was surrounded by high traffic roads needed 20–30% more outdoor airflow rate than a building surrounded by pedestrian roads. Accordingly, energy loads in buildings, for heating and cooling were also affected. In order to dilute indoor CO2 level, the thermal ventilation energy and the ventilation energy uniformly provided a 20% energy load increase during the 12 months, while each monthly energy load varied, depending on the season and/or month. By analyzing indoor CO2 levels and the rise in atmospheric CO2 levels, this study determined how these rises impacted the energy consumption of the building, and how to design a new outdoor airflow supply rate to adapt to a changed environmental condition. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building energy; CO2 concentration; Indoor air quality; Ventilation impact","Air conditioning; Air quality; Buildings; Energy utilization; Indoor air pollution; Roads and streets; Ventilation; Building energy; CO2 concentration; Energy in buildings; Environmental conditions; Heating and cooling; Indoor air quality; Surrounding environment; Ventilation performance; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; air quality; airflow; building; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); cooling; deep water ventilation; heating; indoor air; pedestrian; simulation; urban area; ventilation; Article; building; China; climate change; cold; concentration (parameter); cooling; energy conservation; energy consumption; heating; humidity; priority journal; suburban area; urban area; weather; winter; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065495670

To reduce emissions through voluntary GHG reduction measures, at the 21st Summit of the Conference on Climate Change in France, geothermal energy was selected as a key technology for the achievement of 50 % reduction in national GHG emissions by 2020. To meet this challenge, selection of the most suitable (reasonable and efficient) geothermal energy development site is necessary. The development of economical geothermal power through the efficient execution of the state budget for future geothermal energy development is also necessary. In other countries, geothermal power is being developed using the heat around active volcanoes. In Korea, geothermal abnormalities are related mostly to the geothermal heat produced by the radioactive decay of elements. The research area selected for this study comprised Korea's representative volcanic islands, Jeju Island and Ulleung Island. The geothermal investigation on Jeju Island was assessed through several boreholes, revealing generally lesser heat flow than that of inland of South Korea. On the other hand, a high temperature gradient was found through recent drilling on Ulleung Island. To determine the cause of this high gradient, rock thermal properties and borehole irradiation data from the coastal areas of Jeju and Ulleung islands were compared. It need to be calculated the geothermal reserve and constructed geothermal parameter maps of the volcanic Jeju and Ulleung islands in South Korea for regional analysis and evaluation. As a result, the average thermal conductivity of rocks is 1.69 W/mK (Ulleung) and 1.76 W/mK (Jeju), lower than inland. In the case of geothermal gradient, heat flow, and heat production rate, Ulleung island is average 86.55 °C/km, 127.06 mW/m2, 3.75 µW/m3 and Jeju island is average 24.65 °C/km, 40.13 mW/m2, 0.76 µWm3. It is the value significantly higher Ulleung island than inland, but Jeju island is lower than inland.

Based on thermodynamic calculations, conducting the smelting process at a higher temperature was recommended to achieve a larger amount of FeO reduction, i.e., higher Ti-enrichment, as less precipitate and thus large amounts of a liquid slag were predicted. However, even though the reduction of FeO in ilmenite ore at the initial stage seemed to be faster as the temperature increased, no significant difference in the TiO2 or FeO concentration was observed after the reaction was complete, regardless of the temperature. This was caused by the precipitation of pseudobrookite due to the local depletion of FeO during reaction at higher temperatures, by which further reduction reaction was prohibited. The apparent rate constant increased with increasing temperature and the activation energy of the reduction process was estimated to be 144 kJ/mol, from which it was concluded that the reduction reaction of FeO in ilmenite slag by carbonaceous reductant was generally controlled through the mass transfer in the slag phase.

The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the direct electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) are important electrocatalytic processes that proceed at gas diffusion electrodes of hydrogen fuel cells and CO2 electrolyzers, respectively. However, their low catalytic activity (voltage efficiency), limited long-term stability, and moderate product selectivity (related to their Faradaic efficiency) have remained challenges. To address these, suitable catalysts are required. This review addresses the current state of research on Pt-based and Cu-based nanoalloy electrocatalysts for ORR and CO2RR, respectively, and critically compares and contrasts key performance parameters such as activity, selectivity, and durability. In particular, Pt nanoparticles alloyed with transition metals, post-transition metals and lanthanides, are discussed, as well as the material characterization and their performance for the ORR. Then, bimetallic Cu nanoalloy catalysts are reviewed and organized according to their main reaction product generated by the second metal. This review concludes with a perspective on nanoalloy catalysts for the ORR and the CO2RR, and proposes future research directions. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The importance rank matrix model was employed to establish the ES preferences of 15 selected key organisations involved in AFE comanagement. A two-way ANOVA inferential analysis was used to compare the differences in ES type importance. The results revealed statistically significant differences between provisioning, regulating and cultural ES. Regulating ES were identified as the most important compared to provisioning and cultural ES; a gradual stakeholder preference shift from forest tangible goods. Water, wildlife habitat, flood regulation, carbon intake and climate regulation were identified as the most important ES by all the stakeholders. Therefore, it is important to understand the gradual changes in ES preferences by various stakeholders involved in the co-management of natural resources. This knowledge could be important to the decision-makers in sustainable co-management planning for natural resources and to enhance sustainable utiliation of ES. © Kilonzi F, Ota T.","Aberdare forest; Ecosystem services; Matrix model; Protected forests; Stakeholder perception",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073369108

Prioritization of appropriate interventions for given contexts is needed to assist relevant stakeholders to make strategic decisions and improve adaptability and efficiency of agriculture production system in the face of climate change and variability. First step includes participatory identification and evaluation of location specific CSA interventions suitable for different crop and cropping system with potential to reduce climatic risks in agriculture. All CSA interventions were evaluated based on their contribution to increase farm productivity and income, building resilience to changing climate and reduction of agricultural emissions. Second step includes evaluation of overall implementation feasibility of selected CSA interventions based on their technical feasibility, cost of implementation, inclusivity and synergy with current government programs. In the third step, potential barriers of CSA technology adoption were assessed linking with availability of resources, farmers’ knowledge and acceptability, access to agriculture extensions service, market and government support. In the fourth step, incentive mechanisms to promote CSA interventions such as government subsidy, market linkage, provision of loan and capacity building were evaluated with farmers and key stakeholders. Finally, this prioritization framework assessed the role of different organizations such as the government, private sector, non-government organizations, custom hiring centers and community based organizations in promoting CSA interventions at the local level. Results show that this framework provides ample space for local stakeholders to integrate their knowledge and experience on CSA interventions in prioritization and investment planning. Stakeholders prioritized mainly water and nutrient management technologies, agriculture insurance against climatic risks and ICT based weather and agro-advisory services. This framework provides a decision support tool for policy-making in adaptation and mitigation activities in agriculture sector at the local level. This framework can be used by governments, development organizations and the private sector for investment decision-making. © 2019 The Authors","Barriers; Climate-smart agriculture; Emissions; Incentives; Prioritization; Productivity; Resilience","adaptive management; agricultural policy; agricultural production; agrometeorology; capacity building; climate change; conceptual framework; decision making; ecosystem resilience; investment incentive; prioritization; stakeholder; state role",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064941148

All the synthesized materials were characterized by UV-Visible Spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Raman Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) and Photoluminescence (PL). The morphological characterizations were confirmed by transmission electron microcopy images (TEM). The hydrothermally synthesized material had a size of 5-20 nm by uniform doping of zinc nanoparticles on graphene sheet. The results of PL of Zn(II)-GQDs showed a blue to purple emission with the variation in excitation wavelength from 280nm to 380nm.

The susceptibility of plants to different pollutants was determined by analyzing various biochemical parameters (i.e. total chlorophyll content, ascorbic acid, pH of the leaf extract and relative water content), heavy metal(loid)s level of the investigated plant species. The pollution tolerance level of the analyzed plant samples showed that Morus alba was the most tolerant and Convolvulus arvensis, the most sensitive species to the air pollution. The metal accumulation index value was found highest for Lepidium sativum and lowest for Malcolmia africana, depicting their metal accumulation capacity. Moreover, it was found that the pollution level of all the analyzed heavy metal(loid)s was beyond the permissible limits of WHO except Mn.

Driven by the need to source locally available materials in remote communities and to reduce the carbon footprint arising from hauling of materials over long distances, the use of the rammed earth (RE) technology is regaining popularity. In this study, the rebound hammer values, corresponding to compressive strength of the RE material demonstrated a positive trend with aging. Further, the application of two different ramming head diameters (15.24 cm vs. 7.62 cm diameter) for compaction, revealed that the smaller head results in higher density, lower void ratio, higher compressive strength and better compaction near the end corners of the tested wall. The compressive strength of the material calculated using rebound hammer, showed a positive effect when cement was substituted with 15% of industrial waste additives. Interestingly, the same mix reported 23% higher strength when exposed to wetting-drying cycles as compared to a reference mix under ambient conditions. Overall, the exposure of the specimens to alternating wetting and drying cycles presented a positive impact on the strength of the RE material. Furthermore, the pulse speed recorded by using Ultrasonic pulse velocity equipment revealed a similar trend for the RE material with and without additives when compared to same exposure conditions. On the other hand, uni-axial compressive test results on cylindrical specimens illustrated 34% higher strength for sample prepared without any industrial additive on exposure to wet-dry cycle, while the sample with 15% additives reported 25% increased strength under ambient conditions. The experimental results also highlighted the significance of more lifts on the resulting strength of the material. Therefore, the findings of this paper present useful baseline data for RE that can be used when comparing tests conducted on existing RE structures made of similar materials. © 2019 Institution of Structural Engineers","Composites; Compression; Construction material; Design; Non-destructive testing; Rammed earth; Rebound hammer; Structures; Ultrasonic pulse velocity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065989912

At the same time, this post-political thesis has been challenged for not taking the multiplicity of voices and actually existing forms of contestation into account. In this paper, I investigate the tension between these two positions and show that the existence of diverging voices and environmental struggles does not disprove the post-political thesis as such. I do this both from a theoretical and an empirical point of view. Theoretically, the paper presents a rereading of post-foundational theory and its implications for dealing with climate change. Empirically, the paper is based on activist research in the Transition Towns and Climate Justice Action movements, which have variably been depicted as profoundly political and depoliticised. The paper argues that it is often overlooked that it is on the level of discourse or representation that the diagnosis of post-politics should be made. It is not reality as such which is post-political, but the way reality is portrayed and thereby constructed. On this basis, I argue that post-politics is a real problem for climate movements and that the attempt to overcome it is not only a necessity but also a profound challenge for them. © The Author(s) 2018.","Climate change; democracy; politicisation; post-politics; social movements","climate change; democracy; environmental justice; participatory approach; planning theory; political discourse; political participation; social movement; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059080387

This is due to resistance in the market, or in this case, the failure of renewable energy policies to achieve long-term environmental sustainability due to neglected external factors (economic, societal, etc.). No available literature analyzes potential sources and/or effects of this policy resistance, so this research investigates the underlying mechanisms in the renewable energy generation market by utilizing a system dynamics model. A two-alternative Generalized Bass Model was developed to simulate the renewable energy market (specifically with respect to solar PV and wind energy), including the environmental, societal, and economic concerns associated with each of the alternatives evaluated in this study, so as to identify and address possible causes of policy resistance and its subsequent effects on environmental impacts (esp. GHG emissions and water withdrawal rates). Based on this model, three separate policy areas (solar PV investments, wind power investments, and the elimination of fossil fuel subsidies)and various combinations thereof were proposed and tested within the context of the model. Based on the results of this study, it is highly recommended to invest as generously as possible into multiple renewable energy industries, reduce fossil fuel subsidies (in turn freeing up funding for renewable energy investments), and seek further advancement in renewable energy technologies (e.g. enhancing the useable lifetimes of wind turbines). A balanced policy have potential to increase the share of renewable's up to roughly 40% in the U.S. by 2050, as well as 17% and 32% GHG and water withdrawal reduction potential by 2050. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Renewable energy; Solar photovoltaic; System dynamics; Water withdrawal; Wind energy","Carbon footprint; Commerce; Emission control; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Power markets; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; System theory; Wind power; Wind turbines; Alternative to fossil fuels; Environmental sustainability; Renewable energies; Renewable energy investments; Renewable energy technologies; Solar photovoltaics; System Dynamics; Water withdrawal; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065409712

Altitudinal gradient studies and warming experiments can both increase understanding of climate effects on species interactions, but few studies have used both together to improve predictions. We examined whether plant–fungal symbioses responded similarly to altitude and 23 yr of experimental warming. Root- and leaf-associated fungi, which can mediate plants’ climate sensitivity, responded divergently to elevation vs. warming. Fungal colonization, diversity, and composition varied with altitude, but climate variables were generally weak predictors; other factors such as host plant identity, plant community composition, or edaphic variables likely drive fungal altitudinal distributions. Manipulated warming altered fungal colonization, but not composition or diversity. Leaf symbionts were more sensitive to climate and experimental warming than root symbionts. Altitudinal patterns and responses to warming differed among host plant species and fungal groups, indicating that predicting climate effects on symbioses will require tracking both host and symbiont identities. Combining experimental and observational methods can yield valuable insight into how climate change may alter plant–symbiont interactions, but our results indicate that altitude does not always serve as an adequate proxy for warming effects on fungal symbionts of plants. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","climate change; community composition; diversity; elevation gradient; endophytes; mycorrhizal fungi; next-generation sequencing; plant–fungal interactions; symbiosis; warming experiment","altitude; climate change; community composition; elevation; endophyte; environmental gradient; experimental study; fungus; host-symbiont interaction; molecular analysis; mycorrhiza; prediction; species diversity; symbiont; symbiosis; warming; Fungi; altitude; climate change; fungus; plant; symbiosis; Altitude; Climate Change; Fungi; Plants; Symbiosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066072396

Abalone (Haliotis spp.) populations in the Southern California Bight (SCB) are still recovering from a combination of overfishing and disease, despite the closure of the fisheries 20 years ago and active restoration programs for abalone species in the region. For this study, abalone recruitment and sea urchin populations were surveyed in artificial habitats (16-22 m) across a spatial and temporal climatic gradient in southern California from 2010 to 2017 to inform the development of climate-ready abalone restoration programs. The SCB encompasses warm and cool islands, and experienced two periods of ocean conditions - cool (2010-2013) and warm ocean conditions (2014-2016). Dive surveys of the artificial habitats revealed that juvenile abalone recruitment remained low during the study period, suggesting that recovery is slow. Warm-water years favored recruitment of juvenile pink (Haliotis corrugata) and green abalone (Haliotis fulgens), with the highest abalone recruitment observed at Catalina Island. Endangered white abalone (Haliotis sorenseni) were not observed despite placing the artificial habitats in suitable deep rocky reefs, which is further evidence supporting their endangered species status. The coolest site, San Diego, had little abalone recruitment, with a few juvenile red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and threaded (Haliotis kamtschatkana) abalone present. Sea urchin abundance and diversity increased during the warm period, with the largest increase at Catalina Island. During the warm period, Coronado sea urchin (Centrostephanus coronatus) increased in abundance, coincident with a decrease in the commercially valuable temperate red sea urchin (Mesocentrotus franciscanus). Potential shifts in the sea urchin assemblage to warm-water sea urchins may negatively impact recovering abalone populations and the red sea urchin fishery. Climate-ready abalone restoration will require ecosystem-based monitoring, tracking on not only abalone recruitment but also sea urchins, algal abundances, ocean temperature, and kelp forest communities as climate change may lead to complex and unexpected ecosystem interactions. © 2019 Journal of Shellfish Research.

This paper introduces experience and modality of Japan's fluorocarbon control policy, particularly of the latest revision enforced by Act on Rational Use and Proper Management of Fluorocarbon. The act obliges owners of air conditioning/refrigeration units (here in after ""equipment"") deal with fluorinated gases emissions both in usage phase and in decommissioning phase. This paper explains modality of the provisions stipulated in the act focusing on stakeholders of building, with explanation of supplemental efforts made voluntarily. It is explained that supplemental measures are vital in addition to the obligation, for the sake of ensuring the fluorocarbon emissions reduction measures completed. Besides, this paper explains in regard to expected greenhouse gases reduction by refrigerant leakage prevention in usage phase. Under Japan's fluorinated gases control policy, owners of equipment must conduct inspection of each unit once a designated period to prevent leakage of fluorinated gases, as well as calculating and reporting seepage emissions of fluorinated gases used for refrigerant to government if it is more than a threshold. This obligation makes owners of equipment conscious of leakage emissions of fluorinated gases used for refrigerant, which result in leakage prevention. As effects of leakage prevention of fluorinated gases in building sector in Japan, both the estimated significance of emission reduction in retailing sector and results of the policy implementation in building sector are shown. Japan's fluorocarbon emission control policy has been characteristic in world. Sharing the experience could contribute to setting up further HFCs emissions reduction measures, especially in Asia region where emissions of fluorinated gases used for refrigerant are expected to increase. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air conditioning; Buildings; Emission control; Fluorocarbons; Greenhouse gases; Refrigerants; Sustainable development; Climate change mitigation; Effects of leakage; Emission reduction; Emissions reduction; Leakage prevention; Policy implementations; Refrigerant leakages; Retailing sector; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071875345

Particularly, microbial induced and/or controlled carbonate formations are considered significant archives for recording critical environmental conditions that can be used not only to reconstruct paleo-environments, but also to gain valuable information about evidence of life in environments. Therefore, deciphering carbonate precipitation mechanisms, and the factors controlling these processes, particularly in extreme environments, hold significant insights for industrial applications, and for searching life in extra-terrestrial environments. In the scope of these contexts, we tried to model carbonate precipitation mechanism and possible biological influences in a hypersaline lake, known as an extreme environment in Turkey, in terms of its water chemistry. The aim of this research is to model CaCO3 precipitation in the Acıgöl Lake, using water quality data from the field, and meteorological data obtained from the Turkish State Meteorological Service for the years 2013 and 2015. To achieve this, AQUATOX model is utilized. The model is calibrated for nine stations of the lake using parameters related to water quality, site characteristics, inflow loadings and lake hydrodynamics. Calibration dataset is obtained from the field measurements and meteorological data, for the year 2013. Model validation is conducted both using experimental data, and field observations, obtained in August, 2015. An integrated modeling approach is undertaken by coupling a geochemical reaction model and a process-based ecosystem model, AQUATOX; using field, experimental and meteorological data. Model results suggest that the amount of CaCO3 precipitation in the system ranges from 35.16 to 128.48 mg L−1 d– 1. Temperature, photosynthesis rate, depth and pH are found to be the most significant variables that govern the biogeochemical processes responsible for CaCO3 precipitation. The model showed a strong relationship between calcite precipitation and certain cyanobacteria species such as Anabaena and Aphanizomenon sp. Results also indicate that the model was successful in representing the relationships between calcite precipitation variations, and phosphate and pH.

The motor vehicles are one of the major causes of pollution in the atmosphere. Pollution from the motor vehicles is primarily the pollution which is directly emitted in the atmosphere and when there occur various chemical reactions among pollutants which further pollutes the atmosphere is termed as secondary pollution. When air contamination becomes adequately high, then it may result in serious consequences and may even results in death in some cases. Further this pollution affects people with lung and heart diseases. In this article, a detailed overview about the effect of vehicle pollution on urban areas has been presented.

Methods: Nationwide Medicare Part B fee-for-service databases for 2004 to 2016 were reviewed. Current Procedural Terminology codes for stress MPI were selected: standard planar and single-photon emission computed tomography (STD) and PET. Utilization rates per 1,000 Medicare beneficiaries were calculated. Elective examinations were identified using place-of-service codes for private offices and hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs). Medicare physician specialty codes identified the performing physician. Because Medicare Part B databases are complete population counts, sample statistics were not required. Results: Elective STD MPI utilization peaked in 2006 at 74 studies/1,000 and had declined by 36% by 2016. Cardiologists’ share of STD MPI grew from 79% to 87% between 2004 and 2016. Cardiologists perform STD MPI primarily in private offices, where utilization peaked in 2008 and then demonstrated an absolute decline of 28 studies/1,000 by 2016. During this same time period, cardiologists’ use of STD MPI in HOPDs demonstrated an absolute increase of 8.1 studies/1,000. From 2004 to 2016, STD MPI use by radiologists declined by 58%. Elective PET MPI maintained an upward trend, reflecting increasing use by cardiologists in private offices. Conclusions: Elective STD MPI use is declining, but cardiologists are performing an increasing share in outpatient settings. The drop in private office STD MPI among cardiologists was far greater than the corresponding increase in its use in HOPDs, suggesting that many studies previously performed in private offices were unindicated.

To quantify the chemical compositions of long-range transported and locally produced aerosol particles during a severe haze episode, aerosol particles were collected at a remote background site in Baengnyeong Island (BN) and an inland urban site in Daejeon (DJ) in the Republic of Korea from 7 February to 6 March 2014. Aerosol samples were analyzed for PM2.5, inorganic ions, carbonaceous species, and heavy metals. During a severe haze episode (EP) from 22 February to 1 March 2014, elevated PM2.5 concentrations of 73.3 ± 18.3 μg m−3 and 74.9 ± 14.3 μg m−3 were measured at the BN and DJ sites, respectively. Although both sites were influenced by long-range transported haze from China, SO42− was determined to be the most abundant species at the BN site during the EP period with an average of 29.9 ± 11.5 μg m−3, whereas NO3− was the most abundant species at the DJ site with an average of 20.9 ± 5.4 μg m−3. Low NO2 concentrations (2.6 ± 1.9 ppb) and a northwesterly air-mass trajectory suggest that most air pollutants at the BN site underwent long-range transport from China during the EP period and were minimally affected by local emissions from the Korean Peninsula. The chemical components of long-range transported and locally produced PM2.5 were quantified using arsenic (As) as a tracer for long-range transported haze from China. It was found that large fractions of SO42− (87% ± 31%), OC (70% ± 16%), and NH4+ (65% ± 10%) at the DJ site underwent long-range transport from China during the EP period. However, a significant fraction (67% ± 15%) of NO3− was determined to be secondarily produced from NO2 emitted from local sources during the EP period. On average, 34% of PM2.5 was locally produced at the DJ site during the EP period. Local production of PM2.5 is attributed mainly to NO3− (57%), followed by NH4+ (18%), SO42− (11%), and OC (9%). Results from this work suggest that when severe haze undergoes long-range transport from China to the Korean Peninsula during winter, a reduction of local NO2 emissions is the most effective strategy to reduce PM2.5 levels in inland of the Korean Peninsula. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Arsenic; Local contribution; PM2.5; Regional contribution; Severe haze","Aerosols; Arsenic; Heavy metals; Nitrogen oxides; Urban growth; Air mass trajectories; Carbonaceous species; Chemical compositions; Local contribution; Long range transport; PM2.5; Regional contribution; Severe haze; Atmospheric movements; arsenic acid; cation; cesium ion; ion; lead; magnesium; mesylic acid; organic carbon; politef; potassium; potassium hydroxide; sodium; tracer; zinc; aerosol; air mass; arsenic; concentration (composition); haze; long range transport; particulate matter; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; Asian; atmospheric transport; chemical analysis; chemical composition; China; clinical effectiveness; concentration process; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; haze; human; limit of quantitation; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; seasonal variation; South Korea; urban area; weathering; wind; winter; Baengnyeong Island; China; Incheon [South Korea]; Korea; South Korea; South Korea; Taejon [South Korea]; Taejon [Taejon (ADS)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065515070

This leads to more research in climate adaptive strategies such as traditional design methods, construction techniques and building materials. Traditional dwelling has been successful in achieving harmony between dwelling and climatic environment, which is one of the most important conditions for sustainability. Firstly, this paper focused on analyzing the characteristics of traditional dwellings in Qinba mountainous areas to adapt to the climatic environment. Secondly, two typical dwellings constructed respectively with brick and earth materials were selected for monitoring and simulating of its indoor thermal, luminous and ventilation environment in summer and winter. In addition, the research summarized the advantages and disadvantages of the dwelling's physical environment in response to climatic characteristics. It revealed that the traditional earth dwelling is well adapted to the local climate during summer, although the indoor thermal comfort is not fully satisfactory during winter. Finally, we prompted effective climate adaptive strategies of traditional earth dwelling, such as natural ventilation, thermal insulation and thermal buffer space.

About 80% of the global greenhouse gasses are emitted from these cities. The sustainable practices should be adopted in built environment for these cities. As an example, a residential neighbourhoods in arid climate has been discussed as a case study in practice in this paper. It has been developed to implement the sustainable strategies and concepts. It demonstrates a mixed-use community which integrates the sustainability dimensions to improve the quality toward sustainable living in a small community (about 4000 persons), allocated in Dubai land area. This paper aims to highlight the sustainable practices in the arid zones and to give an overview about the performance of the clean energy and renewable in these areas. The studied development has been selected to evaluate such techniques and strategies in the gulf region (Dubai). Various environmental categories such as; on energy, water, mobility, energy consumption of the buildings and infrastructure, urban green spaces, solid waste management and urban farming, have been appraised in this study. It has been noticed that the urban design proposed reduces its potable water consumption by 40% and for energy demands by 57% compared to conventional households. The solar production can cover around 38% of the energy consumption on average. Many challenges face the sustainability movement in the region, especially, the affordability and feasibility in such harsh climate zones areas.

Growing international concern and cooperation regarding the climate change problem have increased the need to consider the uncertainty in inventories of GHG emissions. The approaches to address uncertainty discussed in this special issue reflect attempts to improve national inventories, not only for their own sake but also from a wider, system analytic perspective. They seek to strengthen the usefulness of national emission inventories under a compliance and/or global monitoring and reporting framework. The papers in this special issue demonstrate the benefits of including inventory uncertainty in policy analyses. The issues raised by the authors and featured in their papers, along with the role that uncertainty analysis plays in many of their arguments, highlight the challenges and the importance of dealing with uncertainty. While the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) clearly stresses the value of conducting uncertainty analyses and offers guidance on executing them, the arguments made here in favor of performing these studies go well beyond any suggestions made by the IPCC to date. Improving and conducting uncertainty analyses are needed to develop a clear understanding and informed policy. Uncertainty matters and is key to many issues related to inventorying and reducing emissions. Considering uncertainty helps to avoid situations that can create a false sense of certainty or lead to invalid views of subsystems. Dealing proactively with uncertainty allows for the generation of useful knowledge that the international community should have to hand while strengthening the 2015 Paris Agreement, which had been agreed at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). However, considering uncertainty does not come free. Proper treatment of uncertainty is demanding because it forces us to take the step from “simple to complex” and to grasp a holistic system view. Only, thereafter, can we consider potential simplifications. That is, comprehensive treatment of uncertainty does not necessarily offer quick or easy solutions for policymakers. This special issue brings together 13 papers that resulted from the 2015 (4th) International Workshop on Uncertainty in Atmospheric Emissions, in Cracow, Poland. While they deal with many different aspects of the uncertainty in emission estimates, they are guided by the same principal question: “What GHGs shall be verified at what spatio-temporal scale to support conducive legislation at local and national scales, while ensuring effective governance at the global scale?” This question is at the heart of mitigation and adaptation. It requires an understanding of the entire system of GHG sources and sinks, their spatial characteristics and the temporal scales at which they react and interact, the uncertainty (accuracy and/or precision) with which fluxes can be measured, and last but not least, the consequences that follow from all of the aforementioned aspects, for policy actors to frame compliance and/or global monitoring and reporting agreements. This bigger system context serves as a reference for the papers in the special issue, irrespective of their spatio-temporal focus, and is used as a guide for the reader. © 2019, The Author(s).","Emission inventory; Greenhouse gas emissions; Monitoring toward compliance; Monitoring toward reporting; Paris Agreement; Uncertainty; Verification","atmospheric pollution; climate change; emission; emission control; emission inventory; environmental monitoring; greenhouse gas; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; pollution policy; quantitative analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; uncertainty analysis; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Cracow; Malopolskie; Poland [Central Europe]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066914997

In the light of the continued increase in emissions globally vis-à-vis the reductions required without further delay until 2050 and beyond, we conjecture that, being ignorant of memory and persistence, we may underestimate the “inertia” with which global GHG emissions will continue on their increasing path beyond today, thus, also leading to the amount of reduction that can be achieved in the future being overestimated. This issue is at the heart of mitigation and adaptation. For a practitioner, this translates to the problem of how persistently an emissions system behaves when subjected to a specified mitigation measure and which emissions level to adapt to for precautionary reasons in the presence of uncertainty. Memory allows us to reference how strongly the past can influence the “near-term future” of the system or (what we define as) its explainable outreach. We consider memory to be an intrinsic property of a system, retrospective in nature; and persistence to be a consequential (i.e., observable) feature of memory, prospective in nature and reflecting the tendency of a system to preserve a current state (including trend). Persistence depends on the system’s memory which, in turn, reflects how many historical states directly influence the current one. The nature of this influence can range from purely deterministic to purely stochastic. Different approaches exist to capture memory. We capture memory generically with the help of three characteristics: its temporal extent and both its weight and quality over time. The extent of memory quantifies how many historical data directly influence the current data point. The weight of memory describes the strength of this influence (fading of memory), while the quality of memory steers how well we know the latter (blurring of memory). Capturing fading and blurring of memory in combination is novel. In a numerical experiment with the focus on systemic insight, we cast a glance far ahead by illustrating one way to capture memory, and to understand how persistence plays out and how an explainable outreach of the system can be derived even under unfavorable conditions. We look into the following two questions: (1) Do we learn properly from the past? That is, do we have the right science in place to understand and treat memory appropriately? And (2) being aware that memory links a system’s past with its near-term future, do we quantify this outreach in a way that is useful for prognostic modelers and decision-makers? The latter question implies another question, namely, whether we can differentiate between and specify the various characteristics of memory (i.e., those mentioned above) by way of diagnostic data-processing alone? Or, in other words, how much system understanding do we need to have and to inject into the data-analysis process to enable such differentiation? Although the prime intention of our perspective piece is to study memory, persistence, and explainable outreach of forced systems and, thus, to expand on the usefulness of GHG emission inventories, our insights indicate the high chance of our conjecture proving true: being ignorant of memory and persistence, we underestimate, probably considerably, the “inertia” with which global GHG emissions will continue on their historical path beyond today and thus overestimate the amount of reductions that we might achieve in the future. © 2018, The Author(s).","Data analysis; Earth system science; Emissions inventory; Explainable outreach; Greenhouse gas; Memory; Persistence; Uncertainty","data assimilation; decision making; Earth science; emission; emission inventory; future prospect; greenhouse gas; historical perspective; memory; reduction; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054152495

To reduce significantly the CO2 emissions of buildings, energy efficiency of old buildings need to be improved. Aim of this study is to determine cost-optimal solutions for energy renovation and renewable energy production systems for an old existing service building. The example building of this study is a residence for elderly people, which was built in 1955 and located in Finland. This study was carried out by a dynamic building simulation tool IDA-ICE and multi objective optimization tool MOBO. The cost-optimal renovation concepts were determined from over 2.6 billion renovation measure combinations to minimize both target energy consumption and life-cycle costs over 20 years. The results show that air-to-water heat pump is more cost effective heating system for the studied building than district heating from the building owner point of view. Improving thermal insulation level of the external walls from the original level is not the most cost-effective option to improve the energy efficiency of the building. Instead of that, for example, installation of PV and solar thermal systems are recommended in all the cost-optimal solutions regardless of the target energy consumption level. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

(1) Background: African Americans constitute 32.4% of Georgia's population, making it the largest racial/ethnic minority group in the state followed by Hispanic Americans at 9.8%. African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and lower wealth groups are more likely than most middle and upper income White Americans to be exposed to environmental pollutants. This is true because racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to live in urban areas where pollution is more concentrated. As a point of departure, we examine PM2.5 concentrations specific to prescribed fire smoke, which typically emanates from fires occurring in rural or peri-urban areas. Two objectives are specified: a) examine the association between percent African American and PM2.5 concentrations at the census tract level for Georgia, and b) identify emitters of PM2.5 concentrations that exceed National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for the 24-h average, i. e., >35 µg/m3. (2) Methods: For the first objective, we estimate a spatial Durbin error model (SDEM) where pollution concentration (PM2.5) estimates for 1683 census tracts are regressed on percent of the human population that is African American or Hispanic; lives in mobile homes; and is employed in agriculture and related occupations. Also included as controls are percent evergreen forest, percent mixed evergreen/deciduous forest, and variables denoting lagged explanatory and error variables, respectively. For the second objective, we merge parcel and prescribed burn permit data to identify landowners who conduct prescribed fires that produce smoke exceeding the NAAQS. (3) Results: Percent African American and mobile home dweller are positively related to PM2.5 concentrations; and government and non-industrial private landowners are the greatest contributors to exceedance levels (4) Conclusions: Reasons for higher PM2.5 concentrations in areas with higher African American and mobile home percent are not clear, although we suspect that neither group is a primary contributor to prescribed burn smoke but rather tend to live proximate to entities, both public and private, that are. Also, non-industrial private landowners who generated prescribed burn smoke exceeding NAAQS are wealthier than others, which suggests that African American and other environmental justice populations are less likely to contribute to exceedance levels in the state.","environmental justice; Georgia; prescribed fire; socially vulnerable populations","African American; analysis; environmental exposure; fire; forest; human; particulate matter; rural population; smoke; toxicity; African Americans; Environmental Exposure; Fires; Forests; Georgia; Humans; Particulate Matter; Rural Population; Smoke",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071646629

In order to effectively strengthen these policies, it is necessary to provide information concerning energy consumption in the building sector to ensure the technical and economic feasibility of policies in the marketplace, and to allow building users and policy makers to easily access and understand energy consumption characteristics. It is important to provide information that allows people to effectively understand the state of energy consumption by end-use (space heating, space cooling, domestic hot water, etc.) as part of the creation of a concrete plan for energy reduction that incorporates various service systems and is familiar to people. This is because providing such information plays an important role in establishing concrete policies and encouraging voluntary energy performance improvements by building occupants. South Korea operates the Korea Energy Statistics Information System (KESIS) and the information provided by this type of information system consists mainly of energy consumption by energy source (electricity, gas, etc.), and such systems remain inadequate for providing effective information on energy consumption and energy use intensity (EUI) by end-use (space heating, space cooling, domestic hot water, etc.) as part of the creation of a concrete plan for energy conservation. In order to accurately provide energy consumption information by end-use rather than limit the information to mainly consumption corresponding to energy sources, in this study, measurement systems were installed in 2014 ~ 2016 based on the overall sampling designs of previous studies for apartment units, classifications, measurement and data gathering methods for energy consumption by end-use. The annual statistical values for EUI by end-use were collected from the measurement data for 71 sample apartment units from May 2017 to April 2018. This data was calculated and analyzed using stratification variable levels for completion year, supplied area, and the heat source type. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

The coupled changes in DIC, oxygen, and nutrients suggest that biological production of organic matter in surface water and the subsequent aerobic respiration in subsurface was the dominant factor regulating pH variability in the nGOM in summer. The highest pH values were observed, together with the maximal biological uptake of DIC and nutrients, at intermediate salinities in the Mississippi and Atchafalaya plumes where light and nutrient conditions were favorable for phytoplankton growth. The lowest pH values (down to 7.59) were observed along with the highest concentrations of DIC and apparent oxygen utilization in hypoxic bottom waters. The nonconservative pH changes in both surface and bottom waters correlated well with the biologically induced changes in DIC, that is, per 100-μmol/kg biological removal/addition of DIC resulted in 0.21 unit increase/decrease in pH. Coastal bottom water with lower pH buffering capacity is more susceptible to acidification from anthropogenic CO2 invasion but reduction in eutrophication may offset some of the increased susceptibility to acidification. ©2019.

Meanwhile, carbon emissions are closely related to the production decisions of microeconomic entities. Thus, studying the relationship between EPU and carbon emissions helps to clarify the impact of institutional factors behind carbon emissions, which is significant for achieving green development. Based on US sector data, we apply a novel parametric test of Granger causality in quantiles to analyze the relationship between EPU and carbon emissions (its growth and uncertainty). We find that there is an outstanding pattern of Granger-causality from the US EPU to the growth of carbon emissions in the tails of the growth distributions of carbon emissions in the industrial sector, residential sector, electric power sector, and transportation sector, except in the commercial sector. That is, carbon emissions are affected by EPU when the growth of carbon emissions is in a higher or lower growth period.

Global surveys rank Asia as the region with the largest share of global mercury emissions, accounting for almost half. China contributes about one-third of the world’s mercury emissions, which is 600–800 t per year. And thus, it plays a vital role in reducing global mercury emissions. Data since 2003 has been surveyed. Mercury emissions in China have risen in the beginning and then declined. There are differences in the composition of mercury emissions sources between China and the world, in which coal combustion and non-ferrous metals smelting contribute more than 50% of the emissions in China. Although mercury emission standards in China are close to those of the European Union and the United States, annual mercury emissions in China are four times higher than those of the United States. Mercury emissions in China are concentrated in the central and eastern regions now, but the annual mercury emissions are increasing in the western regions, which may be related to the construction of industrial parks. © 2019, Zhejiang University Press.","Emission standard; Mercury distribution; Mercury emission trend; Mercury emissions inventory",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091435736

This can be expressed in terms of the difference between the observed P-wave impedance squared and a multiplier times the square of the observed S-wave impedance. This multiplier is a fluid discrimination parameter that laboratory and log measurements suggest varies over a wide range. Theoretically, this parameter is simply related to the ratio of frame bulk and shear moduli and the ratio of densities between the frame and fluid-saturated rock. In practice, empirical determination of the fluid discrimination parameter may be required for a given locality. Given sufficient data for calibration, the parameter can be adjusted so as to best distinguish hydrocarbon-saturated targets from brine-saturated rocks. Using an empirically optimized fluid discrimination parameter has a greater impact on hydrocarbon detection success rate in the oil cases studied than for gas reservoirs, for which there is more latitude. Application to a wide variety of well log and laboratory measurements suggests that the empirically optimized parameter may differ from direct theoretical calculations made using Gassmann’s equations. Combining laboratory and log measurements for sandstones having a broad range of frame moduli, varying from poorly consolidated to highly lithified, reveals a simple linear empirical relationship between the optimized fluid discrimination parameter and the squared velocity ratio of brine-saturated sandstones. © 2019 SEG",,"Hydrocarbons; Parameter estimation; Petroleum prospecting; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Sandstone; Seismic prospecting; Seismology; Shear waves; Well logging; Amplitude anomalies; Hydrocarbon detection; Laboratory measurements; Log measurement; P waves; Rock physics; S-waves; Saturated rock; Seismic amplitudes; Wave impedances; Seismic waves",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121855034

In this paper, a novel risk assessing approach based on a climate risk assessment framework with copula-based approaches is proposed. Firstly, extreme precipitation indices (EPIs) and their marginal distributions are estimated for historical and future periods. Next, the joint probability distributions of extreme precipitation are constructed by copula methods and tested by goodness-of-fit indices. The future joint probabilities and joint return periods (JRPs) of the EPIs are then evaluated. Finally, change rates of JRPs for future periods are estimated to assess climate risk with the quantitative data of exposure and vulnerability of a protected target. An actual application in Taiwan Island is successfully conducted for climate risk assessment with the impacts of extreme precipitation. The results indicate that most of regions in Taiwan Island might have higher potential climate risk under different scenarios in the future. The future joint probabilities of precipitation extremes might cause the high risk of landslide and flood disasters in the mountainous area, and of inundation in the plain area. In sum, the proposed climate risk assessing approach is expected to be useful for assisting decision makers to draft adaptation strategies and face high risk of the possible occurrence of natural disasters. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptation strategy; Climate change; Climate risk; Copula function; Joint probability distribution; Precipitation extremes; Spatial assessment","Disasters; Floods; Precipitation (meteorology); Probability distributions; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Adaptation strategies; Copula functions; Joint probability distributions; Precipitation extremes; Spatial assessment; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; extreme event; future prospect; precipitation intensity; probability; rainfall; risk assessment; spatial analysis; spatial variation; strategic approach; temporal variation; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068138082

Receptor models based on the chemical composition of particulate matter (PM), such as chemical mass balance (CMB)and positive matrix factorization (PMF), are useful means for source apportionment, but the inclusion of other gaseous pollutants need further consideration. The results of the multipollutant analyses using temporal variations in pollutant concentrations, chemical PM speciation and receptor modeling, PMF and conditional bivariate polar plots (CBPF), were used for determination of major pollutant sources of fine particulate matter (PM2.5)and less represented pollutants – hydrogen sulfide (H2S), nitrogen dioxide (NO2)and sulfur dioxide (SO2)in an urban area in Slavonski Brod, Croatia influenced by a large point source (an oil refinery)in Brod, Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is found that the composition of PM2.5 is dominated by carbonaceous combustion particles, mainly organic carbon (OC), with maximum values appearing during winter. Summer PM2.5 levels were dominated by sulfate and ammonium, which can be related to the industrial activities i.e., oil refinery. According to PMF analysis, the majority of OC is coming from biomass burning with ∼50% contribution to observed species concentration followed by ∼30% from industry/refinery and ∼10% from traffic. CPBF model showed that urban and highway traffic was the main source of NO2 concentrations while oil refinery was identified as the dominant source of SO2 and H2S. The CBPF receptor model combines concentrations of pollutants and meteorological parameters and emerged as a reliable complementary tool for the identification of sources for considered gaseous pollutants. Limitations of the CBPF method are in the application in stable atmospheric boundary layer conditions (SABL)as wind direction is not representative. Also, larger uncertainty is related to the representation of peak concentrations transported with higher wind speeds (&gt;8 m/s)due to the lower number of events. This work uses various source apportionment methods in the assessment of PM but also for gaseous pollutants, such as NO2, SO2 and H2S that are less represented in the source apportionment studies and can be used for future scientific applications to assure more efficient air quality management. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bivariate polar plot; Chemical speciation; Oil refinery; Positive matrix factorization; Source apportionment","ammonia; hydrogen sulfide; nitrogen dioxide; organic carbon; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; chemical composition; chemical mass balance; combustion; concentration (composition); emission control; identification method; matrix; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; source apportionment; speciation (chemistry); urban area; urban pollution; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; Article; biomass; bivariate analysis; boundary layer; chemical analysis; chemical composition; combustion; concentration (parameter); Croatia; highway; industrial area; mathematical model; meteorology; oil industry; particulate matter; summer; urban area; wind; wind speed; winter; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Croatia; Slavonski Brod; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Croatia; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065834627

Towards this end, this study aimed to develop a multi-objective optimization model for determining the optimal CO2 emission reduction (CER) strategies for MFHCs that can be used not only by experts but also by non-experts. This study used integrated multi-objective optimization with a genetic algorithm as an optimization methodology. The developed model, which considers the five optimization objectives (i.e., initial investment cost, net present value, savings-to-investment cost, CER, and marginal abatement cost) at the same time, can review a total of 31,200 scenarios combined with four energy saving measures (i.e., insulation, window, lighting, and shading systems). To verify the feasibility of the developed model, this study conducted a case study targeting ‘D’ MFHC in South Korea. First, the accuracy of the calibration of the energy simulation model for ‘D’ MFHC (coefficient of variation of the root mean square error: 12.84%; mean bias error: 0.39%) satisfied the criteria of ASHRAE Guideline 14; second, I8 (expanded polystyrene board - type 1 (No. 4))-L3 (LED lighting installed in louvered ceiling) and I8 (expanded polystyrene board - type 1 (No. 4)) - L4 (ceiling-mounted light) were determined to be the optimal CER strategy (integrated multi-objective optimization score: 0.2252).

The mathematical modeling and simulation of the indoor VLC over the illumination sources with different radiation patterns are presented in this paper. The performance analysis for the optical sources with Lambertian, Lambertian directional, Batwing and Gaussian radiation patterns is carried out in the aspects of illumination, communication and energy efficiency. The illumination analysis results that the Lambertian and Batwing sources can provide flat illuminance in communication plane than the other sources due to their greater illuminance uniformity. The communication ability of the diverse sources is analyzed with the distribution of optical power and RMS delay, and achievable data rate. The Lambertian and Batwing sources provide better user mobility as they have uniform optical power distribution, and they can provide 812 Mbps and 908 Mbps, respectively. The Lambertian directional and Gaussian sources have the optical power concentrated in some regions of indoor environment, and they can provide the 1.082 Gbps and 794 Mbps, respectively, in those regions. This makes these sources more suitable for the fixed VLC links. The energy efficiency of the Lambertian directional source is 108.2 Mbps/W, and its order of emission and directivity makes it more energy efficient than the other sources.

One effect that has not gained much attention so far is the amplification of skyglow by snow, particularly in combination with clouds. Snow, however, has a very high albedo and can become important when the direct upward emission is reduced when using shielded luminaires. In this work, first results of skyglow amplification by fresh snow and clouds measured with all-sky photometry in a suburban area are presented. Amplification factors for the zenith luminance of 188 for snow and clouds in combination and 33 for snow alone were found at this site. The maximum zenith luminance of nearly 250 mcd/m2 measured with snow and clouds is a factor of 1000 higher than the commonly used clear sky reference of 0.25 mcd/m2. Compared with our darkest zenith luminance of 0.07 mcd/m2 measured for overcast conditions in a very remote area, this leads to an overall amplification factor of ca. 3500. Horizontal illuminance measurements show values of up to 0.79 lx, exceeding maximum possible full-moon illuminance levels by more than a factor of two. Additional measurements near the Arctic Circle for clear and overcast conditions are presented and strategies for further studies are discussed.

This study aims to assess the vulnerability of the ecotourism system in Dana Biosphere Reserve (DBR), the major ecotourism destination in Jordan, to climate change. We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews with key informants in DBR to assess climate change-related threats, their influence on natural resources, local communities and ecotourism's activities; and adaptation practices. The results indicate that DBR is highly exposed to multiple climate threats, specifically reduced precipitation, shifts in the rainy season, and increased frequency and intensity of drought.

The built environment was recognized as an important factor in reducing global emissions for the first time at the Conference of Parties (COP) 21 meeting in Paris through a dedicated 'Buildings Day.' The Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction (GlobalABC) was also launched at COP 21 as a network to globally support zero emission, efficient and resilient buildings and construction sector. The Paris Agreement brought all nations to collectively combat climate change with a view to limit temperature increases to no more than 2 degrees Celsius (°C). Nations agreed to report their efforts through the monitoring program. In most countries, residential and commercial buildings spend a large proportion of their energy in lighting, heating, ventilation, air conditioning and in various appliances requiring energy for operation. This paper takes a broad understanding of zero energy. Starting with buildings, the definitions also consider understanding zero energy and from a carbon perspective, considering going from beyond buildings to include precincts and cities. The paper brings an understanding of zero energy, its importance, and its urgency with respect to global commitments to reduce the impact of the building and construction sector and the role of governments and industries in supporting the lowering of emissions in the built environment now and in the future. © 2019 by the authors.","Buildings; Built environment; ZCB (Zero Carbon Building); ZEB (Zero Energy Building); Zero carbon; Zero energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070929459

We developed and applied an innovative approach for regional parameterization, and calibration of the CENTURY ecosystem model. We quantified spatiotemporal variation of soil organic carbon stock (SOC) and aboveground plant biomass production (AGB) and examined their responses to the recent climate change across a diverse range of native grassland systems in Alberta, western Canada. The simultaneous integration of SOC and AGB into calibration and analysis accounted for most of the spatiotemporal variability in the SOC and AGB measurements and resulted in reduced simulation uncertainty across nine grassland regions. These findings suggest the importance of the systematic parameterization and calibration for the reliable assessment of carbon-related ES across a wide geographic area with heterogeneous ecological conditions. Simulation results showed a pronounced variation in the spatial distribution of SOC and AGB and their associated uncertainty across grassland regions. Under baseline grazing intensity regime, an overall negative effect of recent climatic changes on the SOC, and a less consistent effect on the AGB were found. While, an overall positive or slightly negative impact of recent climate change on the SOC and AGB was found under a proposed 10% lower grazing intensity regime. These heterogeneities in the magnitude and direction of climate change effects under different grazing regimes suggest needs for a range of climate change adaptation strategies to maintain carbon-related ES in Alberta's grasslands. The modeling framework developed in this study can be used to improve the spatially explicit assessment of carbon-related ES in other geographically vast grassland areas and examine the effectiveness of alternative management scenarios to ensure the long-term provision of carbon-related ES in grassland systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biogeochemical processes; Calibration and uncertainty; Climate change; Grazing management; Plant biomass production; Soil carbon stock","Biomass; Calibration; Ecosystems; Organic carbon; Uncertainty analysis; Biogeochemical process; Design and implementations; Grazing management; Plant biomass production; Soil carbon stock; Soil organic Carbon stocks; Spatially explicit assessments; Spatiotemporal variability; Climate change; carbon; soil organic matter; soil water; carbon; aboveground production; biogeochemical cycle; calibration; climate change; ecosystem service; grassland; grazing management; soil carbon; spatial variation; temporal variation; uncertainty analysis; Article; biomass production; calibration; Canada; climate change; controlled study; decomposition; ecosystem; grazing; nutrient availability; nutrient dynamics; plant growth; precipitation; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; soil property; temperate grassland; temperature; Alberta; environmental monitoring; grassland; Alberta; Canada; Alberta; Carbon; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Grassland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065621091

One ecologically relevant approach consists of examining the thermal responses of a large number of traits, both related with population dynamics and trophic interactions (i.e. a multi-trait approach). Based on in situ climatic data and projections from climate models, we here designed two daily fluctuating thermal regimes realistically reflecting current and future conditions in Eastern France. These models detected an increase in mean temperature and in the range of daily thermal fluctuations as two local facets of global warming likely to occur in our study area by the end of this century. We then examined the responses of several fitness-related traits in caterpillars of the moth Lobesia botrana – including development, pupal mass, survival rates, energetic reserves, behavioral and immune traits expressed against parasitoids – to this experimental imitation of global warming. Increasing temperatures positively affected development (leading to a 31% reduction in the time needed to complete larval stage), survival rates (+19%), and movement speed as a surrogate for larval escape ability to natural enemies (+60%). Conversely, warming elicited detrimental effects on lipid reserves (−26%) and immunity (total phenoloxidase activity: −34%). These findings confirm that traits should differ in their sensitivity to global warming, underlying complex consequences for population dynamics and trophic interactions. Our study strengthens the importance of combining a multi-trait approach with the use of realistic fluctuating regimes to forecast the consequences of global warming for individuals, species and species assemblages. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate models; Defensive behaviors; Energetic reserves; European grapevine moth; Global warming; Immunity","bioenergetics; caterpillar; climate change; climate conditions; climate modeling; defense mechanism; fitness; global warming; immunity; life history trait; moth; natural enemy; population dynamics; thermal regime; trophic environment; Lepidoptera; Lobesia botrana; Vitis; animal; biological model; female; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; life history trait; male; moth; physiology; pupa; sex ratio; Animals; Female; Global Warming; Life History Traits; Male; Models, Biological; Moths; Pupa; Sex Ratio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069878476

The amount of GHGs in the atmosphere has escalated immensely, with a substantial growth of 5.8% in 2010; a similar increase was observed in Pakistan as well. In Pakistan, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions stand at 54% of total GHG emissions whereas methane, nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide and volatile organic carbon contribute to emissions at 36%, 9%, 0.75% and 0.3%, respectively. One of the key reasons for climatic changes is GHG emission generation from human interventions and activities related to transportation, urban development, industrialization, energy sources, farming and agriculture, waste's improper management, land use and forestry. In 2011, Pakistan's entire GHG emissions were a whopping 347 Mt of CO2-eq, and by 2050, they are estimated to reach 4621 Mt CO2-eq. This review evaluates and assesses GHG emissions generating from various sectors in Pakistan, in a socio-scientific prospect that is caused by human activities and interventions in different economic sectors in Pakistan, endangering the environment across the country. Additionally, the review examines the current level of GHG emissions while accounting for China–Pakistan Economic Corridor–based emissions, abatement strategies including development of a state-of-the-art technique for carbon capture and storage/utilization technologies in Pakistan. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","carbon capture and storage; CPEC; greenhouse gases; human interventions; sectorial emissions","Agricultural robots; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Chemical industry; Forestry; Gas emissions; Global warming; Land use; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Urban growth; Urban transportation; Waste management; Carbon dioxide emissions; Climatic changes; CPEC; Human activities; Human intervention; State-of-the-art techniques; Urban development; Volatile organic carbons; Greenhouse gases; carbon sequestration; climate change; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; human activity; volatile organic compound; Pakistan",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066119542

The model is driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis at a horizontal resolution of 50 km, and the two radiation schemes of CAM (Community Atmosphere Model) and RRTMG (Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for Global Climate Models) are applied. The mean and extreme temperature is generally underestimated by the model over most areas, with the greatest bias reaching 8 °C over the Tibetan Plateau, which can be explained by the underestimation of the long wave radiation. The RRTMG scheme reduces the underestimation of long wave radiation by about 30 W/m 2 in most regions, and thus reduces the root mean square error of annual mean temperature over the east Asia domain by about 0.77 °C. The simulations of precipitation show little dependence on the radiation schemes, with slight superiority in the CAM-driven experiment. The model's performance of producing the interannual variation of the temperature can be partly attributed to that of the long wave radiation, and the CAM scheme works slightly better in producing the interannual feature of both temperature and precipitation. The seasonal cycles of both temperature and precipitation are reasonably produced by the model. The cold bias of temperature is found to mainly occur in the cold months through the year, which is probably associated with the greater underestimation of long wave radiation flux in the cold months. © 2019","CORDEX-EA; Radiation parameterization; Regional climate simulation; WRF","Cams; Mean square error; Radiative transfer; Weather forecasting; Annual mean temperatures; Community atmosphere model; CORDEX-EA; Radiation parameterization; Radiative transfer model; Regional climate simulation; Root mean square errors; Weather research and forecasting; Climate models; climate modeling; computer simulation; longwave radiation; numerical model; parameter estimation; radiative transfer; regional climate; solar radiation; weather forecasting; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063321443

The state has set an ambitious goal of reducing GHG to 1990 levels by 2020 and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. The statewide goal cannot be accomplished without the support of local stakeholders. We analyzed over 150 city climate action plans (CAPs) in California and examined their reduction goals. We hypothesized five sets of factors that can explain whether a jurisdiction adopts a plan or not, and what kind of target it sets. We find that size of the city, political ideology, and institutional capacity are related to a higher chance of adopting a climate action plan, while political ideology and air quality explain the extent of aspiration of targets. We also find evidence of policy diffusion where neighbors are more likely to adopt plans. Our findings identify gaps in the CAPs within the state and address what lessons can be learned from the Californian experience of local climate policy adoption and goal-setting. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Air quality; Gas emissions; Action plan; California; Goal setting; Institutional capacities; Local climate; Policy diffusions; Political ideologies; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070928437

Because carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere and sequestered in forests and wood products, mitigation strategies to sustain and increase forest carbon sequestration are being developed. These strategies require full accounting of forest sector GHG budgets. Here, we describe a rigorous approach using over one million observations from forest inventory data and a regionally calibrated life-cycle assessment for calculating cradle-to-grave forest sector emissions and sequestration. We find that Western US forests are net sinks because there is a positive net balance of forest carbon uptake exceeding losses due to harvesting, wood product use, and combustion by wildfire. However, over 100 years of wood product usage is reducing the potential annual sink by an average of 21%, suggesting forest carbon storage can become more effective in climate mitigation through reduction in harvest, longer rotations, or more efficient wood product usage. Of the ∼10 700 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents removed from west coast forests since 1900, 81% of it has been returned to the atmosphere or deposited in landfills. Moreover, state and federal reporting have erroneously excluded some product-related emissions, resulting in 25%-55% underestimation of state total CO2 emissions. For states seeking to reach GHG reduction mandates by 2030, it is important that state CO2 budgets are effectively determined or claimed reductions will be insufficient to mitigate climate change. © 2019 The Author(s).

This paper reports on our newly established technology: a downdraft fixed-bed biomass gasification system using nut shells (mainly apricot kernel shells) for electricity generation, heating and partially activated carbon production at the same time. Particularly, the key features of the gasification reactor will be presented in detail. In the commercial plant (3 MW scale) located in Hebei province, China, the typical energy conversion from apricot kernel shell gasification is as follows: 47% syngas, 44% char (partially activated carbon), 5% hot water, and 4% energy loss. The main gasification temperature is 600-800 °C, while the activation zone is 850-900 °C. The commercial system has currently been in operation for 4 years. Considering the partially activated carbon as a stable carbon carrier, the whole system features negative CO2 emissions. © 2019 by the authors.","Commercial performance; Electricity; Fixed-bed gasifier; Heat; Partially activated carbon","Activated carbon; Biomass; Electricity; Energy dissipation; Energy security; Gasification; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Power quality; Activated carbon production; Biomass gasification system; Commercial performance; Downdraft fixed beds; Electricity generation; Gasification temperatures; Gasifiers; Greenhouse gas reductions; Electric power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073704496

Here, we present an exhaustive evaluation and validation of a robust, replicable and scalable framework that maps forest aboveground biomass over large areas at fine-resolution by linking airborne lidar and field data with machine learning algorithms. We developed this framework over multiple phases of bottom-up monitoring efforts within NASA's Carbon Monitoring Program. Lidar data were collected by different local and federal agencies and provided a wall-to-wall coverage of three states in the USA (Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware with a total area of 157 865 km2). We generated a set of standardized forestry metrics from lidar-derived imagery (i.e. canopy height model, CHM) to minimize inconsistency of data quality. We then estimated plot-scale biomass from field data that had the closet acquisition time to lidar data, and linked to lidar metrics using Random Forest models at four USDA Forest Service ecological regions. Additionally, we examined pixel-scale errors using independent field plot measurements across these ecoregions. Collectively, we estimate a total of ∼680 Tg C in aboveground biomass over the Tri-State region (13 DE, 103 MD, 564 PA) circa 2011. A comparison with existing products at pixel-, county-, and state-scale highlighted the contribution of trees over 'non-forested' areas, including urban trees and small patches of trees, an important biomass component largely omitted by previous studies due to insufficient spatial resolution. Our results indicated that integrating field data and low point density (∼1 pt m-2) airborne lidar can generate large-scale aboveground biomass products at an accuracy close to mainstream lidar forestry applications (R 2 = 0.46-0.54, RMSE = 51.4-54.7 Mg ha-1; and R 2 = 0.33-0.61, RMSE = 65.3-100.9 Mg ha-1; independent validation). Local, high-resolution lidar-derived biomass maps such as products from this study, provide a valuable bottom-up reference to improve the analysis and interpretation of large-scale mapping efforts and future development of a national carbon monitoring system. © 2019 The Author(s).

These changes and their differences between wet and dry climate are studied at a mid-latitude experiment site in the Loess Plateau of China. The study site, the Jinghe River basin (JRB), covers an area of 43,216 km2 and has a semiarid climate in the north and a semi-humid climate in the south. Two simulations from 1965 to 2012 are made using a site-calibrated Lund–Potsdam–Jena dynamic global vegetation model: one with the observed rise of the atmospheric CO2 from 319.7–391.2 ppmv, and the other with a fixed CO2 at the level of 1964 (318.9 ppmv). Analyses of the model results show that the elevated atmospheric CO2 promotes growth of woody vegetation (trees) and causes a 6.0% increase in basin-wide net primary production (NPP). The NPP increase uses little extra water however because of higher WUE. Further examination of the surface water budget reveals opposite CO2 effects between semiarid and semi-humid climates in the JRB. In the semiarid climate, plants sustain growth in higher CO2 because of the higher level of intracellular CO2 and therefore WUE, thus consuming more water and causing a greater decrease of surface runoff than in the fixed-lower CO2 case. In the semi-humid climate, NPP also increases but by a smaller amount than in the semiarid climate. Plant transpiration (ET) and total evapotranspiration (E) decrease in the elevated CO2 environment, yielding the increase of runoff. This asymmetry of the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 exacerbates drying in the semiarid climate and enhances wetness in the semi-humid climate. Furthermore, plant WUE (=NPP/ET) is found to be nearly invariant to climate but primarily a function of the atmospheric CO2 concentration, a result suggesting a strong constraint of atmospheric CO2 on biophysical properties of the Earth system. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Budget control; Earth (planet); Evapotranspiration; Runoff; Vegetation; Water supply; Biophysical properties; CO2 concentration; Loess plateau of chinas; Net primary production; Plant transpiration; Semi-arid climate; Surface water balances; Vegetation growth; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; evapotranspiration; net primary production; semiarid region; water use efficiency; woody plant; China; Jing Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068194119

Meanwhile, as a quickly developing region in China, Guangdong Province is also facing multi-pollutant conditions, which seriously affect the atmospheric degradation of the materials in this region. It is therefore necessary to identify the key air pollutants that affect the atmospheric corrosivity of Guangdong Province and to propose targets of air pollutant control. An analysis of the environmental data and corrosion rates in Guangdong Province showed that the atmospheric corrosivity of the entire region is closely related to the presence of sulfur dioxide (SO2)and ozone (O3). In addition, a superposition model was utilised to reflect the synergistic effect of SO2 and O3, and a superimposed map of both pollutants was drawn to demonstrate their amount. To control the corrosion rate of carbon steel and avoid exceeding the C2 classification in ISO 9223, the following targets of air pollutant control are proposed: an SO2 concentration of lower than 10 μg m−3 and an O3 level of lower than 85 μg m−3. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric corrosion; Multi-pollutants; Superimposed map","Air pollution control; Atmospheric corrosion; Atmospheric humidity; Corrosion rate; Corrosion resistance; Ozone; Pollution induced corrosion; Steel corrosion; Sulfur dioxide; Atmospheric corrosivity; Atmospheric degradation; Developing regions; Environmental data; Material corrosion; Multi-pollutants; Superposition model; Synergistic effect; Air pollution; carbon; ozone; steel; sulfur dioxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); corrosion; map; ozone; pollution control; sulfur dioxide; air pollutant; air pollution control; Article; chemical analysis; China; concentration (parameter); corrosion; degradation; air pollution; analysis; corrosion; environmental monitoring; heat; humidity; particulate matter; procedures; China; Guangdong; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Corrosion; Environmental Monitoring; Hot Temperature; Humidity; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Sulfur Dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065890048

The fault-controlled Pb-Zn orebodies are mainly hosted in Upper Paleozoic carbonate formations. In order to reveal the mineralization type and metallogenesis of this deposit, multi-isotopic (S, Pb, H and O) analyses on typical ore and gangue minerals were conducted. The average ore sulfide δ34SΣS value is 4.3‰, suggestive of magmatic sulfur. The ore sulfide Pb isotope compositions are homogeneous, with the 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb values of 18 501 to 18 673 15.707 to 15 798, and 38 911 to 39.428, respectively. Lead isotope model ages of the ore sulfides (240-220 Ma) are consistent with the timing of regional Triassic S-type granite emplacement (250-220 Ma), suggesting that the metals may have been granite-derived. The quartz δDV-SMOW (-82.4‰ to -70.5‰) and δ18OH2O (-0.4‰ to +6.4‰) values suggest that the ore-forming fluids were composed of mixed magmatic and meteoric waters. Combined with the geological features of the Pb-Zn deposit in the region, we propose that the Pb-Zn deposits belong to magmatic-hydrothermal type, rather than MVT-type as previously suggested. The Triassic granites may have contributed the ore-forming material and heat that drove the hydro-thermal system. The ore-forming fluids may have migrated into interlayer faults and fractures of the carbonate strata, diluted by subsurface meteoric water and deposited successively the vein-type and stratiform-type Pb-Zn ores. © 2019, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, Part of Springer Nature.","Binh Do deposit; geochemistry; isotope; northern Vietnam; Pb-Zn belt; Triassic granitoids","geochemistry; granitoid; hydrogen; isotopic analysis; lead; metallogenesis; ore deposit; oxygen; sulfur; Triassic; zinc; Thai Nguyen; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065976373

We investigate total emissions rather than per capita emissions or ambient concentrations since it is total emissions that the environment cares about. Energy efficiency is estimated using stochastic frontier analysis and decomposed into both persistent and transient efficiency. We then investigate the long-run dynamics among SO2 emissions, economic growth, and energy efficiency by employing the panel-based error correction model and taking the effects of cyclical variations into account. Our analysis shows that GDP has a positive impact on total SO2 emissions in the short run and gains in energy efficiency have a significant negative effect on emissions in the long run. By controlling the effects of the business cycle, the effects of GDP on emissions remain positive in both the short and long run. The cross-sectional analysis provides similar insights. We argue that economic growth itself is an emission generator. Therefore, the government needs to establish a long-run strategy to curb emissions by improving energy efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy efficiency; Error-correction model; Stochastic frontier analysis; Sulphur dioxide emissions","Economics; Error correction; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Sulfur determination; Sulfur dioxide; Ambient concentrations; Cross sectional analysis; Cyclical variation; Economic growths; Environment care; Error correction models; Panel-based error correction models; Stochastic frontier analysis; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065060938

Here we show that lines with the normal 1RS arm have longer roots than lines with the 1RSRW arm in both field and hydroponic experiments. In the 1RSRW lines, differences in seminal root length were associated with a developmentally regulated arrest of the root apical meristem (RAM). Approximately 10 d after germination, the seminal roots of the 1RSRW plants showed a gradual reduction in elongation rate, and stopped growing a week later. Seventeen days after germination, the roots of the 1RSRW plants showed altered gradients of reactive oxygen species and emergence of lateral roots close to the RAM, suggesting changes in the root meristem. The 1RSRW lines also showed reduced biomass (estimated by the normalized difference vegetation index) and grain yield relative to the 1RS lines, with larger differences under reduced or excessive irrigation than under normal irrigation.

In order to take advantage of this relatively steady source of thermal energy underground for utilization in heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, a hybrid ground source heat pump (HGSHP) system is designed and assembled in Transient System Simulation tool (TRNSYS). Ground source heat pump (GSHP) system provides buildings with more efficient heating and cooling comfort at a higher coefficient of performance (COP) comparing to conventional HVAC units such as furnace, electrical resistance or air source heat pump. In order to improve the overall performance, various auxiliary components can be coupled to the original system to assemble a hybrid system. In this design, the system is presented as a horizontal ground loop in parallel with a liquid dry cooler. The flow of the working fluid of the hybrid system is controlled by a newly-developed type in TRNSYS, which serves as a functional part to improve the overall performance of the hybrid system.

Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States","States will disagree about deployment of solar geoengineering, technologies that would reflect a small portion of incoming sunlight to reduce risks of climate change, and most disagreements will be grounded in conflicting interests. States that object to deployment will have many options to oppose it, so states favouring deployment will have a powerful incentive to meet their objections. Objections rooted in opposition to the anticipated unequal consequences of deployment may be met through compensation, yet climate policy is inhospitable to compensation via liability. We propose that multilateral parametric climate risk insurance might be a useful tool to facilitate agreement on solar geoengineering deployment. With parametric insurance, predetermined payouts are triggered when climate indices deviate from set ranges. We suggest that states favouring deployment could underwrite reduced-rate parametric climate insurance. This mechanism would be particularly suited to resolving disagreements based on divergent judgments about the outcomes of proposed implementation. This would be especially relevant in cases where disagreements are rooted in varying levels of trust in climate model predictions of solar geoengineering effectiveness and risks. Negotiations over the pricing and terms of a parametric risk pool would make divergent judgments explicit and quantitative. Reduced-rate insurance would provide a way for states that favour implementation to demonstrate their confidence in solar geoengineering by underwriting risk transfer and ensuring compensation without the need for attribution. This would offer a powerful incentive for states opposing implementation to moderate their opposition. Key policy insights States favouring deployment of solar geoengineering will need to address other states’ objections—unilateralism is implausible in practice This might be partially achieved using parametric climate risk insurance based on objective indicators A sovereign risk pool offering reduced-rate parametric insurance underwritten by states backing deployment could facilitate cooperation on solar geoengineering deployment States favouring deployment would demonstrate their confidence in solar geoengineering by supporting the risk pool Opposing states would be insured against solar geoengineering risks and proposing states would be incentivized to guard against overconfidence. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","insurance and risk; policy interactions / integration; Solar geoengineering","climate modeling; climate prediction; environmental economics; environmental policy; insurance system; policy analysis; policy approach; risk factor; solar power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064734366

Design/methodology/approach: A content analysis is the main research method for this study. Once all qualifying terms listed on the company website were recorded based on LEED credit and category, the data were synthesized to create a sustainability continuum organizing the firms based on the extent to which they communicate sustainability initiatives on their respective websites. Findings: The results demonstrate that the majority of the largest 50 apartment management firms in the USA are not communicating any sustainability initiatives on their website. In all, 52 percent of companies have no acknowledgment of sustainability initiatives on their website; 16 percent of companies provide some cursory reference to sustainability initiatives; 16 percent offer some detail on their website; 6 percent contain in-depth detail plus metrics. The remaining 10 percent of firms are providing comprehensive sustainability reporting on their websites. Practical implications: Property management companies have an immense opportunity to capitalize on showcasing their green building features via company websites. Not only does incorporating environmental sustainability practices support a climate mitigation strategy, marketing these practices can foster consumer satisfaction and a willingness to pay more. With the awareness that opportunity abounds both to mitigate negative environmental externalities and complement financial goals of apartment property management companies, this research sheds light for property management companies and related parties of missed opportunities in the environmental sustainability space. Originality/value: The analysis presented in this paper is one of the first to the author’s knowledge to explore the degree which property management companies are promoting green real estate management services through website communication. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Apartments; Multifamily housing; Property management; Sustainability; Virtual communication",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067003184

Plant functional traits related to water influences individual performance, community composition, and can provide insight into which species will be most vulnerable to drought. Methods: Here, we used a trait-based approach to examine key water-related traits of five perennial grasses of the Colorado Plateau, with the goals of identifying functional trait syndromes, and assessing vulnerability to drought. We examined 14 traits including hydraulic, above- and belowground biomass, and morphology, then assessed how these traits varied by species, and photosynthetic pathway. Results: Individual water-related traits varied widely, but did not consistently vary by photosynthetic pathway. We identified three unique functional trait syndromes that could be classified as either conservative or non-conservative with regard to water use. Conclusions: Variation in water-related traits may be key to the coexistence of species in drylands, but there is uncertainty as which traits or functional trait syndromes will be most vulnerable to changes in climate. Based on the traits examined here, and forecast changes in climate for the region, we predict that the cool-season, C3 grasses will be most vulnerable in this drying, more drought-prone region. © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Aboveground; Belowground; Drylands; Hydraulic; Morphology; Roots","aboveground production; belowground production; comparative study; dominance; drought resistance; drought stress; grass; hydraulic conductivity; limiting factor; root architecture; Colorado Plateau; United States; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071032702

In addition to health problems, high aerosol loading can impact visibility and thus reduce photolysis rates over the city, leading to potential implications for photochemistry. Photolysis rates are highly sensitive not only to the vertical distribution of aerosols but also to their composition, as this can impact how the incoming solar radiation is scattered or absorbed. This study, for the first time, uses aerosol composition measurements and lidar optical depth to drive the Fast-JX photolysis scheme and quantify the photochemical impacts of different aerosol species during the Air Pollution and Human Health (APHH) measurement campaigns in Beijing in November-December 2016 and May-June 2017. This work demonstrates that severe haze pollution events (PM2,5 &gt; 75 μgm-3) occur during both winter and summer, leading to reductions in O3 photolysis rates of 27 %-34% (greatest in winter) and reductions in NO2 photolysis of 40 %-66% (greatest in summer) at the surface. It also shows that in spite of much lower PM2,5 concentrations in the summer months, the absolute changes in photolysis rates are larger for both O3 and NO2. In the winter, absorbing species such as black carbon dominate the photolysis response to aerosols, leading to mean reductions in J [O1D] and J[NO2] in the lowest 1 km of 24% and 23 %, respectively. In contrast, in the summer, scattering aerosol such as organic matter dominate the response, leading to mean decreases of 2 %-3% at the surface and increases of 8 %-10% at higher altitudes (3-4 km). During these haze events in both campaigns, the influence of aerosol on photolysis rates dominates over that from clouds. These large impacts on photochemistry can have significant implications for concentrations of important atmospheric oxidants such as the hydroxyl radical. Idealized photochemical box model studies show that such large impacts on photochemistry could lead to a 12% reduction in surface O3 (3% for OH) due to haze pollution. This highlights that PM2,5 mitigation strategies could have important implications for the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere both at the surface and in the free troposphere. © 2019 Author(s).

The findings are relevant for local and central governments to improve their communication strategies, which to date have been focused on providing data about outdoor air pollution aggregated at the city level.

However, there is lack of study investigating the summer effect on mortality associated with mental/behavioral disorders, especially in cities with subtropical climate. In addition, summer mortality in subtropical cities is different from tropical cities, and previous studies have not investigated the urban environmental inequality on heat mortality associated with mental/behavioral disorders. A register-based study was developed to estimate the temperature effects on decedents on days with 50th percentile of average daily temperature between 2007 and 2014 in Hong Kong (n = 133,359). Poisson regression was firstly applied to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) from the summer temperature effects on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, respiratory mortality, and mortality associated with mental/behavioral disorders. For a 1 °C increase in average temperature on days with temperature ≥ 24.51 °C, IRRs of mortality associated with mental and behavioral disorders on lag 0 and lag 1 days were 1.033 [1.004, 1.062] and 1.030 [1.002, 1.060], while temperature effects on cardiovascular mortality and respiratory mortality during normal summer days (not extreme heat events) were not significant. A further investigation with linear regression has shown that decedents with mental/behavioral disorders on higher temperature days resided in areas with lower percentage of sky view, lower percentage of vegetation cover, higher level of neighborhood-level PM2.5, higher level of neighborhood-level NO, and higher level of neighborhood-level black carbon (BC).

It becomes imperative to understand the drought characteristics as well as water resource availability in such regions. In this paper, we employ trend analysis to investigate the tendency of Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) and Climatic Water Balance (CWB) from 1979 to 2017 in the Jhelum river basin. We applied Thornthwaite parameterization which is based on latitude and monthly mean temperature for the computation of PET. The results showed that annual PET of Srinagar and Quazigund stations has increasing tendency while annual CWB has decreasing tendency for all the selected stations in the basin. The trend test applied to monthly PET and CWB indicate that monthly PET has increasing tendency in most of the months while monthly CWB has decreasing tendency in most of the months for all the selected stations in the basin. In addition to this, the drought events were characterized using Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI) based on 3, 6 and 12-month time scales. The SPEI was also applied to investigate the spatio-temporal characteristics of drought during the study period in the basin. The spatial patterns of drought severity were derived based on the Average Recurrence Interval (ARI). The temporal analysis revealed that an average of 65 long term, 69 intermediate term and 74 short term drought events were observed across the basin. However the spatial characteristics indicated that drought becomes more severe with long return periods in the western part of the basin. This study also investigated the influence of large scale climatic variables on 3 month SPEI over the basin using cross wavelet analysis. The results show that the drought characteristics are significantly influenced by both the ENSO and ENSO-M events throughout the Jhelum basin. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Climatic water balance; Drought characteristics; Jhelum basin; Potential evapotranspiration; Standardized precipitation evaporation index","drought; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global warming; human activity; potential evapotranspiration; resource availability; spatiotemporal analysis; water budget; water resource; wavelet analysis; India; Jhelum River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068678795

Here we combine hydrological and climate model simulations to evaluate risks to the water supply under projected shifts in the climate at the Paris Agreement warming levels. Modelling the primary surface water sources for Melbourne, Australia, we project that the risk of severe water supply shortage to the climate-dependent portion of the system increases substantially as global warming increases from 1.5 °C to 2.0 °C. Risks are further exacerbated by increases in water demand but substantially ameliorated by supply augmentation from desalination. We demonstrate that reductions in precipitation, rising temperature and growth in water demand combine to substantially amplify the risk of severe water supply shortage under near-term global warming in the absence of a climate-independent supply. This risk amplification is not as apparent in assessments based on meteorological drought alone.

Advances in nanomaterial synthesis and characterization have enabled researchers to screen effects of elemental composition, size, and surface chemistry on catalyst performance. However, direct links from structure and active state to catalytic function are difficult to establish. To this end, operando spectroscopic techniques, those conducted simultaneously as catalysts operate, can provide key complementary information by investigating electrocatalysis under turnover conditions. In particular, Raman and infrared spectroscopy have the potential to reveal the identity of surface-bound intermediates, catalyst active state, and possible reaction sites to supplement the insights extracted from conventional electrochemistry. Such research aims to work in tandem synthetic and catalytic efforts to guide the development of next-generation CO2 electrocatalytic systems through rational design.

The novelty of this paper is the investigation of the pollutant emission reduction effects of environmental taxes in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and Chinese provinces at the same time, and further comparison of the pollutant emission reduction effects of environmental taxes in OECD and China under different environmental tax collection scales, industrial added value levels, and economic development conditions based on Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag Modelling Approach (ARDL). The data are derived from environmental taxes and pollutants of OECD countries from 1994 to 2016 and Chinese provinces from 2004 to 2016. The results show that from the overall regression results, environmental taxes really help to reduce pollutant emissions, both in OECD countries and China. From the grouping regression results, the OECD countries and Chinese inland provinces with small-scale or medium-level of environmental tax revenue and higher level of economic growth all show better emission reduction effects, while OECD countries with low industrial added value and Chinese inland provinces with high industrial added value have more significant effects on pollutant emission reduction via environmental taxes. © 2019 by the authors.","Effectiveness of emission reduction; Environmental tax; International comparison","economic growth; emission control; environmental tax; governance approach; international comparison; OECD; panel data; pollutant removal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070737986

Vegetarians and vegans have a lower risk of many nutrition-related chronic diseases that are epidemic while vegetarian and vegan diets are associated with reduced environmental impact. Despite this strong diet-disease and diet-environment connection, it is not known if dietetics students are taught the principles of vegetarian and vegan nutrition. The overarching goal of our study was to investigate curricular practices in accredited dietetics training programs in the United States (U.S.) including (1) the prevalence and perceived importance of vegetarian and vegan nutrition instruction and (2) if program directors connect vegetarian and vegan diets to climate change mitigation and resource conservation. Primary data were collected by way of a cross-sectional, Internet-based survey. All Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) program directors in the U.S. (N = 574) were sent a 37-question survey and invited to participate in the study. Outcome measures included the prevalence of vegetarian and vegan nutrition instruction, quantifying if relationships exist among variables, and the frequency of connecting vegetarian and vegan diets to environmental impact. Descriptive and inferential statistics were utilized. Respondents (n = 205) indicated that over 51% of programs teach vegetarian nutrition while 49% teach vegan nutrition. There were significant differences between program type and the prevalence of vegetarian (p = 0.00005) and vegan (p = 0.00005) nutrition instruction. Over 90% of program directors believe that vegetarian and vegan nutrition should be taught. Over 50% of programs identify the connection between vegetarian and vegan diets in climate change mitigation and resource conservation. Most ACEND program directors believe vegetarian and vegan nutrition should be taught and half connect diet to environmental concern. Nevertheless, there is a discrepancy between beliefs and practice behaviors. These results suggest the need for increased collaboration and the use of novel techniques that better incorporate vegan and vegetarian nutrition throughout dietetics education. © Copyright © 2019 Hawkins, Mangels, Goldman and Wood.","dietetics education; dietetics practice; plant-based nutrition; vegan nutrition; vegetarian nutrition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072722593

Characterized by widespread and diverse conifer forests, burning within this region may lead to significant terpenoid emissions. Terpenoids constitute a major class of highly reactive secondary organic aerosol (SOA) precursors, with significant structure-dependent variability in reactivity and SOA-formation potential. In this study, highly speciated measurements of terpenoids emitted from laboratory and prescribed fires were achieved using two-dimensional gas chromatography. Nearly 100 terpenoids were measured in smoke samples from 71 fires, with high variability in the dominant compounds. Terpenoid emissions were dependent on plant species and tissues. Canopy/needle-derived emissions dominated in the laboratory fires, whereas woody-tissue-derived emissions dominated in the prescribed fires. Such differences likely have implications for terpenoid emissions from high vs low intensity fires and suggest that canopy-dominant laboratory fires may not accurately represent terpenoid emissions from prescribed fires or wildland fires that burn with low intensity. Predicted SOA formation was sensitive to the diversity of emitted terpenoids when compared to assuming a single terpene surrogate. Given the demonstrated linkages between fuel type, fire terpenoid emissions, and the subsequent implications for plume chemistry, speciated measurements of terpenoids in smoke derived from diverse ecosystems and fire regimes may improve air quality predictions downwind of wildland fires. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Air quality; Forestry; Gas chromatography; Laboratories; Lipids; Smoke; Tissue; Air quality prediction; Formation potential; Mixed-conifer forests; Prescribed fires; Secondary organic aerosols; Structure dependent; Two dimensional gas chromatography; Western United States; Fires; 3 carene; beta pinene; camphene; limonene; myrcene; terpenoid; terpene; aerosol; air quality; coniferous forest; emission; laboratory method; measurement method; prescribed burning; smoke; terpene; wildfire; Abies; air quality; Article; biomass; conifer; Douglas fir; ecosystem; fire; forest; gas chromatography; mass spectrometry; oak; plume; ponderosa pine; precursor; secondary organic aerosol; smoke; air pollutant; forest; wildfire; Coniferophyta; Air Pollutants; Coniferophyta; Ecosystem; Fires; Forests; Terpenes; Wildfires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071707958

Conventionally, the undated timbers (from a building or woodland) are sequentially matched against one another, using t-tests to identify the relative offsets with the ‘best’ match, thus producing a ’site’ chronology. A date estimate is obtained when this is matched to a local master chronology of known calendar age. Many tree-ring sequences in the UK produce rather low t-values and are thus declared not to have a ‘best’ match to a master chronology. Motivated by this and the routine use of Bayesian statistical methods to provide a probabilistic approach to radiocarbon dating, this paper investigates the practicality of Bayesian dendrochronology. We explore a previously published model for the relationship between ring widths and the underlying climatic signal, implementing it within the Bayesian framework via a simulation-based approach. Probabilities for a match at each offset are produced, removing the need to identify a single ‘best’ match. The Bayesian model proves successful at matching in both simulated and real examples. © 2019 University of Oxford","Bayesian statistics; Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation; prior information; statistical models; tree-ring dating","Bayesian analysis; computer simulation; dendrochronology; Markov chain; Monte Carlo analysis; numerical model; radiocarbon dating; timber; tree ring; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063000839

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from road transport increased by 84.3% between 1990 and 2016. This increase in GHG emissions was the highest among the different energy sub-sectors of New Zealand. Increasing energy consumption and GHG emissions are due to the gradual increase in population, car-dependent low-density development, lack of integrated public transport networks, inappropriate policy interventions and so on. These factors are making it difficult to reduce emissions from this sector. This study investigates (i) major drivers of transport sector emissions, including how drivers differ from those affecting other developed countries; (ii) a mitigation policy roadmap to achieve future emissions reduction targets; and (iii) mitigation policy initiatives by the government, and policy gaps. To identify the key drivers from a set of drivers, this study uses a vector error correction model (VECM). The Granger causality test reveals that the fuel economy of the New Zealand passenger vehicle fleet has a significant causal relationship with transport emissions. Introduction of a number of policies such as a feebate scheme and/or a high minimum fuel economy standard could effectively alter this causal relationship in the short term, along with other measures such as urban planning changes for medium-term impact. This study aims to help policy makers identify the most tractable factors driving transport emissions and alternative policy options suitable for emissions mitigation. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Emission factors; Fuel efficiency; Greenhouse gas; Mitigation policies; New Zealand; Road transport","emission control; energy use; error correction; greenhouse gas; pollution policy; road transport; standard (regulation); traffic emission; New Zealand; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; New Zealand; traffic and transport; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; New Zealand; Transportation; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068114795

Investigating the non-stationarity and better estimating the changes of the extreme precipitation are valuable for informing policy decisions. In this study, two precipitation indices are employed to describe the extreme events, including maximum 5-day precipitation amount (RX5day) and the number of very heavy precipitation days (R20). The generalized additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) is employed to characterize non-stationarities in extreme precipitation events and related climate indices in 13 stations in the Hanjiang River basin (HJRB). Three models including stationary model without change (M0), non-stationary models over time (M1) and non-stationarity models with large-scale climate indices (M2) as predictors, respectively, are considered to analyse occurrence rates of extreme precipitation. The optimal model and the significant predictors were selected by the Akaike information criterion (AIC). To investigate the main predictors at regional scale, the homogeneous subregions for precipitation extremes are identified by clustering analysis. Results indicate that: (a) the non-stationarities of RX5day series and R20 series at all stations are identified in the HJRB; (b) extreme precipitation behaviour is significantly influenced by climate indices and non-stationary model 2 to describe the changes of extreme precipitation is better than non-stationary model 1, indicating the impact of large-scale climate forcing on the changes of extreme precipitation regimes; (c) the HJRB can be categorized into three homogenous regions. The optimal distributions and the main predictors of extreme precipitation events in most stations of each subregion are basically the same; (d) the dominated climate indices influencing the extreme precipitation events are different in different regions and have regional patterns. The results highlight the modelling of extreme precipitation events under non-stationarity conditions and provide information for developing strategies of mitigation and adaptation to climate change impacts on extreme precipitation. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","climate indices; extreme precipitation; GAMLSS; Hanjiang River Basin; non-stationarity","Climate models; Precipitation (meteorology); Rivers; Watersheds; Climate index; Extreme precipitation; GAMLSS; Hanjiang rivers; Non-stationarities; Climate change; climate change; climate forcing; climate modeling; climate prediction; extreme event; precipitation intensity; spatial distribution; China; Han River [Hubei-Shaanxi]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063993015

Applying a whole process treatment perspective, this paper decomposes industrial SO2 emissions into six specific driving factors in three whole process treatment dimensions (i.e. source prevention, process control, and end-of-pipe treatment), and economic scale. A temporal index decomposition analysis (Temporal-IDA), attribution analysis (AA), and spatial index decomposition analysis (Spatial-IDA) methods are then applied to quantify each dimension's treatment effect and its spatial differences. The empirical study across 30 regions in China using data from 2005 to 2015 shows that: (1) The end-of-pipe treatment is the dominant dimension for decreasing industrial SO2 emissions, followed by process control. The contribution of source prevention to reduce industrial SO2 emissions has begun to appear, however, there remains room for further improvement; (2) End-of-pipe treatment strength and energy intensity are key factors in reducing industrial SO2 emissions; Inner Mongolia, Henan, and Shandong are the main contributors; (3) The treatment emphasis are different among regions; as such, there are different treatment effects across the three dimensions of the whole process treatment. Regions can be classified into four categories: the Leading type, Process-dependent type, End-dependent type, and Lagging type. Based on the empirical results, this paper identifies the policy implications of promoting whole process treatment on China's industrial SO2 emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Driving factor; Industrial SO2; Temporal-spatial decomposition; Whole process treatment","decomposition analysis; emission control; industrial emission; pollution policy; spatiotemporal analysis; sulfur dioxide; article; decomposition; empiricism; Inner Mongolia; prevention; process control; quantitative analysis; air pollutant; China; industry; spatial analysis; China; Henan; Nei Monggol; Shandong; Air Pollutants; China; Industry; Spatial Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066130582

This topic gained pertinence in recent years due to increased installation rates worldwide with the highest growth rates in non-moderate climates. As PV components are not optimized to the respective climate zone, the target of the project is to gather failure data from PV installations in various climate zones. A standardized data input was achieved by using an extended format of the IEA PVPS Task 13 failure survey, allowing to enter PV system and failure information in rich detail. The components’ and failure structure were elaborated by combining input from reliability workshop proceedings, PVPS Task 13 and project partners’ experience in PV reliability testing. These structures were mapped into a database to collect and prepare the input for further statistical analysis. Collected data was filtered, offering a tidy data set of 1048 samples from 340 sub-systems from 45 countries worldwide. After data filtering, a power loss evaluation, a cluster analysis and a trend analysis were performed.

Extending the laminar flow region over airframes is a potential way to reduce the skin friction drag, which in turn reduces fuel burn and greenhouse gas emissions. This paper introduces a numerical framework that includes the modeling of transition effects for high Reynolds number flows in a high-fidelity, Reynolds–averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) aerodynamic design framework. The CFD solver uses a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element approach and includes goal-oriented adaptation. The Spalart–Allmaras (SA) turbulence model is used for the closure of the governing equations. In the flow stability analysis, the nonlocal, nonparallel effects that characterize boundary layers are accounted for by using the parabolized stability equations (PSE). Transition onset is obtained through an eN method based on the PSE computations, while a smooth intermittency function includes the transition region length. Numerical results for the NLF(1)-0416 airfoil present good agreement with experimental data, improving the computations when compared to fully-turbulent ones. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","Discontinuous Galerkin; Mesh adaptation; Parabolized stability equations; RANS modeling; Transition to turbulence","Aerodynamics; Boundary layers; Computational fluid dynamics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Laminar flow; Navier Stokes equations; Reynolds number; Skin friction; Stability; Turbulence models; Discontinuous galerkin; Mesh adaptation; Parabolized stability equations; RANS modeling; Transition to turbulence; Galerkin methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065922109

As a critical constraint to urban atmospheric CO2 inversion studies, bottom-up spatiotemporally explicit emissions data products are also necessary to construct comprehensive urban CO2 emission information systems useful for trend detection and emissions verification. The ""Hestia Project"" is an effort to provide bottom-up granular fossil fuel (FFCO2) emissions for the urban domain with building/street and hourly space-time resolution. Here, we report on the latest urban area for which a Hestia estimate has been completed - the Los Angeles megacity, encompassing five counties: Los Angeles County, Orange County, Riverside County, San Bernardino County and Ventura County. We provide a complete description of the methods used to build the Hestia FFCO2 emissions data product for the years 2010-2015. We find that the LA Basin emits 48.06 (±5:3) MtC yr-1, dominated by the on-road sector. Because of the uneven spatial distribution of emissions, 10% of the largest-emitting grid cells account for 93.6 %, 73.4 %, 66.2 %, and 45.3% of the industrial, commercial, on-road, and residential sector emissions, respectively. Hestia FFCO2 emissions are 10.7% larger than the inventory estimate generated by the local metropolitan planning agency, a difference that is driven by the industrial and electricity production sectors. The detail of the Hestia-LA FFCO2 emissions data product offers the potential for highly targeted, efficient urban greenhouse gas emissions mitigation policy.

This paper deals with the design of the state observer of the CO2 absorption system in the environment control and life support system of the space station. The main design difficulty is that the dynamic model of the CO2 absorption system is described by the partial differential equation, which causes to the traditional state observer based on ordinary differential equation is no longer applicable. In order to solve this problem, an infinite dimensional slide mode observer algorithm is proposed. This algorithm firstly uses a new projection approximation method to transform the partial differential equation to ordinary differential equation, and then estimates the system state by using sliding mode observer with better robustness to the model approximation error and external disturbance. Compared with the traditional algorithm, the proposed method not only applies to the more general case, e.g. the case of non-orthogonal basis, but also effectively reduces the influence of approximation error and disturbances. Next, the detail realization procedure is illustrated by using a simulation example. The simulation results show that the new algorithm can effectively estimate the state of the CO2 absorption system and further guarantee robust to the model error and external disturbances. © 2019 IAA","CO2 absorption system; Environment control and life support system; Infinite dimensional slide mode observer; Nonlinear observer; State estimator","Approximation algorithms; Carbon dioxide; Errors; Ordinary differential equations; Partial differential equations; Space stations; State estimation; CO2 absorption; Environment control and life supports; Non-linear observer; Slide mode observers; State Estimators; Life support systems (spacecraft)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066443191

A field research was conducted to assess the effectiveness of VEBs on reducing downwind transport of particulate matter (PM) from a ventilated poultry house in Changchun. Five plant species transferred from local area were used to establish five diverse VEBs and separately installed outside of the ventilation fans in summer 2017. The five plant species were Winged Euonymus (WE), Malus Spectabilis (MS), Padus Maackii (PAA), Acer Saccharum Marsh (ASM), and Padus Virginiana “Red Select Shrub” (PV_RSS). The mass concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm and 10 μm or less, respectively) were monitored at downwind and upwind sampling locations around the VEB. The results showed that with the presenting of VEBs, the particle concentrations at the downwind sampling point were significantly reduced compared with that at the upwind sampling point (p &lt; 0.05). Specifically, compared to the control test without VEB, the VEB with PV_RSS had the best PM concentration reduction rate (CRR) of 47.24%±4.33% and 41.13%±5.83% for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. The rough surface of plant leaves may help intercept more PM, though it was also affected by other factors (such as the blade angle, the interaction with wind) needed to be further investigated. The VEB with PV_RSS, which presented the best capacity of CRR, selectively intercepted PM, mainly related to the elements of N, Na, Mg, P, S, and Cl. Implications: Five plant species, including WE, PAA, MS, ASM, and PV_RSS, were evaluated as VEBs to mitigate particulate emissions from outside of a ventilated poultry house in Changchun. They all significantly reduced particulate matter emissions. However, the PV_RSS presented the best capability of trapping fine and coarse particles: PM2.5 and PM10, respectively, while the PAA was the worst one. The microstructure of leaves affected particle deposition and remaining on the leaves, and PV_RSS selectively intercepted particulate matter mainly related to certain elements. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

In this work, a self-templated carbonization strategy for synthesizing heterostructures of transition metal phosphide@nitrogen/phosphorus dual-doped carbon quasiaerogels (TMP@NPCA) is presented using a rationally designed precursor of a metallogel with Zn/M (M = Co, Fe, and Ni) bimetallic clusters (BMOG) and nitrogen/phosphorus chelate ligands.

Samples were collected in different seasons for 1 year. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) was used to perform the measurement of 16 priority PAHs. Average PAH concentrations were ranged from 0.71 to 2.99 ng/m3 in air and 1.59–22.7 ng/g in soil respectively. High levels of PAHs were found in soil compared to air, which indicated deposition in soil. This could be because of the fallout of high-molecular-weight compounds. During the monsoons, PAH concentrations in the air were the lowest compared to the other seasons because of the dilution effect. Phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrenes were dominant in the air, contributing up to 32.5%, 22.7%, and 19.2% of total PAHs, respectively. On the other hand, soils contained fluoranthene (12.3%), pyrene (10.7%), benzo[b]fluoranthene (10%), chrysene (9.82%), and indeno[123-c,d]pyrene (9.64%) compounds. The occurrence of indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (9.14 ng/g) indicated that the soil is contaminated from fly ash and diesel emissions from the thermal power plant and vehicular emission. The diagnostic ratios, thematic maps, and principal component analysis revealed that the fly ash, diesel emissions from the thermal power plant, vehicles, and biomass burning were the probable sources of PAHs in the study area. The human health risk assessment studies reveal that the soil samples are more prone to carcinogenicity than air samples. As per our knowledge, this is the first report on the impact of PAHs on air and soil in this region. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","GC-MS; Human health risk assessment; India; PAHs; Passive air sampler; Thematic mapping","airborne thematic mapper; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; chemical composition; coal-fired power plant; fluoranthene; gas chromatography; health risk; mass spectrometry; PAH; soil pollution; chrysene; chrysene derivative; coal; fluoranthene; fluorene derivative; phenanthrene; phenanthrene derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; pyrene; pyrene derivative; electric power plant; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; human; India; mass fragmentography; pollutant; risk assessment; soil; soil pollutant; Chrysenes; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorenes; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Humans; India; Phenanthrenes; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Power Plants; Pyrenes; Risk Assessment; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067299010

Indonesia as a developing country has committed to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 29 percent by the year 2030. This calls into question the extent of how the cities or local governments can cope with the challenges of the current transport sector climate change mitigation in Bandung City. This paper aims to assess the governance context of climate policies in Bandung City and support further co-benefits. The preliminary stage of study shows that the policies in reducing GHG emissions are not in accordance with what was written by the government. The provincial and local government was aware that the stipulation delivered by the central government regarding mitigation on climate change stated in the regulation both in provincial and local level. Based on the actor's characteristic, the policies that encourage to reduce GHG emissions drive as a multi-actor interaction process namely The Paratransit, Trans Metro Bandung (TMB) and Vehicle Emissions Test. The research design involved an empirical case study on governance and policy relevant to climate change efforts to lower GHG in Bandung City, Indonesia. The analytical framework used for this analysis is the Governance Assessment Tool and the co-benefits approach. Data collection involved semi-structured interviews, a review of policy documents, and secondary quantitative data. The results reveal that the governance qualities create a context that there still are some limits, although several improvements have shown the positive trend at the local level. This is due to the qualities of the extent aspect as a low to moderate, the flexibility as a restrictive, and the coherence and intensity as moderate. The assessment of the criteria of co-benefits is more relevant to the public transport. The TMB has met all of the criteria of co-benefits. Thus, this TMB program has the highest impact to attain the co-benefits. The paratransit has the positive value of the criteria for lowering GHG emissions, energy and environmental sustainability, and development goals. The vehicle emission test met the criteria of sustainability and technical feasibility. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Developing countries; Digital storage; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Sustainable development; Central government; Climate change mitigation; Empirical case studies; Environmental sustainability; Interaction process; Semi structured interviews; Transport sectors; Vehicle emission test; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070997725

Although rising atmospheric CO2 has been proposed as the principal cause, the underlying physiological mechanisms are still being debated, and implications for the global water cycle remain uncertain. Here, we addressed this gap using 30-y tree ring records of carbon and oxygen isotope measurements and basal area increment from 12 species in 8 North American mature temperate forests. Our goal was to separate the contributions of enhanced photosynthesis and reduced stomatal conductance to WUE trends and to assess consistency between multiple commonly used methods for estimating WUE. Our results show that tree ring-derived estimates of increases in WUE are consistent with estimates from atmospheric measurements and predictions based on an optimal balancing of carbon gains and water costs, but are lower than those based on ecosystem-scale flux observations. Although both physiological mechanisms contributed to rising WUE, enhanced photosynthesis was widespread, while reductions in stomatal conductance were modest and restricted to species that experienced moisture limitations. This finding challenges the hypothesis that rising WUE in forests is primarily the result of widespread, CO2-induced reductions in stomatal conductance. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Therefore, we present a method that incorporates Hardware-in-the-Loop simulations where virtual components as models are coupled to real and experimental facilities in real time. By including experimental components, a higher validity can be obtained and the practical applicability of renewable energy scenario can be discussed more profoundly. In this paper, the considered energy system consists of an experimental biocatalytic methanation reactor, a real photovoltaic park, a regenerative fuel cell and short-term storage units to supply a residential district. A representative control sequence of the methanator is obtained by modeling the scenario as an optimal control problem. A first HIL simulation highlights that modifications of the instrumentation are required for a grid injection of the generated methane. The scientific approach can be applied to any energy system where some of the considered components are available as experimental or real facilities. Non-exisiting components are simply replaced by models. The presented approach helps to determine which parts or process parameters are crucial for the planed operation before the overall energy system is realized on a larger scale. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biological methanation; Energy management; HIL simulation; Optimization; Scalable models","Bioinformatics; Energy management; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Hydrogenation; Methanation; Optimal control systems; Optimization; Regenerative fuel cells; Renewable energy resources; Synthetic apertures; Traction (friction); Experimental facilities; HIL simulations; Optimal control problem; Optimized energy managements; Renewable energy systems; Residential districts; Scalable model; Short term storage; Hardware-in-the-loop simulation; alternative energy; catalysis; catalyst; chemical reaction; fuel cell; hardware; methane; modeling; operations technology; optimization; photovoltaic system; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066269707

By combining cyclic voltammetry and in-operando surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy along with MD simulations and DFT calculations, their respective surface attachment, redox chemistry and activity toward electrocatalytic oxygen reduction was investigated. For both porphyrin complexes, it could be shown that catalytic activity is restricted to the first (few) molecular layer(s), although electrodes covered with thiophene-substituted complexes showed a better capability to consume the oxygen at a given overpotential even in thicker films. The spectroscopic data and simulations suggest that both porphyrin complexes attach to a Ag electrode surface in a way that maximum planarity and minimum distance between the catalytic iron site and the electrode is achieved. However, due to the distinctive design of the FeT3ThP complex, the thiophene rings are capable of occupying a conformation, via rotation around the bonding axis to the porphyrin, in which all four sulfur atoms can coordinate to the Ag surface. This effect creates a dense and planar surface coverage of the porphyrin on the electrode facilitating a fast (multi) electron transfer via several covalent Ag-S bonds. In contrast, bulky mesityl groups as peripheral substituents, which have been initially introduced to prevent aggregation and improve catalytic behavior in solution, exert a negative effect on the overall electrocatalytic performance in the immobilized state as a less dense coverage and less stable interactions with the surface are formed. Our results underline the importance of rationally designed heterogenized molecular catalysts to achieve optimal turnover, which not only strictly applies to the here discussed oxygen reduction reaction but eventually holds also true for other energy conversion reactions such as carbon dioxide reduction. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070966873

The near ubiquity of local adaptation suggests that adaptive differentiation may have important consequences for how populations are affected by and respond to changing precipitation. Here, we manipulated rainfall in a common garden to examine how differentiation among populations of common ragweed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia (Asteraceae) affects responses to water availability expected under climate change. We collected seeds from 26 populations along gradients of historical rainfall and used event-based rainout shelters and watering additions to simulate drier summer conditions and more extreme rainfall events, respectively. Ambrosia artemisiifolia had higher fitness on average under reduced rainfall, suggesting it may spread and become more abundant in areas projected to become hotter and drier during the summer months. We also found strong evidence for phenotypic and fitness clines across both latitude and longitude, and that phenological responses and fitness effects of altered rainfall depended on seed source or historical climate. The effect of rainfall treatment on female fitness was highest in western and mid longitudes, but there was little effect on eastern populations. Across latitude, the effect of rainfall treatment on male fitness was highest in southern populations. These phenology and fitness clines suggest that adaptive differentiation across the species’ range has the potential to shape future responses of A. artemisiifolia populations to climate change, particularly altered patterns of rainfall. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Latitudinal gradient; Local adaptation; Local maladaptation; Range limits","climate change; climate effect; ecomorphology; herb; historical perspective; latitudinal gradient; local adaptation; phenotypic plasticity; plant community; rainfall; range size; water availability; Ambrosia artemisiifolia; Asteraceae; acclimatization; adaptation; climate change; plant; ragweed; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Ambrosia; Climate Change; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068842646

However, in the academic literature, there has been little focus on the perceived barriers to climate change action at the household level. Previous research has also highlighted a need for more studies in Latin America. This study contributes to the literature by filling these gaps. In a face-to-face and online survey administered in Nuevo Leon, Mexico, we asked participants what barriers impede their household from taking action to address climate change. Using thematic analysis, seven main barriers were identified: (i) everyday life; (ii) awareness of climate change; (iii) lack of perceived locus of control; (iv) physical limitations of the dwelling; (v) social, (vi) regulatory; and (vii) economic. Given the significant potential effects of climate change in the Nuevo Leon region, a better understanding of the barriers that prevent households from addressing climate change will inform the development of targeted guidelines and strategies to address changing climate. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptation; Barriers to adoption; Climate change; Community response; Developing countries; Household level action; Mexico","adaptation; climate change; community response; developing world; household survey; perception; World Wide Web; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066991616

This paper investigated the effect of injection strategy and intake valve lift (IVL) on super-knock frequency and engine performance through experimental study. The validated numerical models revealed the mechanisms behind experimental results. The results showed that using late second injection under high-IVL condition and early single-injection under low-IVL condition reduced wall wetting and improved mixture homogeneity. This restrained the formation of pre-ignition origins (oil dilution and soot formation were decreased). The tendency of hot-spot self-ignition (local high-temperature region was narrowed) and end-gas detonation combustion (end-gas reactivity was reduced) was suppressed as well. These factors contributed to the reduction of the actual super-knock frequency in experiment. Further, late second injection under high-IVL condition and early single-injection under low-IVL condition also accelerated the flame propagation and promoted the complete combustion of fuel. Thus the dynamic and economic performance improved. CO and soot emissions also reduced, only NOx emission increased. Two-stage injection played the opposite role in engine performance respectively under high-IVL and low-IVL condition. In general, the combination of low-IVL and early single-injection showed the lowest super-knock frequency and best engine performance. © 2019","Engine performance; GDI; Injection strategy; Intake valve lift; Super-knock","Direct injection; Fuels; Ignition; Intake valves; Mixtures; Soot; Wetting; Combustion performance; Economic performance; Engine performance; Experimental and numerical studies; Gasoline direct injection engine(GDI); Intake valve lift; Super-knock; Two stage injection; Combustion knock",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063500499

To reach this index, consumers, business people, city halls, and manufacturers had to work together. However, cities with fewer than 100,000 inhabitants continued to encounter difficulties to carry out the process efficiently. Thus, the objective of this study is to propose new alternatives so that small cities can plan and implement reverse logistics management for unusable tires. The tool used to verify improvement was discrete event simulation, which allowed for the creation of scenarios, experimenting with changes to the consortium’s operation. The analysis confirms that the consortium of cities can have a more efficient process in the destination of tires, with the possibility of reducing costs by 15%, emission of pollutant gases by 71%, and CO2 by 57%. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","City consortium; Discrete event simulation; End-of-life tires; Performance measurement; Reverse logistics; Waste management","decision making; emission; pollutant; simulation; urban area; waste management; Brazil; Brazil; car; city; commercial phenomena; cost; decision making; procedures; waste; waste disposal; waste management; Automobiles; Brazil; Cities; Commerce; Costs and Cost Analysis; Decision Making; Refuse Disposal; Waste Management; Waste Products",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068171424

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the barriers that inhibit the adoption of low-carbon warehousing in Asia-Pacific and their links to carbon abatement performance. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory conceptual model was first developed from a literature review of the general barriers to sustainable supply chain practices and hence potentially in low-carbon warehousing. A large contract logistics services provider in the Asia-Pacific served as the subject of a case study. The perceived barriers to low-carbon warehousing were derived from an internal survey of respondents from the case company and regressed against carbon abatement outcomes at that organization’s operations across the region. Findings: Results show that the case company reduced carbon emissions by 36 percent on a revenue-normalized basis between 2008 and 2014, but with relatively lower success in emerging markets vs mature markets. An Elastic Net regression analysis confirms that technology and government-related factors are the most important barriers in the case company’s efforts to “decarbonize” its local warehousing operations. However, results suggest that the customer-related barrier, which is highly correlated with the government barrier, is in part driven by the latter. Research limitations/implications: This case study is based on a single multinational company in Asia-Pacific, but nonetheless serves as an impetus for more cross-sectional studies to form an industry-wide view. Originality/value: An extended stewardship framework based on the natural resource-based view has been proposed, in which logistics services providers take on a proactive boundary-spanning role to lower the external barriers to low-carbon warehousing. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","3PL; Elastic Net regression; Emerging economies; Logistics social responsibility; Low-carbon warehousing; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070280545

For these reasons, nowadays the power plants are requested to improve their operational flexibility, together with their global efficiency in part-load operation, for ancillary services and to sustain the grid operability. A possible solution for flexibility enhancement is characterized by a highly efficient heat pump integrated in a conventional natural gas combined cycle (CC). Such concept can be applied both to power oriented combined cycle (POCC), to modify the compressor intake temperature with a consequent increase or decrease of the power production, and both to cogeneration CC in association with District Heating Network (DHN). In this work, a statistical analysis of climatic data and their correlations with energy market condition will be performed considering Italian context, to understand which the more suitable conditions for such integrated system are. The analysis will be performed on seasonal and daily basis.

In the present study, climatic reconstruction using the Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP) and the Leaf Margin Analysis (LMA) methods based on the megaflora on one hand and using the Climatic Amplitude Method (CAM) based on the pollen flora on the other hand have been used to check the qualitative climatic estimates based on the comparison between paleovegetation data and similar modern ecosystems. CLAMP and LMA analyses show that the Bernasso climate was colder than the present-day climate of Southern France and of the Hyrcanian and Euxinian regions. On contrary, CAM shows mean annual temperatures higher than the modern Bernasso temperature and equivalent to the temperature of the Hyrcanian and Euxinian regions. Mean annual precipitation and relative humidity reconstructed by CLAMP and CAM are in agreement and indicate that the climate was wetter than today at Bernasso.

The review includes a synthesis of our knowledge regarding the main sources supplying moisture to the Arctic, the changes experienced over the last few decades due to variations in the transport of moisture, the factors that control interannual variability, and the inherent contrast in the mechanisms related to the effect of changes in moisture transport on SIE in the Arctic. We note that the precise identification of the moisture sources for the Arctic depends both on the definition of the Arctic region itself and on the approach used to identify the sources, with the remote regions over the extratropical Atlantic and Pacific Oceans being universally important, as are some continental areas over Siberia and North America. This review also reaffirms the absence of any clear agreement regarding the trends in atmospheric moisture transport to the Arctic, and highlights discrepancies between different data sets and approaches in the quantification of moisture transport, implying that its long-term impact on the intensification of the hydrological cycle in the Arctic remains unclear. We confirm the influence of the major modes of climate variability, planetary circulation patterns, and the changes in cyclonic activity in the variability of moisture transport to the Arctic. We reaffirm that the effect of moisture transport on the Arctic SIE through changes in humidity, cloud cover, and precipitation over the Arctic is a complex scientific problem that requires further detailed study over the decades to come, and we propose some important challenges for future research.

In this paper, using Kenya as the study area, we sought to identify the key drivers that affect greening and browning trends within the 4 main land cover types (agriculture, forest, grassland and shrubland) and within an area characterised by land cover change. The methodological approach used was the random forest classification algorithm, whereby the dependent variable was represented as 4 classes of NDVI greening and browning trends (strong browning, moderate browning, moderate greening, and strong greening). The explanatory variables (n = 28) were broadly grouped into 2 categories, natural and anthropogenic, and included a number of variables as proxies for broad socio-economic development. All models showed strong performance, and the mean values for accuracy and Kappa were 0.96 and 0.95, respectively. Variables that repeatedly featured as the 5 most important variables across the datasets were: travel time to an urban area, distance to towns, distance to roads, distance to rivers, slope and vulnerability to climate change impacts. When the variables were grouped by SDGs, the results obtained showed that the variables grouped under the SDGs 15 (life on land), 8 (economic growth) and 13 (climate action) cumulatively accounted for approximately 80% of the prediction of the greening and browning trends. Our results raise the following considerations to enrich on-going and future policy and planning discussions aimed at addressing LDN: the implementation of LDN should be anchored on tried and tested SLM interventions; further analysis of the drivers of greening and browning trends should be undertaken at the sub-national level; integrated approaches that lead to greater alignment across multiple development priorities, including climate change, should be promoted; and targeted enforcement of environmental legislation is needed to deter processes and activities that are likely to lead to the degradation of land. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Drivers; Kenya; Land degradation-neutrality; NDVI; Random forest",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070732600

The increase in urbanization, the movement of people from rural communities relocating into urban areas, the issue of population density, and a rise in extreme weather are all contributing to these challenges. Although natural and manmade disasters have always existed, the increase in urbanization as a result of the movement of people into urban areas, the resulting increase in population density, and a rise in frequency of extreme weather events are factors that contribute to these challenges. There is a growing field of evidence that individuals experiencing homelessness are disproportionately impacted by disasters due to factors such as exposure to the elements, lack of resources and services, as well as disenfranchisement, and stigma associated with homelessness, all while experiencing greater occurrences of environmental injustice. The shrinking support for funding such services, increasing income inequality between classes, and cultural justifications for criminalizing poverty and homelessness contribute to our collective understanding of disaster vulnerability when experiencing homelessness. Given that there are distinct needs for individuals experiencing homelessness when affected by disasters, this article proposes recommendations for improving policy, research, and services to address these disparities. Trends in income inequality and homelessness have serious implications for planning and response, and recovery from natural or manmade disasters. As such, there is a need to periodically review progress, identify current gaps and unmet needs, and identify opportunities for improvement. © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","advocacy; climate change; disaster; environmental justice; homelessness","advocacy; climate change; environmental justice; environmental policy; extreme event; homelessness; natural disaster; population density; rural population; urban area; urbanization; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070837753

However, differences in building-specific properties (building location, size, construction material, etc.) pose a major challenge in development of generic policy on buildings. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between energy and resource management policies, and building-specific characteristics on environmental impacts of refurbished office buildings in New Zealand. Methods: Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was performed for 17 office buildings operating under seven representative climatic conditions found in New Zealand. Each building was assessed under four policy scenarios: (i) business-as-usual, (ii) use of on-site photovoltaic (PV) panels, (iii) electricity supply from a renewable energy grid, and (iv) best practice construction activities adopted at site. The influence of 15 building-specific characteristics in combination with each scenario was evaluated. The study adopted regression analysis, more specifically Kruskal-Wallis and General Additive Modeling (GAM), to support interpretation of the LCA results. Results and discussion: All the chosen policies can significantly contribute to climate change mitigation as compared to business-as-usual. However, the Kruskal-Wallis results highlight policies on increasing renewable energy sources supplying national grid electricity can substantially reduce the impacts across most environmental impact categories. Better construction practices should be prioritized over PV installation as use of on-site PV significantly increases the environmental impacts related to use of resources. The GAM results show on-site PV could be installed in low-rise buildings in regions with long sunshine hours. The results also show the strong influence of façade elements and technical equipment in determining the environmental performance of small and large buildings, respectively. In large multi-storied buildings, efficient HVAC and smaller window area are beneficial features, while in small buildings the choice of façade materials with low embodied impacts should be prioritized. Conclusions: In general, the study highlighted the importance of policies on increasing renewable energy supply from national grid electricity to substantially reduce most of the impacts related to buildings. In addition, the study also highlighted the importance of better construction practices and building-specific characteristics to reduce the impacts related to resource use. These findings can support policy makers to prioritize strategies to improve the environmental performance of existing buildings in New Zealand and in regions with similar building construction and climate. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Building refurbishment; Construction; Deep retrofit; Energy efficiency; General additive model; Kruskal-Wallis; Life Cycle Assessment; Photovoltaic; Policy making; Regression analysis; Resource management","article; climate change; electricity; environmental impact; life cycle assessment; New Zealand; regression analysis; renewable energy; resource management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059523905

Compacted expansive soils specifically fall short in satisfying the minimum requirements for transport embankment infrastructures, requiring the adoption of hauled virgin mineral aggregates or a sustainable alternative. Use of hauled aggregates comes at a high carbon and economical cost. On average, every 9m high embankment built with quarried/hauled soils cost 12600 MJ.m-2 Embodied Energy (EE). A prospect of using mixed cutting-arising expansive soils with industrial/domestic wastes can reduce the carbon cost and ease the pressure on landfills. The widespread use of recycled materials has been extensively limited due to concerns over their long-term performance, generally low shear strength and stiffness. In this contribution, hydromechanical properties of a waste tyre sandsized rubber (a mixture of polybutadiene, polyisoprene, elastomers, and styrene-butadiene) and expansive silt is studied, allowing the short- and long-term behaviour of optimum compacted composites to be better established. The inclusion of tyre shred substantially decreased the swelling potential/pressure and modestly lowered the compression index. Silt-Tyre powder replacement lowered the bulk density, allowing construction of lighter reinforced earth structures. The shear strength and stiffness decreased on addition of tyre powder, yet the contribution of matric suction to the shear strength remained constant for tyre shred contents up to 20%. Reinforced soils adopted a ductile post-peak plastic behaviour with enhanced failure strain, offering the opportunity to build more flexible subgrades as recommended for expansive soils.

This research describes how the potential for a circular economy in open economies can be estimated by using different assessment methods. Methods and indicators have been selected that have a relevance for one or more of the public policy objectives for circular economy: Openness Index, economic structure, Balassa Index, value chain analysis, substitution potential of Sustainable Materials Management (SMM)strategies, waste treatment scenarios based on physical and hybrid Input-Output (IO)analysis. These methods differ in scope and degrees of complexity and are used at different assessment levels. The potential for a circular economy in this paper is assessed by evaluating the contribution to the public policy objectives for CE: resource efficiency, reduction of dependency on materials, competitiveness, creation of domestic jobs, reduced Greenhouse Gas (GHG)emissions. Results obtained by these methods are shown for Belgium and, in some cases, compared to the results of other countries to illustrate the differences between economies. CE activities (in response to public policy objectives)will enhance the ongoing trend of reducing the share of primary sectors in economies. The openness of an economy is expressed as the ratio of sum of import and export and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Imported products add to the potential of domestic closed-loop circular initiatives like re-use, repair, remanufacture, recycling, but this will require knowledge about composition and spare part availability. Exported products are no longer available for these domestic CE initiatives, reducing the domestic potential for CE and the domestic export activity is vulnerable to CE activities abroad. Especially the increasing geographical distance in trade complicates the practical and legal barriers to close the loop. In open economies, both global and domestic substitution effects due to new circular economy policy initiatives are important to consider. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Physical and hybrid IO analysis; Re-Use; Recycling","Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid materials; Public policy; Recycling; Rhenium compounds; Waste treatment; Circular economy; Degrees of complexity; Gross domestic products; I-o analysis; Resource efficiencies; Substitution effect; Sustainable materials; Value chain analysis; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066021174

Eco-driving and intersection connectivity are the direct effects analyzed along with indirect effects that include empty kilometers, parking, charging infrastructure, powertrain rightsizing, electric vehicle adoption, ride-sharing, and fleet-turnover rates. A case study of an AT fleet in Austin, Texas from 2020 to 2050 with constant travel demand indicates the strategic deployment of an electrified AT fleet can reduce cumulative energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 60% in the base case, with a majority of this benefit resulting from electrified powertrains. Further reductions up to 87% can be achieved with accelerated electrical grid decarbonization, dynamic ride-share, longer vehicle lifetime, more energy efficient computer systems, and faster fuel efficiency improvements for new vehicles.

The observed results show Zhengzhou, Yulin, Jinan, Qingdao, and Changchun as significantly polluted cities where the annual mean concentration of PM2.5 was noted to be greater than 120 µg m−3. However, some cities such as Xiamen, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Jinchang reported average annual PM2.5 concentrations less than 40 µg m−3. In general, the results of spatial distribution reported that the cities of the east, north, and northeast China are highly polluted. According to the average mass of PM2.5 in maximum cities of China, the sum of sulfate, nitrate and ammonium (SNA) and organic matter (OM) contributed over 40 and 35%, respectively. The higher amount of SNA and OM in PM2.5 results from heavy traffic or vehicle emission and burning solid fuel utilized in most part of China.

The literature is rich in studies exploring the delivery of both provisional services (timber or wood products) and cultural ones (recreation or amenity). However, fewer researches have addressed the delivery of regulation services like regulation of climate, carbon sequestration or preservation of habitats. The paper intends to contribute to this scarce literature with a Southern European case study. It analyses whether non-industrial private forest owners from an Italian alpine region would be willing to deliver additional (i.e. beyond legal requirements) quantities of regulation forest ecosystem services, whether they would do so with or without payment, and what affects such willingness. Three services are analysed: habitat improvement, soil conservation and carbon sequestration. Three multinomial logit models are estimated on a sample of 106 non-industrial forest owners. The results show, among others, that the willingness to deliver regulation forest ecosystem services is enhanced when the service impacts also on the property scale: this result concurs with the literature which shows that non-industrial private forest owners very often maximise not only their profit but also their overall utility by considering the self-consumption of services. The paper concludes by providing indications for targeting and tailoring active forest management policies focused on non-industrial forest owners of Italian alpine regions. © 2019, The Author(s).","Forest ecosystem services; Forest multifunctionality; Multinomial logit; NIPF owners; Non-industrial forest owners management decisions; Regulation ecosystem services","alpine environment; ecosystem service; forest management; private land; regression analysis; regulatory approach; willingness to pay; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064629491

There is an emerging link between air pollution, which is ubiquitous in our environment, particularly in urban centers, and incident childhood asthma. Here, using data from 3 successive cohorts recruited from the same 9 communities in southern California over a span of 20 y (1993 to 2014), we estimated asthma incidence using G-computation under hypothetical air pollution exposure scenarios targeting nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter &lt;2.5 μm (PM2.5) in separate interventions. We reported comparisons of asthma incidence under each hypothetical air pollution intervention with incidence under the observed natural course of exposure; results that may be more tangible for policymakers compared with risk ratios. Model results indicated that childhood asthma incidence rates would have been statistically significantly higher had the observed reduction in ambient NO2 in southern California not occurred in the 1990s and early 2000s, and asthma incidence rates would have been significantly lower had NO2 been lower than what it was observed to be. For example, compliance with a hypothetical standard of 20 ppb NO2 was estimated to result in 20% lower childhood asthma incidence (95% CI, −27% to −11%) compared with the exposure that actually occurred. The findings for hypothetical PM2.5 interventions, although statistically significant, were smaller in magnitude compared with results for the hypothetical NO2 interventions. Our results suggest a large potential public health benefit of air pollutant reduction in reduced incidence of childhood asthma. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

However, the test cycles and specification values applied in various areas under different environmental conditions are generally uniform, which is a valuable research issue. In the paper, a physical performance degradation-based statistics approach is presented to increase the flexibility and extensibility of the preventive test schedule under diverse environmental factors, e.g. ambient temperature and the relative humidity of the air. The approach enables to estimate the performance parameter quantitatively on the basis of systematically analyzing historical data of preventive test. Whereafter, the optimization of maintenance strategies in line with local conditions is also recommended to provide guidance, including adjusting the preventive test cycle and adding extra inspection.

We comprehensively assessed the potential impacts of PSF on rice and flour consumption, rice and wheat planting, energy and nutrient supply, irrigation-water, chemical nitrogen (N), phosphorus pentoxide (P2 O5) and potassium oxide (K2 O) fertilizer inputs and total greenhouse gases (GHG) emission for potatoes, rice and wheat, by assuming different proportions of potato substitutes for rice and flour. The results showed that per capita, 2.9 ± 0.3 and 4.7 ± 0.5 kg more potatoes per year would enter the Chinese staple-food diet, under the government’s target. PSF consumed are expected to reach 5.2 ± 0.7 Tg yr−1, equivalent to substituting potatoes for 4.2 ± 0.8–8.5 ± 0.8 Tg yr−1 wheat and 5.1 ± 0.9–10.1 ± 1.8 Tg yr−1 rice under different scenarios. While this substitution can increase the nutrient supply index by 63% towards nutrient reference values, it may induce no significant effect on staple-food energy supply with lower chemical fertilizer (except for K2 O) and irrigation-water inputs and GHG emissions in different substitution scenarios than the business as usual scenario. The reduction in rice and wheat demands lead to wheat in the North China Plain and early rice decrease by 6.1–11.4% and 12.1–24.1%, respectively. The total GHG reduction is equal to 1.1–9.0% of CO2 equivalent associated with CH4 and N2 O emitted from the Chinese agroecosystem in 2005. The saved irrigation water for three crops compared to 2012 reaches the total water use of 17.9 ± 4.9–21.8 ± 5.9 million people in 2015. More N fertilizer, irrigation-water, and GHG can be reduced, if the PSF ratio is increased to 50% together with potato yield improves to the optimal level. Our results implied that the PSF policy is worth doing not only because of the healthier diets, but also to mitigate resource inputs and GHG emissions and it also supports agricultural structure adjustments in the areas of irrigated wheat on the North China Plain and early rice across China, designed to increase the adaptability to climate change. © 2019 by the authors.

However, the combustors particularly developed for ultra-low NOX emission combustors being developed for aircraft gas turbine engines are more susceptible to combustion instabilities. Premixed combustion systems have the capability to meet future regulations on NOx emissions. However, premixed systems always involve the risk of flame flashback into the premixing section. From a gas turbine manufacturer's point of view, it is required to enlarge the safe operating range, in particular with respect to flame flashback. The significance of these flashback phenomena is a strong function of fuel composition and operating conditions. In the literature, flashback along the wall boundary layer shows the most critical failure mechanism for many burner configurations using hydrogen-rich fuels.

Developing low carbon reinforced concrete buildings is an important strategy to achieve the long term sustainability in urban cities. However, the large variability and the combined effect of different reinforced concrete design parameters during the production stage presents considerable effects on the total embodied carbon of buildings, which were not fully explored in literature. Thus, this study aims to develop a systematic approach to quantify the detailed relationship between different concrete design parameters and their combined effects, thereby helping mitigate the building GHG emissions. The proposed approach takes into account the parameters that have significant effects on the embodied carbon of reinforced concrete, and studies different variations of reinforced concrete designs to minimize the carbon emissions. The results of this study serve as a decision support basis for improving the building design in regard to carbon reduction. In an illustrative example, the proposed approach is examined to compare the embodied carbon for different material design scenarios and to suggest the material choice for a lower embodied carbon in concrete buildings. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building design; Carbon footprint; Combined effect; Greenhouse gas; Material production; Reinforced concrete","Carbon footprint; Concrete buildings; Decision support systems; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Reinforced concrete; Building design; Building sectors; Carbon reduction; Combined effect; Decision supports; Embodied carbons; Long-term sustainability; Reinforced concrete design; Architectural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065782463

The European corn borer (ECB) is a major insect pest of corn in North America. Its speed of development could potentially accelerate under a warmer climate, leading to an earlier development of the first generation and an increase in the number of generations per year. The main objective of this study was to assess the potential impacts of climate change on ECB management for the future period 2041–2070 in Quebec, Canada, using bioclimatic modelling and climate analogues. First flight of ECB moths could occur about 15 days earlier in the season in 2041–2070 compared to the reference period 1970–1999. The window for insecticide interventions may be reduced under climate change by 15.6% to 27.8% for univoltine ECB and by 13.8% to 52.7% for bivoltine ECB. Climate change could promote the development of an additional generation in the southern region for both races, considering temperature increases and factors inducing the overwintering diapause. ECB management could become more costly both economically and environmentally under the future climate, and it should be revised according to the results of this study. © 2019 The Royal Entomological Society.","Climate analogues; climate change; degree-day model; European corn borer; pest management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061566707

Oriented at a mid-term re-embedding of Western production and consumption norms into planetary limits, it suggests the development of ""eco-social"" policies in the rich countries. In this theoretical context, this article empirically investigates the relationships between attitudes towards welfare and climate policy in 23 countries. Using 2016 data from the European Social Survey, we explored patterns of synergy between both kinds of policies as well as effects of crowding-out, where support for one kind of policy involves refusing the other. Since previous research addressed the role of welfare states and their institutional foundations in establishing environmentally sustainable societies, we studied how attitudes towards welfare and climate policies differ according to welfare regime afflliation. Additionally, we examined how a range of socio-demographic and political factors such as class, education, income, and political position shape people's views on welfare and climate policy goals. The results of a multiple correspondence analysis indicate that the simultaneous support of welfare and climate policies follows welfare regime lines in that this support is the highest among social-democratic countries. However, also some conservative and Mediterranean countries score high in this regard. At the individual level, people with a higher education, employees in socio-cultural professions, and voters of moderate left and green parties display the highest mutual support for welfare and climate policies. © 2019 by the authors.","Attitudes; Climate change; Climate policy; Eco-social policies; Energy preferences; Environmental policy; European Social Survey; Social policy; Sustainable welfare; Welfare","environmental policy; preference behavior; public attitude; social policy; sustainability; Europe; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070465715

Greenhouse gas emissions are dominated by enteric methane (CH4), accounting for ~60% of total emissions from beef production. With significant N fertilization of pastures, nitrous oxide (N2O) emission is often the second most important greenhouse gas, accounting for ~30% of total emissions from beef production. Region-specific data on greenhouse gas emissions from beef production are lacking, and yet these data are essential to design Southern pastures for improved resource efficiency. Forages with high nutritive value can reduce CH4 emissions by grazing cattle, as a consequence of greater feed efficiency and shorter time to gain maturity. In addition, forages with significant tannins, saponins, and other biochemical components may have the potential to mitigate against enteric CH4 emission. Nitrogen fertilization of pastures often leads to greater soil N2O emission. Establishing and maintaining legumes in pastures can limit the need for external N inputs. Forage production systems that rely on farm-derived nutrients (e.g., precision litter decomposition with management-intensive grazing, application of additional manure sources, and composts), keeping brood cows healthy and productive, and getting calves to finishing weight faster are keys to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from Southern pastures. Also, significant soil organic C sequestration should be a focus to reduce the overall C footprint of animal agriculture in the region. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

These projects are often considered as an answer to a rising challenge affecting numerous traditional utilities: the unforeseen urban change relating to shifting (i.e. declining) demand patterns that are undermining traditional models of infrastructure management. The development of cross-sectoral strategies is considered a way both to tackle the attrition of traditional sources of revenue and to develop greener infrastructure systems by enhancing their efficiency level, often in line with low-carbon programmes implemented by national or local governments. The appeal lies in a fairly static perception of infrastructure management and technological change. Based on a detailed analysis of a traditional German local multi-utility and informed by a six-month internship within the company, the article deciphers the rationale of multi-sectoral practices, in particular the company’s transformation into a cross-utility that devised a common strategy for all its infrastructure networks and its ambiguities. Various facets of such ‘boundary work’ are analysed, focusing on organisational and financial aspects to reveal the new sites of tensions and negotiations between sectors, but also on the material component of these cross-sectoral projects through the case of one such nexus programme, a waste-to-energy programme. This programme embodies the potential contradictions between the call for reduced use of resources (i.e. the production of less waste) and the development of new urban technical systems relying primarily on those same resources. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2018.","cross-sectoral dynamics; district heating; Germany; modernisation of utilities; urban infrastructures; waste management","energy planning; entrepreneur; heating; infrastructural development; inner city area; perception; residential energy; urban development; waste management; water industry; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060241940

Complementing previous work from 2005 to 2009, we map out the ideological networks of political actors engaged in the climate policy network using data from the US Congress as an arena of symbolic interaction. Our analysis identifies polycentric sites of ideological congruence and conflict in the discourse network on climate change. Political actors from different levels and including several actor types formed multiple centers that became bipolarized between the 112th and 114th sessions of the US Congress. This process took place in tandem with the increased participation of subnational actors in the polycentric system. By the 114th session of the Congress—during which the 2016 election took place—subnational policy actors, along with a diversity of other actors, contributed to an extremely polarized discussion of one of the central policies in the Obama Administration’s Climate Action Plan: the Clean Power Plan. This finding is remarkable as the concept of polycentricity tends to be normatively associated with policy innovation, rather than stagnation. Our longitudinal analysis demonstrates, using Discourse Network Analysis, how increased multi-level participation can be associated with policy blockage of progressive climate policies rather than enabling policy innovation. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Climate models; Clean power; Climate policy; Ideological networks; Longitudinal analysis; Multilevels; Multiple centers; Recent researches; Symbolic interaction; Climate change; climate change; election; environmental policy; innovation; national politics; perception; policy approach; public attitude; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068821563

In this study, we used a young tree diversity experiment replicated at two sites in the UK to study the impacts of tree diversity and tree provenance (geographic origin) on the oak (Quercus robur) insect herbivore community and a specialist biotrophic pathogen, oak powdery mildew. Local UK, French, and Italian provenances were planted in monocultures, provenance mixtures, and species mixes, allowing us to test whether: (a) local and nonlocal provenances differ in their insect herbivore and pathogen communities, and (b) admixing trees leads to associational effects on insect herbivore and pathogen damage. Tree diversity had variable impacts on foliar organisms across sites and years, suggesting that diversity effects can be highly dependent on environmental context. Provenance identity impacted upon both herbivores and powdery mildew, but we did not find consistent support for the local adaptation hypothesis for any group of organisms studied. Independent of provenance, we found tree vigor traits (shoot length, tree height) and tree apparency (the height of focal trees relative to their surroundings) were consistent positive predictors of powdery mildew and insect herbivory. Synthesis. Our results have implications for understanding the complex interplay between tree identity and diversity in determining pest damage, and show that tree traits, partially influenced by tree genotype, can be important drivers of tree pest and pathogen loads. © 2019 The Authors.

Some countries have exploited this energy source in order to enhance their transition to renewables. Today the largest geothermal energy producers in the world are New Zealand, U.S.A, Mexico, Philippines, Italy, Iceland, and, more recently, Turkey (Geothermal, 2012). Differently from other renewable sources, geothermal energy produces impacts on the environment that are very site-specific because of the nature of the resource and its geological characteristics Bravi et al.,2010; Parisi et al.,2013. In the same way, the atmospheric emissions associated to the activity of geothermal power plants for electric or heat production (mainly CO2, H2S, NH3, Hg, CH4) are also site-specific. In fact, due to technological and geographical differences among the geothermal installations operating all over the World, it is quite impossible to identify and attribute typical emission patterns, to perform forecasts valid for multiple sites or to collect universal data. Furthermore, it is virtually impossible the comparison among technologies located in different regions or countries. Definitively, inventories of primary data, as accurate and complete as possible, are essential to correctly evaluate the peculiarities of geo-thermoelectric energy production Parisi et al.,2018. Data reported here try to fill the gap in respect to the Italian situation. To this end, a complete survey of the atmospheric emissions from all the geothermal power plants in operation in the Tuscany Region is performed.

For this study, lakes located in the central region of Corrientes province were selected, comprising part of the western margin of the Iberá Wetland. The palynological analysis of the paleocommunities shows, in a first stage of the mid Holocene, the predominance of marsh grasslands and hygrophilous communities that indicates humid to sub-humid environmental conditions. In a later stage of the mid Holocene, the paleocommunities show a characteristic association of wetlands, which together with the presence of Typha sp., would indicate sub-humid to humid conditions and waterlogged or flooded soils with slow-moving water. For the late Holocene, the paleocommunities show, initially, the presence of a grass-dominated herbaceous steppe, indicating environmental disturbances, which in the fossil record could reflect the combination of intense wind action under a dry climate. In a later stage, the frequency and variety of species characteristic of humid environments increase, dominated by marshy-herbaceous species, in addition to the development of the hygrophilous forest. Consequently, since the mid Holocene, the main climate factors responsible for the observed changes in wetland conditions were the location and intensity of the Atlantic and Pacific anticyclones in addition to changes in sea level. These forces mainly affected the distribution of precipitation, causing significant changes in the vegetation communities. © 2019 Nordic Society Oikos","climate change; Corrientes province; Holocene; lake sediments; paleoenvironment; paleovegetation","anticyclone; climate change; environmental conditions; environmental disturbance; fossil record; grassland; Holocene; lacustrine deposit; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; palynology; pollen; sea level change; wetland; Argentina; Atlantic Ocean; Corrientes; Pacific Ocean; Typha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071623543

Although soil respiration (Rs)plays a crucial role in driving the global carbon cycle and regulating climate warming, a general pattern reflecting the Rs response to P addition in terrestrial ecosystems remains unclear. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis from 102 publications to explore the generalities and mechanisms of responses of Rs and its components to P addition across various ecosystems at the global scale. Our results showed that P addition did not significantly change Rs and heterotrophic respiration (Rh)across all ecosystems, but this P addition effect varied among ecosystem types (p &lt; 0.05). Specifically, P addition significantly increased Rs by 17.4% in tropical forest and by 31.7% in cropland, depressed Rs by 13.7% in wetland (p &lt; 0.05), and had minor effect in other ecosystems (grassland, boreal forest, and temperate forest). In contrast, P addition did not have significant effect on Rh within any specific ecosystem type. Among multiple environmental and experimental variables, mean annual temperature might be the fundamental driver indirectly controlling the response of Rs to P addition at the large scale. In addition, P addition increased soil P availability, and changed ecosystem carbon pools and fluxes. The responses of Rs and Rh were significantly positively correlated with those of soil organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon and belowground biomass, respectively, suggesting that changes of these carbon pools may drive the responses of Rs and Rh to P addition. Collectively, our findings imply that Rs in tropical forests would strongly respond to P enrichment where current soil P availability is low and future P deposition rate is high, provide a framework for understanding Rs dynamics under global P deposition, and highlight the need for further field studies partitioning the two components of Rs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Phosphorus deposition; Phosphorus limitation; Root respiration; Soil organic matter decomposition; Soil respiration; Tropical forest","Deposition rates; Forestry; Organic carbon; Phosphorus; Soils; Tropics; Phosphorus limitation; Root respiration; Soil organic matters; Soil respiration; Tropical forest; Ecosystems; belowground biomass; carbon cycle; decomposition; global perspective; meta-analysis; microbial activity; phosphorus; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil respiration; tropical forest; tropical region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064832123

But there are open questions: What have the effects of these measures been? Have they helped China achieve win-win development in terms of its resources, environment, and economy? This paper aims to answer these questions by using a newly proposed global three-hierarchy meta-frontier Luenberger index that can quantify the effects of promoting technological innovation, industrial restructuring, etc., on economic growth, energy conservation and emissions reduction. The results show that (1)during 2001–2016, China's energy efficiency, economic efficiency, and emissions efficiency improved, indicating that China's efforts have brought about the win-win development of resources, the environment, and the economy; (2)the implemented measures have heterogeneous effects on economic growth, energy conservation, and emissions reduction. The implemented measures are generally beneficial to energy conservation and emissions reduction but potentially harmful to the economy; (3)the effects of these measures on economic growth, energy conservation and emissions reduction across China's regions and provinces are also quite different, indicating that local provincial governments should have a clear understanding of their own characteristics before implementing the relevant policies and measures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Heterogeneous effects; Industrial restructuring; Meta-frontier approach; Regional balance development; Win-win development","Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Natural resources management; Heterogeneous effects; Industrial restructuring; Meta-frontier approach; Regional balance development; Win-win; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065497983

It is noted that in the Arctic countries there is no universal understanding of the territories belonging to the Arctic and the Arctic zone. It is especially difficult to determine the southern borders of the Arctic. Also there is no international agreement or treaty that unambiguously and unequivocally define the legal status of the Artic. In USSR main criteria for identifying the southern boundary of the Arctic were the Arctic Circle, the mean multiyear 10°C isotherm of July, and the permafrost zone. However, the use of variables leads to the ""mobility"" of the Arctic boundaries, especially in the face of climate change on the planet. On the basis of Russian domestic documents, the boundaries of the territories that are included in the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation are determined.

By focusing on selecting projected extremes in a high dimensional space, one is confronted with the shrinkage of ensemble size while preserving the projection spread. This study proposes a novel integrated computational geometry algorithm to select extreme climate change scenarios in a high dimensional space. A set of 12 prominent climate extremes indices were used (as input to the algorithm)out of the 27 core indices recommended by the World Meteorological Organization's Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). The ETCCDI indices were projected by Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)for the period of 2081–2100 relative to the baseline period 1986–2005. The approach enables the user to shrink the initial selected ensemble into smaller sub-ensembles while still capturing a wide range of simulated changes for selected climatological variables. The conservation of the projection spread was evaluated using a robust validation method when the spread error was calculated for each simulation run. The developed algorithm was applied to three different regions where the geographical domain was narrowed-down from sub-continental (western North America)to its regional (Alberta, Canada), and local (Athabasca River basin, Alberta, Canada)subdomains. Results revealed that selected extreme scenarios can vary from one region to another within the same geographical domain in response to the spatial variation in climatic regime. © 2019","Downscaling; GCM ensemble; Impact of climate change; Risk assessment; Selection of representative climate models; Uncertainty","Climate models; Computational geometry; Geographical regions; Risk assessment; Climate change detection; Climate change impact assessments; Computational geometry algorithms; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Down-scaling; GCM ensemble; Uncertainty; World meteorological organizations; Climate change; algorithm; atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; downscaling; extreme event; risk assessment; uncertainty analysis; Alberta; article; climate change; geometry; human; risk assessment; river basin; simulation; uncertainty; validation process; Alberta; Athabasca Basin; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065145305

To promote the use of electric heating, the economic incentive from governments will play a decisive role. This paper investigates the impact of taxation and subsidy policies on the long-term evolution of urban heat supply systems based on the evolutionary game theory. The evolutionary stable strategy is calculated which yields the fraction of each kind of heating strategy as well as the regulatory policy in a steady state. Four scenarios including both static and dynamic policy design mechanisms are simulated. The dynamic policy design is formulated as an optimal control problem, and the optimal evolutionary trajectory is obtained from the proposed optimal parameter design algorithm. Simulation results indicate that the amount of electric heating can be flexibly and accurately controlled by the government through the design of taxation and subsidy policies. It is shown in the case study that taxations could be more efficient than subsidies to encourage using electric heating, and a combination of dynamic taxation and dynamic subsidy policies can expedite the heating system electrification process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Evolutionary game theory; Evolutionary stable strategy; Policy design; Taxation and subsidies; Urban heat supply system","Electric heating; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Optimal control systems; Taxation; Economic incentive; Evolutionary game theory; Evolutionary stable strategies; Heat supply systems; Optimal control problem; Optimal parameter design; Policy design; Regulatory policies; Game theory; atmospheric pollution; coal; electrical power; electricity supply; electrification; energy policy; game theory; heating; policy approach; tax system",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066267498

Combining atmospheric observations at seven sites across China with a FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model-based Bayesian inversion technique, we estimate emission magnitudes and changes of four major HCFCs in China during 2011–2017. The emissions of all four HCFCs reached peaks before 2015. Our results agreed well with the reported bottom-up inventories. The Chinese ozone depletion potential (ODP)-weighted emission of the three most abundant HCFCs accounted for 37% of global totals from 2011 to 2016.

Here, PM2.5 samples were weekly collected at different air pollution levels in Beijing, China during one-year period. Microbial composition was profiled using Illumina sequencing, and their interactions were further investigated to reveal the hub genera with network analysis. Diversity of bacteria and fungi showed obvious seasonal variations, and the heavy- or severe-pollution levels mainly affected the diversity and composition of bacteria, but not fungi. While, the community structure of both bacteria and fungi was influenced by the combination of air pollution levels and seasons. The most abundant bacterial genera and some genera with highest abundance in heavy- or severe-pollution days were the hub bacteria in PM2.5. Whereas, only the dominant fungi in light-pollution days in winter were the hub fungi in PM2.5. The complex positive correlations of bacterial or fungal pathogens would aggravate the air pollution effects on human health, despite of their low relative abundances. Moreover, the strong co-occurrence and co-exclusion patterns of bacteria and fungi in PM2.5 were identified. Furthermore, the hub environmental factors (e.g., relative humidity and atmospheric pressure) may play central roles in the distributions of bacteria and fungi, including pathogens. Importantly, AOMs showed significant co-occurrence patterns with the main bacterial and fungal genera and potential pathogens, providing possible microbiological evidences for controlling ammonia emissions to effectively reduce PM2.5 pollution.

However, to do that satisfactorily, it is necessary to know the degree of persistence of sectoral energy consumption. In fact, the degree of persistence shows how much of impact of shocks carries over to the following periods. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the persistence and stationarity of sectoral energy consumption in the United States during 1952–2016 using bootstrap and subsampling confidence intervals. These confidence intervals provide more information compared to the unit root tests. Not only they provide evidence about the stationarity or non-stationarity of the variables, but also they show the degree of persistence. In addition, they require fewer assumptions on the nature of data. The findings show that the energy consumption in the residential and commercial sectors appears to be stationary but persistent. On the contrary, the energy consumption in the industrial and transportation sectors is non-stationary. Therefore, the industrial and transportation sectors are the best candidates to implement energy conservation and economic or environmental-oriented policies, because the effect of these policies will be permanent. Similar policies can be applied in the residential and commercial sectors as well; however, the effects of shocks to these sectors will diminish eventually. © The Author(s) 2018.","bootstrap; confidence interval; Energy consumption; persistence; stationary; subsampling","Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Industrial economics; Motor transportation; Statistical methods; bootstrap; Confidence interval; persistence; stationary; subsampling; Energy utilization; bootstrapping; energy conservation; energy market; energy use; environmental policy; persistence; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059478876

We use the state-of-the-art ECHAM6-HAMMOZ global chemistry- climate model to investigate the seasonal transport of anthropogenic Asian sulfate aerosols and their impact on the UTLS. Sensitivity simulations for SO2 emission perturbation over India (48% increase) and China (70% decrease) are performed based on the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite-observed trend, rising over India by - 4:8% per year and decreasing over China by - 7:0% per year during 2006-2017. The enhanced Indian emissions result in an increase in aerosol optical depth (AOD) loading in the UTLS by 0.61 to 4.17% over India. These aerosols are transported to the Arctic during all seasons by the lower branch of the Brewer-Dobson circulation enhancing AOD by 0.017% to 4.8 %. Interestingly, a reduction in SO2 emission over China inhibits the transport of Indian sulfate aerosols to the Arctic in summer-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons due to subsidence over northern India. The region of sulfate aerosol enhancement shows significant warming in the UTLS over northern India, south China (0:2±0:15 to 0:8±0:72 K) and the Arctic (- 1±0:62 to 1:6±1:07 K). The estimated seasonal mean direct radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) induced by the increase in Indian SO2 emission is-0.2 to-1.5Wm-2 over northern India. The Chinese SO2 emission reduction leads to a positive radiative forcing of - 0:6 to 6Wm-2 over China. The decrease in vertical velocity and the associated enhanced stability of the upper troposphere in response to increased Indian SO2 emissions will likely decrease rainfall over India. © Author(s) 2019.",,"aerosol; anthropogenic effect; atmospheric convection; monsoon; stratosphere-troposphere interaction; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070566646

These systems with lack of time inversion symmetry possess a momentum space Berry curvature that can introduce exotic transport properties. The present study, on epitaxially grown Co2TiSn films, is an approach to understand and explore this possibility. The theoretical investigation shows that the Berry curvature is significant for the total anomalous Hall effect in experimentally grown Co2TiSn films. The deviation between the theory and experiment is due to the influence of side jump and skew scattering mechanisms. From a theoretical point of view, the intrinsic contribution to the anomalous Hall effect originates from partially gaped nodal lines due to the symmetry reduction induced by the lack of time reversal symmetry. Furthermore, from hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, we establish an electronic structure in the film that is comparable to the theoretical density of states calculations. These results provide intuitive insight into Heusler spintronics rooted in topological electronic structure. © 2019 authors. Published by the American Physical Society.

The potential for urban trees to modify microclimates and thereby reduce building energy use and the associated carbon emissions is a commonly cited ecosystem service used to justify million tree planting campaigns across the US. However, what we know of this ecosystem service comes primarily from unvalidated simulation studies. Using the first dataset of actual heating and cooling energy use combined with tree cover data, we show that contrary to the predictions of the most commonly used simulations, trees in a cool climate city increase carbon emissions from residential building energy use. This is driven primarily by near east (<20 m from building) tree cover. Further analysis of urban areas in the US shows that this is likely the case in cool climates throughout the country, encompassing approximately 39% of the US population and 62% of its area (56%, excluding Alaska). This work adds geographic nuance to our understanding of how urban shade trees affect the carbon budget, and it could have major implications for tree planting programs in cool climates. © 2019 The Author(s).

The southernmost watersheds of St. Vincent have a rugged topography that favours flash-flooding in rainy events, with great damage because the area concentrates most of the country’s population and infrastructure. To deal with this problem the Government has developed studies, engineering works and a watershed management plan. Land use management is an effective way of controlling hydrological impacts; the plan divides the watersheds in three uses, nature conservation (46%), agriculture and agroforestry (24%), and urban (30%), with categories, establishing permitted, prohibited and restricted activities. The area is close to the limit of urban development; if further expansion were essential it should be done by increasing density in lower and flatter areas. Many houses, usually low-income settlements, are in flooding or landslide risk areas, which should be decolonized, changing land use. It is also necessary to avoid hillside arable crops. Adaptation to climate change through land use management is essential, although unfortunately less socially and politically appreciated than engineering works. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Caribbean; Climate change adaptation; St. Vincent and the Grenadines; Watershed management","Agriculture; Disasters; Floods; Land use; Soil conservation; Urban growth; Water conservation; Water management; Watersheds; Adaptation to climate changes; Caribbean; Climate change adaptation; Hydrological impacts; St. Vincent and the Grenadines; Vulnerability reductions; Watershed management; Watershed management plans; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; flash flood; flood damage; flooding; hurricane; natural disaster; storm; vulnerability; watershed; Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; Windward Islands [Lesser Antilles]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052586860

However, the potential of a solar PV-system is location specific, influenced by the local solar resource, energy demand and cost among other factors. The main aim of this study is to conduct a detailed assessment of the potential of solar PV-systems in residential buildings in Lagos Metropolitan Area, Nigeria. Nigeria has enormous solar energy potential, it is the most populous country in Africa and occupies a significant place in the development of Africa. Yet, it is a country with one of the lowest per capita electricity consumption in the world – at 149 kWh per capita for a population of about 170 million, about 7% of Brazil's and 3% of South Africa's. To achieve this goal, this study employed the survey of 150 residential buildings in three local government areas (LGAs) in Lagos State, Nigeria to obtain electric load data. HOMER Pro was used to size the PV-systems and to determine the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). The computed energy results of the study for the base case scenario revealed the PV array, lead acid battery and the converter (inverter) of the PV-systems to be in the following range: 0.3–76 kW; 2 to 176 kWh; and 0.1–13.2 kW respectively. Economic analysis revealed a LCOE of the systems in the range of 0.398 USD/kWh to 0.743 USD/kWh. The use of PV-system generated electricity in the dwellings has potential for an annual reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the range of 31.24 kgCO2eq to 7456.44 kgCO2eq.

Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis was carried out on bone collagen from the Islamic cemetery (ca. AD 950–1150) population excavated at 33 Bartomeu Vicent Ramon, Ibiza, including human (n = 42) and faunal remains (n = 3). Stable oxygen and carbon isotope analysis was also undertaken on human tooth enamel carbonate (n = 6), and six humans were directly radiocarbon dated, confirming the presence of two distinct burial phases. The collagen results emphasise a C3-based diet, with variable but generally minor contributions from marine and/or C4 foods. However, the enamel carbonate results indicate a far greater importance of C4 crops than suggested by the collagen results, contributing up to 40% of energy intake. In keeping with previous studies of the region and period, the dietary contribution of marine protein is probably limited. A small number of outliers in both collagen and carbonate isotope results are identified, suggesting the presence of individuals originating elsewhere. The results are compared with those from previous investigations on the Balearics and the Spanish mainland, highlighting the complexity of factors—both cultural and methodological—affecting inter-regional dietary investigation. © 2018, The Author(s).","Diet; Islamic Ibiza; Mobility; Radiocarbon dating; Stable isotope analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046631349

However, the effect of riparian shading on river temperature varies substantially between locations. Process-based models can elucidate the relative importance of woodland and other factors driving river temperature and thus improve understanding of spatial variability of the effect of shading, but characterising the spatial distribution and height of riparian tree cover necessary to parameterise these models remains a significant challenge. Here, we document a novel approach that combines Structure-from-Motion (SfM)photogrammetry acquired from a drone to characterise the riparian canopy with a process based temperature model (Heat Source)to simulate the effects of tree shading on river temperature. Our approach was applied in the Girnock Burn, a tributary of the Aberdeenshire Dee, Scotland. Results show that SfM approximates true canopy elevation with a good degree of accuracy (R 2 = 0.96)and reveals notable spatial heterogeneity in shading. When these data were incorporated into a process-based temperature model, it was possible to simulate river temperatures with a similarly-high level of accuracy (RMSE &lt;0.7 °C)to a model parameterised using ‘conventional’ LiDAR tree height data. We subsequently demonstrate the utility of our approach for quantifying the magnitude of shading effects on stream temperature by comparing simulated temperatures against another model from which all riparian woodland has been removed. Our findings highlight drone-based SfM as an effective tool for characterising riparian shading and improving river temperature models. This research provides valuable insights into the effects of riparian woodland on river temperature and the potential of bankside tree planting for climate change adaptation. © 2019","Climate change; Drones; Process-based model; River temperature; Structure from motion; Unoccupied aerial systems","Climate change; Climate models; Drones; Reforestation; Aerial systems; Climate change adaptation; Process-based modeling; River temperature; Spatial heterogeneity; Structure from motion; Temperature extremes; Temperature modeling; Rivers; aircraft; climate change; forest canopy; forest cover; photogrammetry; riparian forest; river water; shading; tree planting; unmanned vehicle; water temperature; woodland; Article; canopy; climate change; controlled study; forest; limit of quantitation; measurement accuracy; photogrammetry; priority journal; process model; river temperature; structure from motion photogrammetry; water temperature; aircraft; chemistry; climate change; forest; procedures; remote sensing; river; temperature; theoretical model; tree; Aberdeenshire; Girnock Burn; Scotland; United Kingdom; Aircraft; Climate Change; Data Accuracy; Forests; Models, Theoretical; Remote Sensing Technology; Rivers; Temperature; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065183709

Functionalized NDs have been used as carbocatalysts to drive a diversity of heterogeneous reactions, presenting promising catalytic performances, great stability/durability, and low toxicity compared with other carbonaceous and metal materials. More importantly, the tunable configurations of NDs-related materials from sp3 to sp2/sp3 and sp2 carbons endow them as ideal chemical probes to elucidate the intrinsic nature toward metal-free catalysis. Herein, a comprehensive overview is presented in the synthesis, properties, functionalization, and characterization of NDs-based materials as well as their recent applications in fuel cell reactions, carbon dioxide reduction, photocatalysis, organic synthesis, oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, and advanced oxidation processes. More importantly, we provide an insightful discussion on unveiling the intrinsic catalytic centers and structure-reactivity chemistry of NDs in redox reactions from an atomic level. Advanced protocols were proposed for regulating the electronic structures of NDs by surface and structural engineering toward better carbocatalysis, which assists to provide valuable guidance for the rational design of ND-based materials toward target catalytic processes. Finally, future research opportunities were proposed to address the current dilemmas in materials synthesis, to facilitate mechanistic studies by theoretical computations, to enable structural/surface functionalization of NDs for advanced catalysis, and to expand the NDs-based materials toward other promising chemical reactions. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","carbocatalysis; nanodiamond; redox reaction; sp2/sp3 hybrids; structure-performance regime","Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Dehydrogenation; Electronic structure; Fuel cells; Nanocrystals; Pollution control; Redox reactions; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Carbocatalysis; Carbon dioxide reduction; Carbonaceous materials; Heterogeneous reactions; Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions; sp^2/sp^3 hybrids; Structure performance; Nanodiamonds",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071058772

CO2 utilization ratio is defined as the volume ratio of produced oil to injected CO2. CO2 huff and puff technology can further improve oil recovery in high water cut reservoirs. However, as the huff and puff cycle increase, gas channeling is easy to happen and the utilization ratio of CO2 is reduced. Organic fiber composite gel is an effective plugging agent for gas channel. The major objective of this paper is to study the mechanisms of increasing CO2 utilization by injecting organic composite gel as the plugging agent. A large scale (40 cm*40 cm*3 cm) natural rock model with grooves is used to simulate the experimental conditions such as channeling channel and horizontal well. Two groups of experiments of direct CO2 huff and plugging agent assisted CO2 huff and puff were conducted. By comparing the pressure changes during the experiments, the mechanism of blocking the channel, balancing the CO2 displacement front and improving the utilization ratio of CO2 were analyzed. The experimental process was fitted by reservoir numerical simulation, and the remaining oil distribution, plugging agent distribution and CO2 distribution in CO2 huff and puff under different conditions were further demonstrated. Results show that compared with direct CO2 stimulation, the distribution of remaining oil saturation and reservoir pressure become more uniform and the utilization ratio of CO2 is greatly increased after injecting organic fiber composite gel. It is mainly due to the fact that the injected plugging agents flow preferentially into high water saturation region along the high permeability channels. Then, they can generate the organic fiber composite gel and remain in the channeling paths. As a result, the following injected CO2 will be forced to flow towards oil-rich regions radially and uniformly. Thereby, more CO2 can contact and react with the in-situ oil, resulting much higher oil recovery. In other words, the utilization ratio of CO2 is greatly improved. Taking Jidong oilfield as an example, it has been injected 19.2 × 104 t CO2 with the total oil production by 21.1 × 104 t. The utilization ratio of CO2 is calculated as high as 1.09. The observations of this study provide the theoretical basis for future application of organic fiber composite gel before CO2 flooding in the water channeling reservoirs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 utilization ratio; Numerical simulation; Organic fiber composite gel; Real rock plate experiment; Water channeling reservoir","Computer simulation; Fibers; Horizontal wells; Industrial emissions; Numerical models; Offshore oil well production; Oil well flooding; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Reservoirs (water); High water cut reservoir; Organic fibers; Remaining oil distribution; Remaining oil saturations; Reservoir numerical simulation; Rock plate; Utilization ratios; Water channelings; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; composite; computer simulation; enhanced oil recovery; experiment; gel; reservoir; Neptunia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064462803

Physiological approaches can improve green roof plant selection, and shrubs with high drought tolerance and conservative water use under water-deficit should perform well. The water potential at turgor loss point (Ψtlp) has been used to predict drought resistance. Therefore we aimed to determine whether Ψtlp could be used as a screening tool to assess drought resistance for green roof plant selection. Methods: We evaluated 20 shrub species, originating from ecosystems varying in water availability, quantified by heat moisture index (HMI) and mean annual precipitation. We conducted a water-deficit experiment to measure Ψtlp, the degree of iso-anisohydry (△ΨMD) and water use (ET) in response to drought. Results: Shrubs with lower Ψtlp were more anisohydric (greater △ΨMD) and had a more conservative water use (lower ET). However, Ψtlp, ΔΨMD and ET were not related to HMI. Conclusions: These results suggest that Ψtlp could be used to select shrubs for green roofs, as species with lower Ψtlp tended to be more drought tolerant, more anisohydric and used less water under water-deficit. However, species with higher Ψtlp could also potentially survive through drought avoidance. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Drought response; ET; Green roof; Iso-anisohydry; Plant selection; Shrub; Water use; Ψtlp","assessment method; drought; evapotranspiration; greenspace; precipitation (climatology); shrub; urban ecosystem; water use efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067677748

The novelty of this study is grounded predominantly in evaluating for the first time the response of annual GHG fluxes to thinning in a coniferous peri-urban forest soil in Greece, thus contributing significantly to the enrichment of the GHG fluxes database from the Mediterranean forest ecosystem. Results suggest that CH4 uptake increased with increasing thinning intensity. The reduction in CO2 emissions in both thinning treatments was possibly related to an indirect effect of soil heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration. Coniferous peri-urban forests in Greece can act temporally as sinks of atmospheric N2O in the coldest months and a weak source of N2O fluxes in summer. The GHG variation depended largely on soil environmental factors with soil temperature representing the dominant factor for CO2 and CH4, whereas soil moisture correlated, albeit weakly, with N2O variability. Reduction in global warming potential was observed in both thinning treatments, markedly in selective treatment, giving an initial indication that high-intensity thinning in coniferous peri-urban forests in Greece presents a high potential for global change mitigation. © 2019 Society of American Foresters.","Climate-change mitigation; Global-warming potential; Greenhouse gases; Thinning treatments","Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Forestry; Gas emissions; Global warming; Knowledge management; Soil moisture; Atmospheric greenhouse; Autotrophic respiration; Climate change mitigation; Environmental factors; Global warming potential; Mediterranean forest ecosystems; Mediterranean region; Thinning treatment; Greenhouse gases; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystems; Forestry; Greece; Greenhouse Gases; Mediterranean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074855392

Design/methodology/approach: After studying the correlation between energy consumption rates in different sectors of energy consumption and some energy carriers with greenhouse gas distribution (CO2, SO2, NOX and SPM), the most effective factors on pollution emission will be first identified and then predicted for the next 20 years (2015 to 2004). Furthermore, to determine the appropriate method for forecasting, two approaches titled “trend analysis” and “double exponential smoothing” will be applied on data, collected from 1967 to 2014, and their capabilities in anticipating will be compared to each other contributing MSD, MAD, MAPE indices and also the actual and projected time series comparison. After predicting the energy consumption in the sectors and energy carriers, the growth rate of consumption in the next 20 years is also calculated. Findings: Correlation study shows that four energy sectors (industry sector, agriculture, transportation and household-general-commercial) and two energy carriers (electricity and natural gas) have shown remarkable correlation with greenhouse gas emissions. To predict the energy consumption in mentioned sectors and carriers, it is proven that double exponential smoothing method is more capable in predicting. The study shows that among the demand sectors, the industry will account for the highest consumption rate. Electricity will experience the highest rate among the energy careers. In fact, producing this amount of electricity causes emissions of greenhouse gases. Research limitations/implications: Access to the data and categorized data was one of the main limitations. Practical implications: By identifying the sectors and energy carriers that have the highest consumption growth rate in the next 20 years, it can be said that greenhouse gas emissions, which show remarkable correlation with these sectors and carriers, will also increase dramatically. So, their stricter control seems to be necessary. On the other hand, to control a particular greenhouse gas, it is possible to focus on the amount of energy consumed in the sectors and carriers that have a significant correlation with this pollutant. These results will lead to more targeted policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Social implications: The tendency of communities toward industrialization along with population growth will doubtlessly lead to more consumption of fossil fuels. An immediate aftermath of burning fuels is greenhouse gas emission resulting in destructive effects on the environment and ecosystems. Identifying the factors affecting the pollutants resulted from consumption of fossil fuels is significant in controlling the emissions. Originality/value: Such analyses help policymakers make more informed and targeted decisions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and make safer and more appropriate policies and investment. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","CO2 emission; Correlation analysis; Energy sector; Forecasting; Time series analysis","Agricultural robots; Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Growth rate; Investments; Natural gas transportation; Pollution; Population statistics; Time series analysis; CO2 emissions; Correlation analysis; Design/methodology/approach; Double exponential smoothing methods; Energy consumption rates; Energy sector; Greenhouse gases emissions; Time-series comparisons; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062592489

However, differing assumptions employed in these analyses could yield contradicting recommendations regarding intervention implementation. We test the magnitude of the effect of using different key assumptions - average vs marginal emissions, year of calculation, temporal and regional scope, and inclusion of nonemitting generation - to estimate Mid-Atlantic region power pool (PJM) emissions and damage factors. We further highlight the importance of factor selection by evaluating three illustrative 2017 power system examples in PJM. We find that for a simple building lighting intervention, using average emissions factors incorporating nonemitting generation underestimates avoided damages by 45% compared to marginal factors. For PJM demand response, outdated marginal emissions factors from 2016 overestimate avoided damages by 25% compared to 2017 factors. Our assessment of PJM summer load further suggests that fossil-only average emissions factors overestimate damages by 63% compared to average factors incorporating nonemitting generation. We recommend that energy modelers carefully select appropriate emissions metrics when performing their analyses. Furthermore, since the U.S. electric grid is rapidly changing, we urge decision-makers to frequently update (and consider forecasting) grid emissions factors.

This availability is assessed by means of local wind speed statistics. Under climate change, the future (long term) wind resource availability is, however, highly uncertain. This research proposes a methodology for on-site wind resource assessment in future (climate change) perspective based on stochastic modeling, observed data and the latest generation of climate model results for future projections. Statistical downscaling and bias correction methods, i.e., the Quantile Perturbation Method and Quantile Matching, are applied to enable local scale assessments. It requires observed data for extended periods to facilitate climate change signal assessments and associated future projections. Two types of data sets are considered for observed data, i.e., on-site (local) measurements and reanalysis data.

Based on a panel dataset covering 337 cities from 2004-2013, this study derives the following findings. (1) Air pollution significantly reduces domestic tourist arrivals in the local city. On average, if the concentration of PM2.5 (particulate matter equal to or less than 2.5 micrometers in width) in one city increases by 1 μg/m3, the number of domestic tourists to the city declines by 0.7%. (2) Air pollution demonstrates significant spatial spillover effects. If the PM2.5 in other cities simultaneously increases by 1 μg/m3, the number of domestic tourists traveling to the local city rises by 4.1%. (3) The magnitude of the spillover effects of air pollution is larger than the negative direct effects on local cities. This study suggests that enhancing air quality in the local area will effectively promote the domestic tourism industry in the local city. In addition, it is implied that a simultaneous improvement in the air quality in all cities might not lead to an increase in the number of domestic tourist arrivals. Thus, in order to deal with the spillover effects of air pollution on the domestic tourism industry, local governments should make efforts to develop cross-city or cross-region tourism. © 2019 by the authors.","Air pollution; China; Domestic tourism; PM2.5; Spatial econometric analysis; Spillover effect","air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); domestic work; econometrics; particle size; particulate matter; spillover effect; tourism development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070469201

The study was carried out in the following steps: i) development of a time series model of dynamic thermal response of multi-layer six-pane glass and BIPV façade structures on the basis of transient computational fluid dynamics simulations, ii) integration of the façade structure dynamic model into the building dynamic model by adapting TRNSYS software code, iii) determination of the final energy balance including heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting, and on-site electricity production, iv) nZEB metrics evaluation considering night-time cooling by ventilation, evaporation cooling and hybrid ventilation of case study office buildings. It is shown that energy need for the cooling of the studied office building is dominant in all considered climate conditions, although it can be decreased up to 23% in most favourable considered climate conditions by implementing free cooling techniques. The case study buildings with BIPV structures on their east and west façades meet more stringed nZEB criteria; in addition, final energy demand decreases by 17–37% in comparison to the reference all-glass building. In the case of all-BIPV buildings, the final energy demand is decreased by 36–48%.

Hospitals buildings represent 7% of the nonresidential building stock in the European Union and are responsible for approximately 10% of the total energy consumption in this sector. The design and construction of hospital buildings is a complex and challenging activity for all the involved specialists, especially when energy performance is one of the objectives. This paper discusses the energy performance simulation on an hourly basis of a new hospital building that was constructed in the city of Mioveni, Romania. At this stage of the study, the building energy model solely investigates the performance of the building envelope, without modelling the HVAC system. The complexity of the building model derives from the multitude of thermal zones depending on interior temperature and ventilation air changes conditions. Several simulations are performed investigating the heating and cooling energy need depending on the building location. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

The paper reviews four case studies of Canadian flood disaster risk reduction, with each case chosen to represent one of the four PARA risk reduction options. The extensive network of dikes and pumping stations employed in British Columbia’s Lower Mainland (Fraser River) is used in the paper as an example of a “protect” approach to flood risk reduction; Winnipeg, Manitoba’s Basement Flood Relief Program is used to highlight the “accommodate” approach; zoning changes and land expropriation following Toronto, Ontario’s 1954 Hurricane Hazel flood disaster are used to showcase the “retreat” approach; and, modern floodplain development planning approaches in Calgary, Alberta are used to highlight the “avoid” approach. Overall, this paper contends that the PARA framework can be an effective approach for comprehensive flood disaster risk reduction and flood resilience; however, contextual factors, including equity considerations, should guide its application in situ. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Canada; Climate change; Disaster risk reduction; Flooding; Natural hazards; Resilience","climate change; conceptual framework; disaster management; flooding; hazard management; natural hazard; risk assessment; Canada; Corylus americana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057211435

Biogas fuel is basically a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide. Its composition depends on the type of raw material used for its production. Methane concentration in biogas is between 50÷80%. To be possible engine to work with maximum efficiency with different biogas fuels, it is necessary to modify specific adjustment parameters depending on the concentration of methane in the mixture. This requires the creation of a biogas simulation system for different concentrations of the main components. The aim is to investigate and determine the optimum and permissible biofuel blend concentrations and their impact on engine performance and fuel consumption.

However, the extent to which sub-national renewable energy policies can improve air quality remains unclear. To investigate this issue, we develop a systemic modeling framework that combines economic and air pollution models to assess the projected sub-national impacts of Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPSs) on air quality and human health, as well as on the economy and on climate change. We contribute to existing RPS cost-benefit literature by providing a comprehensive assessment of economic costs and estimating economy-wide changes in emissions and their impacts, using a general equilibrium modeling approach. This study is also the first to our knowledge to directly compare the health co-benefits of RPSs to those of carbon pricing. We estimate that existing RPSs in the 'Rust Belt' region generate a health co-benefit of $94 per ton CO2 reduced ($2-477/tCO2) in 2030, or 8 for each kWh of renewable energy deployed (0.2-40 kWh-1) in 2015 dollars. Our central estimate is 34% larger than total policy costs. We estimate that the central marginal benefit of raising renewable energy requirements exceeds the marginal cost, suggesting that strengthening RPSs increases net societal benefits. We also calculate that carbon pricing delivers health co-benefits of $211/tCO2 in 2030, 63% greater than the health co-benefit of reducing the same amount of CO2 through an RPS approach. © 2019 The Author(s).

Urban plant phenology monitoring is such a typical case, since massive residents do not necessarily mean enough eligible phenology observers. To handle this traditional challenge, this study attempted those surveillance cameras (SCs)widespread almost in any city all over the world. The schematic plan is to install an automatic software module, which has the function of plant phenology monitoring, as a plug-in into any central unit that wire-controls RGB SCs. The kernel of the module is a general-purposed algorithm capable of deriving the starting and ending dates of the key phenological events of different plants that stand in the field of view of each telecontrolled SC. The kernels of the algorithm comprise deriving phenological indices from the digital number (DN)records by a SC from all of its RGB channels and, then, modeling of plant dynamics based on the proposed novel phase-limited multi-Gaussian model for curve-fitting of phenological phases. In the case of determining the key phenological dates regarding flowering and foliation in this study, tests suggested that the proposed scheme and phenological indices and the programmed software plug-in all worked well. Overall, the feasibility of using the widespread SCs for urban plant phenology monitoring was validated, and the scheme can be further extended to composing phenology observation networks at local or global scales. The solution is of implications for more understanding the interannual rhythms of terrestrial ecosystems as well as the inherent mechanisms of vegetation-climate interactions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Phenological index; Phenology model; Software plug-in; Surveillance camera; Urban plant phenology monitoring",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065526502

The health sector is a significant contributor to climate change, making up approximately 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Yet most nurses do not learn about the health dangers of climate change in their education or in practice, and therefore are ill-equipped to lead action on climate change. When educated about climate change, nurses can effectively lead climate adaptation and mitigation strategies aimed at creating healthier populations. As the most trusted professionals and making up 40% of the health-care workforce, nurses have the potential to impact behavior change and launch a movement around climate solutions. Health Care Without Harm and the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments partnered on the “Nurses Climate Challenge” with the aim of nurses educating 5,000 health professionals on climate and health. In the Nurses Climate Challenge, nurses register as Nurse Climate Champions and gain access to online resources to plan and host educational sessions about climate change. After educating, Nurse Climate Champions return to the online platform to track their progress. Within 10 months, over 540 Nurse Climate Champions from 6 continents, 16 countries, and 42 U.S. states registered for access to the resources.

The results presented show that the Argentinean Andes range, from the central to northern latitudes, is an excellent region for the placement of these plants, due to the sum of different positive factors: very high mean annual solar irradiation, low ambient temperature and relative humidity, low precipitable water content, normal wind speeds, and extremely low aerosol content of the atmosphere. The proposed regions are nearby San Antonio de los Cobres and El Leoncito and are compared with two important locations where large solar power plants have been (or will be) built: a site in Africa (Ouarzazate, Morocco) and one in Asia (Dubai, Arab Emirates). We present the results of the possible production of electricity, supplying a total of about 21,000 GWh, which is 15.6% of the 2015 Argentinean electric consumption and, consequently, could reduce the emission of greenhouse gases in a total mass of 11.2 × 106 tons of CO2eq. The installation of this type of renewable power plant will contribute significantly to the Argentinean population due to frequent (mainly summer) cutoff of electric power supply and, in particular, to isolated (low income) populations leaving in the Argentinean Andes range. © 2019 by ASME.","Andes; Argentina; climatic data; solar power plant; solar radiation","Electric power systems; Greenhouse gases; Solar power plants; Solar radiation; Andes; Argentina; Climatic data; Electric consumption; Electric power supply; Low ambient temperatures; Performance factors; Precipitable water content; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059932337

A number of approaches have been suggested, but the community appears to be silent on the potential of one of the most revolutionary technologies of the current century, systems and synthetic biology (SSB). The potential of SSB to modulate the fast carbon cycle, and thereby mitigate climate change is in itself enormous, but if the history of genomics is any measure, it is also reasonable to expect sizeable economic returns on any investment. More generally, the approach to climate control has been badly unbalanced. The last three decades have seen intense international attention to emission control, with no parallel plan to test, scale and implement carbon removal technologies, including attention to their economic, legal and ethical implications.

This rule is named after C.W.L. Gloger who was one of the first to summarise the associations between climatic variation and animal colouration, noting in particular that birds and mammals seemed more pigmented in tropical regions. The term ‘Gloger's rule' was coined by B. Rensch in 1929 and included different patterns of variation from those described by Gloger. Rensch defined the rule in two ways: a simple version stating that endothermic animals are predicted to be darker in warmer and humid areas due to the increased deposition of melanin pigments; and a complex version that includes the differential effects of humidity and temperature on both main types of melanin pigments – eu- and phaeo-melanin. The blackish eu-melanins are predicted to increase with humidity, and decrease only at extreme low temperatures, while the brown-yellowish phaeomelanins prevail in dry and warm regions and decrease rapidly with lower temperatures. A survey of the literature indicates that there is considerable variation/confusion in the way Gloger's rule is understood (based on 271 studies that define the rule). Whereas the complex version is hardly mentioned, only a quarter of the definitions are consistent with the simple version of Gloger's rule (darker where warm and wet), and most definitions mention only the effects of humidity (darker where wet). A smaller subset of studies define the rule based on other correlated climatic and environmental variables such as vegetation, latitude, altitude, solar radiation, etc., and a few even contradict the original definition (darker where cold). Based on the literature survey, I synthesised the qualitative (N = 124 studies) and quantitative (meta-analytically, N = 38 studies, 241 effects) evidence testing the simple version of Gloger's rule (I found no tests of the complex version). Both lines of evidence supported the predicted effects of humidity (and closely linked variables) on colour variation, but not the effects of temperature. Moreover, humidity effects are not restricted to birds and mammals, as the data indicate that these effects also apply to insects. This suggests that the simple version of Gloger's rule as originally defined may not be valid, and possibly that the rule should be re-formulated in terms of humidity effects only. I suggest, however, that more data are needed before such a reformulation, due to potential publication biases. In conclusion, I recommend that authors cite Rensch when referring to Gloger's rule and that they make clear which version they are referring to. Future research should concentrate on rigorously testing the validity and generality of both versions of Gloger's rule and establishing the mechanism(s) responsible for the patterns it describes. Since humidity seems to be the core climatic variable behind Gloger's rule, I suggest that the two most plausible mechanisms are camouflage and protection against parasites/pathogens, the latter possibly through pleiotropic effects on the immune system. Understanding the processes that lead to climatic effects on animal colouration may provide insights into past and future patterns of adaptation to climatic change. © 2019 Cambridge Philosophical Society","biogeography; climate; Gloger's rule; humidity; melanin; pigmentation; temperature; thermal melanism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068187104

These emissions result in environmental externalities primarily in terms of climate and air quality. Here we quantify the cost of co-pollutant emissions per ton of CO2 emissions from US electric power generation. We measure the co-pollutant cost of carbon (CPCC) as the total value of statistical life associated with US-based premature mortalities attributable to co-pollutant emissions, per mass of CO2. We find an average CPCC of ∼$45 per metric ton (mt) of CO2 for the year 2011 (in 2017 USD). This is ∼20% higher than the central Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) measure of climate damages that was used by the Obama administration in its regulatory impact analysis for the Clean Power Plan (CPP), and &gt;8 times higher than the SCC used by the Trump administration in its analysis for the Plan's repeal. At the state-level, the CPCC ranged from ∼$7/mt CO2 for Arizona to ∼$96/mt CO2 for New Jersey. We calculate the CPCC trends from 2002 to 2017 and find a 71% decrease at the national level, contributing to total savings of ∼$1 trillion in averted mortality from power plant emissions over this period. By decomposing the aggregate and fuel-specific co-pollutant intensities into simultaneous (CO2-driven) and autonomous components, we conclude that the CPCC trends originated mainly from targeted efforts to reduce co-pollutant emissions, e.g. through fuel switching (from coal to natural gas) and autonomous changes in co-pollutant emissions. The results suggest that the overall benefit to society from policies to curtail carbon emissions may be enhanced by focusing on pollution sources where the associated air-quality co-benefits are greatest. At the same time, continued efforts to reduce co-pollutant intensities, if technologically feasible, could help to mitigate the air-quality damages of the CPP's repeal and replacement. © 2019 The Author(s).

Making right management decisions for long-term sustainability is therefore challenging, and farmers and farm advisors would greatly benefit from an evidence-based DSS targeted for assessing and improving the supply of several soil functions simultaneously. To address this need, we designed the Soil Navigator DSS by applying a qualitative approach to multi-criteria decision modeling using Decision Expert (DEX) integrative methodology. Multi-criteria decision models for the five main soil functions were developed, calibrated, and validated using knowledge of involved domain experts and knowledge extracted from existing datasets by data mining. Subsequently, the five DEX models were integrated into a DSS to assess the soil functions simultaneously and to provide management advices for improving the performance of prioritized soil functions. To enable communication between the users and the DSS, we developed a user-friendly computer-based graphical user interface, which enables users to provide the required data regarding their field to the DSS and to get textual and graphical results about the performance of each of the five soil functions in a qualitative way. The final output from the DSS is a list of soil mitigation measures that the end-users could easily apply in the field in order to achieve the desired soil function performance. The Soil Navigator DSS has a great potential to complement the Farm Sustainability Tools for Nutrients included in the Common Agricultural Policy 2021–2027 proposal adopted by the European Commission. The Soil Navigator has also a potential to be spatially upgraded to assist decisions on which soil functions to prioritize in a specific region or member state. Furthermore, the Soil Navigator DSS could be used as an educational tool for farmers, farm advisors, and students, and its potential should be further exploited for the benefit of farmers and the society as a whole. © Copyright © 2019 Debeljak, Trajanov, Kuzmanovski, Schröder, Sandén, Spiegel, Wall, Van de Broek, Rutgers, Bampa, Creamer and Henriksen.","decision support system; field scale; method DEX; multi-criteria decision models; soil functions; soil management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072736079

It reviews the impacts of new drivers, in particular those resulting from global climate change and the expansion in aquaculture and the effectiveness of local societal responses aimed at addressing them. Adaptation and mitigation actions are proposed to cope with the impacts and their socio-economic consequences for Latin America and Caribbean mangroves. By comparing the situation in Latin America and the Caribbean with other regions, the knowledge gaps and priority research needs are discussed to support delineating a preliminary unifying framework to address the environmental pressures affecting mangroves. This scenario necessarily includes the interaction of climate change with human interventions and their effects on ecosystem goods and services, as well as their respective adaptation and management options. Results show that drivers of environmental impacts have changed in the past 40 years, reducing the effectiveness of some important societal responses towards conservation and sustainable management with a great potential to increase rates of mangrove deforestation and conversion to human uses. Although efforts in conservation and restoration have contributed to decreasing pressure on these ecosystems, the coupling of old drivers, such as damming, with climate change, and the appearance of new drivers in the region, such as shrimp aquaculture, may eclipse the gains made through these conservation efforts. Despite the negative trend, we discuss some successful efforts to curb negative impacts of human activities on mangroves. We also recommend regional assessments based on primary sources in the representative mangrove-bearing countries throughout the continent to allow the upscaling of their experiences towards a regional response to the challenges facing Neotropical mangrove conservation and sustainable use. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Caribbean; conservation; Latin America; management; mangrove ecosystems; sustainability","adaptive management; anthropogenic effect; climate change; conservation management; deforestation; ecosystem management; environmental effect; environmental impact; global climate; human activity; mangrove; nature-society relations; Neotropical Region; sustainability; Caribbean Islands; Latin America; Decapoda (Crustacea); Rhizophoraceae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066981501

The aim of this study was to provide a broader urban perspective on the relationship between UFP, measured in terms of particle number concentration (PNC) and PM2.5 (mass concentration of particles with aerodynamic diameter &lt; 2.5 μm) and factors that influence their concentrations. Hourly average PNC and PM2.5 were acquired from 10 cities located in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia over a 12-month period. A pairwise comparison of the mean difference and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with the application of bootstrapping were performed for each city. Diurnal and seasonal trends were obtained using a generalized additive model (GAM). The particle number to mass concentration ratios and the Pearson's correlation coefficient were calculated to elucidate the nature of the relationship between these two metrics. Results show that the annual mean concentrations ranged from 8.0 × 103 to 19.5 × 103 particles·cm−3 and from 7.0 to 65.8 μg·m−3 for PNC and PM2.5, respectively, with the data distributions generally skewed to the right, and with a wider spread for PNC. PNC showed a more distinct diurnal trend compared with PM2.5, attributed to the high contributions of UFP from vehicular emissions to PNC. The variation in both PNC and PM2.5 due to seasonality is linked to the cities' geographical location and features. Clustering the cities based on annual median concentrations of both PNC and PM2.5 demonstrated that a high PNC level does not lead to a high PM2.5, and vice versa. The particle number-to-mass ratio (in units of 109 particles·μg−1) ranged from 0.14 to 2.2, &gt;1 for roadside sites and &lt;1 for urban background sites with lower values for more polluted cities. The Pearson's r ranged from 0.09 to 0.64 for the log-transformed data, indicating generally poor linear correlation between PNC and PM2.5. Therefore, PNC and PM2.5 measurements are not representative of each other; and regulating PM2.5 does little to reduce PNC. This highlights the need to establish regulatory approaches and control measures to address the impacts of elevated UFP concentrations, especially in urban areas, considering their potential health risks. © 2019","Particle number concentration; PM2.5; Urban aerosol","Air quality; Computational complexity; Correlation methods; Health risks; Risk assessment; Generalized additive model; Geographical locations; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; Particle number concentration; Pearson's correlation coefficients; PM2.5; Potential health risks; Urban aerosols; Urban growth; aerosol; air quality; bootstrapping; concentration (composition); correlation; particulate matter; temporal variation; traffic emission; trend analysis; urban atmosphere; aerosol; article; Asia; Australia; bootstrapping; city; concentration (parameter); correlation coefficient; Europe; health hazard; Kolmogorov Smirnov test; North America; seasonal variation; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; city; exhaust gas; particle size; particulate matter; Asia; Australia; Europe; North America; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065858791

Although the relevance of society in regional mitigation and adaptation to climate change is now recognised, it is still not clear how local places and social climate change meanings inform each other. Taking this gap in research as a starting point, we investigate people's ‘emplaced’ climate meanings with the approach of psychological distances (geographical, temporal and social). Using a grounded method and 36 semi-structured interviews with inhabitants of North Frisia (Germany) – a region that has always been profoundly affected by environmental change – we disentangle the different distances and proximities that permeate and create local climate change meanings. Overall, we demonstrate (1) the dynamic nature of psychological distances and proximities producing climate change meanings and we reveal (2) the importance of a place-based approach for analysing the abstract entity of climate change. © 2019","Construal level theory; North Frisia; Psychological distances and proximities; Regional climate change; Social perception of climate change","climate change; environmental change; perception; psychology; regional climate; sense of place; Germany; North Frisia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067871223

An important variable in hydrological models trying to catch this behaviour is the catchment representative root zone storage capacity (Sr). Traditionally, Sr is derived from soil properties, which makes it difficult to incorporate changes in climatic and vegetation conditions. Using climate data rather than soil data to derive Sr enables the evaluation of the effect of climate variability on modelled runoff through Sr-estimates. A temporal variability in Sr reflects a changing root system and thus the vegetation's adaptation to medium-term fluctuations in the climate. The sensitivity of the derived Sr to variations in climate could give information about the impact of climatic changes on the hydrological behaviour of a catchment. Therefore, this study investigates how a climate-derived root zone storage capacity changes under changing climatic conditions. Southern Africa is selected as a study area, as this region represents a wide variety in climatic conditions, including very dry ones. Sr-values estimated for the current climate and vegetation cover are compared with Sr-values estimated for two cases with varying climatic conditions. The results show that these changes not only affect the root zone storage capacity, but differences in changing patterns are observed between grid cells as well. Especially, the current runoff coefficient and the inter-annual variability in precipitation and evaporation appear to be important variables in determining the change behaviour of Sr. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climatic variability; Hydrology; Root zone storage capacity; Southern Africa","Catchments; Digital storage; Hydrology; Runoff; Sensitivity analysis; Vegetation; Climatic variability; Hydrological models; Interannual variability; Runoff coefficients; Southern Africa; Storage capacity; Temporal variability; Vegetation condition; Climate change; climate conditions; climate variation; hydrological modeling; hydrology; rhizosphere; runoff; spatiotemporal analysis; vegetation cover; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065775694

These communities are increasingly vulnerable to climate (e.g. increasing cyclone occurrence and intensity) and environmental (e.g. mining and deforestation) stressors. Within these landscape systems, accurate and timely monitoring of human-climate-environment interactions is important to inform landscape management, land use policies, and climate-smart sustainable development. Data collection and monitoring approaches exist to capture landscape-livelihood information such as surveys, participatory GIS (PGIS), and remote sensing. However, these monitoring approaches are challenged by data collection and management burdens, timely integration of databases and data streams, aligning system requirements with local needs, and socio-technical issues associated with low-resource development contexts. Such monitoring approaches only provide static representation of livelihood-landscape interactions failing to capture the dynamic nature of vulnerabilities, and benefit only a small user base. We present a prototype of a mobile, open-source geospatial tool being collaboratively developed with the Ministries of Agriculture in Fiji and Tonga and local stakeholders, to address the above shortcomings of PGIS and other environmental monitoring and data sharing approaches. The tool is being developed using open-source mobile GIS technologies following a formal ICT for Development (ICT4D) framework. We discuss the results for each component of the ICT4D framework which involves multiple landscape stakeholders across the two Small Island Developing States. Based on the ICT4D user requirements analysis, we produced a prototype open-source mobile geospatial data collection, analysis and sharing tool.

However, most of the spatially explicit approaches that have been developed to date produce outputs at a coarse resolution or do not disaggregate the data by sector. In this study, we present a methodology for assessing GHG emissions from the residential sector by settlements at a fine spatial resolution. In many countries, statistical data about fossil fuel consumption is only available at the regional or country levels. For this reason, we assess energy demand for cooking and water and space heating for each settlement, which we use as a proxy to disaggregate regional fossil fuel consumption data. As energy demand for space heating depends heavily on climatic conditions, we use the heating degree day method to account for this phenomenon. We also take the availability of energy sources and differences in consumption patterns between urban and rural areas into account. Based on the disaggregated data, we assess GHG emissions at the settlement level using country and regional specific coefficients for Poland and Ukraine, two neighboring countries with different energy usage patterns. In addition, we estimate uncertainties in the results using a Monte Carlo method, which takes uncertainties in the statistical data, calorific values, and emission factors into account. We use detailed data on natural gas consumption in Poland and biomass consumption for several regions in Ukraine to validate our approach. We also compare our results to data from the EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research), which shows high agreement in places but also demonstrates the advantage of a higher resolution GHG inventory. Overall, the results show that the approach developed here is universal and can be applied to other countries using their statistical information. © 2019, The Author(s).","Geoinformation system; Greenhouse gas emissions; High-resolution data; Residential sector; Spatial inventory; Uncertainty","climate conditions; emission; emission inventory; environmental assessment; fossil fuel; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; information system; natural gas; residential location; spatial distribution; uncertainty analysis; Poland [Central Europe]; Ukraine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064265796

In order to pinpoint the best integration mode, different sizes of gas turbine and solar collector's area have been examined and presented. Thermoflow software was used for evaluating the performance of each integrated design under consideration. The optimal solar integration sizes have been determined. Moreover, reduction in CO2 emissions due to integrating the LFR system is estimated with respect to that of the conventional trigeneration plant. For the considered trigeneration plant (that is required to produce 120.5 MW of steam, and 2500kg/s of chilled water), the study revealed that LFR-GTPP with gas turbine sizes less than 190 MWe capacities have more economic feasibility and sufficient ability for utilizing solar energy.

The annual performance of the LFR-GTPP with different sizes of gas turbine and solar collector's area have been examined and presented. Thermoflex + PEACE software were used for the economic-thermodynamic-environmental assessment of different integration configurations. For the considered tri-generation plant (produce 35.6 kg/s of steam (120.55 MW), 2500 kg/s of chilled water (24440 tons), and 90 MWe of steam turbines electricity), the study revealed that LFR-GTPP with gas turbine sizes in the range 130–190 MWe have more economic feasibility for integrating LFR. Furthermore, the study revealed that the integration of LFR system with a conventional gas turbine tri-generation power plant (GTPP) in locations with high solar radiation has more economic feasibility (with 7.6% reduction in LEC) compared to equivalent GTPP integrated with CO2 capturing technology while achieving the same CO2 emissions reduction. Moreover, a conceptual procedure to determine the optimal configurations of the LFR-GTPP has been developed and presented in this article. The results indicate that the proper location to apply optimal integration configuration is in regions with high levels of solar radiation and low ambient temperature. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental impact; Gas turbine tri-generation power plant; Linear Fresnel reflector; Solar thermal power plants; Thermodynamic and economic performance","Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Emission control; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Gas turbines; Integration; Reflection; Solar radiation; Steam turbines; Thermoelectric power plants; Trigeneration plant; Economic feasibilities; Economic performance; Environmental assessment; Integration configurations; Linear fresnel reflector (LFR); Low ambient temperatures; Solar thermal power plants; Tri-generation; Gas turbine power plants; carbon emission; cooling; equipment; integrated approach; performance assessment; power generation; power plant; solar radiation; temperature effect; turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061343704

Organic carbon compounds are nowadays the most intensively used electron sources in full-scale wastewater treatment, corresponding with the well-understood carbon-nitrogen biogeochemistry for heterotrophic denitrification process. In the twenty-first century, the low-carbon technology is on calling to reduce the carbon footprint and relieve climate changing threatens. Autotrophic denitrification is highly recommended for mainstream wastewater treatment. The reduced-sulphur compounds (such as sulphide, elemental sulphur, and thiosulphate) could be utilised as electron donors, to drive sulphur cycle reactions to reduce nitrate and nitrite to dinitrogen gas. Based on the literature review and our own research experiences, this paper presents our perspectives on sulphur-driven autotrophic denitrification. It particularly focuses on the functional enzymes, sulphur bioreactors, and influential operating factors. Overall, this paper provides new insights on sulphur-nitrogen biogeochemistry and application as a low-carbon technology for nitrogen removal during municipal wastewater treatment. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Autotrophic denitrification; Sulphur; Sulphur-oxidising bacteria; Wastewater treatment","Biogeochemistry; Biological water treatment; Carbon footprint; Denitrification; Nitrogen removal; Organic carbon; Reclamation; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; Autotrophic denitrification; Biological denitrification; Biological nitrogen removal; Heterotrophic denitrification; Low-carbon technologies; Municipal wastewater treatment; Organic carbon compounds; Reduced sulphur compounds; Wastewater treatment; acetic acid; alcohol; carbon; carbon dioxide; enzyme; methane; methanol; nitrate; nitrate reductase; nitric oxide reductase; nitrite; nitrite reductase; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; nitrous oxide reductase; organic matter; sulfide; sulfur; thiosulfate; nitric acid derivative; nitrogen; sulfur derivative; autotrophy; bioremediation; carbon footprint; denitrification; enzyme activity; nitrogen; oxidation; pollutant removal; sulfur; wastewater treatment; activated sludge; alkalinity; autotrophy; biodegradation; bioengineering; carbon footprint; climate change; cost; denitrification; heterotrophy; municipal wastewater; nonhuman; Paracoccus; Proteobacteria; Review; sludge; solids retention time; sulfur cycle; sulfur oxidizing bacterium; Sulfurimonas; Thiobacillus; Thiomicrospira; waste water management; metabolism; microbiology; procedures; waste water; water management; Autotrophic Processes; Denitrification; Nitrates; Nitrites; Nitrogen; Sulfur Compounds; Waste Water; Water Purification",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067820639

That makes it difficult for researchers to understand the competition mechanism of C3 and C4 plants under different climate environments and its relationship with the climate factors. It is also not conducive for researchers to assess the influence of future climate change on regional C3/C4 vegetation. Exactly, C3/C4 vegetation change in the regional-scale will have a significant impact on the global carbon cycle and agricultural production. Therefore, it is especially important to reconstruct the evolutionary history of C3/C4 vegetation in southern China and clarify the influencing mechanism of climate change. In this study, we systematically analyzed stable carbon isotope (δ13C) of the longchain n-alkanes in sediment samples from eight lakes and four peat profiles in southern China, to reconstruct the spatiotemporal evolution of C3/C4 vegetation in these regions since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and to investigate the climate factors that affect the C4 plant abundance change in the research area. The integrated long-chain n-alkane (C27–C33) stable carbon isotope results of samples from Zhanjiang Huguangyan Maar Lake, Xingyun Lake, Lugu Lake and Dingnan peat showed that, from the LGM to the Early Holocene, C4 plant relative abundance exhibited a gradually increasing trend from 21% to 34%. In the Middle Holocene, the C4 plant abundance significantly declined and reached a lowest value of 10%. In space, the C4 plant abundance generally exhibited a gradually declining trend from south to north in the LGM and the Early Holocene, while it showed an opposite trend in the Holocene Climate Optimum (6.0 cal ka BP). It reflected that the main influencing factor on C4 plants spatial distribution was changing from temperature to precipitation. This study indicated that temperature was the dominant factor affecting C4 plant distribution in southern China, however, when the temperature condition was appropriate, an increase in precipitation (especially more spring precipitation) would reduce the competitive advantages of C4 plants. Therefore, the combination of temperature and seasonal precipitation was the important factor that determines the C3/C4 vegetation proportion change in the southern China. Under the premise that the temperature will rise and precipitation will increase in the future, the reduction of a competitive advantage for the C4 plants could affect agricultural production in China. © 2018, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","C3/C4 vegetation; Holocene Climate Optimum period; Last Glacial Maximum; Long-chain n-alkanes; Stable carbon isotope","Agriculture; Carbon; Chains; Competition; Glacial geology; Isotopes; Lakes; Paraffins; Peat; Vegetation; Agricultural productions; Holocene climate; Influencing mechanisms; Last Glacial Maximum; Long chain n-alkanes; Seasonal precipitations; Spatiotemporal evolution; Stable carbon isotopes; Climate change; abundance; alkane; carbon isotope; climate variation; Hypsithermal; Last Glacial Maximum; precipitation (climatology); temporal evolution; vegetation dynamics; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050297877

Obviously, the combustion conditions and exhaust emissions are sensitive at such high EGR rate. And any slight fluctuation in the EGR quantity will bring unintended deviations from the desired engine performance, thus LTC mode is only limited at partial engine operation points. So the engine has to switch combustion mode frequently between compression ignition (CI) and LTC region within a few engine cycles in real application, which may result in combustion cyclic variations and even misfire, especially during transient operation. In order to investigate effect of heavy EGR transient process on engine combustion cycles, the experimental work was carried out on a four-cylinder VM common-rail turbocharged diesel engine. The results show that the oxygen concentration in the intake charge almost maintains at steady level at EGR steady conditions, while the exhaust oxygen concentration is affected by exhaust values opening/exhaust values closing (EVO/EVC), and result in intra-cycle fluctuation, which will approximately bring 2% calculation error bandwidth for EGR ratio. From 37% to 55% EGR ratio, the EGR gas is mainly driven by the pressure ratio of intake and exhaust duct, and it will experience a long accumulating process to reach a new equilibrium. And the inordinate delayed injection timing will promote in-cylinder cycle-to-cycle variation and even misfire, especially during transition from CI to LTC region. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Exploiting solar energy implies a reduction of the network operation cost as well as of the carbon footprint of radio access networks, but previous research works indicate that the area of the solar panels that are necessary to power a standard macro BS is large, so large to make the solar panel deployment problematic, especially within urban areas. In this paper we use a modeling approach based on Markov reward processes to investigate the possibility of combining small area solar panels with a connection to the power grid to run a macro BS. By so doing, it is possible to increase the amount of renewable energy used to run a radio access network, while also reducing the cost incurred by the network operator to power its base stations. We assume that energy is drawn from the power grid only when needed to keep the BS operational, or during the night, that corresponds to the period with lowest electricity price. This has advantages in terms of both cost and carbon footprint. We show that solar panels of the order of 1-2 kW peak, i.e., with a surface of about 5-10 m2, combined with limited capacity energy storage (of the order of 10-15 kWh, corresponding to about 3-5 car batteries), and a smart energy management policy, can lead to an effective exploitation of renewable energy. © 2019 ITC Press.","Base station; Energy consumption; Green networking; Radio access network; Renewable energy; Solar panel","Base stations; Carbon footprint; Cost reduction; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Energy utilization; Radio; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Electricity prices; Green networkings; Markov reward process; Mobile network operators; Network operations; Renewable energies; Solar panels; Use of renewable energies; Radio access networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074747965

This research analyzed interviews with Australian and Canadian professionals who worked with climate change knowledge in research, policy, and practice to gauge in what way their climate knowledge was linked to autonomous adaptation in personal circles. Analysis combined a thematic approach and a novel Future Climate Narrative (FCN) typology informed by literature relating to Future Thinking, Climate Knowledge and Narrative Communication. The results identified four main narratives: Distance, Vulnerability, Agency, and Change. Findings showed that where Change narratives were not commonly shared, little climate change knowledge was exchanged in personal circles, especially information that might increase a sense of danger; challenge the imagination; or present unfamiliar scenarios. This research shows that without future-oriented narratives supporting autonomous and community adaptation planning and practice, the benefits of currently high social adaptive capacity and relatively low vulnerability to climate change may not be realized through proactive adaptation. In developed nations where near- term, and in some cases unavoidable, climate change impacts are not commonly discussed, new Change narratives linking Climate Knowledge and Future Thinking are needed to reflect swiftly evolving climate change scenarios. In addition, lack of adaptation planning among well-informed professionals again challenges expectations that more and better climate change knowledge will directly increase adaptation behaviour, irrespective of engagement in future thinking. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Autonomous; Change; Communication; Decision-maker; Distance; Prospection","academic research; adaptive management; autonomy; climate change; communication; decision making; environmental education; environmental planning; future prospect; research work; vulnerability; Australia; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067195087

Under 2014 trade volumes, technologies and energy mixes, a hard Brexit - reverting to a trade pattern between the UK and the EU prior to the European Internal Market (EIM) - would imply a rise of about 0.215Gt of CO2eq in the UK's emissions embodied in imports. This is equivalent to a 38% rise in UK's imported emissions in 2014 and roughly equal to the territorial emissions of the Netherlands in 2017. Substituting imports from the EU with those from the Rest of the World (RoW), under the same conditions, implies adding 0.35 kg of CO2eq, on average, to each dollar of activity imported in the UK. This underlines the emission benefits of an integrated European market abiding to common environmental standards and climate policies. Filling the gap in imports lost from the UK to the EU by stepping up production within the EIM would result in an extra 0.012Gt of CO2eq, a rather small increase when compared to the additional emissions in the UK's imports following Brexit. Should the EU reallocate the lost imports from the UK to the RoW, a total of 0.128Gt of CO2eq would be added to the EIM imports. This exposes the environmental benefits in terms of emissions in keeping UK trade closely linked to the EU and the important role that Single Member States can play indirectly on EU's import emissions. In terms of emissions embodied in trade, the sum of the EU market is, paradoxically and for the better, less than the sum of its individual parts. © 2019 The Author(s).

This study responds to the need expressed by the scientific community to develop and test LCSA methodology, by assessing the sustainability of a concentrated solar power (CSP) plant based on HYSOL technology (an innovative configuration delivering improved efficiency and power dispatchability). Methods: The methodology proposed consists of three stages: goal and scope definition, modelling and application of tools, and interpretation of results. The goal of the case study was to investigate to what extent may the HYSOL technology improve the sustainability of power generation in the Spanish electricity sector. To this purpose, several sustainability sub-questions were framed and different analysis tools were applied as follows: attributional and consequential life cycle assessment, life cycle cost (LCC) analysis and multiregional input-output analysis (MRIO), and social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) in combination with social risk assessment (with the Social Hotspots Database). Visual diagrams representing the sustainability of the analysed scenarios were also produced to facilitate the interpretation of results and decision making. Results and discussion: The results obtained in the three sustainability dimensions were integrated using a “questions and answers” layout, each answer describing a specific element of sustainability. The HYSOL technology was investigated considering two different operation modes: HYSOL BIO with biomethane as hybridization fuel and HYSOL NG with natural gas. The results indicated that the deployment of HYSOL technology would produce a reduction in the climate change impact of the electricity sector for both operation modes. The LCC analysis indicated economic benefits per MWh for a HYSOL NG power plant, but losses for a HYSOL BIO power plant. The MRIO analysis indicated an increase in goods and services generation, and value added for the HYSOL technology affecting primarily Spain and to a lower extent other foreign economies. The social analysis indicated that both alternatives would provide a slight increase of social welfare Spain.

This method can be extended to monitoring black carbon, which is composed of particles with a diameter smaller than 2.5 μm. Traditionally, the monitoring of PM particulate material has been done using robust and expensive equipment such as BAM and TEOM, which should not be subject to continuous movement dynamics to avoid deterioration or possible damage. Therefore, in our research associated with the study of air quality, we use low cost, reliable and easy mobilility Shinyei optical sensors, allowing its using in any place or region. To ensure reliability in the measurement of PM concentrations, the corresponding intercalibration with reference equipments was made. Simultaneously, we made measurements of macroscopic state variables associated with the climate, then we modeled and simulated the dispersion and diffusion of PM in the air of the municipality under study. Next, we compare simulation and monitoring results to know the air quality status. Basically, we follow the methodology of a research program that we design and which is constituted by several phases and whose general objective is the study of air quality. In each phase of this program, the inventory of emission sources is intensified to involve other pollutants, including greenhouse gases. Finally, it is show the results obtained from the first phase implemented in the municipality of Vijes, Valle del Cauca, Colombia. These results were socialized with the governmental entities responsible for the care of the environment, too, in scientific events.

The use of precomputed equilibrium ratios (K-values) has long been justified on the basis of efficiency. However, this method may not appropriately represent thermal recovery mechanisms. An equation of state (EOS) approach is more rigorous, though prohibitively costly. In thermal recovery processes the injection of steam results in hydrocarbon-water interactions at elevated temperatures. Representation of phase behavior for these systems in a nonisothermal context gives rise to a set of challenges owing to the polarity of the water molecule and resulting nonideal phase behavior. In this research we address two difficulties pertinent to thermal compositional reservoir simulation: (i) robust phase-stability analysis using a predetermined set of initial estimates for phase-equilibrium ratios; (ii) numerical solution of phase-split (flash) calculations in the presence of trace components. Phase-stability testing can be difficult for hydrocarbon-water mixtures. Three-phase regions can be extremely narrow in pressure-temperature space, making the resolution of phase boundaries problematic. The standard approach to phase stability testing for hydrocarbon reservoir fluids entails using a series of initial guesses for the equilibrium ratios based on variations of the Wilson correlation (Wilson, G. M. A modified Redlich-Kwong equation of state, application to general physical data calculations; 65th National AIChE Meeting, Cleveland, OH, 1969) and trial-phase compositions dominated by each of the Nc components present. For hydrocarbon-water mixtures, fewer initial guesses are required. We propose a physics-based strategy, sensitive to the distinct behavior of water. We use the steam saturation pressure to guide our selection of trial phase compositions. Below saturated steam pressure, only two sets of equilibrium ratios are required to identify the correct phase state. Above the saturation pressure, we expand our set of initial K-value estimates to account for the appearance of a near pure aqueous phase. The K-values obtained from stability analysis are used to perform two-phase flash computations. Then, the stability of the two-phase mixture is assessed. The phase state of the system following the two-phase flash guides the choice of the next set of K-values. This strategy has two direct benefits. First, the number of trial phases required for stability testing is predetermined. Second, the reliability of the phase-stability tests and the ensuing equilibrium calculations is greatly improved. The solution procedure for phase-split calculations in isothermal compositional simulation is typically a two-stage process that uses successive-substitution in conjunction with the Newton method. However, in a nonisothermal setting the presence of trace amounts of hydrocarbons in the aqueous phase can produce ill-conditioned linearized systems when standard (conventional) variables are used in the Newton loop. We have developed a reduced order model for three-phase split calculations that allows us to circumvent these numerical difficulties. The reduced method is formulated to take advantage of the sparsity of the binary interaction parameter matrix. For the first time, we demonstrate the efficacy of a reduced-variables formulation for phase-split calculations involving trace components. We present our protocol for hydrocarbon-water phase-equilibrium computations through comprehensive testing of characterized fluids from the literature. Through our approach to robust phase-stability testing and phase-split calculations, we are able to consistently resolve phase boundaries. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Hydrocarbons; Mixtures; Molecules; Newton-Raphson method; Phase composition; Phase equilibria; Phase stability; Saturation (materials composition); Thermal oil recovery; Binary interaction parameter; Compositional simulations; Hydrocarbon-water mixture; Isothermal compositional simulation; Phase equilibrium calculation; Phase stability analysis; Redlich-kwong equation of state; Successive substitutions; Equations of state",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070881901

The output of the study was to assess fuel consumption, CO2, and regulated pollutant emissions for different type of vehicles, routes, and drivers. The results show that in the case studied, urban roads had fewer emissions (CO2 and pollutants) but there was an increase in the population affected by pollutants. On the contrary, bypasses reduced travel time and congestion but increased fuel consumption and emissions. Traffic conditions had a greater influence on fuel consumption in petrol vehicles than diesel ones. Therefore, there must be a balanced distribution of traffic in order to minimize congestion, and at the same time to reduce emissions and the number of people affected by harmful pollution levels. There should be a combination of regulatory measures in traffic policies in order to achieve that balance by controlling access to city centres, limiting parking spaces, pedestrianization, and lowering traffic speeds in sensitive areas. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Driving behaviour; Eco-routing; Emissions; Fuel consumption; Road type","Behavioral research; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Environmental management; Fuel consumption; Fuels; Particulate emissions; Pollution; Routing algorithms; Travel time; Driving behaviour; ECO routing; Environmental strategy; Number of peoples; Pedestrianization; Regulated pollutants; Road type; Traffic conditions; Traffic congestion; car use; climate change; fuel consumption; mobility; road transport; traffic congestion; traffic emission; urban transport; Caceres [Extremadura]; Extremadura; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070750532

These risks are particularly pronounced in the Upper Nile Basin, a chronically water stressed agricultural region that includes western Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Uganda. While the causes of humanitarian crises in the Nile Basin are complex and involve governance, conflict, and climate, we demonstrate that nearly all recent regional crop failures have occurred amid hot and dry conditions and low runoff supplies. Using an observational ensemble, we find that such hot and dry years have been more frequent in recent decades, driven by increasing regional temperatures. This trend is likely to continue despite climate model projections of increasing regional precipitation. By the late 21st century, the frequency of hot and dry years may rise by a factor of 1.5–3, even if warming is limited to 2 °C. Regional water scarcity will continue to be a chronic issue for the Upper Nile from population growth alone, but runoff deficits during future hot and dry years will amplify this effect, leaving an additional 5–15% of the future population facing water scarcity. Climate change, along with the region's complex water politics, dependence on subsistence agriculture, and history of geopolitical instability, places the region at risk of severe food and water shortages as hot and dry years become more frequent. Adaptation and climate-resilient water management policies informed by an understanding of compound extremes will be essential to manage these risks. ©2019.

It is in response to this gap, this paper explores agency perspectives and policy responses on the possibility and procedure for harnessing urban planning as a tool for managing climate change impacts in a Ghanaian city of Kumasi. Using a review of three relevant urban planning and climate change policies of Ghana, and interviews with six urban planning and climate-related agencies in Kumasi, findings indicate a demonstration of an unclear nature of policies, and a lack of focus on climate change issues in urban planning. Evidence of weak agency framework and coordination challenges (e.g., logistics, enforcement of laws) were reported, a situation that has contributed to the city's inability to manage ‘normal’ climate change impacts (e.g., flash floods).

Also, the wide spread in household characteristics (e.g. size, income, age)leads not only to different carbon footprints, but also includes an underlying difference in the contributions of the consumption domains. Therefore, it is essential that policies focussing on climate change mitigation should be customized to take into account these differences. In this study we quantify which socio-economic household characteristics are associated with a higher than average per capita carbon footprint and which consumption domains trigger this higher than average carbon footprint. The results are quantified for the regional case study of Flanders (Belgium). To obtain a better estimate of direct and indirect emissions we draw upon the EXIOBASE2 multi-region input-output dataset combined with the regional input-output data and detailed regional household budget survey data. From our analysis, it is also clear that the decomposition of the carbon footprint into the relevant consumption domains reveals insights that are absent when comparing total carbon footprints. Overall we find that there is a clear link between the income distribution and the carbon footprint of consumption, a finding that returns frequently in literature for both developed and developing countries. However, this income distribution is closely related to several underlying other socio-economic categories (e.g. level of education and household size)which do provide further insights useful for policy as they reveal important socio-economic aspect which needs to be considered. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Household budget survey; Household consumption; Input-output analysis","Budget control; Climate change; Developing countries; Economic analysis; Emission control; Surveys; Climate change mitigation; Footprint analysis; Household Consumption; Income distribution; Indirect carbon emissions; Input output analysis; Level of educations; Socioeconomic aspects; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065430821

However, before they can be applied with confidence, it is important to calibrate and validate crop models in the region of interest. In this study, the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model was evaluated for its potential to simulate maize yield using limited data from field trials on two maize cultivars. Two independent fields at the Cradock Research Farm were used, one for calibration and one for validation. Before calibration, mean simulated yield was 8 t ha−1 while mean observed yield was 11.26 t ha−1. Model calibration improved mean simulated yield to 11.23 t ha−1 with a coefficient of determination, (r2) = 0.76 and a model efficiency (NSE) = 0.56. Validation with grain yield was satisfactory with r2 = 0.85 and NSE = 0.61. Calibration of potential heat units (PHUs) and soil-carbon related parameters improved model simulations. Although the study only used grain yield to calibrate and evaluate the model, results show that the calibrated model can provide reasonably accurate simulations.

We leverage fire and vegetation records from a highly flammable ecoregion in Alaska and present new lake-sediment analyses to examine biogeochemical responses to fire over the past 5300 years. No significant difference exists in δ13C, %C, %N, C: N, or magnetic susceptibility between pre-fire, post-fire, and fire samples. However, δ15N is related to the timing relative to fire (χ2 = 19.73, p &lt; 0.0001), with higher values for fire-decade samples (3.2 ± 0.3) than pre-fire (2.4 ± 0.2) and post-fire (2.2 ± 0.1) samples. Sediment δ15N increased gradually from 1.8 ± 0.6 to 3.2 ± 0.2 over the late Holocene, probably as a result of terrestrial-ecosystem development. Elevated δ15N in fire decades likely reflects enhanced terrestrial nitrification and/or deeper permafrost thaw depths immediately following fire. Similar δ15N values before and after fire decades suggest that N cycling in this lowland-boreal watershed was resilient to fire disturbance. However, this resilience may diminish as boreal ecosystems approach climate-driven thresholds of vegetation structure, permafrost thaw and fire. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Despite its importance, aerosol pH projected in the near future has not been addressed explicitly while investigating the response of aerosol concentrations to emission regulations. In this study, we apply CMAQ to simulate aerosol pH in 2011 and 2050 across the continental U.S. We also assess the influence of two major emission trends, declining SO2 emissions and rising NH3 emissions, with a set of sensitivity simulations. Our results show that the aerosols will remain acidic with average pH typically ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 in 2050. Further reducing domestic SO2 emissions does not significantly decrease aerosol acidity, even if SO2 emissions were reduced to preindustrial levels because of the nonlinear response of SO4 2- concentration to SO2 emissions, and the semivolatile NH3-NH4 + buffering effect. Aerosol pH response to NH3 emission increase will remain minor. Consequently, future fine particulate matter control efficiency will not be undercut by additional nitrate aerosol formation even if SO2 emissions from industry and electricity generation are aggressively controlled, although areas will see some substitution leading to nitrate increases if NOx emissions are not reduced.

Process-based dynamic global vegetation models (DGVM) are important tools for simulating past vegetation dynamics and carbon cycle; yet the link between spatial gradients of climate and vegetation cover in geological past has received less attention. In this study, we simulate the distribution of vegetation under three CO2 levels for two climate states, the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Pre-industrial (PI) climate with fire activated or deactivated using the ORCHIDEE-MICT DGVM. Results show that elevated CO2 and warmer climate promote global total tree cover but the impacts are different between forest biomes. Regional tree cover is highly regulated by mean annual precipitation (MAP) especially in the tropics, and by temperature for the boreal-arctic tree line. Based on quantile nonlinear regressions, we analyze the MAP threshold at which maximum tree cover is reached. This threshold is significantly reduced with elevated CO2 for tropical and temperate trees. With higher CO2, increased tree cover leads to reduced fire ignition and burned area, and provides a positive feedback to tree cover, especially in Africa. Besides, in our model, increasing CO2-induced enhancement of gross primary productivity (GPP) is more prominent for tropical trees than for temperate and boreal trees, and for dry regions than wet regions. This difference explains why CO2 is the major factor influencing forest cover in the tropics. It also highlights that special attention should be paid to collect paleo-vegetation data across savannas-forest transition in dry regions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM); Elevated CO2; Nonlinear quantile regression; Precipitation limitation; Vegetation shift","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Digital storage; Forestry; Glacial geology; Tropics; Vegetation; Elevated CO2; Gross primary productivity; Last Glacial Maximum; Mean annual precipitation; Non-linear regression; Quantile regression; Vegetation distribution; Vegetation model; Climate models; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; global change; Last Glacial Maximum; precipitation (climatology); primary production; regression analysis; vegetation cover; vegetation dynamics; vegetation mapping",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068413112

By expanding the theory of planned behaviour by considering the effects of the quality of public transport service and individual behaviour, this paper establishes a mixed PET behaviour model. Grounded theory is used to analyse data obtained from in-depth interviews, with the aim of determining the relationships among different attributes of the quality of public transport service and PET. An empirical examination in the form of a questionnaire was conducted in Changsha, China, to obtain the intensity and mechanism of various factors influencing pro-environment behaviour decision-making. The results reveal three new pieces of information. First, the influence of many psychological variables (except subjective norms) is consistent with the prediction results of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), and the predictions of the model are accurate. More specifically, intention (0.535) and habit (0.354) are key factors in PET behaviour, while attitude (0.527) has the most significant effect on intention towards PET behaviour. Second, the perceived service quality of public transport has a direct and significant impact on intention towards PET behaviour. Satisfaction with public transport service quality exerts a mediating effect on perceived service quality and PET behaviour. More specifically, operation and management (0.808) and vehicle environment (0.809) have the most important influence on intention towards PET behaviour. Last but not least, the extent of the influence of PET behaviour varies based on travellers' demographic characteristics. The driving age, income and ownership of private cars show the greatest impact. The perceived service quality of public transport and travellers' social and economic characteristics all play roles in the psychology of travel decisions, and are associated with PET behaviour on several distinct levels. From the perspectives of passenger psychology, public transport service quality and personal attributes of passengers, this paper provides a scientific basis for decision-making in transportation systems and the formulation of traffic intervention strategies to promote voluntary public reductions in carbon-intensive travel behaviour. © 2019 by the authors.","Grounded theory; Perceived service quality; Pro-environment travel behaviour; Qualitative research methods; Structural equation model; Theory of planned behaviour","Decision making; Quality of service; Grounded theory; Perceived service qualities; Qualitative research methods; Structural equation modeling; Theory of planned behaviour; Travel behaviour; Behavioral research; numerical model; public transport; qualitative analysis; research method; service quality; theoretical study; travel behavior; urban society",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070739907

Past studies have shown that Chinese pollutants have a significant impact on Taiwanese air quality; fortunately, China has also been actively promoting various emission control. This study used an air quality model to simulate and evaluate improvements under three emission control scenarios, and assessed the possibility of achieving governmental air quality standards across the various regions of Taiwan under these scenarios. The simulation results show that under the implementation of the expected Taiwan and China emission control strategies (Scenario 3), all regions in Taiwan can reach the 1-Hour O 3 standard (120 ppb) by 2020, but since the 8-Hour O 3 standard (60 ppb) is considerably stricter, with strategies biased toward PM 2.5 improvement, most areas, particularly western Taiwan, will still be unable to meet the standards by 2020. For PM 2.5 , regulatory responses have significantly improved Annual PM 2.5 and 24-Hour PM 2.5 in each region, especially in southern Taiwan, however in most regions such as western Taiwan there are still pockets of pollutants where Annual PM 2.5 (15 μg/m 3 ) and 24-Hour PM 2.5 (35 μg/m 3 ) rise well above the desired threshold to 2–14 μg/m 3 and 3–30 μg/m 3 respectively. It is suggested that Taiwan should propose more intensive emission control measures and strengthen the implementation of such measures.

However, how they co-regulate carbon fluxes is still elusive for some understudied ecosystems. To fill the gap, we examined net ecosystem productivity (NEP), gross ecosystem productivity (GEP,) and ecosystem respiration (ER) responses to multilevel of temperature increments (control, warming 1, warming 2, warming 3, warming 4) in three contrasting hydrological growing seasons in a typical semiarid alpine meadow. We found that carbon fluxes responded to precipitation variations more strongly in low-level warming treatments than in high-level ones. The distinct responses were attributable to different soil water conditions and community composition under low-level and high-level warming during the three growing seasons. In addition, carbon fluxes were much more sensitive to decreased than to increased precipitation in low-level warming treatments, but not in high-level ones. At a regional scale, this negative asymmetry was further corroborated. This study reveals that future precipitation changes, particularly decreased precipitation would induce significant change in carbon fluxes, and the effect magnitude is regulated by climate warming size. © 2019 The Authors.

In the search for low-carbon development and industrial upgrading, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH)region represents an experimental plot for all of China. In this study, we employed a comprehensive analytical framework to investigate the changing pattern of CO2 emissions in the BTH region, where large-scale industrial structural changes are happening; the results of this study provide a critical reference for regions facing the dual tasks of industrial transitions and environmental protection. The results indicate that industrial structural changes have helped diminish mounting CO2 emissions in the BTH region; however, the extent of the effect differs among the provinces involved. Improvements in technology and organization level in the fastest growing sectors, such as machinery manufacturing and service industries, have helped to curb CO2 emissions significantly. However, industrial structural changes have failed to narrow the CO2 emission gaps among provinces in the region. Being in different phase of development and possessing various resource endowments, the provinces in the BTH region have followed a diversified path of industrial upgrading and have emerged as a region with explicit labor divisions and supply chains. On one hand, this intensifies regional CO2 emission differences, and on the other, it has allowed policymakers to promote more customized decarbonizing plans. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei; China; CO2 emissions; Industrial structural change; Input-output model; Structural decomposition analysis","Carbon dioxide; Facings; Machinery; Supply chains; China; CO2 emissions; Industrial structural change; Input output model; Structural decomposition analysis; Tianjin; Industrial emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065495148

Therefore, a shift from coal to natural gas (NG) and electricity is of great significance for the synergistic reduction of air pollutants and carbon emissions. However, the lack of building energy statistics at finer spatial scales makes it difficult to form targeted local strategies. In this study, a spatial downscaling framework was developed to project building energy consumption with higher resolution based on openly available information. Then, major air pollutant emission reductions induced by scattered coal substitution policies were estimated from national, provincial and city perspectives. The role played by buildings in realizing the overall carbon mitigation potential was also evaluated. The results show that a policy-driven increase in NG and electricity consumption during the 13th Five-Year Plan (FYP) period could contribute 15% and 4% to national SO2 and NOx emission control targets, respectively, and is helpful for some less-developed areas in achieving greater health benefits and faster low-carbon transformation.

Since conventional zero-inflated integer-valued generalized auto-regressive conditional heteroscedastic (GARCH) models and Poisson regression cannot properly illustrate consecutive 0s in time series of counts, the paper proposes a Markov switching Poisson integer-valued GARCH model wherein a first-order Markov process governs the switching mechanism. This newly designed model has some interesting statistical features: lagged dependence, overdispersion, consecutive 0s, non-linear dynamics and time varying coefficients for the meteorological variables governed by a two-state Markov chain structure. We perform parameter estimation and model selection within a Bayesian framework via a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme. As an illustration, we conduct a simulation study to examine the effectiveness of the Bayesian method and analyse 12-year weekly dengue case counts from five provinces in north-eastern Thailand. The evidence strongly supports that the proposed Markov switching Poisson integer-valued GARCH model with two climatological covariates appropriately describes consecutive 0s, non-linear dynamics and seasonal patterns.

Experiments and within-species comparisons suggest that environmental temperature might be important in explaining this variation. To investigate the importance of temperature, at broad geographical and taxonomic scales, we extended a global database of terrestrial arthropods screened for Wolbachia and Cardinium. Our final dataset contained data from more than 117 000 arthropods (over 2500 species) screened for Wolbachia and more than 18 000 arthropods (over 800 species) screened for Cardinium, including samples from 137 different countries, with mean temperatures varying from −6.5 to 29.2°C. In insects and relatives, Cardinium infection showed a clear and consistent tendency to increase with temperature. For Wolbachia, a tendency to increase with temperature in temperate climates is counteracted by reduced prevalence in the tropics, resulting in a weak negative trend overall.

Spatially explicit (gridded) emission inventories (EIs) should allow us to analyse sectoral emission patterns to estimate the potential impacts of emission policies and support decisions on reducing emissions. However, such EIs are often based on simple downscaling of national level emission estimates and the changes in subnational emission distributions do not necessarily reflect the actual changes driven by the local emission drivers. This article presents a high-definition, 100-m resolution bottom-up inventory of GHG emissions from industrial processes (fuel combustion activities in energy and manufacturing industries, fugitive emissions, mineral products, chemical industries, metal production and food and drink industries), which is exemplified for data for Poland. The study objectives include elaboration of the universal approach for mapping emission sources, algorithms for emission disaggregation, estimation of emissions at the source level and uncertainty analysis. We start with IPCC-compliant national sectoral GHG estimates made using Polish official statistics and, then, propose an improved emission disaggregation algorithm that fully utilises a collection of activity data available at the national/provincial level to the level of individual point and diffused (area) emission sources. To ensure the accuracy of the resulting 100-m resolution emission fields, the geospatial data used for mapping emission sources (point source geolocation and land cover classification) were subject to thorough human visual inspection. The resulting 100-m emission field even holds cadastres of emissions separately for each industrial emission category. We also compiled cadastres in regular grids and, then, compared them with the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR). A quantitative analysis of discrepancies between both results reveals quite frequent misallocations of point sources used in the EDGAR compilation that considerably deteriorate high-resolution inventories. We also use a Monte-Carlo method-based uncertainty assessment that yields a detailed estimation of the GHG emission uncertainty in the main categories of the analysed processes. We found that the above-mentioned geographical coordinates and patterns used for emission disaggregation have the greatest impact on the overall uncertainty of GHG inventories from the industrial processes. We evaluate the mitigation potential of industrial emissions and the impact of separate emission categories. This study proposes a method to accurately quantify industrial emissions at a policy relevant spatial scale in order to contribute to the local climate mitigation via emission quantification (local to national) and scientific assessment of the mitigation effort (national to global). Apart from the above, the results are also of importance for studies that confront bottom-up and top-down approaches and represent much more accurate data for global high-resolution inventories to compare with. © 2019, The Author(s).","Fugitive emission; Greenhouse gas emission; Industrial sector; Manufacturing industry; Monte-Carlo method; Spatial inventory; Uncertainty analysis","algorithm; combustion; downscaling; emission control; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; industrial emission; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Monte Carlo analysis; quantitative analysis; uncertainty analysis; Poland [Central Europe]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059872696

The agricultural emissions display evident geographical differences in the regional, national, and even local levels, not only due to spatially differentiated activity, but also due to very geographically different emission coefficients. Thus, spatially resolved inventories are important for obtaining better estimates of emission content and design of GHG mitigation processes to adapt to global carbon rise in the atmosphere. This study develops a geoinformation approach to a high-resolution spatial inventory of GHG emissions from the agricultural sector, following the categories of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change guidelines. Using the Corine Land Cover data, a digital map of emission sources is built, with elementary areal objects that are split up by administrative boundaries. Various procedures are developed for disaggregation of available emission activity data down to a level of elementary emission objects, conditional on covariate information, such as land use, observable in the elementary object scale. Among them, a statistical scaling method suitable for spatially correlated areal emission sources is applied. As an example of implementation of this approach, the spatial distribution of methane (CH4) and Nitrogen Oxide (N2O) emissions was obtained for areal emission sources in the agriculture sector in Poland with a spatial resolution of 100 m. We calculated the specific total emissions for different types of animal and manure systems as well as the total emissions in CO2-equivalent. We demonstrated that the emission sources are located highly nonuniformly and the emissions from them vary substantially, so that average data may provide insufficient approximation. In our case, over 11% smaller emission was estimated using spatial approach as compared with the national inventory report where average data were used. In addition, we quantified uncertainties associated with the developed spatial inventory and analysed the dominant components in total emission uncertainties in the agriculture sector. We used the activity data from the lowest possible (municipal) level. The depth of disaggregation of these data to the level of arable lands is minimal, and hence, the relative uncertainty of spatial inventory is smaller when comparing with traditional gridded emissions. The proposed technique allows us to discuss factors driving the geographical distribution of GHG emissions for different categories of the agricultural sector. This may be particularly useful in high-resolution modelling of GHG dispersion in the atmosphere. © 2018, The Author(s).","Agriculture sector; Geoinformation system; GHG emissions; High-resolution (big) data; Spatial inventory; Uncertainty","agricultural emission; carbon balance; emission; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; human activity; source-sink dynamics; spatial distribution; spatial resolution; uncertainty analysis; Poland [Central Europe]; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040373657

Solar energy can be utilized to supplement energy needs of a building either passively or actively. It is feasible to reduce consumption of energy usage for heating, cooling and lighting requirements of a building by adopting a climate sensitive approach for design of building elements like static sunshade, wall and roof. To study the effect of passive building elements in composite climate zone, four rooms were designed with a different combination of type of static sunshade, wall and roof. The static sunshade and brick cavity wall with brick projections were designed using sunpath diagram and shadow angles. Air cavity was introduced in the reinforced cement concrete (RCC) roof by laying hollow stoneware pipes. This paper presents theoretical and simulation studies to compare thermal performance of the four rooms. Theoretically, the four rooms were compared by steady state method based on total heat load in every month and on representative days in different seasons throughout the year. The extreme and most frequently occurring temperature values (mode) in every season were identified by obtaining the frequency distribution of the outdoor air temperature with the software SPSS Statistics (IBM Corp. 2012). Results showed that room with designed passive elements gained minimum heat in summer and moderate summer, while it lost minimum heat in winter and moderate winter. This shows the effectiveness of the designed passive elements in insulating the room interiors from the extreme climatic conditions. The rooms were also simulated using software Autodesk Ecotect Analysis 2011 and their performance was compared on a typical day in each month. Results showed that this software can be helpful for preliminary design to get an idea about the room performance that can help to create thermally comfortable indoor environment for the well being of occupants. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Brick; Energy efficiency; Roofs; Solar energy; Sun hoods; Walls (structural partitions); Consumption of energy; Design of buildings; Frequency distributions; Outdoor-air temperature; Passive solar design; Reinforced cement concretes (RCC); Renewable energy source; Steady-state method; Architectural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072128346

The model combines general economic equilibrium theory with location choice and New Economic Geography and implements a dynamic, fully endogenous agglomeration-dispersion mechanism for people and industries coupled with a gravity model for bilateral interregional flows. A novelty of the model is a two-layers structure: (i) the country-wide layer formulated as a global multi-sector, multi-country and multi-period computable general equilibrium (CGE) model; and (ii) the regional economy layer, which simulates impacts on regional economies, while considering country-wide economic trends as boundary conditions. The paper presents a use of the model in the assessment of regional economic effects of electrification of car mobility in Europe and wide use of domestically produced advanced biofuels. © 2019 by the authors.

In addition to commuting hours and holidays, if a large-scale event, such as a concert, a sporting event or an exhibition is held, it is easy to make traffic congestion even worse. If we know in advance the time and place of the large-scale event, then we can accurately forecast the future traffic flow and plan the driving route. It helps effectively relieve traffic flow, reduce travel time and carbon emissions. In this study, we used the Vehicle Detector (VD) [12] data from the Taipei City Government Open Data Platform as a source of regular traffic data as well as the data of Forecastable Sporadic Event (FSE), such as a large-scale event, to forecast traffic flow. The information of time and place of the FSE are collected from various information websites (ticketing websites, tourist websites, etc.) by web crawlers. We proposed a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model for traffic flow forecast, which was trained with both VD and FSE data. We further used Adam Optimizer to adjust the weight and bias of the model to optimize the forecast accuracy. The implementation of the LSTM model was conducted in TensorFlow, a machine learning framework developed by Google.

Modeling based on field measurements is an effective approach for assessing the potential impact of the moso bamboo expansion. The G93 algorithm is one of the most widely used models, however no studies have tested the applicability of the algorithm for moso bamboo isoprene emission. This study was undertaken to establish a model for reproducing moso bamboo isoprene emission fluxes. To this aim, this study examined 1) the isoprene emission ability of moso bamboo, and 2) its responses to environmental factors such as leaf temperature and light. We also tested 3) the reproducibility of the G93 algorithm for moso bamboo isoprene emission fluxes. This study used a chamber method with a modified photosynthesis system and carbon absorbents to quantify isoprene emitted from bamboo leaves in central Taiwan under the humid subtropical climate. First, we screened isoprene emission from 12 bamboo species, and the results confirmed that moso bamboo exhibited significant isoprene emission potential. Second, we measured isoprene emission fluxes from moso bamboo leaves with light controls every month from summer to spring. The isoprene emission fluxes increased with photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD); under sufficient PPFD conditions, the seasonal changes in the isoprene emission fluxes were regulated by leaf temperature, and low isoprene emission fluxes were found in low leaf temperature conditions. Thirdly, overestimations were observed in the G93 algorithm with the original parameters in periods with leaf temperatures <23 °C. Using the G93 algorithm with site-specific parameters could improve the overestimation in the low-temperature period. This study suggests the necessity of parameterization in the G93 algorithm to reproduce the suppression of isoprene emission fluxes from moso bamboo leaves in the low-temperature period. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","G93 algorithm; Isoprene emission flux; Leaf temperature; Model parameterization; Moso bamboo; Photosynthetically active radiation","Bamboo; Parameter estimation; Temperature; Isoprene emission; Leaf temperature; Model parameterization; Moso bamboo; Photosynthetically active radiation; Isoprene; absorbent; carbon; isoprene; algorithm; Article; bamboo; climate; environmental factor; forest; nonhuman; photosynthesis; photosynthetically active radiation; Phyllostachys; Phyllostachys edulis; plant leaf; priority journal; seasonal variation; spring; summer; Taiwan; temperature; Phyllostachys pubescens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065712223

Ground-based MAX-DOAS measurements were performed from April 2013 to February 2017. The MAX-DOAS measurements of NO2 and HCHO vertical column densities (VCDs) are used to validate ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) satellite observations over Nanjing. The comparison shows that the OMI observations of NO2 correlate well with the MAX-DOAS data with Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of 0.91. However, OMI observations are on average a factor of 3 lower than the MAX-DOAS measurements. Replacing the a priori NO2 profiles by the MAX-DOAS profiles in the OMI NO2 VCD retrieval would increase the OMI NO2 VCDs by ∼ 30% with correlation nearly unchanged. The comparison result of MAX-DOAS and OMI observations of HCHO VCD shows a good agreement with R of 0.75 and the slope of the regression line is 0.99. An ageweighted backward-propagation approach is applied to the MAX-DOAS measurements of NO2 and HCHO to reconstruct the spatial distribution of NO2 and HCHO over the Yangtze River Delta during summer and winter time. The reconstructed NO2 fields show a distinct agreement with OMI satellite observations. However, due to the short atmospheric lifetime of HCHO, the backward-propagated HCHO data do not show a strong spatial correlation with the OMI HCHO observations. The result shows that the MAX-DOAS measurements are sensitive to the air pollution transportation in the Yangtze River Delta, indicating the air quality in Nanjing is significantly influenced by regional transportation of air pollutants. The MAX-DOAS data are also used to evaluate the effectiveness of air pollution control measures implemented during the Youth Olympic Games 2014. The MAXDOAS data show a significant reduction of ambient aerosol, NO2 and HCHO (30 %-50 %) during the Youth Olympic Games. Our results provide a better understanding of the transportation and sources of pollutants over the Yangtze River Delta as well as the effect of emission control measures during large international events, which are important for the future design of air pollution control policies. © Author(s) 2019.",,"air quality; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); ground-based measurement; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; seasonal variation; source apportionment; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070453229

Yet there is poor understating of the persistence of soil carbon sequestration in nitrogen-fixing shrub plantations. Here, we selected three C. korshinskii plantations with different ages (10, 20, and 30 years) on the Loess Plateau to evaluate the persistence of soil carbon sink. We examined dynamics of soil carbon, total nitrogen, and soil water, as well as their relationships along the plantation ages. The results showed that soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) were tightly coupled. SOC, STN, and soil water stocks (0–100 cm) were significantly decreased by 23.9%, 19.9%, and 29.2% from 10 to 30 years, respectively. The reduction of SOC and STN was likely caused by lowered intercanopy herbaceous productivity due to soil drying and intensified competition from shrubs. We present evidence that the positive carbon sequestration by afforestation of leguminous shrub in short term may be further weakened by water shortage, making our ability to restore degraded land in semiarid regions more challenging than previously thought. Therefore, it is essential to improve management of afforestation land such as thinning for maintaining SOC sequestration persistently in water-limited areas. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Caragana korshinskii; Loess Plateau; soil carbon sequestration; soil C–N coupling; soil desiccation","Arid regions; Ecosystems; Landforms; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fixation; Reforestation; Restoration; Sediments; Soil moisture; Caragana Korshinskii; Carbon sequestration; Ecosystem restoration; Loess Plateau; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil desiccations; Soil organic carbon; Soil total nitrogen; Organic carbon; angiosperm; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; desiccation; landscape; nitrogen; plantation; soil carbon; soil water; China; Loess Plateau; Caragana korshinskii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068474327

Recently, many studies have revealed the potential of MILD combustion in various power systems but most studies have been focused on gas phase fuel MILD combustion. Therefore, further study on MILD combustion using liquid fuel is needed for the application to a liquid-fueled gas turbine especially. In this work, we studied experimentally on the formation of liquid fuel MILD combustion under the condition of high dilution by burnt gas generated from a first premixed flame in two stages combustor which consists of the first premixed burner and secondary combustor. In particular, the effects of burnt gas velocity and oxygen level of burnt gas on the formation of liquid fuel MILD combustion were investigated. The results show that as the burnt gas velocity through the nozzle becomes higher, the color of flames was changed from yellow to pale blue and flames became very short. The OH radical measured by ICCD camera was uniformly distributed on the pale blue flame surface and its intensity was very low compared to conventional liquid diffusion flame. As burnt gas velocity is increased, local high-temperature region appeared to be diminished and the flame temperature became spatially uniform. And CO emission was sampled around 1 ppm and NOx emission was measured around 10 ppm under the overall equivalence ratio of 0.8 to 0.98 for 40 mm or less diameter of velocity control nozzle. This low NOx emission seems to be attributed to maintaining the average temperature in secondary combustor below the threshold temperature of thermal NOx formation. In view of the uniform temperature distribution, low OH radical intensity and low NOx emission data in the secondary combustor, formation of stable MILD combustion using kerosene liquid fuel could be verified at high burnt gas velocity. © 2019, KSME & Springer.","Dilution; Kerosene fuel; Low NOx; MILD combustion; Spray combustion","Combustors; Dilution; Free radicals; Gases; Kerosene; Liquids; Nitrogen oxides; Nozzles; Temperature distribution; Velocity; Experiment analysis; Flame temperatures; Kerosene fuels; Low NOx; MILD combustion; Secondary combustors; Spray combustion; Threshold temperatures; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070100828

Biomass is a promising resource and it can be converted to multiple products and services including fuels, chemicals, heat and electricity via different conversion routes. Hence, replacement of fossil-based services with biomass-based services is critical to mitigate fossil CO2 emissions, and innovative design of new and efficient energy conversion systems is necessary. Different industries need heat for their operations at different temperature levels. Today, these demands are satisfied using conventional natural gas boilers by imposing a CO2 tax to account for their emissions. In this study, we discuss the potential of replacing conventional boilers with a combined heat and fuel (CHF) plant design which utilizes lignocellulosic biomass in thermochemical conversion to generate heat for different industrial sectors together with biofuels cogeneration. Heat is generated due to the exothermic nature of the thermochemical conversion processes that operate at high temperatures. Gasification process produces syngas which is converted into fuels such as synthetic natural gas, Fischer-Tropsch crude, methanol and dimethyl ether and electricity. Different scenarios are evaluated considering the CO2 produced via this system is either released, sequestrated, or stored and used in a co-electrolysis unit in which surplus renewable electricity available during summer is converted into additional syngas. A parametric analysis has been performed considering type and size of plants, CO2 tax, and purchase and transportation costs of wood to compare the price of heat for the industrial sectors. Natural gas and wood boilers are used as the basis to calculate the breakeven CO2 tax values for the same heat prices for the proposed CHF systems.

Nevertheless, food waste treatment should be evaluated in terms of sustainability and considering the availability of an optimized separate collection and a suitable treatment facility. Anaerobic codigestion of waste-activated sludge with food waste is a way to fully utilize available anaerobic digestion plants, increasing biogas production, energy, and nutrient recovery and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Climate change-related phenomena can considerably affect buildings mechanical and thermal-energy response by contributing to materials degradation and structural safety.

The purpose of this paper is to propose an innovative, integrated, multidisciplinary methodology for assessing construction materials’ degradation in historic masonry buildings and its potential future evolution, providing a risk mapping accounting for interactions between climate change effects and structural damage. Such a replicable approach consists in (i) preliminary site inspections, (ii) damage and degradation surveys, (iii) development and calibration of numerical models predicting structural-thermal response and (iv) prediction of materials degradation accounting for future climate conditions and potential worsening of structural damage. The final output of the procedure is a hierarchical mapping of regions with different degradation severities, by identifying those where a specific type of degradation or damage insists but are likely stable and those where they are expected to get worse due to changes in future climate conditions or to a negative interaction between degradation and damage. The presented approach is applied to an iconic Italian monumental building, the Consoli Palace in Gubbio, where future climate scenarios up to 2080 are simulated according to the IPCC climate change predictions. Results highlight that thermal-energy and structural aspects need to be jointly considered in the preservation of surface materials of historic buildings exposed to climate change severity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Construction material degradation; Continuous monitoring; Historic buildings; Risk mapping; Structural and thermal-energy dynamic simulation","Buildings; Climate models; Forecasting; Historic preservation; Mapping; Masonry construction; Masonry materials; Risk assessment; Structural analysis; Thermal energy; Climate change prediction; Continuous monitoring; Future climate scenarios; Historic buildings; Historical construction; Materials degradation; Negative interaction; Risk mappings; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065070929

The present study analyzed the relationship between emotional intelligence, motivational climate in sport, and anxiety according to participation in contact or non-contact sports, using multi-group structural equation modeling; (2) Methods: This research was conducted with a sample of 371 semi-professional athletes from Spain. The main variables were emotional intelligence, motivational climate in sport, and anxiety. A multi-group path analysis was developed and demonstrated acceptable fit (χ2= 418.60; df = 46; p &lt; 0.001; Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.959; Normalized Fit Index (NFI) = 0.955; Incremental Fit Index (IFI) = 0.959; Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.063); (3) Results: A negative association was identified between task-oriented climate and ego-oriented climate. Moreover, there was a positive relationship between task-oriented climate and emotional intelligence, which was strongest in individuals participating in non-contact sports. The relationship between ego-oriented climate and emotional intelligence was less evident. Furthermore, both state anxiety and trait anxiety were negatively correlated with emotional intelligence; (4) Conclusions: The key conclusion from the present research is that task-oriented motivational climates positively influence levels of emotional intelligence and anxiety, especially in contact sports. It is important to encourage the development of self-determined motivational climates in order to avoid emotional states which can hinder performance. © 2019 by the authors.","Contact Sports; Emotions; Motivational Climate; Non-contact Sports; Stress",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070667025

Over 640 million people in Africa are expected to rely on biomass for cooking by 2040. In Kenya, cooking inefficiently with wood and charcoal persists as a cause of deforestation and household air pollution. This research analyses the effects of four biomass cookstove strategies on reducing air pollutant emissions in Kisumu County between 2015 and 2035 using the Long-Range Energy Alternatives Planning system. The Business as Usual scenario (BAU) was developed considering the historical trends in household energy use. Energy transition scenarios to Improved Cookstoves (ICS), Pellet Gasifier Stoves (PGS) and Biogas Stoves (BGS) were applied to examine the impact of these systems on energy savings and air pollution mitigation. An integrated scenario (INT) was evaluated as a mix of the ICS, PGS and BGS. The highest energy savings, in relation to the BAU, are achieved in the BGS (30.9%), followed by the INT (23.5%), PGS (19.4%) and ICS (9.2%). The BGS offers the highest reduction in the GHG (37.6%), CH4 (94.3%), NMVOCs (85.0%), CO (97.4%), PM2.5 (64.7%) and BC (48.4%) emissions, and the PGS the highest reduction in the N2O (83.0%) and NOx (90.7%) emissions, in relation to the BAU. © 2019","Biogas; Biomass pellets; Cookstoves; Energy forecasting; Global warming; Local air pollutants","Biogas; Biomass; Charcoal; Deforestation; Energy conservation; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Health risks; Intelligent control; Pelletizing; Air pollutant emission; Air pollutants; Biomass pellets; Cookstoves; Energy forecasting; Environmental health risks; Household energy use; Pollution mitigation; Air pollution; atmospheric pollution; biogas; biomass; cooking appliance; forecasting method; global warming; greenhouse gas; indoor air; Kenya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065396669

Interventions were assessed by employing four-stage modelling techniques, as a tool to identify signs of mode shifting behaviour from single occupancy vehicle (SOV) use to public transport modes. Extensive modelling work was conducted in collaboration with the National Transport Authority (NTA) of Ireland utilising the National Regional Modelling System (RMS) to represent the sustainable policy changes. Parameter modifications in the mode and destination choice and trip assignment stages were made to account for improvements made to frequency, time and cost attributes of public transport modes included in the model. Subsequent changes in vehicle kilometres travelled of various modes modelled were then utilised to estimate the potential emissions savings. In addition to this, the potential monetary savings generated from a reduction in emissions were calculated. The key results produced from this study found that an increase in the mode share of public transport of up to 2.87% could be achieved in the GDA. Up to 1.76% of which was estimated to come directly from private car trips, as a result of implementing the policy incentives tested.

Here, we report unprecedented multidecadal shifts in forest carbon uptake in semi-arid Mediterranean pine forests in Spain over 1950–2012. The averaged carbon sink reduction varies between 31% and 37%, and reaches values in the range of 50% in the most affected forest stands. Regime shifts in forest carbon uptake are associated with climatic early warning signals, decreased forest regional synchrony and reduced long-term carbon sink resilience. We identify the mechanisms linked to ocean multidecadal variability that shape regime shifts in carbon capture. First, we show that low-frequency variations of the surface temperature of the Atlantic Ocean induce shifts in the non-stationary effects of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on regional forest carbon capture. Modelling evidence supports that the non-stationary effects of ENSO can be propagated from tropical areas to semi-arid Mediterranean biomes through atmospheric wave trains. Second, decadal changes in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) significantly alter sea–air heat exchanges, modifying in turn ocean vapour transport over land and land surface temperatures, and promoting sustained drought conditions in spring and summer that reduce forest carbon uptake. Third, we show that lagged effects of AMO on the winter North Atlantic Oscillation also contribute to the maintenance of long-term droughts. Finally, we show that the reported strong, negative effects of ocean surface temperature (AMO) on forest carbon uptake in the last decades are unprecedented over the last 150 years. Our results provide new, unreported explanations for carbon uptake shifts in these drought-prone forests and review the expected impacts of global warming on the profiled mechanisms. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","carbon sink; climate; forest; multidecadal drought; regime shift; resilience","biogeochemical cycle; carbon cycle; carbon sink; climate change; decadal variation; ecosystem resilience; forest ecosystem; surface temperature; Spain; carbon; Atlantic Ocean; forest; sea; Spain; temperature; Atlantic Ocean; Carbon; Forests; Oceans and Seas; Spain; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067514111

Some advantages of this technology have been recognized as e.g., less required water added to raw feedstock and consequently minimized digester size and cost, higher volumetric organic loading rates (OLR) that may lead to higher efficiency methane yield and better acceptance of a wide range of feedstocks. However, scientific studies of SS-AD at pilot- and full-scale are very few and difficulties have been reported in operating SS-AD, especially when the system undergoes a scale-up, where methane production is the purpose. As a result, this review gives a summary of scientific studies for SS-AD processes at laboratory-, pilot- and full-scale, where a great diversity of substrate composition, reactor design and operational parameters have been categorized, and their performances in terms of methane yield have been analyzed. This, in turn, helps to identify that factors affecting methane yields at different scales arise mainly from operational conditions as well as the characteristic of feedstocks. This review even contributes to suggest several strategies for improvement of methane yield at full-scale. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Improvement; Methane yield; Solid-state anaerobic digestion","Feedstocks; Methane; Spectrum analysis; Structural design; Improvement; Methane production; Methane Yield; Operational conditions; Operational parameters; Solid-state anaerobic digestions; Substrate composition; Volumetric organic loading; Anaerobic digestion; anaerobic digestion; bioreactor; efficiency measurement; experimental study; laboratory method; methane; operations technology; parameter estimation; performance assessment; substrate",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067212403

Cultures in mineral medium supplemented with the tested substrates were monitored, and sulphate reduction efficiency is discussed in light of substrates compositions, dosages and corresponding chemical oxygen demand/[SO4 2−] ratios. The results reveal the ability of those substrates to feed SRB and confirm that testing doses targeting ratios of 1.5 and values close to this was a good strategy to optimize sulphate reduction activity. As expected, this activity was faster for substrates that have in their composition simple compounds (such as low-chain alcohols and organic acids) and/or compounds that can be rapidly degraded (such as sugars), though it also occurred in a longer-term perspective with substrates composed mainly of slowly degradable compounds (such as cellulose and lignin). Thus, this work demonstrates the potential of new substrates and respective required doses to feed SRB bioreactors in long-term passive bioremediation processes or faster more active processes. That is, it opens the way for the use of such substrates in the treatment of sulphate-rich waters, as the acid mine drainage generated in some mines on the Iberian Pyrite Belt region, and it encourages further experiments to evaluate the use of SRB-based processes to treat the industrial wastewaters successfully tested in this work themselves, specially the olive mill wastewater which is still a problem for many small olive oil producers. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","Chemical oxygen demand/[SO4 2−] ratio; Electron donors; Organic substrates; Sulphate reduction","Ability testing; Bacteria; Bioremediation; Industrial water treatment; Olive oil; Pyrites; Sulfur compounds; Wastewater treatment; Electron donors; Iberian Pyrite Belt; Industrial by-products; Industrial wastewaters; Olive mill wastewaters; Organic substrate; Sulphate reducing bacteria; Sulphate reduction; Chemical oxygen demand; byproduct; carbon; electron; industrial waste; organic matter; reduction; substrate; sulfate-reducing bacterium; Bacteria; Carbon; Portugal; Products; Sources; Spain; Substrates; Wastes; Iberian Peninsula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060514460

Given these circumstances, which are arguably the most challenging for international cooperation, commitment problems and free-riding incentives for countries to delay costly mitigation efforts are major obstacles to effective environmental agreements. Starting from this premise, we examine domestic mitigation efforts, with the goal of assessing the extent to which the willingness of individuals to contribute voluntarily to the public good of climate mitigation could be scaled up to the global level. Although individual environmental actions are clearly insufficient for achieving ambitious global mitigation targets, we argue that they are nevertheless initial and essential steps in the right direction. In fact, individual and community efforts may be particularly important if local interventions encourage shifts in norms and behaviors that favor large-scale transformations. With this in mind, we discuss the importance of the visibility of norms and the role of beliefs when such visibility is lacking and their implications for leveraging cooperative behavior to increase climate mitigation efforts locally and globally. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Based upon data-driven parameters and damage estimates, our numerical model generates optimal values for region-wide vehicle trips and associated PM2.5 concentrations along with their corresponding time paths. Our dataset includes a host of pertinent weather variables that determine PM2.5 concentrations both independently as well as interacted with vehicle trips. As a result, our empirical model enables us to isolate the conditions under which vehicle travel most affects air pollution levels. Our results suggest that maximizing net social welfare in the presence of mobile-source pollution requires substantial reductions in traditional, emissions-generating vehicle usage on days experiencing critical weather conditions – in the case of our study area, temperature inversions. Because they are socially optimal and targeted solely for days with temperature inversions, the estimated reductions in vehicle usage are substantially larger than those proposed by Moscardini and Caplan (2017) to attain the daily National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for particulate matter on an average basis. We find that the optimal reduction in vehicle trips result in corresponding particulate matter concentrations that are roughly 6–13% of the NAAQS. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Mobile-source air pollution; Optimal vehicle trips; Trip-weather interactions","air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); particulate matter; traffic emission; transport vehicle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067920142

This book brings together key thinkers in this field to develop a meaningful synthesis between the existing practice of regenerative development and the input of scholars in the social sciences. It begins by providing an expert introduction to the history, principles, and practices of regenerative development before going on to present a thorough theoretical examination by known theorists from disciplines including sociology, geography, and ethics. A section on regenerative development practices illustrates the need to significantly advance our understanding of how urbanization, climate change, and inequality interact at every scale of development work. Finally, the book ends with a serious consideration of the ways in which integrated systems thinking in higher education could result in a curriculum for the next generation of regenerative development professionals. Regenerative Urban Development, Climate Change and the Common Good will be of great interest to students, scholars, and practitioners of regenerative development, climate change, urban planning, and public policy. © 2020 selection and editorial matter Beth Schaefer Caniglia, Beatrice Frank, John L.

Truck platooning is such an application that relies on the development of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) and is said to be practice ready. While the main advantages of truck platooning lie in emission and energy reduction, claims are also being made for the influence on traffic flow. In this paper, we pose hypotheses based on some of the main claims. We also attempt to substantiate and give quantitative proof of the potential effects of truck platooning on traffic flow performance. The simulation model LMRS-IDM+ is extended to encompass the main influencing dynamics related to potential effects of truck platooning, based on empirical findings. The effects of truck platooning were tested for the influence of traffic states, truck gap settings, platoon sizes, and the share of equipped trucks. This resulted in outcomes regarding the total traffic performance, the performance of traffic at ramps, and the ability of a platoon to remain platooning as part of a case experiment performed on a part of the Trans-European ITS Corridor. The results showed that truck platooning may have a small negative effect on the total non-saturated traffic flow, however with a much larger negative effect on saturated traffic flow. However, drivers may be reluctant to platoon in saturated traffic in any case. The ability of inflowing traffic to merge at on-ramps was found to be affected by truck platoons, with platoon disengagements occurring under various conditions. The applied gap settings for platooning trucks did not significantly affect the merge time, while a higher gap did lead to a higher number of disengagements. The ability of trucks to platoon was positively affected by a greater percentage of equipped trucks and by larger platoon sizes. Shorter gap times also slightly improved the ability of trucks to remain in platooning formation. Finally, recommendations are given to improve platoon strategies and for policymakers to only allow truck platooning outside of busy (near-) saturated traffic, even though drivers may be reluctant to use the system in these conditions. Also, recommendations are made to investigate potential differences in the effects between the European and American contexts for truck-platooning. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Traffic flow; Traffic flow simulation; Truck platooning; Vehicle automation","Adaptive cruise control; Automobiles; Traffic surveys; Cooperative adaptive cruise control; Cooperative driving; Non-saturated traffic; Potential difference; Saturated traffic flow; Traffic flow; Traffic flow simulation; Vehicle automations; Trucks; empirical analysis; modeling; policy making; traffic congestion; trucking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066301491

The growing awareness of the population regarding environmental issues is pushing governments worldwide more and more to promote policies aiming at limiting harmful effects of human development. In particular, the rapid increase of the global temperature, especially in the polar regions, and the management of human wastes, mainly plastic in seas, are some of the main points to be addressed by these novel policies. Several actions must be implemented in order to limit such issues. Unfortunately, the recent COP 24 Conference was not successful, but hopefully an agreement will be established in 2020 at the COP 26 Conference. The effort performed by policymakers must be mandatorily supported by the scientific community. In this framework, this paper aims at showing that countries worldwide are trying to negotiate an agreement to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In addition, in this paper all the researchers reported can provide quantitative measures of the actions to be implemented in order to address a sustainable and efficient use of energy. Here, innovations in terms of novel efficient and environmentally friendly technologies mainly based on renewable energy sources have been also investigated. The study also highlights different sectors that have been involved for this aim, such as energy conversion systems, urban areas, mobility, sustainability, water management, social aspects, etc. In this framework, specific conferences are periodically organized in order to provide a forum for discussion regarding these topics. In this area the Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems (SDEWES) conference is the most ordinary conference. The 13th Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems Conference was held in Palermo, Italy in 2018. The current Special Issue of Energies, precisely dedicated to the 13th SDEWES Conference, is based on three main topics: energy policy and energy efficiency in urban areas, energy efficiency in industry and biomass and other miscellaneous energy systems. © 2019 by the authors.

From the perspective of social welfare, considering the radial and non-radial characteristics of different input and output indicators, and the inseparability of the energy input and undesirable output, this study employs the non-separable hybrid DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) model to evaluate the total energy efficiency of Chinese provinces between 2012 and 2016. Furthermore, this study calculates the energy saving and emission reduction potentials of China. The results reveal that the average total factor energy efficiency in China from 2012 to 2016 is 0.694, which means that there are still 30.6% energy efficiency losses. There is great potential for China to save energy, reduce pollutant emissions, and increase the output of social welfare. There are great differences in the total factor energy efficiency among provinces. The average energy saving potential of the whole country is 60.5%. If the energy efficiency of all provinces can reach the frontier, the whole country can save more than half of the energy consumption. The highest national average emission reduction potential is SO2, followed by dust, CO2, and NOX. The implication of the conclusion is that in the development of regional economy, we cannot sacrifice the social welfare and sustainable development and take the growth rate of GDP as the only objective. Different energy saving and emission reduction policies should be put forward according to the characteristics of different provinces. © 2019 by the authors.","Energy saving and emission reduction potential; Non-separable hybrid DEA model; Social welfare; Total factor energy efficiency","economic growth; emission control; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy resource; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; growth rate; model; sulfur dioxide; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070445284

Here, we quantify rates of change in mean cold tolerances, and contributions of colonization and local extinction to those rates, recorded in plant macrofossil assemblages from North American hot deserts over the last 30,000 years. Location: Mojave, Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts. Time period: 30–0 thousand years before present (kybp). Major taxa studied: Vascular plants. Methods: Colonization and local extinction dates for 269 plant species were approximated from macrofossils in 15 packrat (Neotoma) midden series. Cold tolerances estimated from contemporary climate were used to quantify assemblage-mean cold tolerances through time. Rates of colonization and local extinction, and their effects on rates of change in assemblage-mean cold tolerances, were estimated for 30–20 kybp (Late Pleistocene, no directional warming), 20–10 kybp (deglaciation, rapid warming) and 10–0 kybp (Holocene, no directional warming). Results: Rates of change in all metrics were negligible during the Late Pleistocene. Rates of change in assemblage-mean cold tolerances (mean 1.0°C × 10−4/yr) lagged behind warming during deglaciation, and continued at similar rates (1.2°C × 10−4/yr) throughout the Holocene. Colonization and local extinction contributed equally to delayed responses to warming, but their dynamics differed through time: Colonization by warm-adapted species predominated during deglaciation, while the most heat-adapted species exhibited long delays in colonization. Only the most cold-adapted species went locally extinct during deglaciation, followed by slow repayment of the extinction debt of cool-adapted species during the Holocene. Main conclusions: Responses to rapid warming can persist for millennia, even after cessation of warming. Consistent patterns from different midden series across the region support a metacommunity model in which dispersal interacts with environmental filters and buffers against local extinction to drive community–climate disequilibrium during and after periods of warming. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; climate niche; community assembly; dispersal limitation; extinction debt; palaeoecology","climate effect; climate variation; colonization; community dynamics; dispersal; extinction; Last Glacial Maximum; paleoclimate; paleoecology; plant; Chihuahuan Desert; Mojave Desert; Sonoran Desert; United States; Neotoma; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067413093

Despite all this, cities especially in developing countries still experience the effects of climate change. This paper adopted a mixed method approach to examine township spatial planning and climate change adaptation in identifying potentialities for an integrated approach. Mdantsane case study as one of the largest townships in South Africa was assessed as a unique landscape with reminiscent of apartheid legacies to improve the people's climate change adaptation under urban poverty, lack of basic facilities and other environmental challenges. In keeping with a case study design, we collected data making use of pretested open and close-ended survey forms with an interplay of GIS and remote sensing techniques. This study reveals that Mdantsane is extremely susceptible to the impacts of climate change due to their built-up and natural environment set up as well as the existing interrelations. Thus, comprehensive integration of spatial planning is essential for proofing, health, wellbeing and resilience. Consequently, recommendations to seek strategic intervention and planning were made to sustain adaptation of residents to climate change in the future with specific focus to reduce climate and environmental risks in Mdantsane Township. © 2019 The Authors","Assessment; climate change adaptation; Mdantsane township; Resilience; Spatial planning; Urban","adaptive management; apartheid; climate change; GIS; remote sensing; residential location; spatial planning; urban design; urban planning; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066960726

Hence, the aim of this research was to outline a methodology for producing a high-resolution spatially explicit emission inventory, demonstrated for Poland. GHG emission sources were classified into point, line, and area types and then combined to calculate the total emissions. We created vector maps of all sources for all categories of economic activity covered by the IPCC guidelines, using official information about companies, the administrative maps, Corine Land Cover, and other available data. We created the algorithms for the disaggregation of these data to the level of elementary objects such as emission sources. The algorithms used depend on the categories of economic activity under investigation. We calculated the emissions of carbon, nitrogen sulfure and other GHG compounds (e.g., CO2, CH4, N2O, SO2, NMVOC) as well as total emissions in the CO2-equivalent. Gridded data were only created in the final stage to present the summarized emissions of very diverse sources from all categories. In our approach, information on the administrative assignment of corresponding emission sources is retained, which makes it possible to aggregate the final results to different administrative levels including municipalities, which is not possible using a traditional gridded emission approach. We demonstrate that any grid size can be chosen to match the aim of the spatial inventory, but not less than 100 m in this example, which corresponds to the coarsest resolution of the input datasets. We then considered the uncertainties in the statistical data, the calorific values, and the emission factors, with symmetric and asymmetric (lognormal) distributions.

Five years of data (24,000 flowers, 6800 plants) measured fruit set relative to floral areas, capsule volumes, climate, phenology, pollination mechanisms, disturbance tolerance and demography. Pollination varied from 0-95% of flowers, floral displays from 90-3300 mm2 and capsules from 15-1300 mm3 per spike. Pollination traits strongly influenced outcomes, with self-pollination highest (59-95%), followed by sexually deceptive autumn or winter-flowering (18-39%), visual deception (0-48%) and sexually deceptive spring-flowering (13-16%). Pollination was limited by drought in autumn or spring and cool winter temperatures. Some orchids were resilient to drought and one formed seed after the leaves withered. Plant density had the greatest impact on fruit set for orchids forming large groups, especially for sexually deceptive pollination. Consequently, small group average (SGA) pollination was up to 4× greater than overall averages and peak seed production occurred in the best locations for genetic exchange and dispersal. SGA rates and seedpod volumes were strongly linked to clonality, but not to demographic trends. Resource competition limited flowering at higher plant densities and competition within spikes resulted in smaller, later-forming seedpods. Pollination data from co-occurring common orchids identified five evolutionary trade-offs linked to pollination, provided baseline data for rare species and revealed impacts of changing climate. © 2019 by the authors.","Banksia woodland; Climate; Clonality; Density dependence; Disturbance; Phenology; Pollination; Terrestrial orchids; Urban vegetation","angiosperm; disturbance; environmental factor; phenology; pollination; seed production; terrestrial ecosystem; tolerance; urban area; woodland; Australia; Western Australia; Banksia; Embryophyta; Orchidaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070978977

On the contrary, a very distinct feature of the current wave of land grabs is the convergence of multiple crises, including food, energy/fuel, environmental, and financial. The Southern Mozambique District, Massingir, is an area with high potential regarding water sources and biodiversity. It recently became a host of a biofuel project, and also a huge block of land is being transformed into a conservation/tourism area; answering to many issues within capitalism's crisis, this area is an evidence of how synergetic resource grabbing can arise as a response to the convergence of multiple crises. Therefore, by analyzing the emerging politics of natural resources in Massingir District and the dynamics regarding the land-use change, changes in property relations, it is possible to understand how rural livelihoods are shaped. Risks related to food security and sovereignty, loss of control and access to resources, consistent narrowing down of the set of livelihood strategies, and inter-community conflicts over scarce resources are the main implications of such emerging climate-smart land politics. © 2019 by the authors.","Biofuel; Climate change; Conservation; Land grabbing; Rural livelihoods",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071271034

The fraction of applied material emitted into the atmosphere and the magnitude of peak emissions are two quantities used by regulators to protect public health and are typically based on field estimates. However, the current body of field studies covers only a narrow subset of the broad range of application practices and soil conditions under which applications are performed and is subject to an unknown level of estimation error. Here we use the HYDRUS model to estimate cumulative and peak emissions of 1,3-D for 17 application methods used in California. The simulations are parameterized with soils data from 16 fields sampled immediately prior to fumigation in order to establish a representative distribution of initial soil conditions. The results demonstrate a wide range in cumulative emissions, with mean losses of initial applied mass between 10 and 58% over two weeks depending on application method. Emissions are highly variable in response to soil conditions, with coefficients of variation ranging from 16 to 54% for cumulative flux and 26 to 67% for peak three-hour flux depending on application method. The simulated distributions show similarities to the available field study estimates in terms of the mean and spread of distributions, particularly in the case of cumulative emissions, indicating that the modeling approach could be a useful tool to support regulatory decision-making in cases where field data is limited. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","1,3-D; Fumigant application; HYDRUS; Off-site transport; Soil fumigation; Volatilization","Decision making; Fumigation; Soils; Vaporization; 1,3-D; Coefficients of variations; Cumulative emissions; HYDRUS; Off sites; Regulatory decisions; Simulated distribution; Soil fumigation; Three dimensional computer graphics; 1,3 dichloropropene; fumigant; unclassified drug; emission; fumigation; modeling; soil analysis; volatilization; air and air related phenomena; Article; California; decision making; fumigation; priority journal; simulation; soil and soil related phenomena; standardization; uncertainty; volatilization; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065292257

Edaphic (soil-related) factors, such as soil pH, as well as tree species affect forest carbon cycles, but are difficult to disentangle. We studied how conversion of deciduous stands to mono-culture spruce plantations affected the soil organic matter (SOM) composition along a lithological gradient in the Mullerthal (Luxembourg) and Gaume (south-east Belgium) regions. Parent materials in these regions range from decalcified sands to calcareous marls. A twin plot setup of adjacent deciduous and coniferous stands on the same parent material was used to evaluate the effect of edaphic factors versus litter input differences on SOM composition and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. Lignin and cutin/suberin molecular proxies were identified with thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM), to distinguish litter sources (coniferous vs deciduous and leaf litter vs roots) in the studied stands. In this study, SOC stocks were influenced more by parent material than by forest type. Lignin yield, composition and degradation state were influenced both by litter input chemistry and edaphic context. There appear to be important interaction effects between the two, as the relative importance of parent material and litter quality was site specific. We therefore advice that carbon stock models include data on both vegetation history as well as edaphic context. © 2019 The Authors","Carbon stocks; Cutin; Lignin; SOC; SOM; Suberin; THM-GC–MS","Alkylation; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Climate change; Fertilizers; Forestry; Lignin; Lithology; Soils; System-on-chip; Carbon stocks; Climate change mitigation; Cutin; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic matters; Spruce plantations; Suberin; Thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation; Organic carbon; climate change; forest ecosystem; gas chromatography; hydrolysis; leaf litter; lignin; mass spectrometry; methylation; molecular ecology; parent material; soil organic matter; Alkylation; Carbon; Cutin; Fertilizers; Forestry; Input; Soil; Belgium; Luxembourg [Belgium]; Picea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067444925

Previous PICO bubble chambers have produced world-leading WIMP search results with fluorocarbon target fluids, separated from the steel bellows by a buffer layer of water. Surface tension effects at the jar walls and liquid-liquid interface lead to a class of background events which have nuclear-recoil-like acoustic signatures and thus contaminate the WIMP-like signal region in analysis. Thus new bubble chambers are to be constructed ""right-side-up"", meaning that the jar of C3F8 is above the bellows with no water inside the inner vessel. The Drexel Bubble Chamber (DBC), runs successfully at and below the nuclear recoil thresholds used by PICO for WIMP searches, including thresholds as low as 1.19 keV . We have demonstrated sensitivity to 137Cs gammas and spontaneous fission neutrons from 244Cm, and acoustic alpha discrimination is demonstrated to be possible although the observed rate of alpha decays is very low. Position reconstruction from stereoscopic imaging allows for basic analysis cuts for calibration data.

After binding the ligand, AhR triggers induction of the expression of phase I and phase II drug-metabolizing genes, together with numerous other genes that are not directly involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics. Several studies have shown that AhR plays a role in tumor initiation, promotion and progression, but the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes are not fully understood. A previous study from our laboratory indicated that the SERPINB2 gene is presumably regulated by AhR. To prove that such induction is really AhR-dependent, in the present study we knocked down the expression of AhR by stable transfection of a laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cell line (UT-SCC-34) with shRNA, resulting in 92% reduction of BNF-induced expression of SERPINB2. However, in silico analysis did not reveal AhR-dependent responsive elements in the promoter of the SERPINB2 gene. Therefore, to address this problem, we have used cycloheximide, an inhibitor of translation, and our results clearly indicate that an additional, newly synthesized protein is involved in AhR-dependent induction of SERPINB2 expression by BNF. So, to exclude that AhR binds to the putative xenobiotic-responsive elements (XREs) localized upstream of the SERPINB2 gene, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. As expected, we found no direct binding of AhR to its responsive elements in the vicinity of the SERPINB2 gene, further demonstrating the indirect SERPINB2 induction by AhR. However, the further analysis demonstrated that the expression of the enhancer RNA encoded by the region of DNA 20 kbp upstream from the SERPINB2 gene was AhR-dependent. Although AhR-mediated SERPINB2 induction clearly requires the synthesis of an additional protein, the kinetics of SERPINB2 induction is as fast as the kinetics of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 induction (both genes directly regulated by AhR). Therefore, given previous studies regarding the induction of SERPINB2 expression by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), we think that, similarly, the interaction with pause-release proteins may be responsible for AhR-dependent regulation of SERPINB2 expression. © 2019","Aryl hydrocarbon receptor; CYP1A1; CYP1B1; Enhancer RNA; SERPINB2","aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; cytochrome P450 1A1; cytochrome P450 1B1; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; benzo[a]pyrene; beta naphthoflavone; cycloheximide; cytochrome P450 1A1; cytochrome P450 1B1; ligand; serine proteinase inhibitor; small interfering RNA; Article; binding site; chromatin immunoprecipitation; computer model; controlled study; CYP1A1 gene; CYP1B1 gene; gene; gene control; gene expression; human; human cell; ligand binding; promoter region; protein DNA binding; protein function; receptor binding; SERPINB2 gene; antagonists and inhibitors; drug effect; gene expression; genetics; metabolism; RNA interference; tumor cell line; Benzo(a)pyrene; beta-Naphthoflavone; Cell Line, Tumor; Cycloheximide; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1B1; Gene Expression; Humans; Ligands; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Interfering; Serpins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067384883

This approach is limited, however, as much of the ocean floor has not been sampled. We take a machine learning approach to update and refine the estimate of the amount of sedimentary carbonate precipitation, as well as define whether sedimentary carbonate precipitation is driven by organoclastic microbial sulfate reduction or anaerobic methane oxidation. We identify areas where there is sedimentary carbonate formation using machine learning, based upon oceanic physical and chemical properties including bathymetry, temperature, water depth, distance from shore, and tracers of primary production, and data from the global ODP/IODP database. Our results suggest that the total amount of sedimentary carbonate formation is much lower than previous estimates, at 1.35±0.5×1011 mol C/yr. We suggest that this rate is a lower estimate and discuss why machine-learning approaches may always produce lower-bound estimates of global processes. Our calculations suggest that the formation of sedimentary carbonate today is mainly driven by anaerobic methane oxidation (77%), with the remainder attributed to organoclastic sulfate reduction. We use our machine-learning results to speculate the impact that sedimentary carbonate precipitation may have had on the carbon isotope composition of the surface dissolved inorganic carbon reservoir over Earth history. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","authigenic carbonate; machine learning","Carbonation; Learning systems; Machine learning; Methane; Pore pressure; Reduction; Sedimentology; Submarine geology; Sulfur compounds; Anaerobic methane oxidations; Authigenic carbonates; Carbon isotope composition; Carbonate formations; Carbonate precipitation; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Machine learning approaches; Physical and chemical properties; Sediments; authigenic mineral; carbon sink; carbonate sediment; formation mechanism; machine learning; marine sediment; methane; precipitation (chemistry)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065765080

In order to reduce their energy demand, it is important to improve envelopes’ thermal transmittance without damaging the historic integrity of their façades by applying interior insulation. Thus, a detailed planning is needed to guarantee that case-specific variables are well considered. In this study, a holistic performance-based evaluation method is developed. Firstly, the hygrothermal risks are investigated through dynamic hygrothermal simulation. Secondly, an energy assessment is performed, followed by a life-cycle assessment to investigate the environmental impact of the intervention. The developed method is applied in the framework of a conservation and rehabilitation case of a residential building, to evaluate six natural-based insulation systems: perlite filled bricks, wood fibre, cellulose, cork, mineral foam, and calcium silicate. Results show that vegetal-based materials have the lowest initial environmental impact. In any case, retrofit interventions proved to be crucial to reduce the overall environmental impact associated with the use of historic buildings. The developed method, proving to be suitable for application to internally insulated historic buildings, supports a clear identification of the design solution with the lowest environmental impact by using a unique indicator. © 2019 The Authors","Energy assessment; Historic buildings; Hygrothermal assessment; Interior insulation; Life-cycle assessment; Natural materials","Artificial life; Buildings; Calcium silicate; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Historic preservation; Life cycle; Silicates; Thermal insulation; Wood; Energy assessment; Historic buildings; Hygrothermal; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Natural materials; Environmental impact; building; design method; energy efficiency; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; environmental indicator; greenhouse gas; holistic approach; insulation; life cycle analysis; performance assessment; simulation; transmittance; Buildings; Calcium Silicate; Greenhouse Gases; Life Cycle; Silicates; Thermal Insulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066477223

Their top-heavy hypsometry makes them highly sensitive to changes in climate when the equilibriaum line altitude (ELA) lies above the plateau edge, allowing ice to expand significantly as regional ELAs decrease, and causing rapid recession as climate warms. With respect to future climate warming, it is important to understand the controls on plateau icefield response to climate change in order to better predict recession rates, with implications for water resources and sea-level rise. Improving knowledge of the controls on glacier recession may also enable further palaeoclimatic information to be extracted from the Quaternary glacial record. We use the distribution of moraines to examine topographic controls on Younger Dryas icefield recession in Scotland. We find that overall valley morphology influences the style of recession, through microclimatic and geometric controls, with bed gradient affecting moraine spacing. Ice mass reconfiguration may occur as recession progresses because ice divide migration could alter the expected response based on hypsometric distribution. These results add to a growing body of research examining controls on glacier recession and offer a step towards unravelling non-linear ice mass behaviour. Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Sustainable forest management therefore depends on species- and regional-specific information. Here, we use tree-ring width measurements of 334 beech, 280 fir, 144 spruce and 63 pine trees from 75 inventory plots in Slovakia to assess the predominant factors that control radial stem growth of Europe's economically most important forest species. All four species exhibit significant shifts in stem growth over the past 100 years. Ring width patterns were, however, not significantly affected by tree species diversity and site elevation. The resistance, resilience and recovery of all species to the extreme summer droughts between 1950 and 2003 suggest that spruce is the species most unsuitable for the predicted warmer and drier future. Silver fir may benefit from warmer conditions, although we cannot conclude that it will not suffer from predicted increased frequency of climate extremes.

Focussing on the effect of agricultural practices on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from soil, the hypothesis of this research is that the organic conservation system (ORG+) may reduce emissions of N2O, CH4 and CO2 from soil, compared to an integrated farming system (INT) and an organic (ORG) system in a two-year irrigated vegetable crop rotation set up in 2014, in a Mediterranean environment. The crop rotation included: Savoy cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. sabauda L. cv. Famosa), spring lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Justine), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill. cv. Montebianco) and summer lettuce (L. sativa cv. Ballerina). Fluxes from soil of N2O, CH4 and CO2 were measured from October 2014 to July 2016 with the flow-through non-steady state chamber technique using a mobile instrument equipped with high precision analysers. Both cumulative and daily N2O emissions were mainly lower in ORG+ than in INT and ORG. All the cropping systems acted as a sink of CH4, with no significant differences among treatments. The ORG and ORG+ systems accounted for higher cumulative and daily CO2 emissions than INT, maybe due to the stimulating effect on soil respiration of organic material (fertilizers/plant biomass) supplied in ORG and ORG+. Overall, the integration of conservation and organic agriculture showed a tendency for higher CO2 emissions and lower N2O emissions than the other treatments, without any clear results on its potential for mitigating GHG emissions from soil. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon dioxide; Cover crops; Green manure; Methane; Nitrous oxide; No-till; Organic fertilizers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070735391

Innovations in remote sensing and forest monitoring provide ever-increasing levels of coverage, spatial and temporal detail, and accuracy. More global products and advanced open-source algorithms are becoming available. Still, these datasets and tools are not always consistent or complementary, and their suitability for local REDD+ performance assessments remains unclear. These assessments should, ideally, be free of any confounding factors, but performance estimates are affected by data uncertainties in unknown ways. Here, we analyse (1) differences in accuracy between datasets of forest cover change; (2) if and how combinations of datasets can increase accuracy; and we demonstrate (3) the effect of (not) doing accuracy assessments for REDD+ performance measurements. Our study covers five local REDD+ initiatives in four countries across the tropics. We compared accuracies of a readily available global forest cover change dataset and a locally modifiable open-source break detection algorithm. We applied human interpretation validation tools using Landsat Time Series data and high-resolution optical imagery. Next, we assessed whether and how combining different datasets can increase accuracies using several combination strategies. Finally, we demonstrated the consequences of using the input datasets for REDD+ performance assessments with and without considering their accuracies and uncertainties. Estimating the amount of deforestation using validation samples could substantially reduce uncertainty in REDD+ performance assessments. We found that the accuracies of the various data sources differ at site level, although on average neither one of the input products consistently excelled in accuracy. Using a combination of both products as stratification for area estimation and validated with a sample of high-resolution data seems promising. In these combined products, the expected trade-offs in accuracies across change classes (before, after, no change) and across accuracy types (user's and producer's accuracy) were negligible, so their use is advantageous over single-source datasets. More locally calibrated wall-to-wall products should be developed to make them more useful and applicable for REDD+ purposes. The direction and degree of REDD+ performance remained statistically uncertain, as CIs were overlapping in most cases for the deforestation estimates before and after the start of the REDD+ interventions. Given these uncertainties and inaccuracies and to increase the credibility of REDD+ it is advised to (1) be conservative in REDD+ accounting, and (2) not to rely on results from single currently available global data sources or tools without sample-based validation if results-based payments are intended to be made on this basis. © 2019 The Authors","Accuracy; Deforestation; Measurement, reporting and verification; Performance; REDD+; Uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073601954

In Indonesia, governments, multilateral/bilateral agencies and NGOs have applied engagement and FPIC in the development of REDD+ initiatives at national and sub-national scales. This article develops a theoretical framework by adapting governmentality to deliberative democracy and then analyses how participation and engagement are used as powerful tools to govern the introduction of REDD+. The framework is applied to two sub-national REDD+ initiatives, the Central Sulawesi Pilot Province and the Kalimantan Forest and Climate Partnership. The engagement and participatory forums employed in these cases operate to alter and discipline the activities of local agents who regulate, manage and use forestry resources. They provide a political space to introduce new knowledge and external narratives on appropriate and legitimate ways to govern land-use development. As a highly managed post-political domain they enable contested issues around forests to be debated and potentially resolved, but within a prescribed managerial framework focussed on carbon mitigation. Through engagement and discursive interaction the multiple landholders, communities, businesses and government agencies are activated as subjects and citizens of these new carbon based endeavours. Those applying engagement and FPIC need to recognise the unbalanced power relations inherent within these processes; and ensure they form an integral part of a much broader and longer term deliberative exchange, rather than required steps along the trajectory of project or program delivery. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Deliberative democracy; Engagement; FPIC; Governmentality; REDD+ Indonesia","conceptual framework; democracy; environmental policy; ethnic group; local participation; stakeholder; state role; Borneo; Indonesia; Kalimantan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065133520

Burning fossil fuels to produce electricity and heat are the biggest cause of climate change and emissions and represent one third of total greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, buildings become responsible for improving the external environment, either by construction phases, rehabilitating process or by maintaining process. In Romania the building sector is the main contributor to gas emission and most of the residential multi-storeys constructions are buildings from the communist period built using standardized projects. In Romania one the main goals are the thermal rehabilitation of buildings and construction of apartments especially in the inner circle of the capital. However, the renovation measures are very basic and do not target actual/future EU legislation that imposes the Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB) standard for the buildings. To overcome and to provide an alternative to both correct refurbishment and creation of new apartments the OVER 4 prototype was developed. These prototypes are modules of apartments where multiple bioclimatic strategies were implemented to minimize the energy consumption.

Using a detailed model of power sector investments and operations, this analysis systematically explores potential drivers and barriers to midcentury advanced nuclear reactor commercialization. Model results suggest that extensive deployment of advanced nuclear technologies would likely require a combination of new policies (especially carbon pricing), innovation in technologies to significantly lower capital and financing costs (likely below $4000/kW), and innovation in business models to enable nonelectricity revenue streams. With policies targeting stringent emissions reductions, the presence of technologies like lower-cost advanced nuclear can reduce compliance costs by over 50%. However, without strong policy support and in a market with low-cost renewables and gas, costs of advanced nuclear reactors would have to decrease substantially from current estimates to make them economically competitive by 2050. © 2019, © 2019 American Nuclear Society.","Advanced nuclear reactors; deep decarbonization; electric power sector; energy policy; energy-economic modeling","Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Energy policy; Investments; Nuclear reactors; Advanced nuclear reactors; Current estimates; Detailed modeling; Electric power sector; Emissions reduction; Energy-economic model; Future technologies; Nuclear technology; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063463919

Lynwood area vehicle tailpipe emissions were first surveyed in 1989 and 1991 because the area suffered from a large number of carbon monoxide (CO) air quality violations. These new measurements allow for the estimation of fuel-specific CO and total hydrocarbon (HC) emissions reductions, changes in the longevity of emission-control components, and the prevalence of high emitters in the current fleet. Since 1989 CO emissions decreased approximately factors of 10 (120 ± 8 to 12.3 ± 0.2 gCO/kg of fuel) and 20 (210 ± 8 to 10.4 ± 0.4 gCO/kg of fuel) at our I-710/Imperial Highway and Long Beach Blvd. sites, respectively. These reductions are also reflected in the local ambient air measurements. Tailpipe HC emissions have decreased by a factor of 25 (50 ± 4 to 2.1 ± 0.3 gHC/kg of fuel) since 1991 at the Long Beach Blvd. location. The decreases are so dramatic that the vast majority of vehicles now have HC measurements that are indistinguishable from zero. The decreases have increased the skewedness of the emissions distribution with the 99th percentile now responsible for more than 37% (CO) and 28% (HC) of the totals. Ammonia emissions collected in 2018 at both Lynwood locations peak with 20-year-old vehicles (1998 models), indicating long lifetimes for catalytic converters. In 1989 and 1991, the on-road Lynwood fleets had significantly higher emissions than fleets observed in other locations within the South Coast Air Basin. The 2018 fleets now have means and emissions by model year that are consistent with those observed at other sites in Los Angeles and the U.S. This indicates that modern vehicle combustion management and after-treatment systems are achieving their goals regardless of community income levels. Implications: Recent on-road vehicle emission measurements at two locations in the Lynwood, CA area, first visited in 1989, found significant fuel specific CO and HC emission reductions. CO emissions have decreased by a factor of 10 and 20 at each location and HC emissions have declined by a factor of 25. This has increased the skewedness in both species emissions distribution. The 2018 fleets have means and emissions by model year that are now consistent with those observed at other U.S. sites indicating that modern vehicle emissions control advancements are achieving their goals regardless of community income levels. © 2019, © 2019 A&WMA.",,"ammonia; carbon monoxide; hydrocarbon; air pollutant; air pollution; California; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Ammonia; Carbon Monoxide; Environmental Monitoring; Hydrocarbons; Los Angeles; Motor Vehicles; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069736033

Currently, the transportation is sustained through highway, which has 232.6 km length between the cities used as a case study. High-speed railway construction is projected on the same route. We formed different capacity alternatives as alternative scenarios and life cycle assessment approach was applied to these scenarios. Environmental damage ratio decreased with the increasing utilization ratio of the railway. The greatest change was seen in ecosystem quality. We also assessed emissions during the construction activities of both railway and highway. A social cost-benefit analysis suggested that damage cost in the current situation was ?562,000. The scenario with100% replacement of highway with railway transportation showed the lowest damage cost (?157,000)while the highest damage cost was due to NOx emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Emissions; Life cycle assessment; Social cost-benefit analysis; Sustainability; Transportation","Construction industry; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Life cycle; Particulate emissions; Railroad plant and structures; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Sustainable development; Transportation; Comparative assessment; Construction activities; Environmentally friendly alternatives; High - speed railways; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Railway transportation; Social cost; Transportation of goods; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066452758

Here, a covalent triazine-based framework (CTF) is demonstrated as an efficient cocatalyst to reduce CO2 under visible-light irradiation. The nitrogen-rich triazine moieties in CTF contribute to CO2 adsorption, while the periodical pore structure of CTF favors the accommodation of CO2 and electron mediator. Immobilization of cobalt species onto CTF promotes the photocatalytic activity with a 44-fold enhancement over pristine CTF and the optimal CO production rate of the obtained Co/CTFs was up to 50 μmol g−1 h−1. The results of solid-state UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS), CO2 adsorption and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) illustrated that the increased activity was ascribed to the enhanced CO2 capture capacity, improved absorption of visible-light and facilitated the transfer of charge from CTF to CO2 molecules. The CTF not only serves as a substrate for active Co species, but also bridges the photosensitizer with cobalt catalytic sites for the efficient transfer of photoexcited electrons.

By cross-referencing results of microscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, and electrochemical analysis, we demonstrate that the Pt atoms tend to form disordered atomic clusters capping on the Co nanoparticle surface. The values of unfilled d-states (hTs) extracted from X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy were used to calculate the d-band vacancies of Pt. Accordingly, CoPt-CO570 (reduced in CO at 570 K) possesses the lowest hTs value (0.302) (i.e., the lowest Pt d-band vacancies) among experimental samples, indicating a strong electron relocation from Co atoms. Such electron relocations are attributed to the high extent of the heteroatomic intermix between Pt and Co atoms and thus improves the oxygen reduction reaction activity of CoPt-CO570. For providing further evidence, structural and electrochemical properties for H2 and NaBH4 reduction-prepared CoPt NCs are compared as the control.

The focus of the current research lies in defining the molecular and supramolecular structure of soil humus acids. This paper provides a brief review of the current understanding of the problem and shares findings of the elemental and X-ray structural analysis of humic and fulvic acids extracted from Chernozems and Chestnut soils in the Rostov region. This region occupies a large area of the South-European Russia. Humic acids in the studied soils have reduced carbon content compared to average parameters for these soil types. The supramolecular organization of humic acids in three-dimensional space contains two to four layers of condensed aromatic systems supplemented by a network of chain fragments of different regularity and length. Parameters of this structure vary for soils of different genesis and genetic horizons. However, interplanar distances are fixed in the range of 0.349 to 0.371 nm. Thickness of the carbon network band increases with the benzoidicity level of humic acids. The obtained results confirm the specific matrix structure of humic acid molecules. Considering currently available scarce data these findings are valuable and unique.

This modelling study was designed to assess system performance in response to price and climate variability of three pasture-only systems, 12-month, 6-month and 3-month, each with a range of stocking rates. We used a combination of six metrics to assess the systems. Higher stocking rate systems were more exposed to climate and economic risk, but performed better in terms of production, profit and equity growth. The lower stocking rate systems showed lower environmental footprint and variability of operating profit, but also lower production, profit and equity growth. Intermediate systems, with average performance in all six metrics, were somewhere between 2.7 and 3.2 cows/ha for the dairy region explored here, irrespective of pasture-only regime. System choice will depend on the operator's perception of sources of uncertainty, and how they intend to cope with these uncertainties. With greater environmental pressure, systems will have to lean towards lower stocking rates and input, while pressure for financial performance will drive the system in the opposite direction.

Pressure and temperature estimations based in the fluid inclusion microthermometry and selenide thermometry constrain the formation of the deposit at 250–270 °C and 1.2–1.7 kbar. Element concentrations of alkali metals, Pb, Cs and to a lesser extent Ba correlate with salinity, whereas redox-sensitive elements including U and Ce vary widely. Gold concentrations from 50 to 500 ppb detected in some inclusions are consistent with the highly oxidizing conditions defined by selenide mineralogy. The presence of uranium and gold within fluid inclusions of the distal hematite alteration zone confirms the oxidizing, metal carrier fluids. The occurrence of hydrothermally precipitated carbon implies that a reducing CH4-bearing fluid was also present, and the structural relationships suggest that mixing between this reducing fluid (and interaction with carbon-upgraded rocks) with an acidic, oxidizing and metal-carrying fluids was the main process driving ore metal precipitation. The genesis of the Serra Pelada Au–Pd-Pt deposit shows similarities with sediment-hosted copper deposits and unconformity-related U ± Au ± PGE deposits, having in common the downflow of highly oxidizing fluids into the hydrothermal domain of the Earth's upper crust. Major differences in metal proportions of these broad classes of ore deposits and other sediment-hosted systems in different ore provinces are primarily caused by differences in source rocks available for oxidative leaching and variations in the geometry of the hydrothermal system. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Au-PGE mineralization; Carajás; Fluid inclusion; Serra Pelada","Carbon; Clay alteration; Cobalt deposits; Copper deposits; Deposits; Gold alloys; Hematite; Kaolinite; Mineralogy; Ores; Palladium alloys; Platinum alloys; Platinum metals; Precipitation (chemical); Ternary alloys; Element concentrations; Fluid inclusion; Fluid inclusion microthermometry; Homogenization temperatures; Hydrothermal alterations; Pressure and temperature; Serra Pelada; Structural relationship; Gold deposits; concentration (composition); enrichment; fluid inclusion; gold; host rock; hydrothermal deposit; hydrothermal system; lead; metallogenesis; mineralization; ore body; ore deposit; oxidation; platinum; Brazil; Carajas; Para [Brazil]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068751907

The rate was initially set at $10/ton of CO2 and then raised annually by increments of $5 to reach $30/ton in 2012. We measure the impact of the tax on diesel users; these are primarily businesses involved in heavy industries, mining, construction, and commercial transportation, and they represent 18.2% of B.C. fossil fuel emissions. Based on a cointegration equation and a related error-correction model, we find that, over 2008–2016, the combined long and short run carbon tax impact has resulted in an average of 5.85 cent/litre increase at the pump, and a reduction of 1.24 L in monthly per capita diesel consumption. The average annual reduction amounts to 1.3% of B.C. 2008 diesel emissions and 0.2% of total emissions in the province in that same year.

Therefore, archaeobotanists have often performed charring experiments mainly aimed to produce comparative materials and to better understand the various processes affecting the morphology and composition of archaeobotanical assemblages. In this paper, and based on previous works, we develop a laboratory protocol which standardizes the charring process and proposes how to perform charring experiments with a step-by-step description of the methodology. Our observations have focused on ripe Triticum spelta, a species seldom approached by former experiments, both in its ripe and unripe and roasted form, known as Grünkern. We explore the parameters that affect the production of comparative material which preserves the features closest to the non-charred individuals both as regards overall shape and external morphology but also as regards the effects of charring on the internal morphology of the cereal grains examined with the aid of Scanning Electron Microscopy. Based on our own experience and on which information we missed when performing our experiments, we describe here the work that we carried out with the aims of exploring the effects of charring on cereal grain structure, but simultaneously of providing a protocol useful for charring experiments, needed for the standardization of similar work. This standardization is needed in order to achieve meaningful comparisons of results when producing charred material. Being applicable to other experiments and laboratories, it will enable in the future a more reliable exploration and interpretation of ancient cereal foods. © 2019 The Authors","Archaeobotany; Cereal; Charring experiment; Grünkern; Methodology; Triticum spelta L.",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066454041

Muga watershed of Upper Blue Nile basin is characterized by deterioration with mismanagement of natural resources. Thus, this study was aimed at detecting the magnitude and pattern of land use/land cover changes and assessing drivers of changes over the last three decades (1985–2017) in the Muga watershed. Synergy of Landsat imageries (1985, 2002, and 2017), household survey, focus group discussion, key informant interview, and field observation were used to detect changes and drivers of changes. Land use/land cover changes in the study watershed were detected using digital image analysis techniques, and their socio-economic and biophysical drivers were analysed using descriptive statistics. The change detection results revealed a significant increasing trend of cultivated land and urban areas by 12 and 270%, respectively. In contrast, grasslands, forest lands and shrub-bushlands showed a declining trend of about 40, 21 and 12%, respectively. The socioeconomic data analysis results indicated that expansion of cultivated land, cutting of trees for fuelwood and construction purposes, population growth, land tenure policy, and climate variability were the most influential drivers of land use/land cover changes in the study watershed. The findings of this study confirmed that unmanaged land cover conversion led to degradation of natural resources of the study watershed. Thus, alternative sources of income for youths and landless peasants, and integrated watershed management, which has paramount importance in maintaining economic and ecological benefits were suggested to alleviate the adverse effects of land use/land cover changes in Muga watershed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Drivers; Ethiopia; Land use/ land cover; Muga watershed; Remote sensing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068756243

Local residents and environmental activists have raised concerns about health, noise, ground water contamination, seismicity, environmental amenity, and other impacts of the industry on communities. Despite the complexities of shale gas extraction, an emphasis on the local has shaped key dimensions of the debate around the appropriate location for well pads to the relative exclusion of other issues. This paper draws on fieldwork in Lancashire, UK, to reflect on the political construction of scale in order to explore how an emphasis on “the local” can restrict political debate over shale gas to narrow concerns with land-use planning thereby obviating a fuller engagement with wider questions concerning risk, energy policy, and climate change. It is concluded that a more nuanced conception of scale is necessary for understanding how concerns with shale gas are diminished rather than strengthened through the current planning policy and regulatory regime operating in the UK. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) has the potential to achieve a lower cost of electricity than a supercritical pulverized coal power plant with an amine absorption system. Although the concept and research on chemical looping has a long history, CLC has numerous technical issues that must be addressed prior to a commercial debut. This effort is directed toward the following major issues for CLC: (1) demonstrating continuous solids handling, operability, and reactor performance at autothermal conditions and (2) preliminary assessments of oxygen carrier attrition and relative material make-up costs. These are critical issues that should be addressed under realistic conditions prior to directing resources toward larger scale demonstrations. This paper will also describe NETL's small 50-kWth natural gas circulating CLC test facility located in Morgantown, WV. Despite its small size, this experimental test unit has operated at autothermal conditions for 11 h using a copper-iron-alumina oxygen carrier developed at NETL. This paper will describe the test facility and operating experiences using NETL's “Gen 2.0” oxygen carrier material. Natural gas conversion to CO2 ranged from 70 to 90% over approximately 75 oxidation-reduction cycles during the autothermal operating period. Estimates for the process specific attrition rate during autothermal operation are also presented. Finally, estimates for the oxygen carrier makeup cost, specific to the NETL process configuration, are several orders of magnitude greater than the NETL target. Future work should focus on reducing the oxygen carrier material cost and improving the attrition resistance of the oxygen carrier material under autothermal test conditions. © 2019","Chemical Looping Combustion","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Coal; Cosmetics; Cost benefit analysis; Fossil fuel power plants; Greenhouse gases; Materials handling; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Oxygen; Pulverized fuel; Test facilities; Testing; Auto-thermal operation; Chemical looping combustion; Fossil fuel combustion; Natural gas conversion; Oxidation reduction cycles; Preliminary assessment; Pulverized coal power plant; United states department of energies; Coal combustion; carbon emission; combustion; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; natural gas; oxidation; reduction; Morgantown; United States; West Virginia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066158031

Here we review the evidence linking protection from local pressures (e.g., fishing and habitat destruction) with increased resilience. Despite strong theoretical underpinnings, studies have only rarely attributed resilience responses to the recovery of food webs and habitats, and increases in the diversity of communities and populations. When detected, resistance to ocean warming and recovery after extreme events in MPAs have small effect sizes against a backdrop of natural variability. By contrast, large die-offs are well described from MPAs following climate stress events. This may be in part because protection from one set of pressures or drivers (such as fishing) can select for species that are highly sensitive to others (such as warming), creating a ‘Protection Paradox’. Given that climate change is overwhelming the resilience capacity of marine ecosystems, the only primary solution is to reduce carbon emissions. High-quality monitoring data in both space and time can also identify emergent resilience signals that do exist, in combination with adequate reference data to quantify the initial system state. This knowledge will allow networks of diverse protected areas to incorporate spatial refugia against climate change, and identify resilient biological components of natural systems. Sufficient spatial replication further offers insurance against losses in any given MPA, and the possibility for many weak signals of resilience to accumulate. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"carbon emission; climate change; data quality; ecosystem resilience; food web; habitat fragmentation; human activity; knowledge; marine park",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066478889

The first successes in decarbonizing the electricity sector were already achieved under the German Energiewende. However, further steps in this direction, also concerning the heat and transport sectors, have stalled. This paper describes three possible pathways for the transformation of the German energy system until 2050. The scenarios take into account current climate politics on a global, European, and German level and also include different demand projections, technological trends and resource prices. The model includes the sectors power, heat, and transportation and works on a Federal State level. For the analysis, the linear cost-optimizing Global Energy System Model (GENeSYS-MOD) is used to calculate the cost-efficient paths and technology mixes. We find that a reduction of CO2 of more than 80% in the less ambitious scenario can be welfare enhancing compared to a scenario without any climate mitigating policies. Even higher decarbonization rates of 95% are feasible and needed to comply with international climate targets, yet related to high effort in transforming the subsector of process heat. The different pathways depicted in this paper render chances and risks of transforming the German energy system under various external influences. c 2019 by the authors.","Decarbonization; Energiewende; Energy policy; Energy system modeling; Energy transformation; GENeSYS-MOD; Renewables","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Decarbonization; Energy policy; Energiewende; Energy system model; Energy transformation; GENESYS; Renewables; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070270542

Pollution control is strongly linked to atmospheric acidification and contaminants in combustion exhausts. In such a contest, marine propulsion is actually a key player that is accounting for a substantial contribution to pollution. Kyoto protocol's obligations established decarbonisation as a compulsory commitment and contaminant constraints are defined by current emission policy and regulations both on a global and on a regional basis. In this paper, a study is carried out in order to develop a framework for current emission policy and assessment of exhausts due to constraints imposed on fuel choice. Gas fuelled marine propulsion, implemented through state-of-the-art GT areoderivative prime movers, powered by LNG, is analysed from the environmental point of view. The pollutant emissions from various size GT models are evaluated through both GT datasheets and commercial (as well as self-coded) software, in order to assess the validity of LNG as an alternative fuel option for future sustainable marine applications. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.",,"Application programs; Gas emissions; Gas turbines; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Marine applications; Pollution control; Quality control; Ship propulsion; Combustion exhausts; Current emissions; Policy and regulation; Policy assessment; Pollutant emission; Quality evaluation; State of the art; Sustainable power; Marine pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071858560

The causes of the late Pleistocene extinctions have been extensively debated and continue to be poorly understood. Several extinction models have been proposed, including two nutritionally based extinction models: the coevolutionary disequilibrium and mosaic-nutrient models. These models draw upon the individualistic response of plant species to climate change to present a plausible scenario in which nutritional stress is considered one of the primary causes for the late Pleistocene extinctions. In this study, we tested predictions of the coevolutionary disequilibrium and mosaic-nutrient extinction models through the study of dental wear and enamel hypoplasia of Equus and Bison from various North American localities. The analysis of the dental wear (microwear and mesowear) of the samples yielded results that are consistent with predictions established for the coevolutionary disequilibrium model, but not for the mosaic-nutrient model. These ungulate species show statistically different dental wear patterns (suggesting dietary resource partitioning) during preglacial and full-glacial time intervals, but not during the postglacial in accordance with predictions of the coevolutionary disequilibrium model. In addition to changes in diet, these ungulates, specifically the equid species, show increased levels of enamel hypoplasia during the postglacial, indicating higher levels of systemic stress, a result that is consistent with the models tested and with other climate-based extinction models. The extent to which the increase in systemic stress was detrimental to equid populations remains to be further investigated, but suggests that environmental changes during the late Pleistocene significantly impacted North American equids. © 2019 The Paleontological Society.

Here we conducted the first long-term and continuous study of PBL heights (PBLHs) in Boston, MA, using a compact lidar instrument. We developed an image recognition algorithm to estimate PBLHs from the lidar measurements and evaluated simulations of the PBL from seven numerical weather prediction (NWP) model versions, which showed different systematic errors and variability in simulating the PBLHs (discrepancies from -2.5 to 4.0 km). The NWP model with the best overall agreement for the fully developed PBL had R2 = 0.72 and a bias of only 0.128 km. However, this model predicted a notable number of anomalously high carbon dioxide concentrations at ground stations, because it occasionally significantly underestimated the PBLH. We also developed a novel method that combines lidar data with footprints from a Lagrangian particle dispersion model to identify long-range transport of air pollution in the nocturnal residual layer. Our framework was powerful in evaluating the performance of models used to estimate air pollution and GHG emissions in cities, which is critical to track progress on emission reduction targets and guide effective policies. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Boundary layers; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Gas emissions; Image recognition; Optical radar; Systematic errors; Weather forecasting; Emission reduction targets; Lagrangian particle dispersion model; Lidar measurements; Long range transport; Numerical weather prediction models; Planetary boundary layers; Recognition algorithm; Urban air pollution; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; air quality; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); estimation method; greenhouse gas; lidar; long range transport; urban pollution; air pollution; Article; boundary layer; carbon footprint; dispersion; Massachusetts; planetary boundary layer; systematic error; weather; air pollutant; city; environmental monitoring; greenhouse gas; theoretical model; Boston; Massachusetts; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Boston; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Gases; Models, Theoretical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071069711

In addition, recent work suggests that the MJO can influence the stratospheric polar vortex, which is also known to influence the tropospheric NAO—thus, there likely exists a stratospheric pathway for MJO influence as well. Here, we apply two methods to shed more light on the pathways linking the MJO to the NAO. First, we use a traditional approach in climate science based on analyzing conditional probabilities. Second, we use methods from causal discovery theory based on probabilistic graphical models. Together, these two analysis approaches reveal that the MJO can impact the NAO via both a tropospheric and stratospheric pathway. The stratospheric pathway is shown to come about in two ways: First, both methods show that the MJO itself influences the strength of the stratospheric polar vortex on a timescale of ∼10 days, and then 5 days later the vortex can drive changes in the NAO. Second, the state of the stratospheric polar vortex acts to condition the NAO to be conducive (or not) to MJO influence. When the vortex is in a state that opposes the expected NAO response to the MJO, we find little influence of the MJO on the NAO, however, when the vortex supports the expected NAO response, the NAO is up to 30% more likely to be in a particular state following active MJO periods. ©2019.

The preliminary assessment takes into account different perspectives from the industrial and economic point of view: the availability of suitable surfaces, the economics of the investment and the best processes to be fed by solar produced steam towards a preliminary techno-economic feasibility study. The starting points for the analysis have been the characterization of the thermal demand in terms of necessary temperature level (°C), overall consumption and time distribution. The following step has been the identification of the suitable collectors to be installed taking into account the thermal parameters presented before, the boundary conditions of the industrial facility (e.g. space available, orientation, etc.), the technical characteristics of the collector itself and the solar irradiation available considering the plant's location. Moreover, the complex thermal facility in the factory, constituted by multiple (3) gas boilers and a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant in two different but linked pressurized steam loops, is taken into account for the definition of the solar collectors configuration and their integration via the proper management of heat generators and storage.

Epoxides represent attractive modifications of unsaturated polymer backbones for this purpose, but they suffer from limited mechanical reactivity. Here, we report that placing alkenes adjacent to cis-epoxide mechanophores along a polymer backbone results in ring-opening to carbonyl ylides during sonication, whereas epoxides with an adjacent saturated, linear alkyl chain do not. Upon release, tension-trapped ylides preferentially close to their trans-epoxides in accordance with the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. The reactivity of carbonyl ylides is exploited to tag the activated species with spectroscopic labels and to facilitate force-induced cross-linking through a reaction with pendant alcohols on co-polymers. The alkene effect is attributed to a combination of lower activation energy of the reaction (δG‡) and greater force-coupled change in the length as the reaction proceeds from the ground to transition state (δx‡) relative to epoxides without the alkene. Even with alkene assistance, mechanochemical reactivity remains low; single-molecule force spectroscopy establishes that at ∼2500 pN ring-opening proceeds with a rate constant that is less than approximately 5 s-1 in toluene.

It was determined that reducing the proportion of binder (manure) to 15% leads to the need to increase the pressure of the press to 300 kgf / cm2. Adding manure in the briquette changes the burning characteristics, the briquette burns longer, and it becomes possible to reduce the pressure.

Defining the territory as a sociotechnical system allows us to underline the interrelations between space, energy and society. Groups of municipalities in a region can be identified with respect to their potential production of renewable energy by means of well-known data-mining approaches. Similar municipalities linking together can share ideas and promote collaborations, supporting clever social planning in the transition towards a new energy system. The methodology is applied to the South Tyrol case study (Italy). Results show eight different spatially-based sociotechnical systems within the coherent cultural and institutional context of South Tyrol. In particular, this paper observes eight different systems in terms of (1)different renewable energy source preferences in semi-urban and rural contexts; (2)different links with other local planning, management, and policy needs; (3)different socio-demographic specificities of individuals and families; (4)presence of different kinds of stakeholders or of (5)different socio-spatial organizations based on land cover. Each energy system has its own specificities and potentialities, including social and spatial dimensions, that can address a more balanced, inclusive, equal, and accelerated energy transition at the local and translocal scale. © 2019 The Authors",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065120140

While the drivers of RE policy adoption have been well-studied in the U.S. and Europe, we know little about the factors that drive RE policy adoption in developing countries. Both theory and anecdotal evidence suggest that policies often spread when one country emulates another's policy, but scholars of policy diffusion have tended to focus on emulation of political and ideological peers, overlooking other factors that may be particularly critical for driving RE policy adoption, including emulation of peers with similar electric sector conditions and emulation that is driven by coercive donor-recipient aid relationships. We use a directed dyadic analysis to assess the factors that prompt a country to emulate another's policies and to determine whether emulation patterns differ across developed and developing countries. We find that both sets of countries tend to emulate the policies of their political peers, and that developing countries tend to emulate the policies of donors. The effect of electric sector similarities varies by policy type. Countries emulate feed-in tariffs of countries with similar electric sector conditions, but they emulate quota policies of countries with dissimilar levels of reliance on renewable energy. Results suggest that different policies may diffuse via different emulation patterns. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy policy; Feed-in tariff; Ideological similarities; Policy diffusion; Quota system; Renewable portfolio standard","alternative energy; developing world; energy policy; quota system; tariff structure; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063965936

When used for water remediation or electrochemical energy storage and conversion, they are nanostructured and exposed to various environments. Therefore, understanding their surface reactivity is of prime importance. Such studies have been hindered by carbon contamination from syntheses. Herein, this synthetic and characterization challenge is addressed through a new approach to 50 nm carbon-free Ti4O7 and Ti6O11 nanoparticles. It takes advantage of the different reactivities of rutile and anatase TiO2 nanoparticles towards H2, to use the former as precursor of TinO2n−1 and the latter as a diluting agent. This approach is combined with silica templating to restrain particle growth. The surface reactivity of the Magnéli nanoparticles under different atmospheres was then evaluated quantitatively by synchrotron-radiation-based X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which revealed oxidized surfaces with lower conductivity than the core. This finding sheds a new light on the charge transfer occurring in these materials. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Therefore, a substantial reduction in projected increases is required to bring emissions in line with long-term global climate objectives. Literature on how LICs are integrating climate change mitigation and sustainable transport strategies is limited. Key drivers of transport policy include improving accessibility, congestion, air quality, energy security, with reducing greenhouse gas emissions being of lower priority. This paper assesses the current status, feasibility and potential of selected low-carbon transport measures with high sustainable development benefits that can be implemented in the short to medium term, socalled 'quick wins'. It examines to what extent ten such quick wins are integrated in climate change strategies in nine low- and middle-income countries in Africa and South Asia. The research method comprises expert interviews, an online questionnaire survey of experts and policymakers in the focus countries, and a review of literature and government plans. Results indicate that sustainable urban transport policies and measures are considered high priority, with vehicle-related measures such as fuel quality and fuel economy standards and electric two- and three-wheelers being of key relevance. In existing national climate change strategies, these quick wins are integrated to a certain extent; however, with better coordination between transport and energy and environment agencies such strategies can be improved. A general conclusion of this paper is that for LICs, quick wins can connect a 'top-down' climate perspective with a 'bottom-up' transport sector perspective. A knowledge gap exists as to the mitigation potential and sustainable development benefits of these quick wins in the local context of LICs. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change strategies; Low-carbon transport; Low-income countries; Paris Agreement; Sustainable mobility; Transport policy","climate change; emission control; environmental policy; global climate; greenhouse gas; policy making; questionnaire survey; strategic approach; sustainability; sustainable development; transportation policy; Africa; Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070745993

However, current measurements regarding the influences of CSA management practices on SOC sequestration diverge widely, making it difficult to derive conclusions about individual and combined CSA management effects and bringing large uncertainties in quantifying the potential of the agricultural sector to mitigate climate change. We conducted a meta-analysis of 3,049 paired measurements from 417 peer-reviewed articles to examine the effects of three common CSA management practices on SOC sequestration as well as the environmental controlling factors. We found that, on average, biochar applications represented the most effective approach for increasing SOC content (39%), followed by cover crops (6%) and conservation tillage (5%). Further analysis suggested that the effects of CSA management practices were more pronounced in areas with relatively warmer climates or lower nitrogen fertilizer inputs. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that, through adopting CSA practices, cropland could be an improved carbon sink. We also highlight the importance of considering local environmental factors (e.g., climate and soil conditions and their combination with other management practices) in identifying appropriate CSA practices for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring crop productivity. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","biochar; climate; conservation tillage; cover crop; meta-analysis; soil organic carbon","agricultural management; agricultural practice; biochar; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; conservation tillage; cover crop; environmental factor; meta-analysis; soil carbon; soil organic matter; carbon; fertilizer; agriculture; carbon sequestration; meta analysis; soil; Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Fertilizers; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066009556

Therefore, metals and trace elements were analyzed in feathers of Bonelli's eagles (Aquila fasciata) from southern Portugal in 2007–2013, where they are believed to be exposed to a wide range of contamination sources such as agricultural land uses, urban areas, active and abandoned mines and a coal-fired power plant. We focused on concentrations of aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn), as these contaminants are potentially associated with those sources and are known to pose a risk for terrestrial vertebrates. Stable isotope values of nitrogen (δ 15 N: 15 N/ 14 N), carbon (δ 13 C: 13 C/ 12 C) and sulphur (δ 34 S: 34 S/ 32 S) were used as dietary proxies to control for potential effects of prey composition on the contamination pattern. The spatial distribution of potential contamination sources was quantified using geographic information systems. Concentrations of Hg in the southern part of the study area were above a reported toxicity threshold for raptors, particularly in territories closer to a coal-fired power plant at Sines, showing that contamination persisted after a previous assessment conducted in the 1990s. Hg and Se levels were positively correlated with δ 15 N, which indicates biomagnification. Concentrations of As, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn were generally low and unrelated to mining- or industrial activities, indicating low environmental background concentrations. Al was found at higher concentrations in the southernmost areas of Portugal, but this pattern might be related to external soil contamination on feathers. Overall, this study indicates that, among all elements studied, Hg seems to be the most important contaminant for Bonelli's eagles in southern Portugal, likely due to the power plant emissions and biomagnification of Hg in terrestrial food webs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biomonitoring; Landfills; Metal contamination; Mines; Power plant; Stable isotopes","Abandoned mines; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Coal mines; Contamination; Fossil fuel power plants; Information use; Isotopes; Land fill; Land use; Mines; Pollution detection; Power plants; Trace elements; Background concentration; Biomonitoring; Coal-fired power plant; Environmental Monitoring; Large-scale monitoring; Metal contamination; Power-plant emissions; Stable isotopes; Soil pollution; aluminum; arsenic; carbon; chromium; copper; lead; mercury; nitrogen; selenium; sulfur; trace element; zinc; trace element; biomonitoring; diet; heavy metal; landfill; mine; power plant; predator; raptor; species conservation; trace element; agricultural land; Aquila fasciata; Article; coal power; concentration (parameter); correlational study; dietary intake; eagle; electric power plant; feather; food web; geographic information system; land use; mining; nonhuman; Portugal; predator; prey; priority journal; risk factor; soil pollution; terrestrial invertebrate; toxicity; urban area; analysis; animal; chemistry; dietary exposure; environmental monitoring; Falconiformes; food chain; metabolism; pollutant; raptor; statistics and numerical data; Portugal; Accipitridae; Aquila; Raptores; Vertebrata; Animals; Dietary Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Falconiformes; Feathers; Food Chain; Portugal; Raptors; Trace Elements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064896549

However, a more effective appraisal is achievable by employing three mutually correlated drought variables (i.e., duration, severity, peak) concurrently. This study adopted trivariate copulas for multivariate drought frequency estimation in seven climatic sub-regions and mainland China between 1961 and 2013. The joint distribution is modeled using nine trivariate copula functions, namely Clayton, Ali–Mikhail–Haq (AMH), Gumbel–Hougaard, Frank, M3, M4, M5, M6, and M12. The performance of the different copulas was evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), Akaike information criterion (AIC), bias, and graphical test. The results showed that trivariate Clayton copula performed better in modeling joint dependence structure of drought variables in contrast to other class of copulas in sub-regions I–VII and mainland China. Therefore, the Clayton copula–based drought joint distributions were used for the multivariate drought frequency analysis, regarding probabilities and return periods. The joint probabilities in the “OR” cases were greater than that of the “AND” cases in all the seven sub-regions and mainland China. There is every possibility that drought event occurrence will be given for “OR” cases. Accordingly, counter measures of drought hazards need to be set for proactive responses especially in sub-regions III, V, and VI. The trivariate return periods were compared with the univariate and bivariate return periods and discussed the need of multivariate drought frequency analysis. In conclusion, the Clayton trivariate copula is an excellent choice for efficient drought risk evaluation, and results are very handy in the design of water resource hydrologic systems under severe and extreme drought conditions. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"climate modeling; drought; frequency analysis; multivariate analysis; numerical model; probability; regional climate; trend analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058489423

Use of rapid reagent mixing and freeze quenching allowed triggering of (pre-)nucleation reactions and stabilisation of calcium carbonate precursors within 18 ms of contact between the reagent solutions. Using this approach, we examined the impact of saturation state and pH on the short-range order of calcium carbonate precursors. Results show that highly hydrated precursor structures characterised by low coordination number form in conditions below the solubility limit of calcite. The first and second coordination shells of these structures furthermore present similarities with the local coordination environment of calcite. Comparisons with previous molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the observed structures present characteristics most similar to simulated clusters possessing a high coordination number in their first shell. Substantial differences were observed between the local coordination environment of structures prepared at pH 7.5 and 8.5, even though both conditions are dominated by bicarbonate, suggesting a critical role for the carbonate ion under the conditions examined. Overall, our findings are consistent with previous work on the existence and structure of calcium carbonate prenucleation clusters and provide further support for the role of non-classical nucleation in these systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Calcium carbonate; EXAFS; Non-classical nucleation theory; Prenucleation clusters; X-ray absorption spectroscopy","bicarbonate; calcite; calcium carbonate; nucleation; pH; saturation; X-ray spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067939401

Data for this study were collected from 392 randomly selected smallholder farmers, using a structured questionnaire. The study used principal component analysis to group together related strategies that farmers used to respond to the effects of climate variability, which resulted into seven groups of responses. Majority of farmers at 97.5%, 85% and 74.1%, respectively, used cultural practices, diversification practices and risk reduction practices. Intensification practices followed by 69.3% while terraces crop and herd management and new breeds were the least adopted at 27%, 13.2% and 9%, respectively. Multivariate probit model was then used to examine the factors influencing smallholder farmers’ choice of response strategies to effects of climate change. The results indicated that access to weather information had a strong effect on use of risk management strategies at 74% and intensification strategies at 49%. Increase in level of education and exclusive dependence on agriculture increased the probability of introducing new breeds by 30% and 53%, respectively, while access to extension services increased use of terraces by 42%. Strong local institutions that facilitate access to information and credit are likely to initiate changes in key household characteristics, which positively affect response to effects of climate variability. Policies should aim to strengthen local institutions that enhance access to information and credit services. There is need for investment in the provision of affordable and quality education, relevant demand-driven extension services that provide localized response solutions. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Agro-pastoralism; Arid and semiarid lands; Climate variability; Multivariate probit; Principal component analysis; Response","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Climate models; Risk management; Climate variability; Cultural practices; Level of educations; Multivariate probit; Response strategies; Risk management strategies; Smallholder farmers; Weather information; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100783334

The final dehydration temperatures of the Eu3+ complexes show a zigzag pattern as a function of the carbon chain length of the dicarboxylate ligands, leading to the so-called odd-even effect. The FTIR data confirm the ligand–metal coordination via the mixed mode of bridge–chelate coordination, except for the Eu3+-oxalate complex. XRD results indicate that the highly crystalline materials belong to the monoclinic system. The odd–even effect on the 4 f–4 f luminescence intensity parameters (Ω2 and Ω4) is explained by using an extension of the dynamic coupling mechanism, herein named the ghost-atom model. In this method, the long-range polarizabilities (a*) were simulated by a ghost atom located at the middle of each ligand chain. The values of a* were estimated using the localized molecular orbital approach. The emission intrinsic quantum yield (QLn Ln) of the Eu3+ complexes also presented an the odd-even effect, successfully explained in terms of the zigzag behavior shown by the Ω2 and Ω4 intensity parameters.

Otherwise the consequences will be severe. The Green Growth Masterplan of South Sumatra has outline the strategies and action toward achieving sustainability. The masterplan consist of seven strategies aimed at achieving 5 sustainable development goals: (1) sustainable economic growth; (2) inclusive and equitable growth; (3) socio, economic and environmental resilience; (4) healthy and productive ecosystem, and (5) greenhouse gas emission reduction. The masterplan also implied that the only way South Sumatra will be able to achieve the green economic growth is through collaboration and cooperation among all stakeholders in the province. All of the enabling condition in green growth strategy were pointed toward the importance to build a strong partnership with all stakeholders. They need to work together and combine their knowledge and resources to achieve the green growth vision. One of the enabling condition is a strengthened capacity to conduct and implement green growth action. At this point, the issues of knowledge management became important. In order to collaborate effectively in managing the South Sumatra Landscape, a strong basis of knowledge is required. A knowledge society need to be formed in South Sumatra for this purpose. This knowledges need to be manage in such a way that any stakeholders in South Sumatra will be able access, utilize and improve. The SECI (Socialize-Externalize-Combine-Internalize) framework of Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995), fit nicely into the context of South Sumatra green growth implementation. Tacit knowledge from local wisdom of community needs to be combined with explicit knowledge that has been produced by so many research project in South Sumatra. The only problem with SECI framework is in institutionalization of the framework itself. Knowledge sharing on sustainable development needs to be facilitated by a body who can work with multiple stakeholders and at the same time implement the knowledge management system. In South Sumatra, this was addressed through the Green Growth Partnership Institution. KOLEGA SUMSEL is a form knowledge society which strive to achieve green growth vision through cooperation and collaboration. The cooperation models itself is an important contribution from South Sumatra to the development practitioners in other places. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Our estimates agree with previous observations in showing an increase in ANCP in the vicinity of the polar front (∼3 mol C m−2 y−1), compared to lower rates in the subtropical zone (≤ 1 mol C m−2 y−1) and the seasonal ice zone (&lt;2 mol C m−2 y−1). Paradoxically, the increase in ANCP south of the subtropical front is associated with elevated surface nitrate and silicate concentrations, but decreasing surface iron. We hypothesize that iron limitation promotes silicification in diatoms, which is evidenced by the low silicate to nitrate ratio of surface waters around the Antarctic polar front. High diatom silicification increases the ballasting effect of particulate organic carbon and overall ANCP in this region. A model-based assessment of our methods shows a good agreement between ANCP estimates based on oxygen and nitrate drawdown and the modeled downward organic carbon flux at 100 m. This agreement supports the presumption that net biological consumption is the dominant process affecting the drawdown of these chemical tracers and that, given sufficient data, ANCP can be inferred from observations of oxygen and/or nitrate drawdown in the Southern Ocean. ©2019.

Renewable energy resources can be seen as an alternative energy to capture the remote rural electrification's problems. Installing and operating a renewable energy generation is not difficult but it requires cautious step as to make sure maximum use of energy can improve the electrification. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to critically analyze five types of optimized hybrid renewable energy systems in term of financial and power production using HOMER software. This paper approaches four renewable energy resources, namely solar, hydro, wind and biomass in three remote rural areas located in Limbang, Kapit and Sri Aman regions. Different combination of solar PV system, micro-hydro generator, wind turbine and biomass generator together with battery storage and converter were studied. The optimization between these different sizes of system was built based on energy demand satisfaction, system cost and carbon gas emission. Comparison between operational of behaviors hybrid renewable energy systems with stand-alone diesel generator only were also carried out to elucidate the effects on investment cost and environment. The results revealed that hybrid hydro with battery system is seen to be the cheapest system and has the best technical performance in all locations. Solar PV and biomass generator system were combined with hydro generator as a backup power. It is also found that hybrid renewable energy is more cost-effective and reduce of carbon emission compared to standalone diesel generator. © 2019 IEEE.","HOMER; hybrid renewable energy resources; initial cost; net present cost; operating cost; remote rural area","Biomass; Carbon; Cost effectiveness; Diesel engines; Electric batteries; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Hydroelectric generators; Operating costs; Rural areas; Decentralized electricity; HOMER; Hybrid renewable energies; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Initial costs; Net present cost; Remote rural areas; Renewable energy generation; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078818679

One drawback of this combustion method, however, is the high nitric dioxide (NO2) emissions observed at certain operating points. The conditions leading to increased NO2 formation have been investigated using a batch reactor model in CANTERA. It has been found that the high emission levels of NO2 can be traced back to the mixing of small amounts of quenched CH4 with NO from the hot combustion zones followed by postoxidation in the presence of O2, requiring that the temperatures are within a certain range. NO2 formation in the exhaust duct of a test engine has been modeled and compared to the experimental results. The well-stirred reactor model has been used that calculates the steady-state of a uniform composition for a certain residence time. An appropriate reaction mechanism that considers the effect of NO/NO2 on methane oxidation at low temperature levels has been used. The numerical results of NONO2 conversion in the duct at low temperature levels show good agreement with the experimental results. The partial oxidation of CH4 can be predicted well. It can be shown that methane oxidation in the presence of NO/NO2 at low temperature levels is enhanced via the reaction steps CH3 P NO2 CH3O P NO and CH3O2 P NO CH3O P NO2. In addition, the elementary reaction HO2 P NO NO2 P OH is the important NO oxidizing step. © 2019 by ASME.",,"Air engines; Batch reactors; Combustion; Diesel engines; Ducts; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Temperature; Combustion method; Elementary reaction; Formation kinetics; Methane oxidation; Numerical results; Partial oxidations; Reaction mechanism; Well-stirred reactors; Dual fuel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064404573

The travel data were collected from an activity diary survey in rural Sichuan. Geographic information system technology, combined with on-site measurement, was used to obtain data on the built environment. After controlling the socio-demographic factors, the model results corroborate that all built environment variables had significant total effects on car ownership, travel distance, travel frequency, and travel emissions. Specifically, residents living in the village with more accessible markets, higher roads, and higher building density travel a shorter distance and emit less CO2. Meanwhile, residents living in the village with centralized living style and higher transit and destination accessibility travel less frequently but emit more CO2. Individual travel attitudes have a limited effect on travel behavior and CO2 emissions.

In this study, a two-step carbonization approach is developed to enhance the electrochemical performance of lignocellulose biomass-derived hard carbon. The first step comprises slow low-temperature pyrolysis of fir wood that produces an amorphous carbon in which hexagonal planes are embedded in the amorphous carbon region to some extent. The second step comprises high-temperature carbonization at 1300 °C, which yields a hard carbon with a high degree of graphitization, an increased layer-plane length, and a low micropore volume. Two-step carbonized hard carbon delivers a large reversible capacity of 276 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1 after 100 cycles and high rate capacities of 108 mAh g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 and 76.3 mAh g−1 at 2.5 A g−1. The low-voltage plateau capacity below 0.1 V is 194 mAh g−1. The results of these experiments indicate that the exceptional electrochemical performance of two-step carbonized hard carbon arises from the effective suppression of micropore formation and a good balance between the degree of graphitization and number of defect sites.

Grade separation projects have been used to solve this problem and have resulted in overall air pollution reduction in many cases. Many grade separation projects are constructed near sensitive urban locations accommodating susceptible individuals. This research argues that in such cases in addition to the overall air pollution reduction, air pollution concentration near sensitive locations is an influential factor for deciding the appropriate scenario. This research proposes a complementary simulation-based method for assessing the resulting pollution concentration of the new grade separation projects near sensitive locations. In this method, traffic congestion and air pollution of the different available project scenarios were simulated and compared. The recommended scenario was selected as a trade-off between the resulting traffic congestion, the amount of air pollution, and air pollution concentration near sensitive locations. The proposed method was applied to an actual grade separation project in Dezful, Iran using VISSIM and EnViVer traffic and air pollution simulation software packages. It was shown that air pollution concentration near sensitive locations could be reduced by up to 40% with no significant change to the overall air pollution and the average vehicle speed. The achieved results in the case study uphold the pollution concentration near sensitive locations as a possible influential factor in the grade separation projects. The proposed method targets a new aspect of the grade separation projects assessment. As a result of the proposed method implementation, unintentional adverse impacts of air pollution can be avoided on the susceptible groups of citizens. The similar method proposed for the grade separation projects in this project can be adapted for other types of urban transportation projects. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Construction management; Grade separation; Simulation; Traffic congestion","Air pollution; Computer software; Economic and social effects; Location; Project management; Separation; Urban transportation; Construction management; Method implementations; Pollution concentration; Pollution reduction; Simulation; Simulation software package; Simulation-based method; Transportation projects; Traffic congestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065428320

The extent to which waste-to-energy (WtE) technologies can contribute to climate change mitigation was assessed by performing a multicriteria analysis. The results indicated that CO2e emissions from MSW in Bahrain have been increasing since the Askar landfill was constructed in 1986. Emission recalculations indicated that CO2e emissions from MSW contribute 6.2% of total emissions in Bahrain rather than the 11.6% reported in the second national communication. Methane emissions from MSW in 2030 are predicted to be 22-63 Gg.

These plants require a high level of direct normal irradiance to work properly and profitably. Over-sizing of plant capacity is frequently employed in order to store part of the energy produced, to extend the operating time throughout the day, and also to manage cloud transients. Forecasting the energy delivered by the plant is very important in plant operational strategies to ensure dispatchability as much as possible. This work presents an analysis of energy forecasting in solar tower plants by combining a short-term solar irradiation forecasting scheme with a solar tower plant model using the System Advisor Model (SAM), as the modeling tool for computing plant production throughout the year.

Fossil fuels have been utilized since the beginning of the twentieth century for electricity generation. However, fossil fuels depletion at the escalating pace as well as their formidable negative implications upon ecosystem contributed to increasing interest in harnessing renewable energy sources for producing electric power to meet the growing demand worldwide. In Iraq, the electrical supply is not sufficient to supply 12 hours a day of electricity. Many rural areas, particularly their schools are suffering from the electricity shortage such as Umm Qasr Primary School that located 20 km away from the city centre of Karbala city in the middle of Iraq. In order to overcome this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid system which relies on renewable resources and the local grid to electrify Umm Qasr Primary School. Various combinations of energy resources have been analysed by using HOMER software to estimate an optimum hybrid system. The analysis illustrates that the optimal configuration of the projected system is composed of 22.4 kW PV modules, 59 batteries, and 5738kWh purchased from the local grid which has reduced the net present cost(NPC)from US$ 163791 the current situation to US$60,420 for the proposed system.

Hence, policies focused solely on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions could potentially resolve one problem (i.e., climate change)by creating another, thereby leading to burden-shifting. Here, the occurrence and severity of burden-shifting in energy systems design are both investigated through the application of a novel approach integrating multi-objective optimization, life cycle assessment and multivariate regression based on elasticities. Environmental impacts are classified into three categories: no burden-shifting, total burden-shifting and partial burden-shifting, providing for the latter two a measure of their severity. Due to inherent trade-offs in the life cycle performance of technologies, discussed in detail in this work, the Paris Agreement 2 °C targets would lead to burden-shifting in the United States (total or partial)in up to eight environmental impacts. On the other hand, stringent carbon emissions reductions in line with the 1.5 °C targets can lead to burden-shifting in three environmental impacts. Indeed, in both cases undesirable increases in some damage categories of up to 1.64% for every percentage increase in cost can take place as a result of more stringent limits on greenhouse gas emissions compared to the least cost solution. Overall, this work aims to foster fruitful discussions on how to generate energy within the Earth's ecological capacity by expanding the analysis beyond climate change. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Elasticity; Energy systems modeling; IPAT; Life cycle assessment; STIRPAT","Climate change; Earth (planet); Ecodesign; Economic and social effects; Elasticity; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Multiobjective optimization; Regression analysis; Sustainable development; Systems analysis; Carbon emissions reductions; Energy systems modeling; Global warming potential; IPAT; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Minimize greenhouse gas emissions; Multivariate regression; Stirpat; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065823071

The implication is that biomes are maintained by positive feedbacks, e.g. with fire, and that historical distributions could play a role in determining modern ones. In this context, climate alone does not govern transitions between biomes, and understanding the causes and pathways of such transitions becomes crucial. Here, we use a multi-proxy analysis of a 2000-year core to evaluate modes of transition in vegetation structure and fire regimes. We demonstrate a first transition ca 1540 BP, when a cyclic fire regime entered a forested landscape, eventually resulting, by ca 1060 BP, in a transition to a more open savannah-like or mosaicked structure. This pattern may parallel currently accelerating fire regimes in tropical forests suggesting that fires can savannize forests, but perhaps more slowly than feared. Finally, ca 540 BP, a drought combined with anthropogenic influences resulted in a conclusive transition to savannah, probably resembling the modern landscape in the region. We show here that fire interacted with drought to transition forest to savannah, suggesting that disturbance by fire can be a major driver of biome change. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Monitoring of PM2.5 concentrations still in a very early stage and the spatial coverage is limited. These constraints lead to difficulty in assessing the health issues related to PM2.5 exposure for prior time periods or in certain areas. As PM2.5 levels are strongly influenced by meteorological conditions, this work employs machine learning models, namely, linear regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) to predict PM2.5 concentrations at hourly time scale, utilizing the readily available meteorological data. The main input variables for the proposed models were hourly measurements of meteorological data such as temperature, wind speed and direction, humidity and pressure. Dataset was collected in five cities in China: Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenyang and Chengdu as a study region and hourly readings for three years were included in this work. Experiments showed that the random forest model achieved higher predictive accuracy than other proposed models in estimating hourly PM2.5 concentrations with R2 value varied between 0.67 and 0.78. This work proposes a promising and affordable approach for robustly predicting PM2.5 concentrations. © 2019 IEEE.","Environmental pollution; Meteorological data; Particulate matter; PM2.5 prediction; Random forest","Decision trees; Forecasting; Meteorology; Support vector machines; Wind; Environmental pollutions; Machine learning models; Meteorological condition; Meteorological data; Particulate Matter; Random forest modeling; Random forests; Wind speed and directions; Particles (particulate matter)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078290890

Previous regional and local studies conducted on the Lower Jurassic Marrat Formation focused mainly on structural traps, however a need to tackle complex carbonate systems is required at a stratigraphic level in order to better identify and map subtle trapping mechanisms onshore and offshore. Throughout this new study, a regional geological and geophysical integrated approach was applied in order to complete the sequence stratigraphic assessment of the Marrat Formation, and to identify the architectural evolution of this potential carbonate reservoir including stratigraphic traps deposited on this wide carbonate ramp. A four-step workflow was applied and comprises 1) detailed tectonostratigraphic review, 2) 2D/3D seismic interpretation and 3D seismic characterization, 3) sequence stratigraphic and environmental interpretation based on available sedimentologic core descriptions, biostratigraphic and petrophysical data. The fourth results have been integerated in a forward stratigraphic model to test the proposed geological conceptual model. The overall output of this study comprise a series of Gross Depositional Environment maps and Ecological Property maps for the whole Marrat Formation, that highlight the lateral and vertical display of sedimentary facies and associated petrophysical properties along onshore/offshore Kuwait. The Lower Marrat unit transgresses on top of the Minjur unconformity. It is composed of dominantly onlapping packages of dolostone and dominantly micritic limestone facies intercalated with several layers of anhydrite. The Middle Marrat presents dominantly regressive trends with prograding geobodies observed along the shallow inner ramp environment including lagoon and oncolitic shoal complexes. The Upper Marrat transgresses on top of the Middle Marrat and is mainly composed of limemudstones/wackstone carbonate deposited in mainly mid-ramp environment in a context of general deepening. © 2019 SEG",,"Carbonation; Lime; Offshore oil well production; Petrophysics; Seismology; 3-D seismics; Arabian plates; Architectural evolution; Carbonate system; Integrated approach; Jurassic; New study; Offshores; Structural traps; Trapping mechanisms; Stratigraphy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121870055

State funding for refurbishment is the most feasible option using two routes: Condition Improvement Fund (CIF) which is restricted to improving the physical aspects of school facilities; and Salix Energy Efficiency Fund (SEEF) aimed at energy/equipment retrofit measures. Although the use of BIM technology (underpinned by the government soft-landing (GSL) framework) together with the use of energy modelling/simulation tools have become integral to making buildings more energy efficient, they are constrained by lack of adoption. This study used primary and secondary data to investigate the effectiveness of contemporary BIM and energy simulation technologies in refurbishment of existing school buildings. Secondary data collected from 10 case studies of schools that benefitted from SEEF was supported by primary data from survey questionnaire of 126 professionals involved in refurbishment. Results showed that: (a) CIF and SEEF ought to operate in synergy due to the interaction of a building's physical envelope with heat transfer and energy used by equipment and systems; (b) refurbishment professionals are not fully adopting BIM which in turn affects managing the buildings in their operational phase; and (c) some schools are not getting technical advice on how to optimise the funds they receive from SEEF leading to non-optimal investment. Recommendations provided include: extensive training on BIM and GSL to heads of schools; upskilling of professionals on using building pathology techniques that are compatible with BIM together with COBie and NBS Toolkit; advise government agencies to reconcile the purpose of CIF and SEEF for carbon reduction solution in schools. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","BIM; energy performance; refurbishment; school buildings","Carbon; Climate change; Energy efficiency; Heat transfer; Investments; Meteorological problems; School buildings; Surveys; Sustainable development; BIM technologies; Building pathology; Energy performance; Energy simulation; Government agencies; Non-optimal investments; Operational phase; refurbishment; Architectural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071880304

We employ a discrete-fracture model where fractures are modelled lower-dimensionally, within a rock matrix. A mass balance equation is solved over the rock-matrix while a lower-dimensional flow equation is solved over the lower-dimensional fractures, with coupling terms to account for the flux transfer from the surrounding rock-matrix. The discretisation of the Darcy-fluxes is based on the control-volume distributed multi-point flux approximation (CVD-MPFA) coupled with a lower-dimensional fracture model. We solve a non-linear system for the primary variables that are the phase pressure and the component molar densities while the secondary variables are updated depending on the updated values of the primary variables at each iteration of the non-linear solver. We use the cubic type equation-of-state (EOS) to model the physical properties of gas components, e.g. CO2. The water phase is multi-component as we allow solubility of gas components in the water phase. Solubility of H2O in the gaseous phase is also included in the developed method. We compare compositional simulation results, using unstructured grids, obtained via the lower-dimensional fracture model and the results obtained by the equi-dimensional fracture model for a case of CO2 injection into a water saturated reservoir with intersecting fractures. The results show good agreement between the two models while the lower-dimensional fracture model is also computationally cost effective. Results are also presented for the evolution of injected CO2 under gravity through a water saturated reservoir with and without fractures that demonstrate the profound effects of discrete-fractures that can lead to CO2 leakage. The presented method is also applied to a 3D simulation of injection of a multi-component gas with CO2 and CH4 into a saline water saturated reservoir with a surface 2D fracture network. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO2; Compositional; CVD-MPFA; Finite-volume; Two-phase; Unstructured grid","Carbon dioxide; Compressibility of gases; Cost effectiveness; Equations of state of gases; Finite volume method; Fracture; Iterative methods; Linear systems; Matrix algebra; Numerical methods; Porous materials; Saline water; Solubility; Water injection; Compositional; Compositional simulations; Discrete-fracture models; Fractured porous media; Intersecting fractures; Mass balance equations; Two phase; Unstructured grid; Two phase flow; carbon dioxide; conceptual framework; finite volume method; fluid injection; fractured medium; numerical model; phreatic zone; two phase flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068251366

Herein, we have developed a facile approach for dramatically downwards shifting band edge positions of carbon nitride up by about 1 eV via in-plane heterojunction with graphitic carbon units to enhance the oxidation capability of the electron holes generated from the valence band. The graphitic carbon units in junction with tri-s-triazine domains were clearly observed and its in-plane hybridization with carbon nitride was formed during the copolymerization using melamine with a small amount of m-phenylenediamine as the precursors. The direct intralayer junction between the tri-s-triazine and the graphitic carbon domain, essentially different with interlayer junction reported in literature, is able to shift downwards the band edge positions via merging electron density of states of carbon nitride with that of graphitic carbon, and thus would be beneficial for separation of photoexcited charge carriers and generation of hydroxyl radicals for the oxidation of pollutants. The hybrid photocatalyst prepared with a small quantity (less than 1%) of m-phenylenediamine and melamine as precursors has shown much enhanced NO oxidation to final products (NO2− and NO3−) and increased NO removal 10% than the one from melamine only. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Advanced oxidation process; Air pollution; Band energy; Carbon nitride; Doping; Nitrogen monoxide","Air pollution; Aromatic compounds; Carbon nitride; Carrier mobility; Doping (additives); Energy gap; Graphitic Carbon Nitride; Heterojunctions; Polyols; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Band edge position; Band energy; Conduction band edge; Hybrid photocatalysts; Nitrogen monoxide; Photocatalytic oxidations; Visible-light photocatalysts; Oxidation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063440429

Loss of saline wetlands due to relative sea-level rise, land-use change, and hydrologic alterations liberates previously stored C and reduces the capacity for future C sequestration. Widespread wetland loss has prompted marsh restoration and creation projects around the world; however, little is known about the timescale and capacity for created marshes to function as blue C sinks and the role of environmental conditions in mediating soil C accumulation in restoration sites. Using a chronosequence of five created saline marshes ranging in age from 5 to 32 yr and two adjacent natural reference marshes in southwest Louisiana, USA, short- and longer-term C accumulation rates (SCAR and LCAR, respectively) were determined using feldspar marker horizons and peat depth in cores at six locations in each marsh. Created marshes ranged in elevation from −12 to 41 cm (NAVD88) and supported assorted plant community compositions driven by local environmental conditions. SCAR ranged from 75 to 430 g C·m−2·yr−1, which were comparable in the two youngest and two oldest marshes. Longer-term CAR ranged from 18 to 99 g C·m−2·yr−1 but did not significantly differ among marshes of different ages. Our findings indicate that LCAR in these created marshes were influenced by site-specific environmental conditions (i.e., stem density and mineral sediment) rather than marsh age. Results suggest that conditions appropriate for the establishment of vegetation with high stem densities, such as Distichlis spicata and Spartina patens, may facilitate higher LCAR in created marshes, which may be useful for restoration project planning and mitigation of climate change. © 2019 The Authors.","autochthonous production; carbon storage; Distichlis spicata; Louisiana; Spartina patens; stem density; vertical accretion; wetland creation; wetland restoration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071876530

Designing energy and climate related strategies on the level of municipalities has been hampered by the lack of comprehensive data on the current status of energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions on the local level. A novel approach based on the so-called spatial turn in energy and climate policies has now been established in the form of the Energy Mosaic Austria, which represents a comprehensive energy and greenhouse gas inventory for all Austrian municipalities considering different purposes of energy consumption and different energy sources. The inventory is based on the linkage of bottom-up and top-down operations, utilizing data on land use and mobility structures on the municipal level. The outcomes provide a detailed insight into the pattern of energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions that are resolved on the municipal level. A spatially differentiated analysis of the inventory yields dependencies of the energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions on spatial structures particularly due to the fractions of different types of land use including mobility. With the energy mosaic Austria, local policy makers are given an inventory with unprecedented spatial and contentual resolution, which is fully coherent with more coarse-grained provincial and nationwide compilations of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions and elucidates the scope of action in energy and climate policy from the municipal to the nationwide level. © 2019 by the authors.","Austria-wide basis for decision-making; Comprehensive database; Energy model; Energy planning; Final energy consumption; Greenhouse gas emissions; Integrated spatial; Municipal level","Climate change; Decision making; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Austria; Energy model; Energy planning; Final energy; Integrated spatial; Municipal levels; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070565512

Increased awareness of the complexity of ethical issues in the health care setting has fueled interest in nursing ethics. However; there is limited information on the relationship between nurses' perception of ethical climate and job satisfaction globally and no study was done on this issue particularly in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the relationship between nurses' perception of ethical climates and job satisfaction in Jimma University Specialized Hospital, southwest Ethiopia, 2016. Methods: Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted on 266 nurses in Jimma University Specialized Hospital from March to April 2016. The study participants were invited by using simple random sampling method. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires and were entered into Epidata 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS Version 20.0. Pearson's correlation was used to assess the correlation between each dimension of the hospital ethical climate and job satisfaction of nurses. Variables significant at bivariate analysis (P < 0.25) were considered as a candidate for the multivariable linear regression analysis. All analyses were conducted at the 0.05 significance level. Results: The percentage mean score for ethical climate and job satisfaction were 53.4 and 51.3% respectively. Law and code climate significantly influenced job satisfaction (β = 1.53, p = 0.000). Caring climate also significantly influenced nurses job satisfaction (β = 0.99, p = 0.000). The result also showed that an independence climate significantly influenced job satisfaction (β = 0.62, p = 0.041). On the other hand, rule climate and instrumental climate did not significantly affect job satisfaction (β = 0.380, p = 0.409 and β = - 0.208, p = 0.290 respectively). The adjusted R square was 0.601, indicating that 60.1% of the variations in job satisfactions was explained by ethical climate variables. Conclusion: The different dimensions of ethical climates have a negative or positive impact on nurses' job satisfaction and maintaining a positive ethical climate is key to increasing nurses' job satisfaction. © 2019 The Author(s).","Ethical climates; Job satisfaction; JUSH; Nurses","adult; article; bivariate analysis; care behavior; climate; controlled study; cross-sectional study; data analysis software; Ethiopia; female; human; human experiment; human tissue; job satisfaction; linear regression analysis; male; nurse; perception; questionnaire",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071623398

This special issue presents recent insights from combining the two research topics. There is some convergence with respect to core challenges that sustainable urban tourism is facing. Firstly, relating to social sustainable development, there is the tension between the quality of life for residents in different ways and the development of cities to benefit the tourism industry. Secondly, relating to environmental sustainable development, there is the tension between residents and their desire for good local environmental standards and visiting tourists that create a number of over-tourism related local environmental problems. Thirdly, there are the challenges that so far have received less attention, but obviously are expected to become crucial in the years to come: The double climate change provides risks to cities from a changing climate and from more ambitious climate policies to come. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change and tourism; Sustainable tourism; Urban sustainable tourism; Urban tourism",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070473934
